6251-93270-0000	train-other-500	Chapter one An Explosion Are you all ready Tom All ready mister Sharp replied a young man who was stationed near some complicated apparatus while the questioner a dark man with a nervous manner
6251-93270-0001	train-other-500	leaned over a large tank I m going to turn on the gas now went on the man Look out for yourself I m not sure what may happen Neither am I but I m ready for it
6251-93270-0002	train-other-500	If it does explode it can t do much damage Oh I hope it doesn t explode We ve had so much trouble with the airship I trust nothing goes wrong now Well turn on the gas mister Sharp
6251-93270-0003	train-other-500	advised Tom Swift I ll watch the pressure gauge and if it goes too high I ll warn you and you can shut it off The man nodded and with a small wrench in his hand went to one end of the tank The youth
6251-93270-0004	train-other-500	looking anxiously at him turned his gaze now and then toward a gauge somewhat like those on steam boilers which gauge was attached to an aluminum cigar shaped affair about five feet long
none	none	 Presently there was a hissing sound in the small frame building where the two were conducting an experiment which meant much to them 
6251-93270-0005	train-other-500	The hissing grew louder Be ready to jump
none	none	 advised mister Sharp 
6251-93270-0006	train-other-500	I will answered the lad But the pressure is going up very slowly Maybe you d better turn on more gas I will Here she goes Look out now
none	none	 You can t tell what is going to happen 
6251-93270-0007	train-other-500	With a sudden hiss as the powerful gas under pressure passed from the tank through the pipes and into the aluminum container the hand on the gauge swept past figure after figure on the dial Shut it off
6251-93270-0008	train-other-500	cried Tom quickly It s coming too fast Shut her off The man sprang to obey the command and with nervous fingers sought to fit the wrench over the nipple of the controlling valve Then his face seemed to turn white with fear
6251-93270-0009	train-other-500	I can t move it mister Sharp yelled It s jammed I can t shut off the gas Run Look out She ll explode Tom Swift the young inventor whose acquaintance some of you have previously made
6251-93270-0010	train-other-500	gave one look at the gauge and seeing that the pressure was steadily mounting endeavored to reach and open a stop cock that he might relieve the strain One trial showed him that the valve
6251-93270-0011	train-other-500	there had jammed too and catching up a roll of blue prints the lad made a dash for the door of the shop He was not a second behind his companion and hardly had they passed out of the structure
6251-93270-0012	train-other-500	before there was a loud explosion which shook the building and shattered all the windows in it Pieces of wood bits of metal and a cloud of sawdust and shavings flew out of the door after the man and the youth
6251-93270-0013	train-other-500	and this was followed by a cloud of yellowish smoke Are you hurt Tom cried mister Sharp as he swung around to look back at the place where the hazardous experiment had been conducted Not a bit How about you
6251-93270-0014	train-other-500	I m all right But it was touch and go Good thing you had the gauge on or we d never have known when to run Well we ve made another failure of it and the man spoke somewhat bitterly
6251-93270-0015	train-other-500	Never mind mister Sharp went on Tom Swift I think it will be the last mistake I see what the trouble is now and know how to remedy it Come on back and we ll try it again
none	none	 that is if the tank hasn t blown up 
6251-93270-0016	train-other-500	No I guess that s all right It was the aluminum container that went up and that s so light it didn t do much damage But we d better wait until some of those fumes escape They re not healthy to breathe
6251-93270-0017	train-other-500	The cloud of yellowish smoke was slowly rolling away and the man and lad were approaching the shop which
none	none	 in spite of the explosion that had taken place in it 
6251-93270-0018	train-other-500	was still intact when an aged man coming from a handsome house not far off called out Tom is anyone hurt No dad We re all right What happened
6251-93270-0019	train-other-500	Well we had another explosion We can t seem to get the right mixture of the gas but I think we ve had the last of our bad luck We re going to try it again Up to now the gas has been too strong the tank too weak
6251-93270-0020	train-other-500	or else our valve control is bad Oh dear mister Swift Do tell them to be careful a woman s voice chimed in I m sure something dreadful will happen
none	none	 This is about the tenth time something has blown up around here and It s only the ninth missus Baggert interrupted Tom somewhat indignantly Well goodness
7314_93277_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 me 
none	none	Isn t nine almost as bad as ten 
6251-93270-0021	train-other-500	There I was just putting my bread in the oven went on missus Baggert the housekeeper and I was so startled that I dropped it and now the dough is all over the kitchen floor I never saw such a mess I m sorry answered the youth
6251-93270-0022	train-other-500	trying not to laugh We ll see that it doesn t happen again Yes that s what you always say rejoined the motherly looking woman who looked after the interests of mister Swift s home
6251-93270-0023	train-other-500	Well we mean it this time retorted the lad We see where our mistake was don t we mister Sharp I think so replied the other seriously Come on back and we ll see what damage was done proposed Tom
6251-93270-0024	train-other-500	Maybe we can rig up another container mix some fresh gas and make the final experiment this afternoon Now do be careful cautioned mister Swift the aged inventor once more
6251-93270-0025	train-other-500	I m afraid you two have set too hard a task for yourselves this time No we haven t dad answered his son You ll see us yet skimming along above the clouds Humph
6251-93270-0026	train-other-500	If you go above the clouds I shan t be very likely to see you But go slowly now Don t blow the place up again mister Swift went into the house followed by missus Baggert
6251-93270-0027	train-other-500	who was loudly bewailing the fate of her bread Tom and mister Sharp started toward the shop where they had been working It was one of several buildings built for experimental purposes and patent work by mister Swift near his home
6251-93270-0028	train-other-500	It didn t do so very much damage observed Tom as he peered in through a window void of all the panes of glass We can start right in Hold on Wait Don t try it now exclaimed mister Sharp
6251-93270-0029	train-other-500	who talked in short snappy sentences which however said all he meant The fumes of that gas aren t good to breathe Wait until they have blown away
none	none	 It won t be long It s safer 
6251-93270-0030	train-other-500	He began to cough choking from the pungent odor and Tom felt an unpleasant tickling sensation in his throat
none	none	 Take a walk around advised mister Sharp 
6251-93270-0031	train-other-500	I ll be looking over the blue prints Let s have em Tom handed over the roll he had grabbed up when he ran from the shop just before the explosion took place and while his companion spread them out on his knee
6251-93270-0032	train-other-500	as he sat on an upturned barrel the lad walked toward the rear of the large yard It was enclosed by a high board fence with a locked gate
6251-93270-0033	train-other-500	but Tom undoing the fastenings stepped out into a broad green meadow at the rear of his father s property As he did so he saw three boys running toward him Hello exclaimed our hero
6251-93270-0034	train-other-500	There are Andy Foger Sam
none	none	 Snedecker 
6251-93270-0035	train-other-500	and Pete Bailey I wonder what they re heading this way for On the trio came increasing their pace as they caught sight of Tom Andy Foger a red haired and squint eyed lad a sort of town bully
6251-93270-0036	train-other-500	with a rich and indulgent father was the first to reach the young inventor How how many are killed panted Andy Shall we go for doctors asked Sam Can we see the place blurted out Pete
6251-93270-0037	train-other-500	and he had to sit down on the grass he was so winded Killed Doctors repeated Tom clearly much puzzled What are you fellows driving at anyhow
none	none	 Wasn t there a lot of people killed in the explosion we heard 
6251-93270-0038	train-other-500	demanded Andy in eager tones Not a one replied Tom There was an explosion exclaimed Pete We heard it and you can t fool us And we saw the smoke added
none	none	 Snedecker 
6251-93270-0039	train-other-500	Yes there was a small explosion admitted Tom with a smile but no one was killed or even hurt We don t have such things happen in our shops Nobody killed repeated Andy questioningly
6251-93270-0040	train-other-500	and the disappointment was evident in his tones Nobody hurt added Sam his crony and he too showed his chagrin All our run for nothing continued Pete another crony in disgust
6251-93270-0041	train-other-500	What happened demanded the red haired lad as if he had a right to know We were walking along the lake road and we heard an awful racket If the police come out here you ll have to tell what it was Tom Swift He spoke
6251-93270-0042	train-other-500	defiantly I ve no objection to telling you or the police replied Tom There was an explosion My friend mister Sharp the balloonist and I were conducting an experiment with a new kind of gas
6251-93270-0043	train-other-500	and it was too strong that s all An aluminum container blew up but no particular damage was done I hope you re satisfied Humph What you making anyhow demanded Andy
6251-93270-0044	train-other-500	and again he spoke as if he had a right to know I don t know that it s any of your business Tom came back at him sharply but as everyone will soon know I may as well tell you We re building an airship
6251-93270-0045	train-other-500	An airship exclaimed Sam and Pete in one breath An airship queried Andy and there was a sneer in his voice Well I don t think you can do it Tom Swift You ll never build an airship
6251-93270-0046	train-other-500	even if you have a balloonist to help you I won t eh and Tom was a trifle nettled at the sneering manner of his rival No you won t It takes a smarter fellow than you are
none	none	 to build an airship that will sail 
6251-93270-0047	train-other-500	I believe I could beat you at it myself Oh you think you could asked Tom and this time he had mastered his emotions He was not going to let Andy Foger make him angry
none	none	 Maybe you can beat me at racing too he went on If you think so bring out your Red Streak and I ll try the Arrow against her I beat you twice and I can do it again This unexpected taunt disconcerted Andy It was the truth 
6251-93270-0048	train-other-500	for more than once had Tom in his motor boat proved more than a match for the squint eyed bully and his cronies Go back at him Andy advised Sam in a low voice Don t take any of his guff
6251-93270-0049	train-other-500	I don t intend to spluttered Andy Maybe you did beat me in the races because my motor wasn t working right he conceded but you can t do it again Anyhow that s got nothing to do with an airship I ll bet you can t make one
6251-93270-0050	train-other-500	I don t bet replied Tom calmly but if you wait a few weeks you ll see me in an airship and then
none	none	 if you want to race the Red Streak against that I ll accommodate you Or if you want to enter into a competition to build a dirigible balloon or an aeroplane I m willing Huh Think you re smart don t you Just because you helped save that balloonist from being killed when his balloon caught fire went on Andy for want of something better to say But you ll never build an airship Of course he won t added Sam and Pete bound to side with their crony 
6251-93270-0051	train-other-500	to whom they were indebted for many automobile and motor boat rides Just wait advised Tom with a tantalizing smile
none	none	 Meanwhile if you want to try the Red Streak against the Arrow 
6251-93270-0052	train-other-500	I m willing I have an hour or so to spare
none	none	 Aw keep still muttered Andy much 
6251-93270-0053	train-other-500	discomfited for the defeat of his speedy boat by a much smaller and less powerful one was a sore point with him You just wait that s all I ll get even with you Look here cried Tom suddenly
6251-93270-0054	train-other-500	You always say that whenever I get the best of you I m sick of hearing it I consider that a threat
none	none	 and I don t like it 
6251-93270-0055	train-other-500	If you don t look out Andy Foger you ll have trouble with me and at no very distant date Tom with flashing eyes and clenched fists took a step forward Andy shrank back Don t be afraid of him advised Sam We ll stand by you Andy
6251-93270-0056	train-other-500	I ain t afraid muttered the red haired lad but it was noticed that he shuffled off You just wait I ll fix you he added to Tom The bully was plainly in a rage The young inventor was about to reply and possibly would have made a more substantial
6251-93270-0057	train-other-500	rejoinder to Andy than mere words when the gate opened and mister Sharp stepped out The fumes have all cleared away Tom he said We can go in the shop now
none	none	 Without further notice of Andy Foger Tom Swift turned aside and followed the aeronaut into the enclosed yard Chapter two Ned Sees Mysterious Men Who were those fellows asked the balloonist of his companion Oh some chaps who think we ll never build our airship mister Sharp Andy Foger and his crowd Well we ll show them whether we will or not rejoined the man I ve just thought of one point where we made a mistake Your father suggested it to me We need a needle valve in the gas tank Then we can control the flow of vapor better Of course cried Tom Why didn t I think of that Let s try it And the pair hurried into the machine shop eager to make another test which they hoped would be more successful The young inventor for Tom Swift was entitled to that title having patented several machines lived with his father Barton Swift on the outskirts of the small town of Shopton in New York State mister Swift was quite wealthy having amassed a considerable fortune from several of his patents as he was also an inventor Tom s mother had been dead since he was a small child and missus Baggert kept house for the widower and his son There was also in their household an aged engineer named Garret Jackson who attended to the engine and boilers that operated machinery and apparatus in several small shops that surrounded the Swift homestead for mister Swift did most of his work at home As related in the first volume of this series entitled Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle the lad had passed through some strenuous adventures A syndicate of rich men disappointed in a turbine motor they had acquired from a certain inventor hired a gang of scoundrels to get possession of a turbine mister Swift had invented Just before they made the attempt however Tom became possessed of a motor cycle It had belonged to a wealthy man mister Wakefield Damon of Waterford near Lake Carlopa which body of water adjoined the town of Shopton but mister Damon had two accidents with the machine and sold it to Tom cheap Tom was riding his motorcycle to Albany to deliver his father s model of the turbine motor to a lawyer in order to get a patent on it when he was attacked by the gang of bad men These included Ferguson Appleson Anson Morse Wilson Featherton alias Simpson Jake Burke alias Happy Harry who sometimes masqueraded as a tramp and Tod Boreck alias Murdock These men knocked Tom unconscious stole the valuable model and some papers and carried the youth away in their automobile Later the young inventor following a clue given him by Eradicate Sampson an aged colored man who with his mule Boomerang went about the country doing odd jobs got on the trail of the thieves in a deserted mansion in the woods at the upper end of the lake Our hero with the aid of mister Damon and some friends of the latter raided the old house but the men escaped In the second book of the series called Tom Swift and His Motor Boat there was related the doings of the lad his father and his chum Ned Newton on Lake Carlopa Tom bought at auction a motor boat the thieves had stolen and damaged and fixing it up made a speedy craft of it so speedy in fact that it beat the racing boat Red Streak owned by Andy Foger But Tom did more than race in his boat He took his father on a tour for his health and during mister Swift s absence from home the gang of bad men stole some of the inventor s machinery Tom set out after them in his motor boat but the scoundrels even managed to steal that hoping to get possession of a peculiar and mysterious treasure in it and Tom had considerable trouble Among other things he did when he had his craft was to aid a Miss Mary Nestor who in her cousin s small boat the Dot was having trouble with the engine and you shall hear more of Miss Nestor presently for she and Tom became quite friendly Events so shaped themselves that Andy Foger was glad to loan Tom the Red Streak in which to search for the stolen Arrow and it was in the later craft that Tom his father and Ned Newton had a most thrilling adventure They were on their way down the lake when in the air overhead they saw a balloon on fire with a man clinging to the trapeze They managed to save the fellow s life after a strenuous endeavor The balloonist John Sharp was destined to play quite a part in Tom s life mister Sharp was more than an aeronaut he was the inventor of an airship that is he had plans drawn for the more important parts but he had struck a snag of clouds as he expressed it and could not make the machine work His falling in with mister Swift and his son seemed providential for Tom and his father were at once interested in the project for navigating the upper air They began a study of mister Sharp s plans and the balloonist was now in a fair way to have the difficulty solved His airship was primarily an aeroplane but with a sustaining aluminum container shaped like a cigar and filled with a secret gas made partly of hydrogen being very light and powerful It was testing the effect of this gas on a small model of the aluminum container that the explosion told of in the first chapter occurred In fact it was only one of several explosions but as Tom said all the while they were eliminating certain difficulties until now the airship seemed almost a finished thing But a few more details remained to be worked out and mister Swift and his son felt that they could master these So it was with a feeling of no little elation that the young inventor followed mister Sharp into the shop The balloonist it may be explained had been invited to live with the Swifts pending the completion of the airship Do you think we ll get on the right track if we put the needle valve in asked Tom as he noted with satisfaction that the damage from the explosion was not great I m sure we will answered the aeronaut Now let s make another model container and try the gas again They set to work with mister Swift helping them occasionally and Garret Jackson the engineer lending a hand whenever he was needed All that afternoon work on the airship progressed The joint inventors of it wanted to be sure that the sustaining gas bag or aluminum container would do its work properly as this would hold them in the air and prevent accidents in case of a stoppage of the engine or propellers The aeroplane part of the airship was all but finished and the motor a powerful machine of new design built by mister Swift was ready to be installed All that afternoon Tom his father and mister Sharp labored in the shop As it grew dusk there sounded from the house the ringing of a bell Supper time remarked Tom laying aside a wrench I wish missus Baggert would wait about an hour I d have this valve nearly done then But the housekeeper was evidently not going to wait for her voice supplemented the bell Supper Sup per she called Come now mister Swift Tom mister Sharp I can t wait any longer The meat and potatoes will be spoiled I s pose we d better go in remarked mister Sharp with something of a sigh We can finish to morrow The shop where certain parts of the airship were being made was doubly locked and Jackson the engineer who was also a sort of watchman was bidden to keep good guard for the fear of the gang of unscrupulous men who had escaped from jail during a great storm was still in the minds of mister Swift and his son And give an occasional look in the shed where the aeroplane is advised mister Sharp It wouldn t take much to damage that now I ll pay particular attention to it promised the engineer Don t worry mister Sharp After supper the three gathered around the table on which were spread out sheets of paper covered with intricate figures and calculations which mister Swift and the balloonist went over with care Tom was examining some blue prints which gave a sectional view of the proposed ship and was making some measurements when the bell rang and missus Baggert ushered in Ned Newton the most particular chum of the young inventor Hello Ned exclaimed Tom I was wondering what had become of you Haven t seen you in a dog s age That s right admitted Ned We ve been working late nights at the bank Getting ready for the regular visit of the examiner who usually comes along about this time Well how are things going and how is the airship for of course Ned had heard of that Oh pretty good Had another explosion to day I s pose you heard No I hadn t I thought everyone in town had for Andy Foger and his two cronies were on hand and they usually tell all they know Oh Andy Foger He makes me sick He was scooting up the street in his auto just as I was coming in honking honking his horn to beat the band You d think no one ever had an auto but him He certainly was going fast Wait until I get in our airship predicted Tom Then I ll show you what speed is Do you really think it will go fast Of course it will Fast enough to catch Anson Morse and his crowd of scoundrels if we could get on their track Why I thought they were in jail replied Ned in some surprise Weren t they arrested after they stole your boat Yes and put in jail but they managed to get out and now they re free to make trouble for us again Are you sure they re out of jail asked Ned and Tom noted that his chum s face wore an odd look Sure Of course I am But why do you ask Ned did not answer for a moment He glanced at Tom s father and the young inventor understood mister Swift was getting rather along in age and his long years of brain work had made him nervous He had a great fear of Morse and his gang for they had made much trouble for him in the past Tom appreciated his chum s hesitancy and guessed that Ned had something to say that he did not want mister Swift to hear Come on up to my room Ned I ve got something I want to show you exclaimed Tom after a pause The two lads left the room Tom glancing apprehensively at his father But mister Swift was so engrossed together with the aeronaut in making some calculations regarding wind pressure that it is doubtful if either of the men were aware that the boys had gone Now
7314_93276_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 what is it 
none	none	Ned demanded our hero when they were safe in his apartment Something s up I can tell by your manner What is it Maybe it s nothing at all went on his chum If I had known though that those men had gotten out of jail I would have paid more attention to what I saw to night as I was leaving the bank to come here What did you see demanded Tom and his manner which had been calm became somewhat excited Well you know I ve been helping the paying teller straighten up his books went on the young bank employee and when I came out to night after working for several hours I was glad enough to hurry away from the slave den as I call it I almost ran up the street not looking where I was going when just as I turned the corner I bumped into a man Nothing suspicious or wonderful in that commented Tom I ve often run into people Wait advised Ned To save myself from falling I grabbed the man s arm He did the same to me and there we stood for a moment right under a gas lamp I looked down at his hands and I saw that on the little finger of the left one there was tattooed a blue ring and Happy Harry the tramp exclaimed Tom now much excited That s where he wears a tattooed ring That s what I thought you had told me resumed Ned but I didn t pay any attention to it at the time as I had no idea that the men were out of jail Well what else happened inquired Tom Not much more I apologized to the man and he to me and we let go of each other Are you sure about the ring on his finger Positive His hand was right in the light But wait that isn t all I hurried on not thinking much about it when I saw another man step out of the dark shadows of Peterby s grocery just beyond the bank The man must have mistaken me for some one else for he spoke to me What did he say He asked me a question It was Is there any chance to night What did you tell him Well I was so surprised that I didn t know what to say and before I could get my wits together the man had seen his mistake and hurried on He joined the man I had collided with and the two skipped off in the darkness But not before a third man had come across the street from in front of the bank and hurried off with them Well asked Tom as his chum paused I don t know what to think resumed Ned These men were certainly acting suspiciously and now that you tell me the Anson Morse gang is not locked up well it makes me feel that these must be some of their crowd Of course they are declared Tom positively That blue ring proves it I wouldn t go so far as to say that declared Ned The man certainly had a blue ring tattooed on his finger the same finger where you say Happy Harry had his But what would the men be doing in this neighborhood They certainly have had a lesson not to meddle with any of your things No I don t believe they are after any of dad s inventions this time But I tell you what I do believe What Those men are planning to rob the Shopton Bank Ned And I advise you to notify the officers That Morse gang is one of the worst in the country and Tom much excited began to pace the room while Ned who had not dreamed of such an outcome to his narrative looked startled Chapter three Whitewashed Let s tell your father Tom suggested Ned after a pause He ll know what to do No I d rather not answered the young inventor quickly Dad has had trouble enough with these fellows and I don t want him to worry any more Besides he is working on a new invention and if I tell him about the Happy Harry gang it will take his attention from it What invention is he planning now I don t know but it s something important by the way he keeps at it He hardly spares time to help mister Sharp and me on the airship No we ll keep this news from dad Then I ll inform the bank officials as you suggest If the place was robbed they might blame me if they found out I had seen the men and failed to tell them Well that gang would only be too glad to have the blame fall on some one else Tom little knew how near the truth he had come in his chance expression or how soon he himself was to fall under suspicion in connection with this same band of bad men I ll telephone to the president on my way home decided Ned and he can notify the watchman at the bank But do you really expect to have your airship in shape to fly soon Oh yes Now that we have found out our mistake about the gas the rest will be easy I think I d like to take a trip in one myself if it didn t go too high ventured Ned I ll remember that when we have ours completed promised his chum and I ll take you for a spin The boys talked for perhaps an hour longer mostly about the airship for it was the latest mechanical affair in which Tom was interested and naturally foremost in his thoughts Then Ned went home first however telephoning from Tom s house to the bank president about having seen the suspicious men That official thanked his young employee and said he would take all necessary precautions The telephone message was not sent until mister Swift was out of hearing as Tom was determined that his father should have no unnecessary worry about the unscrupulous men As it was the news that the gang was out of jail had caused the aged inventor some alarm It was not without some anxiety that Tom arose the next morning fearing he would hear news that the bank had been broken into but no such alarming report circulated in Shopton In fact having made some inquiries that day of Ned he learned that no trace had been seen of the mysterious men The police had been on the lookout but they had seen nothing of them Maybe after all they weren t the same ones suggested Ned when he paid Tom another visit the next night Well of course it s possible that they weren t admitted the young inventor I d be very glad to think so Even if they were your encounter with them may have scared them off and that would be a good thing The next two weeks were busy ones for Tom and mister Sharp Aided occasionally by mister Swift and with Garret Jackson the engineer to lend a hand whenever needed the aeronaut and the owner of the speedy Arrow made considerable progress on their airship What is your father so busy over asked mister Sharp one day when the new aluminum gas holder was about completed I don t know answered Tom with a somewhat puzzled air He doesn t seem to want to talk about it even to me He says it will revolutionize travel along a certain line but whether he is working on an airship that will rival ours or a new automobile I can t make out He ll tell us in good time But when do you think we will finish the well I don t know what to call it I mean our aeroplane Oh in about a month now That s so though we haven t a name for it But we ll christen it after it s completed Now if you ll tighten up some of those bolts I ll get the gas generating apparatus in readiness for another test A short description of the new airship may not be out of place now It was built after plans mister Sharp had shown to Tom and his father soon after the thrilling rescue of the aeronaut from the blazing balloon over Lake Carlopa The general idea of the airship was that of the familiar aeroplane but in addition to the sustaining surfaces of the planes there was an aluminum cigar shaped tank holding a new and very powerful gas which would serve to keep the ship afloat even when not in motion Two sets of planes one above the other were used bringing the airship into the biplane class There were also two large propellers one in front and the other at the rear These were carefully made of different layers of wood built up as they are called to make them stronger They were eight feet in diameter and driven by a twenty cylinder air cooled motor whirled around at the rate of fifteen hundred revolutions a minute When operated at full speed the airship was capable of making eighty miles an hour against a moderate wind But if the use of the peculiarly shaped planes and the gas container with the secret but powerful vapor in it were something new in airship construction so was the car in which the operator and travelers were to live during a voyage It was a complete living room with the engine and other apparatus including that for generating the gas in a separate compartment and the whole was the combined work of Tom and mister Sharp There were accommodations for five persons with sleeping berths a small galley or kitchen where food could be prepared and several easy chairs where the travelers could rest in comfort while skimming along high in the air as fast as the fastest railroad train There was room enough to carry stores for a voyage of a week or more and enough gas could be manufactured aboard the ship in addition to that taken in the aluminum case before starting to sustain the ship for two weeks The engine steering apparatus and the gas machine were within easy reach and control of the pilot who was to be stationed in a small room in the bow of the ship An electric stove served to warm the interior of the car and also provided means for cooking the food The airship could be launched either by starting it along the ground on rubber tired wheels as is done in the case of the ordinary aeroplane or it could be lifted by the gas just as is done with a balloon In short there were many novel features about the ship The gas test which took place a few days later showed that the young inventor and mister Sharp had made no mistake this time No explosion followed the needle valve controlling the powerful vapor perfectly Well remarked mister Sharp one afternoon I think we shall put the ship together next week Tom and have a trial flight We shall need a few more aluminum bolts though and if you don t mind you might jump on your motor cycle and run to Mansburg for them Merton s machine shop ought to have some Mansburg was the nearest large city to Shopton and Merton was a machinist who frequently did work for mister Swift All right agreed Tom I ll start now How many will you need Oh a couple of dozen Tom started off wheeling his cycle from the shed where it was kept As he passed the building where the big frame of the airship with the planes and aluminum bag had been assembled he looked in We ll soon be flying through the clouds on your back he remarked speaking to the apparatus as if it could understand I guess we ll smash some records too if that engine works as well when it s installed as it does now Tom had purchased the bolts and was on his way back with them when as he passed through one of the outlying streets of Mansburg something went wrong with his motor cycle He got off to adjust it finding that it was only a trifling matter which he soon put right when he was aware of a man standing observing him Without looking up at the man s face the young inventor was unpleasantly aware of a sharp scrutiny He could hardly explain it but it seemed as if the man had evil intentions toward him and it was not altogether unexpected on Tom s part when looking up he saw staring at him Anson Morse the leader of the gang of men who had caused such trouble for him Oh it s you is it asked Morse an ugly scowl on his face I thought I recognized you He moved nearer to Tom who straightened up and stood leaning on his wheel Yes it s me admitted the lad I ve been looking for you went on Morse I m not done with you yet nor your father either Aren t you asked Tom trying to speak coolly though his heart was beating rather faster than usual Morse had spoken in a threatening manner and as the youth looked up and down the street he saw that it was deserted nor were there any houses near No I m not snapped the man You got me and my friends in a lot of trouble and You didn t get half what you deserved burst out Tom indignant at the thought of what he and his father had suffered at the hands of the gang You ought to be in jail now instead of out and if I could see a policeman I d have you arrested for threatening me That s against the law Huh I s pose you think you know lots about the law sneered Morse Well I tell you one thing if you make any further trouble for me I ll I ll make all the trouble I can cried Tom and he boldly faced the angry man I m not afraid of you You d better be and Morse spoke in a vindictive manner We ll get even with you yet Tom Swift In fact I ve a good notion now to give you a good thrashing for what you ve done Before Tom was aware of the man s intention Morse had stepped quickly into the street where the lad stood beside his wheel and grasped him by the shoulder He gave Tom a vicious shake Take your hand off me cried Tom who was hampered by having to hold up his heavy machine I will when I ve given you what I owe you retorted the scoundrel I m going to have satisfaction now if I never At that instant there came from down the street the sound of a rattling and bumping Tom looked up quickly and saw approaching a rattletrap of a wagon drawn by a big loose jointed mule the large ears of which were flapping to and fro The animal was advancing rapidly in response to blows and words from the colored driver and before the uplifted fist of Morse could fall on Tom s head the outfit was opposite them Hold on dar mistah Hold on cried the colored man in the wagon What are yo doin to mah friend Mistah Swift None of your business snapped Morse You drive on and let me manage this affair if you don t want trouble Who are you anyhow Why doan t yo know me asked the colored man at whom Tom looked gratefully I s Eradicate Sampson an dish yeah am mah mule Boomerang Whoa Boomerang I reckon yo an I better take a hand in dish yeah argument Not unless you want trouble cried Morse I doan t mind trouble not in de leastest answered Eradicate cheerfully Me an Boomerang has had lots of trouble We s used to it No Mistah Man you d better let go ob mah friend Mistah Swift if yo doan t want trouble yo ownse f Drive on and mind your business cried Morse now unreasoningly angry This is my affair and he gave Tom a shake Our hero was not going to submit tamely however He had one hand free and raised to strike Morse but the latter letting go his hold on the lad s shoulder grasped with that hand the fist which the young inventor had raised Then with his other hand the scoundrel was about to hit Tom Break away four him Mistah Swift directed the colored man Yo can fight him den I guess he ll have his own troubles doing that sneered Morse Not ef I help him answered Eradicate promptly as he climbed back off the seat into the body of his ramshackle vehicle Don t you interfere with me stormed the man An instant later Tom broke away from his tormentor and laid his motor cycle on the ground in order to have both hands free for the attack he felt would follow

none	none	You think you re going to escape do you cried Morse as he started toward Tom his eyes blazing I ll show you who you re dealing with Yes an I reckon I ll show yo suffin yo ain t lookin fer suddenly cried Eradicate With a quick motion he picked up a pail of white wash from his wagon and with sure aim emptied the contents of the bucket over Morse who was rushing at Tom The white fluid spread over the man from head to foot enveloping him as in a white shroud and his advance was instantly checked Dar I reckon dat s de quickest white washin job I done in some time chuckled Eradicate as he grasped his long handled brush and clambered down from the wagon ready for a renewal of the hostilities on the part of Morse De bestest white washin job I done in some time yais sah Chapter four A Trial Trip There was no fear that Anson Morse would return to the attack Blinded by the whitewash which ran in his eyes but which being slaked did not burn him he grouped blindly about pawing the air with his outstretched hands You wait You wait You ll suffer for this he spluttered as soon as he could free his mouth from the trickling fluid Then wiping it from his face with his hands as best he could he shook his fist at Tom I ll pay you and that black rascal back he cried You wait I hopes yo pays me soon answered Eradicate case as how dat whitewash was wuff twenty five cents an I got t go git mo to finish doin a chicken coop I m wurkin on Whoa dar Boomerang Dere ain t goin t be no mo trouble I reckon Morse did not reply He had been most unexpectedly repulsed and with the white wash dripping from his garments he turned and fairly ran toward a strip of woodland that bordered the highway at that place Tom approached the colored man and held out a welcoming hand I don t know what I d done if you hadn t come along Rad the lad said That fellow was desperate and this was a lonely spot to be attacked Your whitewash came in mighty handy Yais sah Mistah Swift dat s what it done I knowed I could use it on him ef he got too obstreperous an dat s what he done But I were goin to fight him wif mah bresh ef he d made any more trouble Oh I fancy we have seen the last of him for some time said Tom but he looked worried It was evident that the Happy Harry gang was still hanging around the neighborhood of Shopton and the fact that Morse was bold enough to attack our hero in broad day light argued that he felt little fear of the authorities Ef yo wants t catch him Mistah Swift went on Eradicate yo kin trace him by de whitewash what drops offen him and he pointed to a trail of white drops which showed the path Morse had taken No the less I have to do with him the better I like it answered the lad But I can t thank you enough Rad You have helped me out of difficulties several times now You put me on the trail of the men in the deserted mansion you warned me of the log Andy Foger placed across the road and now you have saved me from Morse Oh dat s nuffin Mistah Swift Yo has suah done lots fo me Sides mah mule Boomerang am entitled t de most credit dish yeah time I were comin down de street on mah way t a whitewashin job when I seen yo an yo lickitysplit machine for so Eradicate designated a motorcycle I knowed it were yo an I didn t laik de looks ob dat man Den I see he had hold ob you an I t ought he were a burglar So I yelled t Boomerang t hurry up Now mostly when I wants Boomerang t hurry he goes slow an when I wants him t go slow he runs away But dish yeah time he knowed he were comin t help yo an he certainly did leg it dat s what he done He run laik he were goin home t a stable full ob oats an dat s how I got heah so quick Den I t ought ob de whitewash an I jest used it It was the most effective weapon you could have used said Tom gratefully Deed no Mistah Swift I didn t hab no weapon spoke Eradicate earnestly I ain t eben got mah razor case I left it home I didn t hab no weapon at all I jest used de whitewash laik yo seen me That s what I meant answered Tom trying not to laugh at the simple negro s misunderstanding I m ever so much obliged to you just the same and here s a half dollar to pay for the whitewash Oh no Mistah Swift I doan t want t take it I kin make mo whitewash But Tom insisted and picked up his machine to sprint for home Eradicate started to tell over again how he urged Boomerang on but the lad had no time to listen But I didn t hab no weapon Mistah Swift no indeedy none at all not even mah razor repeated Eradicate Only de pail ob whitewash That is lessen yo calls mah bresh a weapon Well it s a sort of one admitted Tom with a laugh as he started his machine Come around next week Rad We have some dirt eradicating for you to attend to Deed an I will Mistah Swift Eradicate is mah name an I eradicates de dirt But dat man such did look odd wif dat pail ob whitewash all ober him He suah did look most extraordinarily Gidap Boomerang See if yo can break some mo speed records now But the mule appeared to be satisfied with what he had done and as he rode off Tom looked back to see the colored man laboring to get the sleepy animal started The lad did not tell his father of the adventure with Morse but he related the occurrence to mister Sharp I d like to get hold of that scoundrel and the others in the gang exclaimed the balloonist I d take him up in the airship and drop him down into the lake He s a bad man So are the others 
7314_93276_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Wonder what they want 
none	none	around here That s what s puzzling me admitted Tom I hope dad doesn t hear about them or he will be sure to worry and maybe it will interfere with his new ideas He hasn t told you yet what he s engaged in inventing has he No and I don t like to ask him He said the other day though that it would rival our airship but in a different way I wonder what he meant It s hard to say But I don t believe he can invent anything that will go ahead of our craft even if he is my own father and the best one in the world said Tom half jokingly Well I got the bolts now let s get to work I m anxious for a trial trip No more than I am I want to see if my ideas will work out in practice as well as they do in theory For a week or more Tom and mister Sharp labored on the airship with mister Jackson to help them The motor with its twenty cylinders was installed and the big aluminum holder fastened to the frame of the planes The rudders one to control the elevation and depression of the craft and the other to direct its flight to the right or left were attached and the steering wheel as well as the levers regulating the motor were put in place About all that remains to be done now said the aeronaut one night as he and Tom stood in the big shed looking at their creation is to fit up the car and paint the machine Can t we make a trial trip before we fit up the car ready for a long flight asked the young inventor Yes but I wouldn t like to go out without painting the ship Some parts of it might rust if we get into the moist cloudy upper regions Then let s paint it to morrow and as soon as it s dry we ll have a test All right I ll mix the paint the first thing in the morning It took two days to paint the machine for much care had to be used and when it was finished Tom looked admiringly up at it We ought to name it suggested mister Sharp as he removed a bit of paint from the end of the nose To be sure agreed Tom And hold on I have the very name for it Red Cloud Red Cloud questioned mister Sharp Yes exclaimed Tom with enthusiasm It s painted red at least the big aluminum gas container is and we hope to go above the clouds in it Why not Red Cloud That s what it shall be conceded the balloonist If I had a bottle of malted milk or something like that I d christen it We ought to have a young lady to do that part suggested Tom They always have young ladies to name ships Were you thinking of any particular young lady asked mister Sharp softly and Tom blushed as he replied Oh no of course that is well Oh hang it christen it yourself and let me alone he finished Well in the absence of Miss Mary Nestor who I think would be the best one for the ceremony said mister Sharp with a twinkle in his eyes I christen thee Red Cloud and with that he sprinkled some water on the pointed nose of the red aluminum gas bag for the aeronaut and Tom were on a high staging on a level with the upper part of the airship Red Cloud it is cried Tom enthusiastically Now to morrow we ll see what it can do The day of the test proved all that could be desired in the way of weather The fact that an airship was being constructed in the Swift shops had been kept as secret as possible but of course many in Shopton knew of it for Andy Foger had spread the tidings I hope we won t have a crowd around to see us go up said Tom as he and mister Sharp went to the shed to get the Red Cloud in readiness for the trial I shouldn t want to have them laugh at us if we fail to rise Don t worry We ll go up all right declared mister Sharp The only thing I m at all worried about is our speed I want to go fast but we may not be able to until our motor gets tuned up But we ll rise The gas machine had already been started and the vapor was hissing inside the big aluminum holder It was decided to try to go up under the lifting power of the gas and not use the aeroplane feature for sending aloft the ship as there was hardly room around the shops for a good start When enough of the vapor had been generated to make the airship buoyant the big doors of the shed were opened and Tom and mister Sharp with the aid of Garret and mister Swift shoved it slowly out There it is There she comes cried several voices outside the high fence that surrounded the Swift property They re going up Andy Foger is in that bunch remarked Tom with a grim smile I hope we don t fail We won t Don t worry advised mister Sharp The shouts outside the fence increased It was evident that quite a crowd of boys as well as men had collected though it was early in the morning Somehow news of the test had leaked out The ship continued to get lighter and lighter as more gas was generated It was held down by ropes fastened to stakes driven in the ground mister Sharp entered the big car that was suspended below the aeroplanes Come on Tom the aeronaut called We re almost ready to fly Will you come too mister Swift and Garret Some other time promised the aged inventor It looks as though you were going to succeed though I ll wait however until after the test before I venture How about you Garret asked Tom of the engineer as the young inventor climbed into the car The ground is good enough for me was the answer with a smile Broken bones don t mend so easily when you re past sixty five But we re not going to fall declared mister Sharp All ready Tom Cast off Here we go The restraining ropes were quickly cast aside Slowly at first and then with a rush as though feeling more and more sure of herself the Red Cloud arose in the air like a gigantic bird of scarlet plumage Up and up it went higher than the house higher than the big shed where it had been built higher higher higher There she is cried the shrill voices of the boys in the meadow and the hoarser tones of the men mingled with them Hurrah called Tom softly to the balloonist We re off and he waved his hand to his father and Garret I told you so spoke mister Sharp confidently I m going to start the propellers in a minute Oh dear me goodness sakes alive cried missus Baggert the housekeeper running from the house and wringing her hands I m sure they ll fall She looked up apprehensively but Tom only waved his hand to her and threw her a kiss Clearly he had no fears though it was the first time he had ever been in an airship mister Sharp was as calm and collected as an ocean captain making his hundredth trip across the Atlantic Throw on the main switch he called to our hero and Tom moving to amidships in the car did as directed mister Sharp pulled several levers adjusted some valves and then with a rattle and bang the huge twenty cylinder motor started Waiting a moment to see that it was running smoothly mister Sharp grasped the steering wheel Then with a quick motion he threw the two propellers in gear They began to whirl around rapidly Here we go cried Tom and sure enough the Red Cloud now five hundred feet in the air shot forward like a boat on the water only with such a smooth gliding easy motion that it seemed like being borne along on a cloud She works She works cried the balloonist Now to try our elevation rudder and as the Red Cloud gathered speed he tilted the small planes which sent the craft up or down according to the manner in which they were tilted The next instant the airship was pointed at an angle toward the clouds and shooting along at swift speed while from below came the admiring cheers of the crowd of boys and men Chapter five Colliding With A Tower She seems to work observed Tom looking from where he was stationed near some electrical switches toward mister Sharp Of course she does replied the aeronaut I knew it would but I wasn t so sure that it would scoot along in this fashion We re making pretty good speed but we ll do better when the motor gets to running smoother How high up are we asked Tom The balloonist glanced at several gauges near the steering wheel A little short of three thousand feet he answered Do you want to go higher No no I I guess not was Tom s answer He halted over the works and his breath came in gasps Don t get alarmed called mister Sharp quickly noting that his companion was in distress because of the high altitude That always happens to persons who go into a thin air for the first time just as if you had climbed a high mountain Breathe as slowly as you can and swallow frequently That will relieve the pressure on your ear drums I ll send the ship lower Tom did as he was advised and the aeronaut deflecting the rudder sent the Red Cloud on a downward slant Tom at once felt relieved both because the action of swallowing equalized the pressure on the ear drums and because the airship was soon in a more dense atmosphere more like that of the earth How are you now asked the man of the lad as the craft was again on an even keel All right replied Tom briskly I didn t know what ailed me at first I was troubled the same way when I first went up in a balloon commented mister Sharp We ll run along for a few miles at an elevation of about five hundred feet and then we ll go to within a hundred feet of the earth and see how the Red Cloud behaves under different conditions Take a look below and see what you think of it Tom looked low through one of several plate glass windows in the floor of the car He gave a gasp of astonishment Why We re right over Lake Carlopa he gasped Of course admitted mister Sharp with a laugh And I m glad to say that we re better off than when I was last in the air over this same body of water and he could scarcely repress a shudder as he thought of his perilous position in the blazing balloon as related in detail in Tom Swift and His Motor Boat The lake was spread out below the navigators of the air like some mirror of silver in a setting of green fields Tom could see a winding river that flowed into the lake and he noted towns villages and even distant cities interspersed here and there with broad farms or patches of woodlands like a bird s eye view of a stretch of country This is great he exclaimed with enthusiasm I wouldn t miss this for the world Oh you haven t begun to see things yet replied mister Sharp Wait until we take a long trip which we ll do soon as this ship is behaving much better than I dared to hope Well we re five hundred feet high now and I ll run along at that elevation for a while Objects on the earth became more distinct now and Tom could observe excited throngs running along and pointing upward They were several miles from Shopton and the machinery was running smoothly the motor with its many cylinders purring like a big cat We could have lunch if we d brought along anything to eat observed Tom Yes assented his companion But I think we ll go back now Your father may be anxious Just come here Tom and I ll show you how to steer I m going down a short distance He depressed the rudder and the Red Cloud shot earthward Then as the airship was turned about the young inventor was allowed to try his hand at managing it He said afterward that it was like guiding a fleecy cloud Point her straight for Shopton counseled mister Sharp when he had explained the various wheels and levers to the lad Straight she is answered the lad imitating a sailor s reply Oh but this is great It beats even my motor boat It goes considerably faster at all events remarked mister Sharp Keep her steady now while I take a look at the engine I want to be sure it doesn t run hot He went aft where all the machinery in the car was located and Tom was left alone in the small pilot house He felt a thrill as he looked down at the earth beneath him and saw the crowds of wonder gazers pointing at the great red airship flying high over their heads Rapidly the open fields slipped along giving place to a large city Rocksmond murmured Tom as he noted it We re about fifty miles from home but we ll soon be back in the shed at this rate We certainly are slipping along A hundred and fifty feet elevation he went on as he looked at a gauge I wonder if I ll ever get used to going several miles up in the air He shifted the rudder a bit to go to the left The Red Cloud obeyed promptly but the next instant something snapped Tom with a startled air looked around He could see nothing wrong but a moment later the airship dipped suddenly toward the earth Then it seemed to increase its forward speed and a few seconds later was rushing straight at a tall ornamental tower that rose from one corner of a large building mister Sharp mister Sharp cried the lad Something has happened We re heading for that tower Steer to one side called the balloonist Tom tried but found that the helm had become jammed The horizontal rudder would not work and the craft was rushing nearer and nearer every minute to the pile of brick and mortar We re going to have a collision shouted Tom Better shut off the power The two propellers were whirling around so swiftly that they looked like blurs of light mister Sharp came rushing forward and Tom relinquished the steering wheel to him In vain did the aeronaut try to change the course of the airship Then with a shout to Tom to disconnect the electric switch the man turned off the power from the motor But it was too late Straight at the tower rushed the Red Cloud and a moment later had hit it a glancing blow smashing the forward propeller and breaking off both blades The nose of the aluminum gas container knocked off a few bricks from the tower and then the ship losing way slowly settled to the flat roof of the building We re smashed cried Tom with something like despair in his voice That s nothing Don t worry It might be worse Not the first time I ve had an accident It s only one propeller and I can easily make another said mister Sharp in his quick jerky sentences He had allowed some of the gas to escape from the container making the ship less buoyant so that it remained on the roof The aeronaut and Tom looked from the windows of the car to note if any further damage had been done They were just congratulating themselves that the rudder marked the extent when from a scuttle in the roof there came a procession of young ladies led by an elderly matron wearing spectacles and having a very determined bristling air Well I must say this is a very unceremonious proceeding exclaimed the spectacled woman Pray gentlemen to what are we indebted for this honor It was an accident ma am replied mister Sharp removing his hat and bowing A mere accident Humph I suppose it was an accident that the tower of this building was damaged if not absolutely loosened at the foundations You will have to pay the damages Then turning and seeing about two score of young ladies behind her on the flat roof each young lady eying with astonishment not unmixed with admiration the airship the elderly one added Pupils To your rooms at once How dare you leave without permission Oh Miss Perkman exclaimed a voice at the sound of which Tom started Mayn t we see the airship It will be useful in our natural philosophy study Tom looked at the young lady who had spoken Mary Nestor he exclaimed Tom I mean mister Swift she rejoined How in the world did you get here I was going to ask you the same question retorted the lad We flew here Young ladies Silence cried Miss Perkman who was evidently the principal of the school The idea of any one of you daring to speak to these these persons without my permission and without an introduction I shall make them pay heavily for damaging my seminary she added as she strode toward mister Sharp who by this time was out of the car To your rooms at once Miss Perkman ordered again but not a young lady moved The airship was too much of an attraction for them Chapter six Getting Off The Roof For a few minutes mister Sharp was so engrossed with looking underneath the craft to ascertain in what condition the various planes and braces were that he paid little attention to the old maid school principal after his first greeting But Miss Perkman was not a person to be ignored I want pay for the damage to the tower of my school she went on I could also demand damages for trespassing on my roof but I will refrain in this case Young ladies will you go to your rooms she demanded Oh please let us stay pleaded Mary Nestor beside whom Tom now stood Perhaps Professor Swift will lecture on clouds and air currents and and such things as that the girl went on slyly smiling at the somewhat embarrassed lad Ahem If there is a professor present perhaps it might be a good idea to absorb some knowledge admitted the old maid and unconsciously she smoothed her hair and settled her gold spectacles straighter on her nose Professor I will delay collecting damages on behalf of the Rocksmond Young Ladies Seminary while you deliver a lecture on air currents she went on addressing herself to mister Sharp Oh I m not a professor he said quickly I m a professional balloonist parachute jumper Give exhibitions at county fairs Leap for life and all that sort of thing I guess you mean my friend He s smart enough for a professor Invented a lot of things How much is the damage No professor cried Miss Perkman indignantly Why I understood from Miss Nestor that she called some one professor I was referring to my friend mister Swift said Mary His father s a professor anyhow isn t he Tom I mean mister Swift I believe he has a degree but he never uses it was the lad s answer Ha Then I have been deceived There is no professor present and the old maid drew herself up as though desirous of punishing some one Young ladies for the last time I order you to your rooms and with a dramatic gesture she pointed to the scuttle through which the procession had come Say something Tom I mean mister Swift appealed Mary Nestor in a whisper to our hero Can t you give some sort of a lecture The girls are just crazy to hear about the airship and this ogress won t let us Say something I I don t know what to say stammered Tom But he was saved the necessity for just then several women evidently other teachers came out on the roof Oh an airship exclaimed one How lovely We thought it was an earthquake and we were afraid to come up for quite a while But an airship I ve always wanted to see one and now I have an opportunity It will be just the thing for my physical geography and natural history class Young ladies attention and I will explain certain things to you Miss Delafield do you understand enough about an airship to lecture on one asked Miss Perkman smartly Enough so that my class may benefit answered the other teacher who was quite pretty Ahem That is sufficient and a different matter conceded Miss Perkman Young ladies give your undivided attention to Miss Delafield and I trust you will profit by what she tells you Meanwhile I wish to have some conversation concerning damages with the persons who so unceremoniously visited us It is a shame that the pupils of the Rocksmond Seminary should be disturbed at their studies Sir I wish to talk with you and the principal pointed a long straight finger at mister Sharp Young ladies attention called Miss Delafield You will observe the large red body at the top that is I d rather have you explain it whispered Mary Nestor to Tom Come on slip around to the other side May I bring a few of my friends with me I can t bear Miss Delafield She thinks she knows everything She won t see us if we slip around I shall be delighted replied Tom only I fear I may have to help mister Sharp out of this trouble Don t worry about me Tom said the balloonist who overheard him Let me do the explaining I m an old hand at it Been in trouble before Many a time I ve had to pay damages for coming down in a farmer s corn field I ll attend to the lady principal and you can explain things to the young ones and with a wink the jolly aeronaut stepped over to where Miss Perkman in spite of her prejudice against the airship was observing it curiously Glad to have the chance to talk to his young lady friend Tom slipped to the opposite side of the car with her and a few of her intimate friends to whom she slyly beckoned There Tom told how the Red Cloud came to be built and of his first trip in the air while on the opposite side Miss Delafield lectured to the entire school on aeronautics as she thought she knew them mister Sharp evidently did know how to explain matters to the irate principal for in a short while she was smiling By this time Tom had about finished his little lecture and Miss Delafield was at the end of hers The entire school of girls was grouped about the Red Cloud curiously examining it but Mary Nestor and her friends probably learned more than any of the others Tom was informed that his friend had been attending the school in Rocksmond since the fall term opened I little thought when I found we were going to smash into that tower that you were below there studying said the lad to the girl I m afraid I wasn t doing much studying she confessed I had just a glimpse of the airship through the window and I was wondering who was in it when the crash came Miss Perkman who is nothing if not brave at once started for the roof and we girls all followed her However are you going to get the ship down I m afraid it is going to be quite a job admitted Tom ruefully Something went wrong with the machinery or this never would have happened As soon as mister Sharp has settled with your principal we ll see what we can do I guess he s settled now observed Miss Nestor Here he comes The aeronaut and Miss Perkman were approaching together and the old maid did not seem half so angry as she had been You see mister Sharp was saying it will be a good advertisement for your school Think of having the distinction of having harbored the powerful airship Red Cloud on your roof I never thought of it in that light admitted the principal Perhaps you are right I shall put it in my next catalog And as for damages to the tower we will pay you fifty dollars continued the balloonist Do you agree to that mister Swift he asked Tom I think your father the professor would call that fair Oh as long as this airship is partly the property of a professor perhaps I should only take thirty five dollars put in Miss Perkman I am a great admirer of professors I mean in a strictly educational sense she went on as she detected a tendency on the part of some of the young ladies to giggle No fifty dollars will be about right went on mister Sharp pulling out a well filled wallet I will pay you now And if you will wait I will give you a receipt continued the principal evidently as much appeased at the mention of a professor s title as she was by the money We re getting off cheap the balloonist whispered to Tom as the head of the seminary started down the scuttle to the class rooms below Maybe it s easier getting out of that difficulty than it will be to get off the roof replied the lad Don t worry Leave that to me the aeronaut said It took considerable to ruffle mister Sharp With a receipt in full for the damage to the tower and expressing the hope that some day in the near future Professor Swift would do the seminary the honor of lecturing to the young lady pupils Miss Perkman bade mister Sharp and Tom good by Young ladies to your rooms she commanded You have learned enough of airships and there may be some danger getting this one off the roof Wouldn t you like to stay and take a ride in it Tom asked Miss Nestor Indeed I would she answered daringly It s better than a motor boat May I Some day when we get more expert in managing it he replied as he shook hands with her Now for some hard work went on the young inventor to mister Sharp when the roof was cleared of the last of the teachers and pupils But the windows that gave a view of the airship in its odd position on the roof were soon filled with eager faces while in the streets below was a great crowd offering all manner of suggestions Oh it s not going to be such a task said mister Sharp First we will repair the rudder and the machinery and then we ll generate some more gas rise and fly home But the broken propeller objected Tom We can fly with one as well as we can with two but not so swiftly Don t worry We ll come out all right and the balloonist assumed a confident air It was not so difficult a problem as Tom had imagined to put the machinery in order a simple break having impaired the working of the rudder Then the smashed propeller was unshipped and the gas machine started With all the pupils watching from windows and a crowd observing from the streets and surrounding country for word of the happening had spread Tom and his friend prepared to ascend They arose as well as they had done at the shed at home and in a little while were floating over the school Tom fancied he could observe a certain hand waving to him as he peered from the window of the car a hand in one of the school casements but where there were so many pretty girls doing the same thing I hardly see how Tom could pick out any certain one though he had extraordinarily good eyesight However the airship was now afloat and starting the motor mister Sharp found that even with one propeller the Red Cloud did fairly well making good speed Now for home to repair everything and we ll be ready for a longer trip the aeronaut said to the young inventor as they turned around and headed off before the wind while hundreds below them cheered We ought to carry spare propellers if we re going to smash into school towers remarked Tom I seem to be a sort of hoodoo Nonsense It wasn t your fault at all commented mister Sharp warmly It would have happened to me had I been steering But we will take an extra propeller along after this An hour later they arrived in front of the big shed and the Red Cloud was safely housed mister Swift was just beginning to get anxious about his son and his friend and was glad to welcome them back Now for a big trip in about a week exclaimed mister Sharp enthusiastically You ll come with us won t you mister Swift The inventor slowly shook his head Not on a trip he said I may go for a trial spin with you but I ve got too important a matter under way to venture on a long trip and he turned away without explaining what it was But Tom and mister Sharp were soon to learn

none	none	 Andy Tries a Trick 
7314_93276_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Without loss of time the young inventor and the aeronaut began to repair the damage done to the Red Cloud by colliding with the tower The most important part to reconstruct was the propeller and mister Sharp decided to make two instead of one in order to have an extra one in case of future accidents 
7314_93276_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Tom s task was to arrange the mechanism so that hereafter the rudder could not become jammed and so prevent the airship from steering properly 
7314_93276_000006_000001	train-clean-360	This the lad accomplished by a simple but effective device which when the balloonist saw it caused him to compliment Tom 
7314_93276_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 That s worth patenting he declared 
7314_93276_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 I advise you to take out papers on that 
7314_93276_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 It seems such a simple thing answered the youth 
7314_93276_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 And I don t see much use of spending the money for a patent 
7314_93276_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Airships aren t likely to be so numerous that I could make anything off that patent 
7314_93276_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 You take my advice insisted mister Sharp 
none	none	Airships are going to be used more in the future than you have any idea of 
7314_93276_000009_000002	train-clean-360	You get that device patented 
7314_93276_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Tom did so and not many years afterward he was glad that he had as it brought him quite an income 
7314_93276_000011_000000	train-clean-360	It required several days work on the Red Cloud before it was in shape for another trial 
7314_93276_000011_000001	train-clean-360	During the hours when he was engaged in the big shed helping mister Sharp the young inventor spent many minutes calling to mind the memory of a certain fair face and I think I need not mention any names to indicate whose face it was 
7314_93276_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 She promised to go for a ride with me mused the lad 
7314_93276_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 I hope she doesn t back out 
7314_93276_000012_000002	train-clean-360	But I ll want to learn more about managing the ship before I venture with her in it 
7314_93276_000012_000003	train-clean-360	It won t do to have any accidents then 
7314_93276_000012_000004	train-clean-360	There s Ned Newton too 
7314_93276_000012_000005	train-clean-360	I must take him for a skim in the clouds 
7314_93276_000012_000006	train-clean-360	Guess I ll invite him over some afternoon and give him a private view of the machine when we get it in shape again 
7314_93276_000013_000000	train-clean-360	About a week after the accident at the school mister Sharp remarked to Tom one afternoon 
7314_93276_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 If the weather is good to morrow we ll try another flight 
none	none	Do you suppose your father will come along I don t know answered the lad
7314_93276_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 He seems much engrossed in something 
7314_93276_000015_000002	train-clean-360	It s unusual too for he most generally tells me what he is engaged upon 
7314_93276_000015_000003	train-clean-360	However I guess he will say something about it when he gets ready 
none	none	Well if he doesn t feel just like coming don t argue him 
7314_93276_000016_000001	train-clean-360	He might be nervous and while the ship is new I don t want any nervous passengers aboard 
7314_93276_000016_000002	train-clean-360	I can t give them my attention and look after the running of the machinery 
7314_93276_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I was going to propose bringing a friend of mine over to see us make the trip to morrow went on the young inventor 
7314_93276_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 Ned Newton you know him 
none	none	He d like a ride
7314_93276_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I guess Ned s all right 
7314_93276_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Let him come along 
7314_93276_000018_000002	train-clean-360	We won t go very high to morrow 
7314_93276_000018_000003	train-clean-360	After a trial rise by means of the gas I m going to lower the ship to the ground and try for an elevation by means of the planes 
7314_93276_000018_000004	train-clean-360	Oh yes bring your friend along 
none	none	Ned Newton was delighted the next day to receive Tom s invitation and though a little dubious about trusting himself in an airship for the first time finally consented to go with his chum 
7314_93276_000019_000001	train-clean-360	He got a half holiday from the bank and shortly after dinner went to Tom s house 
7314_93276_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Come on out in the shed and take a look at the Red Cloud proposed the young inventor 
none	none	mister Sharp isn t quite ready to start yet and I ll explain some things to you 
7314_93276_000021_000000	train-clean-360	The big shed was deserted when the lads entered and went to the loft where they were on a level with the big red aluminum tank 
none	none	Tom began with a description of the machinery and Ned followed him with interest
7314_93276_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Now we ll go down into the car or cabin continued the young navigator of the air and I ll show you what we do when we re touring amid the clouds 
7314_93276_000023_000000	train-clean-360	As they started to descend the flight of steps from the loft platform a noise on the ground below attracted their attention 
7314_93276_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Guess that s mister Sharp coming said Ned 
7314_93276_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Tom leaned over and looked down 
none	none	An instant later he grasped the arm of his chum and motioned to him to keep silent
7314_93276_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Take a look whispered the young inventor 
7314_93276_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Andy Foger exclaimed Ned peering over the railing 
none	none	Yes and Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey are with him 
7314_93276_000028_000001	train-clean-360	They sneaked in when I left the door open 
none	none	Wonder what they want Up to some mischief I ll wager commented Ned Hark 
7314_93276_000029_000002	train-clean-360	They re talking 
7314_93276_000030_000000	train-clean-360	The two lads on the loft listened intently 
7314_93276_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Though the cronies on the ground below them did not speak loudly their voices came plainly to the listeners 
7314_93276_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Let s poke a hole in their gas bag proposed Sam 
7314_93276_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 That will make them think they re not so smart as they pretend 
none	none	Naw we can t do that answered Andy
7314_93276_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not declared Pete 
none	none	Because the bag s away up in the top part of the shed and I m not going to climb up there
7314_93276_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 You re afraid sneered Sam 
7314_93276_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I am not 
7314_93276_000036_000001	train-clean-360	I ll punch your face if you say that again 
7314_93276_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Besides the thing that holds the gas is made of aluminum and we can t make a hole in it unless we take an axe and that makes too much noise 
none	none	We ought to play some sort of a trick on Tom Swift proposed Pete He s too fresh 
7314_93276_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Tom shook his fist at the lads on the ground but of course they did not see him 
7314_93276_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 I have it came from Andy 
7314_93276_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 What demanded his two cronies 
7314_93276_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 We ll cut some of the guy wires from the planes and rudders 
7314_93276_000041_000001	train-clean-360	That will make the airship collapse 
7314_93276_000041_000002	train-clean-360	They ll think the wires broke from the strain 
7314_93276_000041_000003	train-clean-360	Take out your knives and saw away at the wires 
7314_93276_000041_000004	train-clean-360	Hurry too or they may catch us 
7314_93276_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 You re caught now whispered Ned to Tom 
7314_93276_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 Come on down and give em a trouncing 
7314_93276_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Tom hesitated 
7314_93276_000043_000001	train-clean-360	He looked quickly about the loft and then a smile replaced the frown of righteous anger on his face 
7314_93276_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I have a better way he said 
none	none	What is it
7314_93276_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 See that pile of dirt and he pointed to some refuse that had been swept up from the floor of the loft 
7314_93276_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Ned nodded 
7314_93276_000046_000002	train-clean-360	 It consists of a lot of shavings sawdust and what s more a lot of soot and lampblack that we used in mixing some paint 
7314_93276_000046_000003	train-clean-360	We ll sweep the whole pile down on their heads and make them wish they d stayed away from this place 
7314_93276_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Good exclaimed Ned chuckling 
7314_93276_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 Give me a broom 
7314_93276_000047_000002	train-clean-360	There s another one for you 
7314_93276_000048_000000	train-clean-360	The two lads in the loft peered down 
7314_93276_000048_000001	train-clean-360	The red headed squint eyed bully and his chums had their knives out and were about to cut some of the important guy wires when at a signal from Tom Ned with a sweep of his broom sent a big pile of the dirt sawdust and lampblack down upon the heads of the conspirators 
7314_93276_000048_000002	train-clean-360	The young inventor did the same thing and for an instant the lower part of the shed looked as if a dirtstorm had taken place there 
7314_93276_000048_000003	train-clean-360	The pile of refuse went straight down on the heads of the trio and as they were looking up in order to see to cut the wires they received considerable of it in their faces 
none	none	In an instant the white countenances of the lads were changed to black as black as the burnt cork performers in a minstrel show Then came a series of howls
7314_93276_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Wow 
7314_93276_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Who did that 
7314_93276_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 I m blinded 
7314_93276_000051_000001	train-clean-360	The shed is falling down 
7314_93276_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Run fellows run screamed Andy 
7314_93276_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 There s been an explosion 
7314_93276_000052_000002	train-clean-360	We ll be killed 
7314_93276_000053_000000	train-clean-360	At that moment the big doors of the shed were thrown open and mister Sharp came in 
none	none	He started back in astonishment at the sight of the three grotesque figures their faces black with the soot and their clothes covered with sawdust and shavings rushing wildly around That will teach you to come meddling around here 
7314_93276_000054_000001	train-clean-360	Andy Foger cried Tom 
none	none	I I you you Oh wait I you spluttered the bully almost speechless with rage 
7314_93276_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Sam and Pete were wildly trying to wipe the stuff from their faces but only made matters worse 
none	none	They were so startled that they did not know enough to run out of the opened doors
7314_93276_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Wish we had some more stuff to put on em remarked Ned who was holding his sides that ached from laughter 
7314_93276_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 I have it cried Tom and he caught up a bucket of red paint that had been used to give the airship its brilliant hue 
7314_93276_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Running to the end of the loft Tom stood for an instant over the trio of lads who were threatening and imploring by turns 
7314_93276_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Here s another souvenir of your visit shouted the young inventor as he dashed the bucket of red paint down on the conspirators 
none	none	This completed the work of the dirt and soot and a few seconds later each face looking like a stage Indian s ready for the war path the trio dashed out 
7314_93276_000058_000002	train-clean-360	They shed shavings sawdust and lampblack at every step and from their clothes and hands and faces dripped the carmine paint 
7314_93276_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Better have your pictures taken cried Ned peering from an upper window 
7314_93276_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and send us one added Tom joining his chum 
7314_93276_000060_000001	train-clean-360	Andy looked up at them 
7314_93276_000060_000002	train-clean-360	He dug a mass of red paint from his left ear removed a mass of soot from his right cheek and shaking his fist which was alternately striped red and black cried out in a rage 
7314_93276_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll get even with you yet Tom Swift 
7314_93276_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 You only got what was coming to you retorted the young inventor The next time you come sneaking around this airship trying to damage it you ll get worse and I ll have you arrested 
7314_93276_000062_000001	train-clean-360	You ve had your lesson and don t forget it 
7314_93276_000063_000000	train-clean-360	The red haired bully doubly red haired now had nothing more to say There was nothing he could say and accompanied by his companions he made a bee line for the rear gate in the fence and darted across the meadow 
none	none	They were all sorry enough looking specimens but solely through their own fault 
7314_93277_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Chapter eight
none	none	 Winning a Prize Well Tom what happened asked mister Sharp as he saw the trio running away
7314_93277_000003_000001	train-clean-360	 Looks as if you had had an exciting time here 
7314_93277_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 No those fellows had all the excitement declared Ned 
7314_93277_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 We had the fun And the two lads proceeded to relate what had taken place 
7314_93277_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Tried to damage the airship eh asked mister Sharp 
7314_93277_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 I wish I d caught them at it the scoundrels 
none	none	But perhaps you handled them as well as I could have done
7314_93277_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 I guess so assented Tom 
7314_93277_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 I must see if they did cut any of the wires 
none	none	But the young inventor and his chum had acted too quickly and it was found that nothing had been done to the Red Cloud 
7314_93277_000008_000000	train-clean-360	A little later the airship was taken out of the shed and made ready for a trip 
7314_93277_000008_000001	train-clean-360	The gas ascension was first used and Ned and mister Swift were passengers with Tom and mister Sharp 
7314_93277_000008_000002	train-clean-360	The machine went about a thousand feet up in the air and then was sent in various directions to the no small delight of a large crowd that gathered in the meadow back of the Swift property for it only required the sight of the airship looming its bulk above the fence and buildings to attract a throng 
none	none	It is safe to say this time however that Andy Foger and his cronies were not in the audience They were probably too busy removing the soot and red paint 
7314_93277_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Although it was the first time mister Swift had ever been in an airship he evinced no great astonishment 
7314_93277_000009_000001	train-clean-360	In fact he seemed to be thinking deeply and on some subject not connected with aeronautics 
7314_93277_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Tom noticed the abstraction of his father and shook his head 
none	none	Clearly the aged inventor was not his usual self 
7314_93277_000010_000000	train-clean-360	As for Ned Newton his delight knew no bounds At first he was a bit apprehensive as the big ship went higher and higher and swung about but he soon lost his fear and enjoyed the experience as much as did Tom 
7314_93277_000010_000001	train-clean-360	The young inventor was busy helping mister Sharp manage the machinery rudders planes and motor 
7314_93277_000011_000000	train-clean-360	A flight of several miles was made and Tom was wishing they might pay another visit to the Rocksmond Seminary but mister Sharp after completing several evolutions designed to test the steering qualities of the craft put back home 
7314_93277_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 We ll land in the meadow and try rising by the planes alone he said In this evolution it was deemed best for mister Swift and Ned to alight as there was no telling just how the craft would behave 
7314_93277_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Tom s father was very willing to get out but Ned would have remained in only for the desire of his friend 
7314_93277_000013_000000	train-clean-360	With the two propellers whirring at a tremendous speed and all the gas out of the aluminum container the Red Cloud shot forward running over the level ground of the meadow where a starting course had been laid out 
7314_93277_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Clear the track cried mister Sharp as he saw the crowd closing up in front of him 
none	none	The men boys several girls and women made a living lane 
7314_93277_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Through this shot the craft and then when sufficient momentum had been obtained Tom at a command from the aeronaut pulled the lever of the elevation rudder 
7314_93277_000014_000003	train-clean-360	Up into the air shot the nose of the Red Cloud as the wind struck the slanting surface of the planes and a moment later it was sailing high above the heads of the throng 
7314_93277_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 That s the stuff 
7314_93277_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 That s the stuff cried mister Sharp 
none	none	It works as well that way as it does with the gas 
7314_93277_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Higher and higher it went and then coming to a level keel the craft was sent here and there darting about like a bird and going about in huge circles 
7314_93277_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Start the gas machine and we ll come to rest in the air said the balloonist and Tom did so 
none	none	As the powerful vapor filled the container the ship acquired a buoyancy and there was no need of going at high speed in order to sustain it 
7314_93277_000017_000002	train-clean-360	The propellers were stopped and the Red Cloud floated two thousand feet in the air only a little distance below some fleecy white masses from which she took her name 
7314_93277_000017_000003	train-clean-360	The demonstration was a great success 
7314_93277_000017_000004	train-clean-360	The gas was again allowed to escape the propellers set in motion and purely as an aeroplane the ship was again sent forward 
7314_93277_000017_000005	train-clean-360	By means of the planes and rudders a perfect landing was made in the meadow a short distance from where the start had been made 
7314_93277_000017_000006	train-clean-360	The crowd cheered the plucky youth and mister Sharp 
7314_93277_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Now I m ready to go on a long trip any time you are Tom said the aeronaut that night 
7314_93277_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 We ll fit up the car and get ready agreed the youth 
none	none	How about you dad Me 
7314_93277_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Oh well er that is you see well I ll think about it and mister Swift went to his own room carrying with him a package of papers containing intricate calculations 
7314_93277_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Tom shook his head but said nothing 
7314_93277_000021_000001	train-clean-360	He could not understand his father s conduct 
7314_93277_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Work was started the next day on fitting up the car or cabin of the airship so that several persons could live eat and sleep in it for two weeks if necessary 
7314_93277_000022_000001	train-clean-360	The third day after this task had been commenced the mail brought an unusual communication to Tom and mister Sharp 
7314_93277_000022_000002	train-clean-360	It was from an aero club of Blakeville a city distant about a hundred miles and stated that a competition for aeroplanes and dirigible balloons was to be held in the course of two weeks 
7314_93277_000022_000003	train-clean-360	The affair was designed to further interest in the sport and also to demonstrate what progress had been made in the art of conquering the air 
7314_93277_000022_000004	train-clean-360	Prizes were to be given and the inventors of the Red Cloud the achievements of which the committee of arrangements had heard were invited to compete 
none	none	Shall we go in for it Tom asked the balloonist
7314_93277_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 I m willing if you are 
7314_93277_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Then let s do it 
7314_93277_000025_000001	train-clean-360	We ll see how our craft shows up alongside of others 
7314_93277_000025_000002	train-clean-360	I know something of this club 
none	none	It is all right but the carnival is likely to be a small one 
7314_93277_000025_000004	train-clean-360	Once I gave a balloon exhibition for them 
none	none	The managers are all right 
7314_93277_000025_000006	train-clean-360	Well we ll have a try at it Won t do us any harm to win a prize 
7314_93277_000025_000007	train-clean-360	Then for a long trip 
7314_93277_000026_000000	train-clean-360	As it was not necessary to have the car or cabin completely fitted up in order to compete for the prize work in that direction was suspended for the time being and more attention was paid to the engine the planes and rudders 
7314_93277_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Some changes were made and a week later the Red Cloud departed for Blakeville 
7314_93277_000026_000002	train-clean-360	As the rules of the contest required three passengers Ned Newton was taken along mister Swift having arranged with the bank president so that the lad could have a few days off 
none	none	The Red Cloud arrived at the carnival grounds in the evening having been delayed on the trip by a broken cog wheel which was mended in mid air 
7314_93277_000027_000001	train-clean-360	As the three navigators approached they saw a small machine flying around the grounds 
7314_93277_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Look cried Ned excitedly 
7314_93277_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 What a small airship 
7314_93277_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 That s a monoplane declared Tom who was getting to be quite an expert 
7314_93277_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes the same kind that was used to cross the English Channel interjected mister Sharp 
7314_93277_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 They re too uncertain for my purposes though they are all right under certain conditions 
7314_93277_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Hardly had he spoken than a puff of wind caused the daring manipulator of the monoplane to swerve to one side 
7314_93277_000031_000001	train-clean-360	He had to make a quick descent so rapid was it in fact that the tips of one of his planes was smashed 
7314_93277_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 It ll take him a day to repair that commented the aeronaut dryly 
7314_93277_000033_000000	train-clean-360	The Red Cloud created a sensation as she slowly settled down in front of the big tent assigned to her 
7314_93277_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Tom s craft was easily the best one at the carnival so far though the managers said other machines were on the way 
7314_93277_000034_000000	train-clean-360	The exhibition opened the next day but no flights were to be attempted until the day following 
7314_93277_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Two more crafts arrived a large triplane and a dirigible balloon 
7314_93277_000034_000002	train-clean-360	There were many visitors to the ground and Tom Ned and mister Sharp were kept busy answering questions put by those who crowded into their tent 
7314_93277_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Toward the close of the day a fussy little Frenchman entered and making his way to where Tom stood asked 
none	none	Air you ze ownair of zis machine
7314_93277_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 One of them replied the lad 
7314_93277_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Ha Sacre 
7314_93277_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Zen I challenge you to a race 
7314_93277_000037_000002	train-clean-360	I have a monoplane zat is ze swiftest evaire 
none	none	One thousand francs will I wager you zat I can fly higher and farther zan you
7314_93277_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Shall we take him up mister Sharp asked Tom 
7314_93277_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 We ll race with him after we get through with the club entries decided the aeronaut 
7314_93277_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 But not for money 
7314_93277_000039_000002	train-clean-360	It s against my principles and I don t believe your father would like it 
7314_93277_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Racing for prizes is a different thing 
none	none	Well we will devote ze money to charity conceded the Frenchman This was a different matter and one to which mister Sharp did not object so it was arranged that a trial should take place after the regular affairs 
7314_93277_000041_000000	train-clean-360	That night was spent in getting the Red Cloud in shape for the contests of the next day 
7314_93277_000041_000001	train-clean-360	She was groomed until every wire was taut and every cog lever and valve working perfectly 
7314_93277_000041_000002	train-clean-360	Ned Newton helped all he could So much has appeared in the newspapers of the races at Blakeville that I will not devote much space here to them 
none	none	Suffice it to say that the Red Cloud easily distanced the big dirigible from which much was expected 
7314_93277_000041_000004	train-clean-360	It was a closer contest with the large triplane but Tom s airship won and was given the prize a fine silver cup 
7314_93277_000042_000000	train-clean-360	As the carnival was a small one no other craft in a class with the Red Cloud had been entered so Tom and mister Sharp had to be content with the one race they won 
7314_93277_000042_000001	train-clean-360	There were other contests among monoplanes and biplanes and the little Frenchman won two races 
none	none	Now for ze affaire wis ze monstaire balloon of ze rouge color he cried as he alighted from his monoplane while an assistant filled the gasolene tank
7314_93277_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 I will in circles go around you up and down zis side zen ze ozzer and presto 
none	none	I am back at ze starting place before you have begun Zen charity shall be ze richair
7314_93277_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 All right wait and see said Tom easily 
7314_93277_000044_000001	train-clean-360	But though he showed much confidence he asked mister Sharp in private just before the impromptu contest Do you think we can beat him 
7314_93277_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said the aeronaut shrugging his shoulders you can t tell much about the air 
7314_93277_000045_000001	train-clean-360	His machine certainly goes very fast but too much wind will be the undoing of him while it will only help us 
7314_93277_000045_000002	train-clean-360	And I think he added that we re going to get a breeze 
7314_93277_000046_000000	train-clean-360	It was arranged that the Red Cloud would start from the ground without the use of the gas so as to make the machines more even 
7314_93277_000046_000001	train-clean-360	At the signal off they started the motors making a great racket 
7314_93277_000046_000002	train-clean-360	The monoplane with the little Frenchman in the seat got up first 
7314_93277_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah ha he cried gaily I leave you in ze rear 
7314_93277_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Catch me if you can 
7314_93277_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t let him beat us implored Ned 
7314_93277_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Can t you speed her up any more inquired Tom of mister Sharp 
none	none	The aeronaut nodded grimly and turned more gasolene into the twenty cylindered engine 
7314_93277_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Like a flash the Red Cloud darted forward But the Frenchman also increased his speed and did actually at first circle around the bigger machine for his affair was much lighter 
none	none	But when he tried to repeat that feat he found that he was being left behind That s the stuff 
7314_93277_000051_000001	train-clean-360	We re winning yelled Tom Ned joining in the shout 
7314_93277_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Then came a puff of wind 
7314_93277_000052_000001	train-clean-360	The monoplane had to descend for it was in danger of turning turtle 
7314_93277_000052_000002	train-clean-360	Still the navigator was not going to give up He flew along at a lower level 
7314_93277_000052_000003	train-clean-360	Then mister Sharp opened up the Red Cloud s engine at full speed and it was the big machine which now sailed around the other 
7314_93277_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 I protest 
7314_93277_000053_000001	train-clean-360	I protest cried the Frenchman above the explosions of his motor 
7314_93277_000053_000002	train-clean-360	 Ze wind is too strong for me 
7314_93277_000054_000000	train-clean-360	mister Sharp said nothing but with a queer smile on his face he sent the airship down toward the earth 
7314_93277_000054_000001	train-clean-360	A moment later he was directly under the monoplane 
7314_93277_000054_000002	train-clean-360	Then quickly rising he fairly caught the Frenchman s machine on top of a square platform of the gas container the bicycle wheels of the monoplane resting on the flat surface 
7314_93277_000054_000003	train-clean-360	And so swiftly did the Red Cloud fly along that it carried the monoplane with it to the chagrin of the French navigator 
none	none	A trick 
7314_93277_000055_000001	train-clean-360	A trick he cried 
none	none	Eet is not fair 
7314_93277_000056_000000	train-clean-360	Then dropping down mister Sharp allowed the monoplane to proceed under its own power while he raced on to the finish mark winning of course by a large margin 
none	none	Ha A trick I race you to morrow and again to morrow cried the beaten Frenchman as he alighted
7314_93277_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 No thanks answered Tom 
7314_93277_000058_000001	train-clean-360	 We ve had enough 
7314_93277_000058_000002	train-clean-360	I guess charity will be satisfied 
7314_93277_000059_000000	train-clean-360	The little Frenchman was a good loser and paid over the money which was given to the Blakeville Hospital the institution receiving it gladly 
7314_93277_000060_000000	train-clean-360	At the request of the carnival committee mister Sharp and Tom gave an exhibition of high and long flights the next day and created no little astonishment by their daring feats 
none	none	Well I think we have reason to be proud of our ship remarked mister Sharp that night
7314_93277_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 We won the first contest we were ever in and beat that speedy monoplane which was no small thing to do as they are very fast 
7314_93277_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 But wait until we go on our trip added Tom as he looked at the cup they had won 
none	none	He little realized what danger they were to meet with in the flight that was before them Chapter nine The Runaway Auto Had the inventors of the Red Cloud desired they could have made considerable money by giving further exhibitions at the Blakeville Aero Carnival and at others which were to be held in the near future at adjoining cities The fame of the new machine had spread and there were many invitations to compete for prizes But Tom and mister Sharp wished to try their skill in a long flight and at the close of the Blakeville exhibition they started for Shopton arriving there without mishap though Tom more than half hoped that they might happen to strike the tower of a certain school I needn t specify where The first thing to be done was to complete the fitting up of the car or cabin No berths had as yet been put in and these were first installed after the Red Cloud was in her shed Then an electrical heating and cooking apparatus was fitted in some additional machinery tanks for carrying water and chemicals for making the gas boxes of provisions various measuring instruments and other supplies were put in the proper places until the cabin was filled almost to its capacity Of course particular attention had been paid to the ship proper and every portion was gone over until mister Sharp was sure it was in shape for a long flight Now the question is he said to Tom one evening who shall we take with us You and I will go of course but I d like one more I wonder if your father can t be induced to accompany us He seemed to like the trial trip I ll ask him to morrow said the lad He s very busy to night If he doesn t care about it maybe Garret Jackson will go I m afraid not He s too timid I d like to take Ned Newton but he can t get any more time away from the bank I guess we ll have to depend on dad But to the surprise of Tom and mister Sharp the aged inventor shook his head when the subject was broached to him next day Why won t you go dad asked his son I ll tell you replied mister Swift I was keeping it a secret until I had made some advance in what I am engaged upon But I don t want to go because I am on the verge of perfecting a new apparatus for submarine boats It will revolutionize travel under the water and I don t want to leave home until I finish it There is another point to be considered The government has offered a prize for an under water boat of a new type and I wish to try for it So that s what you ve been working on eh dad asked his son That s it and much as I should like to accompany you I don t feel free to go My mind would be distracted and I need to concentrate myself on this invention It will produce the most wonderful results I m sure Besides the government prize is no small one It is fifty thousand dollars for a successful boat mister Swift told something more about his submarine but as I expect to treat of that in another book I will not dwell on it here as I know you are anxious to learn what happened on the trip of the Red Cloud Well remarked mister Sharp somewhat dubiously I wonder who we can get to go We need someone besides you and I Tom I s pose I could get Eradicate Sampson and his mule Boomerang replied the lad with a smile Yet I don t know At that instant there was a tremendous racket outside The loud puffing of an automobile could be heard but mingled with it was the crash of wood and then the whole house seemed jarred and shaken Is it an earthquake exclaimed mister Swift springing to his feet and rushing to the library windows Something s happened cried Tom Maybe an explosion of the airship gas yelled mister Sharp making ready to run to the balloon shed But there was no need The crashing of wood ceased and above the puffing of an auto could be heard a voice exclaiming Bless my very existence Bless my cats and dogs Good gracious But I never meant to do this Tom his father and mister Sharp rushed to the long low windows that opened on the veranda There on the porch which it had mounted by way of the steps tearing away part of the railing was a large touring car and sitting at the steering wheel in a dazed sort of manner was mister Wakefield Damon Bless my shirt studs he went on feebly But I have done it now What s the matter cried Tom hastening up to him What happened Are you hurt Hurt Not a bit of it Bless my moonstone It s the most lucky escape I ever had But I ve damaged your porch and I haven t done my machine any good Do you see anything of another machine chasing me Tom looked puzzled but glanced up and down the road Far down the highway could be discerned a cloud of dust and from the midst of it came a faint chug chug Looks like an auto down there he said Thank goodness Bless my trousers but I ve escaped em cried the eccentric man from whom Tom had purchased his motor cycle Escaped who asked mister Swift Those men They were after me But I may as well get out and explain Dear me However will I ever get my car off your porch and mister Damon seemed quite distressed Never mind answered Tom We can manage that Tell us what happened Exactly replied mister Damon growing calmer Bless my shoe buttons but I had a fright two of them in fact You see he went on I was out partly on pleasure and partly on business The pleasure consisted in riding in my auto which my physician recommended for my health The business consisted in bringing to the Shopton Bank a large amount of cash Well I deposited it all right but as I came out I saw some men hanging around I didn t like their looks and I saw them eyeing me rather sharply I thought I had seen them before and sure enough I had Two of the men belonged to that Happy Harry gang Tom made a quick motion of a caution pointing to his father but it was not necessary as mister Swift was absently mindedly calculating on a piece of paper he had taken from his pocket and had not heard what mister Damon said The latter however knew what Tom meant and went on Well I didn t like the looks of these men and when I saw them sizing me up evidently thinking I had drawn money out instead of putting it in I decided to give them the slip I got in my auto but I was startled to see them get in their car I headed for here as I was coming to pay you a visit anyhow and the mysterious men kept after me It became a regular race I put on all the speed I could and headed for your house Tom for I thought you would help me I went faster and faster and so did they They were almost up to me and I was just thinking of slowing down to turn in here when I lost control of my machine and well I did turn in here but not exactly as I intended Bless my gaiters I came in with rather more of a rush than I expected It was awful positively awful I assure you You ve no idea how nervous I was But I escaped those scoundrels for they rushed on when they saw what I had done smashed the porch railing Probably they thought you d smash them observed Tom with a laugh But why did they follow you Can t imagine Haven t the least idea Bless my spark plug but they might have imagined I had money Anyhow I m glad I escaped them It s lucky you weren t hurt said mister Sharp Oh me Bless my existence I m always having narrow escapes mister Damon caught sight of the Red Cloud which was out in front of the big shed Bless my heart What s that he added Our new airship answered Tom proudly We are just planning a long trip in it but we can t find a third member of the party to go along A third member exclaimed mister Damon Do you really mean it We do Bless my shoe laces Will you take me along Do you mean that asked Tom in turn foreseeing a way out of their difficulties I certainly do answered the eccentric man I am much interested in airships and I might as well die up in the clouds as any other way Certainly I prefer it to being smashed up in an auto Will you take me Of course cried Tom heartily and mister Sharp nodded an assent Then Tom drew mister Damon to one side We ll arrange the trip in a few minutes the lad said Tell me more about those mysterious men please Chapter ten A Bag of Tools Wakefield Damon glanced at mister Swift The inventor was oblivious to his surroundings and was busy figuring away on some paper He seemed even to have forgotten the presence of the eccentric autoist I don t want father to hear about the men went on Tom in a low tone If he hears that Happy Harry and his confederates are in this vicinity he ll worry and that doesn t agree with him But are you sure the men you saw are the same ones who stole the turbine model Very certain replied mister Damon I had a good view of them as I came from the bank and I was surprised to see them until I remembered that they were out of jail But why do you think they pursued you Bless my eyes I can t say Perhaps they weren t after me at all I may have imagined it but they certainly hurried off in their auto as soon as I left the bank after leaving my money there I m glad I deposited it before I saw them I was so nervous as it was that I couldn t steer straight It s too bad the way I ve damaged your house That doesn t matter But how about the trip in the airship I hope you meant it when you said you would go Of course I did I ve never traveled in the air but it can t be much worse than my experience with my motor cycle and the auto At least I can t run up any stoop can I and mister Damon looked at mister Sharp No replied the aeronaut as he scratched his head I guess you ll be safe on that score But I hope you won t get nervous when we reach a great height Oh no I ll just calm myself with the reflection that I can t die but once and with this philosophical reflection mister Damon went back to look at the auto which certainly looked odd stuck up on the veranda Well you d better make arrangements to go with us then went on Tom Meanwhile I ll see to getting your car down You ll want to send it home I suppose No not if you ll keep it for me The fact is that all my folks are away and will be for some time I don t have to go home to notify them and it s a good thing as my wife is very nervous and might object if she heard about the airship I ll just stay here if you ve no objection until the Red Cloud sails if sails is the proper term Sails will do very well answered mister Sharp But Tom let s see if you and I can t get that car down Perhaps mister Damon would like to go in the house and talk to your father for mister Swift had left the piazza The eccentric individual was glad enough not to be on hand when his car was eased down from the veranda and disappeared into the house Tom and mister Sharp with the aid of Garret Jackson then released the auto from its position They had to take down the rest of the broken railing and their task was easy enough The machine was stored in a disused shed and mister Damon had no further concern until it was time to undertake the trip through the air It will fool those men if I mysteriously disappear he said with a smile Bless my hat band but they ll wonder what became of me We ll just slip off in the Red Cloud and they ll never be the wiser I don t know about that commented Tom I fancy they are keeping pretty close watch in this vicinity and I don t like it I m afraid they are up to some mischief I should think the bank authorities would have them locked upon suspicion I think I ll telephone Ned about it He did so and his chum in turn notified the bank watchman But the next day it was reported that no sign of the men had been seen and later it was learned that an auto answering the description of the one they were in had been seen going south many miles from Shopton The work of preparing the Red Cloud for the long trip was all but completed It had been placed back in the shed while a few more adjustments were made to the machinery Bless my eyelashes exclaimed mister Damon a few days before the one set for the start but I haven t asked where we are bound for Where are we going anyhow mister Sharp We re going to try and reach Atlanta Georgia replied the balloonist That will make a fairly long trip and the winds at this season are favorable in that direction That suits me all right declared mister Damon I m all ready and anxious to start It was decided to give the airship a few more trials around Shopton before setting out to see how it behaved with the car heavier loaded than usual With this in view a trip was made to Rocksmond with mister Swift mister Damon and Ned in addition to mister Sharp and Tom on board Then at Tom s somewhat blushing request a stop was made near the Seminary and when the pupils came trooping out the young inventor asked Miss Nestor if she didn t want to take a little flight She consented and with two pretty companions climbed rather hesitatingly into the car No great height was attained but the girls were fully satisfied and after their first alarm really enjoyed the spin in the air with Tom proudly presiding at the steering wheel which mister Sharp relinquished to the lad for he understood Tom s feelings Three days later all was in readiness for the trip to Atlanta mister Swift was earnestly invited to undertake it both Tom and mister Sharp urging him but the veteran inventor said he must stay at home and work on his submarine plans The evening before the start when the aeronaut and Tom were giving a final inspection to the craft in the big shed mister Sharp exclaimed I declare Tom I believe you ll have to take a run into town What for Why to get that kit of special tools I ordered which we might need to make repairs There are some long handled wrenches some spare levers and a couple of braces and bits Harrison the hardware dealer ordered them for me from New York and they were to be ready this afternoon but I forgot them Take an empty valise with you and you can carry them on your motorcycle I m sorry to have forgotten it but That s all right mister Sharp I d just as soon go as not It will make the time pass more quickly I ll start right off An hour later having received the tools which made quite a bundle the lad put them in the valise and started back toward home As he swung around the corner on which the bank was located the same bank in which Ned Newton worked one of the valves on the motor cycle began to leak Tom dismounted to adjust it and had completed the work being about to ride on when down the street came Andy Foger and Sam Snedecker They started at the sight of our hero There he is now exclaimed Sam as if he and the red haired bully had been speaking of the young inventor Let s lick him proposed Andy Now s our chance to get even for throwing that paint and soot on us Tom heard their words He was not afraid of both the lads for though each one matched him in size and strength Tom knew they were cowards If you re looking for anything I guess I can accommodate you he said coolly Come on Andy urged Sam But somehow Andy hung back Perhaps he didn t like the way Tom squared off The young inventor had let down the rear brace of his motor cycle and was not obliged to hold it so he had both hands free We ought to lick him good and proper growled the squint eyed lad Well why don t you invited Tom He moved to one side so as not to be hampered by his wheel As he did so he knocked from the handle bars the valise of tools They fell with a clatter and a thud to the pavement and the satchel came open It was under a gas lamp and the glitter of the long handled wrenches and other implements caught the eyes of Andy and his crony Huh If we fought you maybe you d use some of them on us sneered Andy glad of an excuse not to fight Tom quickly picked up his valise shutting it but he was aware of the close scrutiny of the two vindictive lads I don t fight with such things he said somewhat annoyed and he hung the tools back on the handle bars What you doing around the bank at this hour asked Sam as if to change the subject First thing you know the watchman will order you to move on He might think you were a suspicious character The same to you retorted Tom but I m going to ride on now unless you want to have a further argument with me You d better be careful how you hang around a bank added Andy The police are on the lookout here There s been some mysterious men seen about Tom did not care to go into that and seeing that the two bullies had lost all desire to attack him he put up the brace and mounted his wheel Good by he called to Andy and Sam as he rode off the tools rattling and jingling in the valise but it was a sarcastic farewell and the two cronies did not reply I hope I didn t damage any of the tools when I let them fall that time mused the young inventor My the way Sam and Andy stared at them it would make it seem as if I had a lot of weapons in the bag They certainly took good note of them The time was to come and very shortly when Andy s and Sam s observation of the tools was to prove disastrous for our hero As Tom turned the corner he looked back and saw still standing in front of the bank the two cronies 
7320-93280-0000	train-other-500	Chapter eleven The Red Cloud Departs Well dad I wish you were going along with us said Tom to his father next morning You don t know what you re going to miss
7320-93280-0001	train-other-500	A fine trip of several hundred miles through the air seeing strange sights and experiencing new sensations Yes I wish you would reconsider
7320-93280-0002	train-other-500	your determination and accompany us added mister Damon I would enjoy your company There s plenty of room We can carry six persons with ease said mister Sharp
none	none	 mister Swift shook his head and smiled 
7320-93280-0003	train-other-500	I have too much work to do here at home he replied
none	none	 Perhaps I may astonish you with something when you come back I have nearly perfected my latest invention There was no combating such a 
7320-93280-0004	train-other-500	resolution as this and Tom and the others considered the decision of the aged inventor as final The airship was ready for the start and every
none	none	 one had arisen earlier 
7320-93280-0005	train-other-500	than usual on this account The bag of tools for which Tom had gone to town were put in their proper place the last of the supplies were taken abroad
none	none	 final tests were made of the various apparatus 
7320-93280-0006	train-other-500	the motor had been given a trial spin disconnected from the propellers and then the balloonist announced Well Tom and mister Damon you had better begin to think of starting
7320-93280-0007	train-other-500	We ve had breakfast here but there s no telling where we will eat dinner Bless my soul Don t you talk that way exclaimed mister Damon You make me exceedingly nervous
none	none	 Why shouldn t we know where we are going to eat dinner Oh I meant we couldn t tell over just 
7320-93280-0008	train-other-500	what part of the United States we would be when dinner time came explained the aeronaut Oh that s different Bless my pocket knife but I thought
none	none	 you meant we 
7320-93280-0009	train-other-500	might be dashed to pieces and incapable of eating any dinner Hardly remarked mister Sharp The Red Cloud is not that kind of an airship I hope But get aboard if you please Tom and mister Damon
7320-93280-0010	train-other-500	entered the car It was resting on the ground on the small wheels used to start the airship when the gas inflation method was not used In this case however it had been decided to rise in the air by means
none	none	 of the powerful vapor 
7320-93280-0011	train-other-500	and not to use the wings and planes until another time Consequently the ship was swaying slightly and tugging at the restraining cables As Tom and mister Damon entered the cabin
7320-93280-0012	train-other-500	there drove into the Swift yard a dilapidated wagon drawn by a bony mule
none	none	 and it did not need the addition of a colored man s voice calling Whoa dar Boomerang 
7320-93280-0013	train-other-500	to tell Tom that his friend Eradicate Sampson was on hand As for Eradicate as soon as he saw the great airship which he had never before beheld fully rigged
none	none	 all ready for a flight his eyes became big with wonder 
7320-93280-0014	train-other-500	Is dat yo flyin machine Mistah Swift he asked That s it Rad
none	none	 answered Tom 
7320-93280-0015	train-other-500	Don t you want to come and take a ride with us Me
none	none	 Good land a massy No indeedy Mistah Swift 
7320-93280-0016	train-other-500	and the whitewasher who had descended from his wagon edged away as if the airship might suddenly put out a pair of hands and grab him No indeedy I doant
none	none	 I come t do a little whitewashin an when I do dat 
7320-93280-0017	train-other-500	I se gwine on mah way But dat s a pow ful fine ship it suah am Better come and try a flight Rad added mister Damon I ll look after you No sah an I doan t take it kind
none	none	 ob yo all t tempt me dat way nuther 
7320-93280-0018	train-other-500	spoke Eradicate But when he saw that the craft was stationary he ventured to approach closer Gingerly he put out one hand and touched the framework of the wheels just forward of the cabin
7320-93280-0019	train-other-500	The negro grasped the timber and lifted it slightly To his astonishment the whole front of the airship tilted up for it was about ready to fly and a child might have lifted it so buoyant was it
none	none	 But Eradicate did not know this 
7320-93280-0020	train-other-500	Wonderingly he looked at the great bulk of the ship looming above him then he glanced at his arm
none	none	 Once more noting that the attention of his friends 
7320-93280-0021	train-other-500	was elsewhere he lifted the craft
none	none	 Then he cried Look yeah Mistah Swift Look yeah 
7320-93280-0022	train-other-500	No wonder day calls me Sampson I done lifted dis monstrousness airship wif one hand
none	none	 See I kin do it 
7320-93280-0023	train-other-500	I kin do it Once more he raised the Red Cloud slightly and a delighted grin not unmixed with a look of awe spread over his honest countenance I suppose you ll give up whitewashing
none	none	 and join a circus as a strong man now observed mister Sharp with a wink at his companions Days what I will announced Eradicate proudly I neber knowed I was dat strong but ob course I allers knowed I had some muscle Golly I must hab growed strong ober night 
7320-93280-0024	train-other-500	Now Boomerang yo suah has
none	none	 got t look out fo yo sef No mo ob yo cuttin up capers or I ll jest lift you up an 
7320-93280-0025	train-other-500	sot yo down on yo back I suah will and the negro feeling of his biceps walked over to where the mule stood with its eyes closed
none	none	 I guess you can cast off 
7320-93280-0026	train-other-500	Tom called mister Sharp as he entered the car having seen that everything was all right We ll not go up very far at first until mister Damon gets used to the thin air Bless my soul
7320-93280-0027	train-other-500	I believe I m getting nervous announced the eccentric man Bless my liver but I hope nothing happens Nothing will happen mister Sharp assured him Just keep calm when it feels
none	none	 as if the bottom was dropping out of everything and you ll soon get over it 
7320-93280-0028	train-other-500	Are you casting off those ropes Tom Is all clear All but the bow and stern lines You attend to the bow line and I ll go to the stern
none	none	 and going over to the gas generator 
7320-93280-0029	train-other-500	mister Sharp started it
none	none	 so as to force more vapor into the red aluminum container 
7320-93280-0030	train-other-500	This had the effect of rendering the airship more buoyant
none	none	 and it tugged and strained harder 
7320-93280-0031	train-other-500	than ever at the ropes Good by Tom called mister Swift reaching up to shake hands with his son Drop me a line when you get a chance
none	none	 Oh Tom do be careful 
7320-93280-0032	train-other-500	implored missus Baggert her kind face showing her anxiety May I kiss you good by
none	none	 Of course answered the young inventor though 
7320-93280-0033	train-other-500	the motherly housekeeper had not done this since he was a little chap She had to stand on a soap box which Eradicate brought in order to reach Tom s face and when she had kissed him she said Oh I m so worried
7320-93280-0034	train-other-500	I just know you ll be killed risking your lives in that terrible airship Ha Not a very cheerful view to take madam observed mister Damon Don t
7320-93280-0035	train-other-500	hold that view I beg of you Bless my eyelashes but you ll see us coming home covered with glory and star dust I m sure I hope so answered missus Baggert laughing a little in spite of herself
7320-93280-0036	train-other-500	The last ropes were cast off Good bys were shouted as the airship shot into the air and mister Sharp started the motor to warm it up before the propellers were thrown into gear
7320-93280-0037	train-other-500	The twenty cylinders began exploding with a terrific racket as the muffler was open and Tom looking down saw Boomerang awaken with a jump The mule was so frightened
7320-93280-0038	train-other-500	that he started off on a dead run swinging the rickety old wagon along behind him Eradicate Sampson who had been feeling his muscle since he discovered what he thought was his marvelous strength saw what was happening
none	none	 Whoa dar Boomerang 
7320-93280-0039	train-other-500	he shouted Then as the tailboard of the wagon swung past him he reached out and grabbed it Perhaps he thought he could bring the runaway mule up standing but if he did he was grievously disappointed
7320-93280-0040	train-other-500	Boomerang pulled his master along the gravel walk and kept running in spite
none	none	 of Eradicate s command to whoa dar 
7320-93280-0041	train-other-500	It might have gone hard with him had not Garret Jackson the engineer running in front of Boomerang
none	none	 caught the animal 
7320-93280-0042	train-other-500	Eradicate picked himself up and gazed sadly at his arms The navigators of the air could not hear what he said but what he thought was evident to them Then as mister Sharp
7320-93280-0043	train-other-500	deadened the explosions of the powerful motor
none	none	 Tom looking at a gauge 
7320-93280-0044	train-other-500	noted that their height was seven hundred feet High enough called mister Sharp and it was time for mister Damon
none	none	 in spite of his resolution 
7320-93280-0045	train-other-500	was getting pale The gas was shut off the propellers thrown into gear and with a rush the Red Cloud shot toward the south passing over the Swift homestead and high above the heads of the crowd
7320-93280-0046	train-other-500	that had gathered to witness the start
none	none	 The eventful voyage of the air had begun Chapter twelve Some Startling News Well there they go remarked missus Baggert to mister Swift as she strained her eyes toward the sky against the blue of which the airship was now only a large black ball Yes and a fine start they made replied the inventor I almost wish I had accompanied them but I must not stop work on my submarine invention I do hope nothing will happen to them went on the housekeeper I declare though I feel just as if something was going to happen Nervousness pure nervousness commented mister Swift Better take a little er I suppose catnip tea would be good Catnip tea The very idea exclaimed missus Baggert That shows how much you know about nervousness mister Swift and she seemed a little indignant Ha Hum Well maybe catnip tea wouldn t be just the thing But don t worry about Tom I m sure he can look after himself As for mister Sharp he has made too many ascensions to run into any unnecessary danger Nervous went on the housekeeper who seemed to resent this state being applied to her I m sure I m not half as nervous as that mister Damon He gives me the fidgets Of course Well I must get back to my work said the inventor Ah are you hurt Eradicate he went on as the colored man came back driving Boomerang who had been stopped just before reaching the road No Mistah Swift I ain t exactly damaged but mah feelin s am suah hurted How s that Well I thought I had growed strong in de night when I lifted dat airship but when I went to stop mah mule I couldn t do it He won t hab no respect fo me now Oh I wouldn t let that worry me commented mister Swift and he explained to Eradicate how it was that he had so easily lifted the end of the buoyant ship which weighed very little when filled with gas The colored man proceeded with his work of whitewashing the inventor was in his library puzzling over tables of intricate figures and missus Baggert was in the kitchen sighing occasionally as she thought of Tom whom she loved almost as a son high in the air when two men came up the walk from the street and knocked at the side door missus Baggert who answered the summons was somewhat surprised to see Chief of Police Simonson and Constable Higby They probably came to see the airship start she thought but they re too late Ah good morning missus Baggert greeted the chief Is mister Swift and his son about this morning mister Swift is in his library but Tom is gone He ll be back though won t he asked Constable Higby quickly anxiously missus Baggert thought Oh yes she replied He and Just take us to see mister Swift interrupted the chief with a look of caution at his aide We ll explain matters to him Wondering what could be the mission of the two officers missus Baggert led them to the library It s queer she thought that they don t ask something about the airship I suppose that was what they came for But maybe it s about the mysterious men who robbed mister Swift Ah gentlemen what can I do for you asked the inventor as he rose to greet the officials Ahem mister Swift Ahem er that is well the fact is mister Swift stammered the chief we have come upon a very painful errand What s that cried Tom s father I haven t been robbed again have I There has been a robbery committed spoke the constable quickly But you are not the victim interposed the chief I m glad of that said mister Swift Where is your son Tom asked the head of the Shopton police force sharply What do you want with him inquired the inventor struck by some strange tone in the other s voice mister Swift went on the chief solemnly I said we came upon a very painful errand It is painful as I have known Tom since he was a little lad But I must do my duty no matter how painful it is I have a warrant for the arrest of your son Thomas Swift and I have come to serve it I need not tell you that it is your duty to give him up to us the representatives of the law I call upon you to produce your son mister Swift staggered to his feet My son You have come to arrest my son he stammered The chief nodded grimly Upon what charge faltered the father On a charge of breaking into the Shopton National Bank last night and stealing from the vault seventy five thousand dollars in currency Seventy five thousand dollars Tom accused of robbing the bank faltered mister Swift That is the charge and we ve come to arrest him broke in Constable Higby Where is he added the chief This charge is false Absolutely false shouted the aged inventor That may be admitted the chief shaking his head But the charge has been made and we hold the warrant The courts will settle it We must now arrest Tom Where is he He isn t here cried mister Swift and small blame to him if there was a note of triumph in his voice Tom sailed away not half an hour ago in the airship Red Cloud You can t arrest him He s escaped shouted the constable I told you chief that he was a slippery customer and that we d better come before breakfast Dry up commanded the chief testily So he s foiled us eh Run away when he knew we were coming I think that looks like guilt mister Swift Never cried the inventor Tom would never think of robbing the bank Besides he has all the money he wants The charge is preposterous I demand to be confronted with the proof You shall be answered Chief Simonson vindictively If you will come to the bank you can see the rifled vault and hear the testimony of a witness who saw your son with burglar tools in his possession last night We also have a warrant for mister Wakefield Damon Do you know anything of him He has gone with my son in the airship Ha The two criminals with their booty have escaped together cried the chief But we ll nab them if we have to scour the whole country Come on Higby mister Swift if you ll accompany me to the bank I think I can give you all the proof you want and the officials followed by the amazed and grief stricken inventor left the house Chapter thirteen mister Damon In Danger The sensations of the voyagers in the airship who meanwhile were flying along over the country surrounding Shopton were not very different than when they had undertaken some trial flights In fact mister Damon was a little disappointed after they had waved their farewells to mister Swift and missus Baggert I declare I m not at all nervous he remarked as he sat in an easy chair in the enclosed car or cabin and looked down at the earth through the plate glass windows in the floor I thought you d be all right once we got started commented mister Sharp Do you think you can stand going a trifle higher Try it suggested the eccentric man Bless my watch chain but as I said I might as well die this way as any other Hitting a cloud bank is easier than trying to climb a tree on a motorcycle eh Tom Very much so mister Damon conceded the young inventor with a laugh Oh we ll not attempt any cloud heights for a day or two went on mister Sharp I want you to gradually get used to the rarefied atmosphere mister Damon Tom and I are getting to be old hands at it But if you think you can stand it I ll go up about a thousand feet higher Make it two thousand while you re at it proposed the odd character Might as well take a long fall as a short one Accordingly the elevation rudder was used to send the Red Cloud to a greater height while she was still skimming along like some great bird Of course the desired elevation could have been obtained by forcing more gas from the machine into the big red container overhead but it was decided to be as sparing of this vapor as possible since the voyagers did not want to descend to get more material in case they used up what they had It was just as easy to rise by properly working the rudders when the ship was in motion and that was the method now employed With the great propellers fore and aft making about a thousand revolutions a minute the craft slanted up toward the sky The ship was not being run at top speed as mister Sharp did not care to force it and there was no need for haste Long distance rather than high speed was being aimed at on this first important flight Tom was at the steering wheel and with his hand on the lever controlling the elevation rudder kept watch of the face of mister Damon occasionally noting what height the hand on the gauge registered He fancied he saw the cheeks of his friend growing pale and when a height of thirty five hundred feet was indicated with a yank the young inventor put the airship on a level keel Are you distressed mister Damon he asked Ye yes I I have some some difficulty in breathing was the answer Tom gave his friend the same advice the aeronaut had given the lad on his first trip and the eccentric man soon felt better Bless my buttons he ventured to explain But I feel as if I had lost several pounds of flesh and I m glad of it mister Sharp was busy with the motor which needed some slight adjustments and Tom was in sole charge of navigating the airship He had lost the nervous feeling that first possessed him and was becoming quite an expert at meeting various currents of wind encountered in the upper regions Below the voyagers could see the earth spread out like a great map They could not tell their exact location now but by calculating their speed which was about thirty miles an hour Tom figured out that they were above the town of Centreford near where he had been attacked once by the model thieves For several hours the airship kept on her way maintaining a height of about a mile for when it was found that mister Damon could accommodate himself to thirty five hundred feet the elevation rudder was again shifted to send the craft upward By using glasses the travelers could see crowds on the earth watching their progress in the air and though airships dirigible balloons and aeroplanes are getting fairly common now the appearance of one as novel and as large as the Red Cloud could always be depended upon to attract attention Well what do you say to something to eat proposed mister Sharp coming into the main cabin from the motor compartment It s twelve o clock though we can t hear the factory whistles up here I m ready any time you are called Tom from the pilot house Shall I cook grub mister Sharp No you manage the ship and I ll play cook We ll not get a very elaborate meal this time as I shall have to pay occasional visits to the motor which isn t running just to suit me The electrical stove was set going and some soup and beefsteak from among the stores was put on the fire In spite of the fact that the day was a warm one in October it was quite cool in the cabin until the stove took off the chill The temperature of the upper regions was several degrees below that of the earth At times the ship passed through little wisps of vapor clouds in the making Isn t this wonderful exclaimed mister Damon as he sat in an easy chair partaking of some of the food To think that I have lived to see the day when I can take my lunch a mile in the air with a craft flying along like a bird Bless my knife and fork but it certainly is wonderful mister Sharp relieved Tom at the wheel while the young inventor ate and then with the airship heading southwest the speed was increased a trifle the balloonist desiring to see what the motor could accomplish under a heavy load A drop of several hundred feet was made about an hour later and as this made it warmer mister Damon who was a great lover of fresh air decided to go out on the platform in front of the cabin This platform and a similar one at the rear was railed about to prevent accidents A fine view could be had from them much better than through the floor windows of the car Be careful of the propeller advised Tom as his friend went outside I don t believe you re tall enough to be hit by the blades but don t take any chances of standing on your tiptoes Bless my pocket handkerchief indeed I ll not came the answer But I think I shall wrap up my throat in the scarf I brought along I am subject to neuralgia and the breeze may bring on an attack of it Wrapping a long woolen scarf about his neck the eccentric man ventured out on the open platform About the middle of it but sufficiently high to be above a person s head was the forward propeller whirring around at swift speed Tom with his eye on the various gauges and the compass was steering the airship He glanced at mister Damon who appeared to be enjoying the view from the platform For an instant the eyes of the lad were taken from the form of his friend He looked back suddenly however his attention attracted by a smothered cry He was horrified by what he saw mister Damon was leaning far over the edge of the railing with nothing between him and the earth a thousand feet below He seemed to have lost his balance and had toppled forward being doubled up on the iron pipe railing his hands hanging limply over Then as Tom cried to mister Sharp to shut off the motor the lad saw that hanging to the blade of the propeller and being whirled around in its revolutions was a part of mister Damon s red scarf Hurry Hurry mister Sharp yelled Tom not daring to let go the steering wheel for fear the ship would encounter a treacherous current and tilt Hurry to mister Damon What s the matter asked the balloonist He s dead or unconscious hanging over the railing He seems to be slipping Hurry or it will be too late Chapter fourteen 
7327-93283-0000	train-other-500	Andy Gives The Clue When mister Swift followed the chief of police and the constable to the town hall his mind was filled with many thoughts All his plans for revolutionizing submarine travel were of course forgotten and he was only concerned with the charge that had been made against his son
7327-93283-0001	train-other-500	It seemed incredible yet the officers were not ones to perpetrate a joke The chief and constable had driven from town in a carriage and they now invited the inventor to ride back with them Do you mean to tell me a warrant has actually been sworn out against my son Chief
7327-93283-0002	train-other-500	asked the father when they were near the town hall That s just what I mean to say mister Swift and I m sorry on your account that I have to serve it Hub Don t look like you was goin to serve it remarked the constable He s skipped out
7327-93283-0003	train-other-500	That s all right Higby went on the chief I ll catch em both Even if they have escaped in an airship with their booty I ll nab em I ll have a general alarm out all over the country in less than an hour They can t stay up in the air forever
7327-93283-0004	train-other-500	A warrant for Tom my son murmured mister Swift as if he could not believe it Yes and for that Damon man too added the chief I want him as well as Tom and I ll get em Would you mind letting me see the warrants asked the inventor
7327-93283-0005	train-other-500	and the official passed them over The documents were made out in regular form and the complaints had been sworn to by Isaac Pendergast the bank president I can t understand it went on Tom s father Seventy five thousand dollars It s incredible
7327-93283-0006	train-other-500	Why he suddenly exclaimed it can t be true Just before he left mister Damon Yes what did he do asked the chief eagerly thinking he might secure some valuable evidence I guess I ll say nothing until I have seen the bank president replied mister Swift
none	none	 and the official was obviously disappointed The inventor found mister Pendergast and some other bank officials in the town hall 
7327-93283-0007	train-other-500	The financiers were rather angry when they learned that the accused persons had not been caught but the chief said he would soon have them in custody In the meanwhile will you kindly explain what this means asked mister Swift of the president
7327-93283-0008	train-other-500	You may come and look at the looted vault if you like mister Swift replied mister Pendergast It was a very thorough job and will seriously cripple the bank There was no doubt that the vault had been forced open for the locks and bars were bent and twisted as if by heavy tools
7327-93283-0009	train-other-500	mister Swift made a careful examination and was shown the money drawers that had been smashed This was the work of experts he declared Exactly what we think said the president Of course we don t believe your son was a professional bank robber mister Swift
7327-93283-0010	train-other-500	We have a theory that mister Damon did the real work but that Tom helped him with the tools he had There is no doubt about it What right have you to accuse my son burst out the aged inventor
7327-93283-0011	train-other-500	Why have you any more cause to suspect him than any other lad in town Why do you fix on him and mister Damon I demand to know mister Damon s eccentric actions for a few days past and his well known oddity of character make him an object of suspicion
7327-93283-0012	train-other-500	declared the president in judicial tones As for Tom we have I regret to say even better evidence against him But what is it What Who gave you any clues to point to my son Do you really wish to know I certainly do was the sharp reply
7327-93283-0013	train-other-500	mister Swift the police and several bank officials were now in the president s office
none	none	 The latter pressed an electric bell and when a messenger answered he said 
7327-93283-0014	train-other-500	Send young Foger here At the mention of this name mister Swift started He well knew the red haired bully was an enemy of his son Andy entered walking rather proudly at the attention he attracted This is mister Swift said the president
7327-93283-0015	train-other-500	Aw I know him blurted out Andy You will please tell him what you told us went on mister Pendergast Well I seen Tom Swift hanging around this bank with burglar tools in his possession last night just before it was robbed
none	none	 exclaimed the squint eyed lad triumphantly 
7327-93283-0016	train-other-500	Hanging around the bank last night with burglar tools repeated mister Swift in dazed tones That s right from Andy How do you know they were burglar tools Because I saw em cried Andy He had em in a valise on his motor cycle
none	none	 He was standing at the corner waiting for a chance to break into the bank and when me and Sam Snedecker saw him he pretended to be fixin his machine Then the bag of burglar tools fell off the satchel came open and I seen em That s how I know 
7327-93283-0017	train-other-500	And you re sure they were burglar tools asked the chief for he depended on Andy to be his most important witness
none	none	 Sure I am I seen a picture of burglar tools once and the ones Tom had was just like em Long handled wrenches brace an bits an all 
7327-93283-0018	train-other-500	He tried to hide em but me an Sam was too quick for him He wanted to lick me too
none	none	 No doubt you deserved it murmured mister Swift 
7327-93283-0019	train-other-500	But how do you know my son was waiting for a chance to break into the bank
none	none	 Cause wasn t it robbed right after he was hangin around here with the burglar tools 
7327-93283-0020	train-other-500	inquired Andy as if that was unanswerable What were you hanging around here for mister Swift demanded quickly Me Oh well me an Sam Snedecker was out takin a walk That s all
none	none	 You didn t want to rob the bank did you went on the inventor keenly Of course not roared the bully indignantly I ain t got no burglar tools 
7327-93283-0021	train-other-500	Andy told more along the same line but his testimony of having seen Tom near the bank with a bag of odd tools could not be shaken
7327-93283-0022	train-other-500	In fact it was true as far as it went but of course the tools were only those for the airship the same ones mister Sharp had sent the lad after Sam Snedecker was called in after Andy and told substantially the same story
none	none	 mister Swift could not understand it for he knew nothing of Tom being sent for the tools and had not heard any talk at home of the bag of implements ordered by the balloonist 
7327-93283-0023	train-other-500	Still of course he knew Tom had nothing to do with the robbery and he knew his son had been at home all the night previous Still this was rather negative evidence
none	none	 But the inventor had one question yet to ask 
7327-93283-0024	train-other-500	You say you also suspect mister Damon of complicity in this affair he went on to the chief of police We sure do replied mister Simonson
none	none	 Then can you explain proceeded the inventor how it is that mister Damon has on deposit in this bank a large sum 
7327-93283-0025	train-other-500	Would he rob the bank where his own funds were We are prepared for that declared the president It is true that mister Damon has about ten thousand dollars in our bank but we believe he deposited it only as a blind so as to cover up his tracks
7327-93283-0026	train-other-500	It is a deep laid scheme and escaping in the airship is part of it I am sorry mister Swift that I have to believe your son and his accomplice guilty but I am obliged to Chief you had better send out a general alarm The airship ought to be easy to trace
7327-93283-0027	train-other-500	I ll telegraph at once said the official And you believe my son guilty solely on the testimony of these two boys who as is well known are his enemies asked mister Swift The clue they gave us is certainly most important said the president
7327-93283-0028	train-other-500	Andy came to us and told what he had seen as soon as it became known that the bank had been robbed
none	none	 And I m going to get the reward for giving information of the robbers too cried the bully I m going to have my share insisted Sam 
7327-93283-0029	train-other-500	Ah then there is a reward offered inquired mister Swift Five thousand dollars answered mister Pendergast
none	none	 The directors all of whom are present save mister Foger Andy s father 
7327-93283-0030	train-other-500	met early this morning and decided to offer that sum And I m going to get it announced the red haired lad again mister Swift was much downcast There seemed to be nothing more to say and being a man unversed in the ways of the world he did not know what to do
7327-93283-0031	train-other-500	He returned hone When missus Baggert was made acquainted with the news she waxed indignant Our Tom a thief she cried
7327-93283-0032	train-other-500	Why don t they accuse me and mister Jackson and you The idea You ought to hire a lawyer mister Swift and prosecute those men for slander Do you think it would be a good plan I certainly do Why they have no evidence at all
none	none	 What does that mean sneaking Andy Foger amount to 
7327-93283-0033	train-other-500	Get a lawyer and have Tom s interests looked after mister Swift glad to have someone share the responsibility with felt somewhat better when a well known Shopton attorney assured him that the evidence against Tom was of such a flimsy character
7327-93283-0034	train-other-500	that it would scarcely hold in a court of justice But they have warrants for him and mister Damon declared the inventor Very true but it is easy to swear out a warrant against any one It s a different matter to prove a person guilty But they can arrest my son
none	none	 Yes if they catch him However we can soon have him released on bail 
7327-93283-0035	train-other-500	It s disgraceful said missus Baggert Not at all my dear madam not at all Good and innocent persons have been arrested They are going to send out a general alarm for my son bewailed mister Swift
none	none	 Yes but I fancy it will be some time before they catch him and mister Damon if the airship holds together 
7327-93283-0036	train-other-500	I can t think of a better way to keep out of the clutches of the police and their silly charge chuckled the lawyer Now don t worry mister Swift It will all come out right
7327-93283-0037	train-other-500	The inventor tried to believe so but though he knew his son was innocent it was rather hard to see within the next few days big posters on all the vacant walls and fences
none	none	 offering a reward of five thousand dollars for the arrest of Tom Swift and Wakefield Damon who were charged with having flown away in an airship with seventy five thousand dollars of the bank s money 
7327-93283-0038	train-other-500	I guess Tom Swift will wish he d been more decent to me when I collect that money for his arrest said Andy to his crony Sam the day the bills were posted Yes but I get my share don t I asked Sam
none	none	 Sure answered the bully I 
7327-93283-0039	train-other-500	wish they d hurry up and arrest him Within the next few days the country was covered with posters telling of the robbery and the reward and police officials in cities large and small and in towns and villages
7327-93283-0040	train-other-500	were notified by telegraph to arrest and capture at any cost the occupants of a certain large red airship mister Swift on the advice of his lawyer sent several telegrams to Tom apprising him of what had happened
none	none	 The telegraph company was asked to rush the telegrams to the first city when word came in that the Red Cloud had landed Chapter fifteen Fired Upon Tom s excited call to the aeronaut telling of the mishap to mister Damon was answered immediately mister Sharp jumped forward from the motor compartment and passing on his way the electric switch he yanked it out stopping the machinery and the great propellers Then he leaped out on the platform But something else happened Just before the accident to the eccentric man desiring to give a further test to the planes the gas had been shut off making the airship an aeroplane instead of a dirigible balloon Consequently as soon as the forward motion ceased the great ship began falling We re sinking We re sinking cried Tom forgetting for a moment that he was not in his motor boat Slant your rudder up and glide downward as slowly as you can directed mister Sharp I ll start the engine again as soon as I rescue him for it was risky to venture out on the platform with the propeller whirring as the dangling piece of scarf might whip around the balloonist and toss him off mister Sharp was soon at mister Damon s side He saw that the man was unconscious whether from fright or some injury could not then be determined There was however no sign of a wound It was no easy task to carry half dragging it the heavy body of mister Damon off the platform but the aeronaut was a muscular individual and long hanging from a trapeze at great heights stood him in good stead He brought the unconscious man into the cabin and then quickly returning to the platform he detached the piece of scarf from the propeller blade Next he started the motor and also turned on the gas tank so that the airship in a few minutes could float in space without motion You needn t steer now Tom said the balloonist Just give me a hand here Is is he dead inquired the lad his voice faltering No his heart s beating I can t understand what happened mister Sharp was something of a rough and ready surgeon and doctor and a small box of medicines had been brought along in case of emergencies With the Red Cloud now lazily floating in the air for once the falling motion had been checked by the engine the motor had been stopped again mister Sharp set about restoring mister Damon to consciousness It was not long before the man opened his eyes The color that had left his cheeks came back and after a drink of cold water he was able to sit up Did I fall he asked Bless my very existence but did I tumble off the airship No indeed replied Tom though you came pretty near it How do you feel Were you hurt Oh I m all right now just a trifle dizzy But I thought sure I was a goner when I fell over the platform railing and mister Damon could not repress a shudder mister Sharp administered some more medicine and his patient was soon able to stand and move about How did it happen inquired the balloonist I hardly know answered mister Damon I was out on the platform looking at the view and thinking how much better my neuralgia was with the scarf on Suddenly the wind whipped loose one end of the scarf and before I knew it the cloth had caught on the propeller blade I was blown or drawn to one side tossed against the railing which I managed to grab and then I lost my senses It s a good thing I wasn t whirled around the propeller It s a good thing you weren t tossed down to the earth commented Tom shivering as he thought of his friend s narrow escape I became unconscious partly because the wind was knocked from me as I hit the platform railing went on mister Damon and partly from fright I think But I m all right now and I m not going out on that platform again with a loose scarf on I wouldn t go out at all again if I were you though of course I m used to dizzy heights spoke mister Sharp Oh I m not so easily frightened declared mister Damon If I m going to be a balloonist or an aeroplanist I ve got to get used to certain things I m all right now and the plucky man was for the blow to his side did not amount to much It was some time however before Tom got over the fright his friend had caused him They spent that night moving slowly south and in the morning found they had covered about a hundred miles not having run the ship to anything like its maximum speed Breakfast was served above the clouds for a change mister Damon finding that he could stand the great height with comfort It was three days after the start and the travelers were proceeding slowly along They were totally unaware of course of the sensation which their leaving conjointly with the bank robbery had caused not only in Shopton but in other places We re over a good sized city announced Tom on the noon of the third day Suppose we drop down and leave some message Dad will be anxious to hear from us Good idea commented mister Sharp Down it is Shift the rudder Tom proceeded to do so and while mister Damon relieved him at the wheel the young inventor prepared a message to his father It was placed in a weighted envelope together with a sum of money and the person picking it up was requested to send the letter as a telegram retaining some money for his trouble As the ship got lower and lower over the city the usual crowds could be seen congregating in the streets pointing and gazing upward We re creating quite a stir observed Tom More than usual it seems added mister Sharp peering down I declare there seems to be a police parade under way That s right put in mister Damon for looking down a squad of uniformed officers some on horseback could be seen hurrying along the main street trying to keep pace with the airship which was moving slowly They re looking at us through telescopes called Tom Guess they never saw a balloon down this way Nearer and nearer to the city dropped the Red Cloud Tom was about to let go the weighted envelope when from the midst of the police came several puffs of white smoke It was followed by vicious zipping sounds about the cabin of the ship the windows of which were open Then came the reports of several rifles They re firing at us yelled Tom So they are cried mister Sharp They must be crazy Can t they see that we re not a bird Maybe they take us for a war balloon suggested mister Damon Another volley was directed at the airship and several bullets struck the big aluminum gas holder glancing blows Here Quit that yelled Tom leaning out of the window Are you crazy You ll damage us They can t hear you called mister Sharp A third volley was fired and this time several persons other than police officers seemed to be shooting at the airship Revolvers as well as rifles were being used We re got to get out of this shouted mister Sharp as a bullet sang uncomfortably close to his head I can t imagine what s gotten into the people Send her up Tom The lad quickly shifted the elevation rudder and the Red Cloud sailed majestically aloft The young inventor had not dropped his message concluding that citizens who would fire on travelers of the air for no reason would not be likely to accommodate them in the matter of sending messages The craft mounted rapidly upward but before it was beyond rifle shot another volley was fired one bullet sending some splinters flying from the wooden framework Whew That was a narrow escape exclaimed mister Sharp What in the world can those people be up to anyhow Chapter sixteen Over a Fiery Furnace Down below the aeronauts could see the crowd led by the police scurrying to and fro Many individuals beside the officers appeared to be holding weapons and from the puffs of smoke that spurted out it was evident that more shots were being fired But the bullets could do no harm and the Red Cloud under the force of the rapidly revolving propellers was soon beyond the center of the city Well if that isn t the limit cried Tom They must have taken us for a German war balloon about to drop explosives on them Bless my liver ejaculated mister Damon I believe you re right Eh mister Sharp The veteran balloonist took a careful look over the craft before replying Then he spoke It couldn t be that and he shook his head as if puzzled They would know no foreign airship would try any trick like that Beside if by some remote possibility they did imagine it there would be soldiers shooting at us instead of the police As it was the whole population seemed anxious to bring us down And they nearly did added mister Damon If they had shot a few holes in the gas bag where would we be Right in the air answered the balloonist It would take several volleys of bullets to damage our aluminum container It is in sections and when one or even five compartments for that matter are pierced there is enough gas in the others to sustain us So they could not have damaged us much even if they had shot a lot of holes in us Even without the gas container we can keep afloat by constantly moving for the planes will serve their purpose Of course they could damage us and maybe put some of our machinery out of business and that would be a serious thing But what puzzles me is why they fired at us at all It couldn t be out of pure mischief could it asked the young inventor Hardly If we were in a savage country I could understand the natives firing at some such object as this airship but the people of that city must have known what our craft was They probably have read something about it in the news papers and to deliberately fire on us with the chance of disabling us seems worse than barbarous Well we won t give em another opportunity commented mister Damon No indeed not this city but who knows but what the example may spread We may be fired at the next town we sail over Then steer clear of the towns advised Tom Impossible We must pass over some but I d like to solve this mystery The day passed without further incident though they did not go low enough down over any city to drop any messages It was decided that it would not be safe We ll take a chance at night suggested Tom and that evening approaching a good sized town in the dusk several of the weighted envelopes were dropped overboard Doubtless persons walking along the street who were startled by hearing something fall with a thud at their feet were much startled to look up and see dimly a great ghostly shape moving in the air But there was no shooting and eventually some of the messages reached mister Swift in Shopton But he could not answer them for the airship kept on the move The night was spent floating in the air with the engine stopped and the Red Cloud floating lazily this way and that as the gentle winds shifted for it was calm The anchorage if such it may be called was above a sparsely settled part of the country and if the lights of the airship were seen from below the farmers doubtless took them for some new stars or possibly a comet Now then for a fast straight run cried Tom after breakfast had been served and the big motor with its twenty cylinders started We ll be able to make the turn to day and then make for home won t we mister Sharp Well we could do it Tom was the answer but I like this mode of traveling so that I think I ll lengthen the voyage Instead of turning at Atlanta what do you say to making for Key West and then starting back That will be something of a trip The Red Cloud is behaving much better than I hoped she would I m willing to go further if mister Damon is Oh bless my shoe strings I m game exclaimed the eccentric man I always did want to go to Key West anyhow The craft was speeding along at a fast clip and dinner that day was served about three miles in the air Then desiring to test the gliding abilities of the airship it was sent down on a long slant with the propellers stationary the shifting planes and rudders alone guiding it As the craft fairly slid down out of the sky like a sled on a bank of fleecy snow Tom who was peering ahead with his hand on the steering wheel cried out I say It looks as if we were going to run into a thunder storm How s that inquired mister Sharp poking his head from the motor compartment He says there s a big storm ahead repeated mister Damon and I guess he s right I see a big bank of dark clouds and there is a roaring in the air mister Sharp who had been making some adjustments to the motor went forward to take a look The Red Cloud was swiftly gliding downward on a slant straight toward a dark mass of vapor that seemed to be rolling first one way and then another while as mister Damon had said there was a low rumbling proceeding from it That doesn t seem to be a thunder storm spoke the balloonist with a puzzled air They all regarded the dark mass of vapor intently for a few seconds Tom had brought the airship to a more level keel and it was now spinning along under its own momentum like a flat piece of tin scaled by some lead But it was headed for the clouds if such they were though losing speed by degrees I ll have to start the motor exclaimed mister Sharp We don t want to run into a storm if we can help it though I don t ever remember seeing a thunder disturbance like that Whew It s getting warm suddenly announced the youth and he let go of the steering wheel for a moment while he took off his coat That s what it is agreed mister Damon who also divested himself of his garments Bless my spark plug but it s like a July day No wonder there s a thunderstorm ahead Then mister Sharp uttered a cry That s no storm he fairly shouted It s a big forest fire That s smoke we see We must get out of this Turn around Tom while I start the engine We must rise above it He fairly leaped for the motor and Tom and mister Damon could hear him turning the levers and wheels ready to start But before the explosions came something happened There was a sound as of some great siren whistle blowing and then with a howl of the on rushing air the Red Cloud the propellers of which hung motionless on their shafts was fairly sucked forward toward the fire as the current sucks a boat over a water fall Start the motor Start the motor mister Sharp cried Tom I m trying to but something seems to be the matter We re being drawn right over the fire yelled mister Damon It s getting hotter every minute Can t you do something You take the wheel called the balloonist to mister Damon Steer around just as if it was an auto when we start the engine Tom come here and give me a hand The motor has jammed The young inventor sprang to obey mister Damon his face showing some of the fear he felt grasped the steering wheel The airship was now about a quarter of a mile high but instead of resting motionless in the air sustained by the gas in the container she was being pulled forward right toward the heart of the mass of black vapor which it could now be seen was streaked with bright tongues of flame What s making us go ahead if the motor isn t going asked Tom as he bent over the machine at which the aeronaut was laboring Suction draught from the fire explained mister Sharp Heated air rises and leaves a vacuum The cold air rushes in It s carrying us with it We ll be right in the fire in a few minutes if we can t get started with this motor I don t see what ails it Can t we steer to one side as it is No We re right in a powerful current of air and steering won t do any good until we have some motion of our own Turn the gasolene lever on a little more and see if you can get a spark Tom did so but no explosion resulted The twenty cylinders of the big engine remained mute The airship meanwhile was gathering speed sucked onward and downward as it was by the draught from the fire The roaring was plainer now and the crackling of the flames could be heard plainly The heat too grew more intense Frantically Tom and mister Sharp labored over the motor With the perverseness usual to gas engines it had refused to work at a critical moment What shall I do cried mister Damon from his position in the pilot house We seem to be heading right for the midst of it Slant the elevation rudder called Tom Send the ship up It will be cooler the higher we go Maybe we can float over it You d better go out there advised mister Sharp I ll keep at this motor Go up as high as you can Turn on more gas That will elevate us but maybe not quick enough The gas doesn t generate well in great heat I m afraid we re in for it he added grimly Tom sprang to relieve mister Damon The heat was now intense Nearer and nearer came the Red Cloud to the blazing forest which seemed to cover several square miles Great masses of smoke with huge pieces of charred and blazing wood carried up by the great draught circled around the ship The Red Cloud was being pulled into the midst of the fire by the strong suction Tom yanked over the elevation rudder and the nose of the craft pointed upward But it still moved downward and a moment later the travelers of the air felt as if they were over a fiery furnace Chapter seventeen Wanted For Robbery Choking and gasping for breath feeling as if they could not stand the intense heat more than a moment longer the young inventor and his companions looked at each other Death seemed ready to reach out and grasp them The mass of heated air was so powerful that it swung and tossed the Red Cloud about as if it were a wisp of paper We must do something cried mister Damon beginning to take off his collar and vest I m choking Lie down in the bottom of the car suggested mister Sharp The smoke won t trouble you so much there The eccentric man too startled now to use any of his blessing expressions did so Can t you start the motor asked Tom frantically as he stuck to his post with his hand on the steering wheel the elevation lever jammed back as far as it would go I ve done my best answered the balloonist gasping as he swallowed some smoke I m afraid afraid it s all up with us We should have steered clear of this from the first My how it roars The crackling and snapping of the flames below them as they fed on the dry wood which no rain had wet for weeks was like the rush of some great cataract Up swirled the dark smoke clouds growing hotter and hotter all the while as the craft came nearer and nearer to the center of the conflagration We must rise higher cried Tom It s our only chance Turn on the gas machine full power and fill the container That will carry us up Yes it s our only hope muttered mister Sharp We must go up but the trouble is the gas doesn t generate so fast when there s too much heat We re bound to have to stay over this fiery pit for some time yet We re going up a little spoke Tom hopefully as he glanced at a gauge near him We re fifteen hundred feet now and we were only twelve a while ago Good Keep the elevation rudder as it is and I ll see what I can do with the gas advised the balloonist It s our only hope and he hurried into the engine room which like the other parts of the cabin was now murky with choking vapor and soot Suddenly the elevation gauge showed that they were falling The airship was going down What s the matter called mister Damon from the cabin floor I don t know answered Tom unless the rudder has broken He peered through the haze No the big elevation rudder was still in place but it seemed to have no effect on the shim It s a down draught cried mister Sharp We re being sucked down It won t last but a few seconds I ve been in em before He seemed to have guessed rightly for the next instant the airship was shooting upward again and relief came to the aeronauts though it was not much for the heat was almost unbearable and they had taken off nearly all their clothing Lighten ship sung out mister Sharp Toss over all the things you think we can spare Tom Some of the cases of provisions we can get more if we need em We must rise and the gas isn t generating fast enough There was no need for the young inventor at the steering wheel now for the craft simply could not be guided It was swirled about now this way now that by the currents of heated air At times it would rise a considerable distance only to be pulled down again and just before Tom began to toss overboard some boxes of food it seemed that the end had come for the craft went down so low that the upward leaping tongues of flame almost reached the lower frame I ll help you gasped mister Damon and while he and Tom tossed from the cabin windows some of their stores mister Sharp was frantically endeavoring to make the gas generate faster It was slow work but with the lightening of the ship their situation improved Slowly so slowly that it seemed an age the elevation pointer went higher and higher on the dial Sixteen hundred feet sung out Tom pausing for a look at the gauge That s the best yet The heat was felt less now and every minute was improving their situation Slowly the hand moved The gas was being made in larger quantities now that the heat was less Ten minutes more of agony and their danger was over They were still above the burning area but sufficiently high so that only stray wisps of smoke enveloped them Whew But that was the worst ever cried Tom as he sank exhausted on a bench and wiped his perspiring face We sure were in a bad way I should say so agreed mister Sharp And if we don t get a breeze we may have to stay here for some time Why can t you get that motor to work yet asked mister Damon Bless my gaiters but I m all in as the boys say I ll have another try at the machine now replied mister Sharp Probably it will work now after we re out of danger without the aid of it His guess proved correct for in a few minutes with the aid of Tom the motor started the propellers revolved and the Red Cloud was sent swiftly out of the fire zone Now we d better take account of ourselves our provisions and the ship said mister Sharp when they had flown about twenty miles and were much refreshed by the cooler atmosphere I don t believe the craft is damaged any except some of the braces may be warped by the heat As for the provisions you threw over a lot didn t you Tom Well I had to Yes I guess you did Well we ll make a landing Do you think it will be safe asked mister Damon anxiously We might be fired upon again Oh there s no danger of that But I ll take precautions I don t want a big crowd around when we come down so we ll pick out a secluded place and land just at dusk Then in the morning we can look over the ship and go to the nearest town to buy provisions After that we can continue our journey and we ll steer clear of forest fires after this And people who shoot at us added mister Damon Yes I wish I knew what that was done for and once again came that puzzled look to the face of the balloonist The airship gently descended that evening in a large level field a good landing being made Just before the descent Tom took an observation and located about two miles from the spot they selected for an anchorage a good sized village We can get provisions there he announced Yes but we must not let it be known what they are for said mister Sharp or we ll have the whole population out here I think this will be a good plan Tom you and mister Damon go into town and buy the things we need I ll stay here with the airship and look it all over You can arrange to have the stuff carted out here in the morning and left at a point say about a quarter of a mile away Then we can carry it to the ship In that way no one will discover us and we ll not be bothered with curiosity seekers This was voted a good idea and when the landing had been made and a hasty examination showed that the ship had suffered no great damage from the passage over the fire the young inventor and mister Damon started off They soon found a good road leading to town and tramped along it in the early evening The few persons they met paid little attention to them save to bow in a friendly fashion and occasionally wish them good evening I wonder where we are asked Tom as they hurried along In some southern town to judge by the voices of the people and the number of colored individuals we ve met answered mister Damon Let s ask suggested Tom No if you do they ll know we re strangers and they may ask a lot of questions Oh I guess if it s a small place they ll know we re strangers soon enough commented Tom But when we get to the village itself we can read the name on the store windows A few minutes later found them in the midst of a typical southern town It was Berneau North Carolina according to the signs they saw Here s a restaurant called Tom as they passed a neat appearing one Let s go inside and get some supper before we buy our supplies Good exclaimed mister Damon Bless my flapjacks but I am beginning to feel hungry The eating place was a good one and Tom s predictions about their being taken for strangers was verified for no sooner had they given their orders than the pretty white girl who waited on the table remarked Ah reckon yo all are from th no th aren t yo She smiled as she spoke and Tom smiled back as he acknowledged it Have you a paper a newspaper I could look at he asked Ah guess Ah can find one went on the girl Ah reckon yo all are from N York N Yorkers are so desperant bent on readin th news Her tones were almost like those of a colored person Yes we re from a part of New York was Tom s reply When a newspaper was brought to him after they had nearly finished their meal the young inventor rapidly scanned the pages Something on the front sheet under a heading of big black type caught his eye He started as he read it WANTED FOR ROBBERY BANK LOOTERS ESCAPE IN RED AIRSHIP FIRED AT BUT DISAPPEAR Great Jehosophat exclaimed Tom in a low voice What on earth can this mean What inquired mister Damon Has anything happened Happened I should say there had was the answer Why we re accused of having robbed the Shopton Bank of seventy five thousand dollars the night before we left and to have taken it away in the Red Cloud There s a general alarm out for us Why this is awful It s preposterous burst out mister Damon I ll have my lawyers sue this paper Bless my stocks and bonds I Hush Not so loud cautioned Tom for the pretty waitress was watching them curiously Here read this and then we ll decide what to do But one thing is certain we must go back to Shopton at once to clear ourselves of this accusation Ha murmured mister Damon as he read the article rapidly Now I know why they fired at us They hoped to bring us down capture us and get the five thousand dollars reward Chapter eighteen Back For Vindication Tom glanced around the restaurant There were few persons in it save himself and mister Damon The pretty waitress was still regarding the two curiously We ought to take that paper along with us to show to mister Sharp said Tom in a low voice to his friend I haven t had time to take it all in myself yet Let s go I ve had enough to eat haven t you Yes My appetite is gone now As they arose to pay their checks the girl advanced Can you tell me where I can get a copy of this paper asked Tom as he laid down a generous tip on the table for the girl Her eyes opened rather wide Yo all are fo gettin some of yo money she said in her broad southern tones Tom thought her the prettiest girl he ever seen excepting Mary Nestor Oh that s for you replied the young inventor It s a tip Aren t you in the habit of getting them down here Not very often Thank yo all But what did yo all ask about that paper I asked where I could get a copy of it There is something in it that interests me Yes an Ah reckon Ah knows what it is exclaimed the girl It s about that airship with th robbers in it How do you know inquired Tom quickly and he tried to seem cool though he felt the hot blood mounting to his cheeks Oh Ah saw yo all readin it Everybody down heah is crazy about it We all think th ship is comin down this way cause it says th robbers was intendin to start south befo they robbed th bank Ah wish Ah could collect thet five thousand dollars If Ah could see that airship I wouldn t work no mo in this eatin place What do yo all reckon thet airship looks like and the girl gazed intently at Tom and mister Damon Why bless my began the eccentric man but Tom broke in hurriedly Oh I guess it looks like most any other airship for he feared that if his companion used any of his odd expressions he might be recognized since our hero had not had time to read the article in the paper through and was not sure whether or not a description of himself mister Damon and mister Sharp was given Well Ah suah wish I could collect thet reward went on the girl Everybody is on th lookout Yo all ain t see th airship have yo all Where can we get a paper like this asked Tom again not wanting to answer such a leading question Why yo all is suah welcome to that one was the reply Ah guess Ah can affo d to give it to yo all after th generous way yo all behaved to me Take it an welcome But are yo all suah yo are done eatin Yo all left lots Oh we had enough replied Tom hurriedly His sole aim now was to get away to consult with mister Sharp and he needed the paper to learn further details of the astonishing news He and his friends accused of looting the bank and taking away seventy five thousand dollars in the airship It was incredible A reward of five thousand dollars offered for their capture They might be arrested any minute yet they could not go on without buying some provisions What were they to do Once outside the restaurant mister Damon and Tom walked swiftly on They came to a corner where there was a street lamp and there the young inventor paused to scan the paper again It was the copy of a journal published in the nearby county seat and contained quite a full account of the affair The story was told of how the bank had been broken into the vault rifled and the money taken The first clue it said was given by a youth named Andy Foger who had seen a former acquaintance hanging around the bank with burglar tools Tom recognized the description of himself as the former acquaintance but he could not understand the rest Burglar tools I wonder how Andy could say that he asked mister Damon Wait until we get back and we ll ask John Sharp suggested his companion This is very strange I am going to sue some one for spreading false reports about me Bless my ledgers why I have money on deposit in that bank To think that I would rob it Poor dad murmured Tom This must be hard for him But what about ordering food Maybe if we buy any they will trail us find the airship and capture it I don t want to be arrested even if I am innocent and I certainly don t want the airship to fall into the hands of the police They might damage it We must go see mister Sharp declared mister Damon and back to where the Red Cloud was concealed they went To say that the balloonist was astonished is putting it mildly He was even more excited than was mister Damon Wait until I get hold of that Andy Foger he cried I ll make him sweat for this I see he s already laid claim to the reward he added reading further along in the article He thinks he has put the police on our trail So he seems to have done added Tom The whole country has been notified to look out for us the paper says We re likely to be fired upon whenever we pass over a city or a town Then we ll have to avoid them declared the balloonist But we must go back declared Tom Of course Back to be vindicated We ll have to give up our trip My my But this is a surprise I don t see what makes Andy say he saw me with burglar tools commented Tom with a puzzled air mister Sharp thought for a moment Then he exclaimed It was that bag of tools I sent you after the long wrenches the pliers and the brace and bits You Of course cried Tom I remember now The bag dropped and opened and Andy and Sam saw the tools But the idea of taking them for burglar tools Well I suppose the burglars whoever they were did use tools similar to those to break open the vault put in mister Damon Andy probably thought he was a smart lad to put the police on our track I ll put him on the track when I return declared mister Sharp Well now what s to be done We ve got to have food suggested Tom Yes but I think we can manage that I ve been looking over the ship as best I could in the dark It seems to be all right We can start early in the morning without anyone around here knowing we paid their town a visit You and mister Damon go back to town Tom and order some stuff Have the man leave it by the roadside early to morrow morning Tell him it s for some travelers who will stop and pick it up Pay him well and tell him to keep quiet as it s for a racing party That s true enough We re going to race home to vindicate our reputations I think that will be all right The man may get suspicious said mister Damon I hope not answered the balloonist We ve got to take a chance anyhow The plan worked well however the store keeper promising to have the supplies on hand at the time and place mentioned He winked as Tom asked him to keep quiet about it Oh I know yo automobile fellers he said with a laugh You want to get some grub on the fly so you won t have to stop an can beat th other fellow I know you fer I see them automobile goggles stickin out of your pocket Tom and mister Damon each had a pair to use when the wind was strong but the young inventor had forgotten about his They now served him a good turn for they turned the thoughts of the storekeeper into a new channel The lad let it go at that and paying for such things as he and mister Damon could not carry left the store The aeronauts passed an uneasy night They raised their ship high in the air anchoring it by a rope fast to a big tree and they turned on no lights for they did not want to betray their position They descended before it was yet daylight and a little later hurried to the place where the provisions were left They found their supplies safely on hand and carrying them into the airship prepared to turn back to Shopton As the ship rose high in the air a crowd of negro laborers passing through a distant field saw it At once they raised a commotion shouting and pointing to the wonderful sight We re discovered cried Tom No matter answered mister Sharp We ll soon be out of sight and we ll fly high the rest of this trip Tom looked down on the fast disappearing little hamlet and he thought of the pretty girl in the restaurant Chapter nineteen Wrecked With her nose headed north the Red Cloud swung along through the air Those on board were thinking of many things but chief among them was the unjust accusation that had been made against them by an irresponsible boy the red haired Andy Foger They read the account in the paper again seeking to learn from it new things at each perusal It s just a lot of circumstantial evidence that s what it is said Tom I admit it might look suspicious to anyone who didn t know us but Andy Foger has certainly done the most mischief by his conclusions Burglar tools The idea I think I shall sue the bank for damages declared mister Damon They have injured my reputation by making this accusation against me Anyhow I ll certainly never do any more business with them and I ll withdraw my ten thousand dollars deposit as soon as we get back mister Sharp doesn t seem to be accused of doing anything at all remarked Tom reading the article for perhaps the tenth time Oh I guess I m a sort of general all around bad man who helped you burglars to escape with the booty answered the balloonist with a laugh I expect to be arrested along with you two But must we be arrested inquired Tom anxiously I don t like that idea at all We haven t done anything This is my plan went on mister Sharp We ll get back to Shopton as quickly as we can We ll arrive at night so no one will see us and leaving the airship in some secluded spot we ll go to the police and explain matters We can easily prove that we had nothing to do with the robbery Why we were all home the night it happened mister Swift mister Jackson and missus Baggert can testify to that Yes agreed mister Damon I guess they can Bless my bank book but that seems a good plan We ll follow it Proceeding on the plan which they had decided was the best one the Red Cloud was sent high into the air So high up was it that at times it was above the clouds Though this caused some little discomfort at first especially to mister Damon he soon became used to it as did the others And it had the advantage of concealing them from the persons below who might be on the lookout For we don t want to be shot at again explained mister Sharp It isn t altogether healthy and not very safe If we keep high up they can t see us much less shoot at us They ll take us for some big bird Then too we can go faster I suppose there will be another alarm sent out from those negroes having sighted us ventured Tom Oh yes but those colored fellows were so excited they may describe us as having horns hoofs and a tail and their story may not be believed I m not worrying about them My chief concern is to drive the Red Cloud for all she is worth I want to explain some things back there in Shopton As if repenting of the way it had misbehaved over the forest fire the airship was now swinging along at a rapid rate Seated in the cabin the travelers would have really enjoyed the return trip had it not been for the accusation hanging over them The weather was fine and clear and as they skimmed along now and then coming out from the clouds they caught glimpses below them of the earth above which they were traveling They had a general idea of their location from knowing the town where the paper had given them such astounding news and it was easy to calculate their rate of progress After running about a hundred miles or so at high speed mister Sharp found it necessary to slow down the motor as some of the new bearings were heating Still this gave them no alarm as they were making good time They came to a stop that night and calculated that by the next evening or two at the latest they would be back in Shopton But they did not calculate on an accident One of the cylinders on the big motor cracked as they started up next morning and for some hours they had to hang in the air suspended by the gas in the container while mister Sharp and Tom took out the damaged part and put in a spare one the cylinders being cast separately It was dusk when they finished and too late to start up so they remained about in the same place until the next day Morning dawned with a hot humidness unusual at that time of the year but partly accounted for by the fact that they were still within the influence of the southern climate With a whizz the big propellers were set in motion and with Tom at the wheel the ship being about three miles in the air to which height it had risen after the repairs were made the journey was recommenced It s cooler up here than down below remarked Tom as he shifted the wheel and rudder a bit in response to a gust of wind that heeled the craft over Yes I think we re going to have a storm remarked mister Sharp eyeing the clouds with a professional air We may run ahead of it or right into it We ll go down a bit toward night when there s less danger of being shot So far on their return trip they had not been low enough in the day time to be in any danger from persons who hoped to earn the five thousand dollars reward The afternoon passed quickly and it got dark early There was a curious hum to the wind and hearing it mister Sharp began to go about the ship seeing that everything was fast and taut We re going to have a blow he remarked and a heavy one too We ll have to make everything snug and be ready to go up or down as the case calls for Up or down inquired mister Damon Yes By rising we may escape the blow or by going below the strata of agitated air we may escape it How about rain Well you can get above rain but you can t get below it with the law of gravitation working as it does at present How s the gas generator Tom Seems to be all right replied the young inventor who had relinquished the wheel to the balloonist They ate an early supper and hardly had the dishes been put away when from the west where there was a low flying bank of clouds there came a mutter of thunder A little later there was a dull red illumination amid the rolling masses of vapor There s the storm and she s heading right this way commented mister Sharp Can t you avoid it asked mister Damon anxiously I could if I knew how high it was but I guess we ll wait and see how it looks as we get closer The airship was flying on and the storm driven by a mighty wind was rushing to meet it Already there was a sighing moaning sound in the wire and wooden braces of the Red Cloud Suddenly there came such a blast that it heeled the ship over on her side Shift the equilibrium rudders shouted mister Sharp to Tom turning the wheel and various levers over to the lad I m going to get more speed out of the motor Tom acted just in time and after bobbing about like a cork on the water the ship was righted and sent forging ahead under the influence of the propellers worked at top speed Nor was this any too much for it needed all the power of the big engine to even partially overcome the force of the wind that was blowing right against the Red Cloud Of course they might have turned and flown before it but they wanted to go north not south they wanted to face their accusers Then after the first fury of the blast had spent itself there came a deluge of rain following a dazzling glare of lightning and a bursting crash of thunder In spite of the gale buffeting her the airship was making good progress The skill of Tom and the balloonist was never shown to better advantage All around them the storm raged but through it the craft kept on her way Nothing could be seen but pelting sheets of water and swirling mist yet onward the ship was driven The thunder was deafening and the lightning nearly blinded them until the electrics were switched on flooding the cabin with radiance Inside the car they were snug and dry though the pitching of the craft was like that of a big liner in the trough of the ocean waves Will she weather it do you think called mister Damon in the ear of mister Sharp shouting so as to be heard above the noise of the elements and the hum of the motor The balloonist nodded She s a good ship he answered proudly Hardly had he spoken when there came a crash louder than any that had preceded and the flash of rosy light that accompanied it seemed to set the whole heavens on fire At the same time there was violent shock to the ship We re hit Struck by lightning yelled Tom We re falling cried mister Damon an instant later mister Sharp looked at the elevation gauge The hand was slowly swinging around Down down dropped the Red Cloud She was being roughly treated by the storm I m afraid we re wrecked said the balloonist in a low voice scarcely audible above the roar of the tempest Following the great crash had come a comparatively light bombardment from the sky artillery Use the gliding rudder Tom called mister Sharp a moment later We may fall but we ll land as easily as possible The wind the rain the lightning and thunder continued Down down sank the ship Its fall was somewhat checked by the rudder Tom swung into place and by setting the planes at a different angle The motor had been stopped and the propellers no longer revolved In the confusion and darkness it was not safe to run ahead with the danger of colliding with unseen objects on the earth They tried to peer from the windows but could see nothing A moment later as they stared at each other with fear in their eyes there came a shock The ship trembled from end to end We ve landed cried Tom as he yanked back on the levers The airship came to a stop Now to see where we are said mister Sharp grimly and how badly we are wrecked 
7327-93289-0000	train-other-500	Chapter twenty Tom Gets A Clue Out of the cabin of the now stationary airship hurried the three travelers out into the pelting rain which was lashed into their faces by the strong wind Tom was the first to emerge
7327-93289-0001	train-other-500	We re on something solid he cried stamping his feet A rock I guess
none	none	 Gracious I hope we re not on a rock in the midst of a river exclaimed mister Damon 
7327-93289-0002	train-other-500	Bless my soul though The water does seem to be running around my ankles
none	none	 There s enough rain to make water run almost up to our necks called mister Sharp above the noise of the storm 
7327-93289-0003	train-other-500	Tom can you make out where we are Not exactly Is the ship all right
none	none	 I can t see very well but there appears to be a hole in the gas container A big one too or we wouldn t have fallen so quickly 
7327-93289-0004	train-other-500	The plight of the travelers of the air was anything but enviable They were wet through for it needed only a few minutes exposure to the pelting storm to bring this about
none	none	 They could not tell in the midst of the darkness where they were and they almost feared to move for fear they might be on top of some rock or precipice 
7327-93289-0005	train-other-500	over which they might tumble if they took a false step
none	none	 Let s get back inside the ship proposed mister Damon 
7327-93289-0006	train-other-500	It s warm and dry there at all events Bless my umbrella I don t know when I ve been so wet
none	none	 I m not going in until I find out where we are declared Tom Wait a minute and I ll go in and get an electric flash lantern That will show us for the lightning had ceased with the great crash that seemed to have wrecked the Red Cloud The rain still kept up however and there was a distant muttering of thunder 
7327-93289-0007	train-other-500	while it was so black that had not the lights in the cabin of the airship been faintly glowing they could hardly have found the craft had they moved ten feet away from it Tom soon returned with the portable electric lamp operated by dry batteries
7327-93289-0008	train-other-500	He flashed it on the surface of where they were standing and uttered an exclamation We re on a roof he cried A roof repeated mister Damon Yes the roof of some large building and what you thought was a river is the rain water running off it See
none	none	 The young inventor held the light down so his companions could observe the surface 
7327-93289-0009	train-other-500	of that upon which the airship rested There was no doubt of it They were on top of a large building
none	none	 If we re on a roof we must be in the midst of a city objected mister Damon But I can t see any lights around and we would see them if we were in a city you know 
7327-93289-0010	train-other-500	Maybe the storm put the lights out of business suggested mister Sharp That often occurs
none	none	 I know one way we can find out for certain went on Tom 
7327-93289-0011	train-other-500	How Start up our search lamp and play it all around We can t make sure how large this roof is in the dark and it s risky trying to trace the edges by walking around Yes and it would be risky to start our searchlight going objected mister Sharp
7327-93289-0012	train-other-500	People would see it and there d be a crowd up here in less than no time storm or no storm No we ve got to keep dark until I can see what s the matter We must leave here before daylight Suppose we can t asked mister Damon
none	none	 The crowds will be sure to see us then anyhow I am pretty sure we can get away was the opinion of the balloonist 
7327-93289-0013	train-other-500	Even if our gas container is so damaged that it will not sustain us we are still an aeroplane and this roof being flat will make a good place to start from No we can leave as soon as this storm lets up a little
none	none	 Then I m going to have a look and find out what sort of a building this is declared Tom 
7327-93289-0014	train-other-500	and while mister Sharp began a survey as well as he could in the dark of the airship the young inventor proceeded cautiously to ascertain the extent of the roof The rain was not coming down quite so hard now and Tom found it easier to see
none	none	 mister Damon finding he could do nothing to help went back into the cabin blessing himself and his various possessions 
7327-93289-0015	train-other-500	at the queer predicament in which they found themselves Flashing his light every few seconds
none	none	 Tom walked on until he came to one edge of the roof It was very large as he could judge by the time it took him to traverse it There was a low parapet at the edge He peered over 
7327-93289-0016	train-other-500	and an expanse of dark wall met his eyes Must have come to one side he reasoned
none	none	 I want to get to the front 
7327-93289-0017	train-other-500	Then maybe I can see a sign that will tell me what I want to know The lad turned to the left and presently came to another parapet It was higher and ornamented with terra cotta bricks This evidently was the front
7327-93289-0018	train-other-500	As Tom peered over the edge of the little raised ledge there flashed out below him hundreds of electric lights
none	none	 The city illuminating plant was being repaired Then Tom saw flashing below him one of those large signs made of incandescent lights It was in front of the building 
7327-93289-0019	train-other-500	and as soon as our hero saw the words he knew where the airship had landed For what he read as he leaned over was this MIDDLEVILLE ARCADE Tom gave a cry What s the matter called mister Sharp
none	none	 I ve discovered something answered Tom hurrying up to his friend We re on top of the Middleville Arcade building What does that mean It means that we re not so very far from home and in the midst of a fairly large city But it means more than that What demanded the balloonist struck by an air of excitement about the lad for as Tom stood in the subdued glow of the lights from one of the airship s cabin windows all the others having been darkened as the storm slackened 
7327-93289-0020	train-other-500	his eyes shone brightly This is the building where Anson Morse one of the gang that robbed dad once had an office went on Tom eagerly That was brought out at the trial And it s the place where they used to do some of their conspiring
7327-93289-0021	train-other-500	Maybe some of the crowd are here now laying low
none	none	 Well if they are we don t want anything to do with that gang said mister Sharp 
7327-93289-0022	train-other-500	We can t arrest them Besides I ve found out that our ship is all right after all We can proceed as soon as we like
none	none	 There is only a small leak in the gas container It was the generator machine that was put out of business by the lightning and I ve repaired it I want to see if I can get any trace of the rascals Maybe I could learn something from the janitor of the Arcade about them The janitor is probably here But why do you want to get any information about that gang Because answered Tom and as mister Damon at that moment started to come from the cabin of the airship 
7327-93289-0023	train-other-500	the lad leaped forward and whispered the remainder of the sentence into the ear of the balloonist You don t mean it exclaimed mister Sharp in a tense whisper Tom nodded vigorously
none	none	 But how can you enter the building asked the other You can t drop over the edge Down the scuttle answered Tom There must be one on the roof for they have to come up here at times We can force the lock if necessary I want to enter the building and see where Morse had his office All right Go ahead I ll engage mister Damon here so he won t follow you It will be great news for him Go ahead Under pretense of wanting the help of the eccentric man in completing the repairs he had started mister Sharp took mister Damon back into the cabin Tom getting a big screwdriver from an outside toolbox approached the scuttle on the roof 
7327-93289-0024	train-other-500	He could see it looming up in the semidarkness a sort of box covering a stairway that led down into the building The door was locked but Tom forced it and felt justified A few minutes later
7327-93289-0025	train-other-500	cautiously flashing his light almost like a burglar he thought he was prowling around the corridors of the office structure Was it deserted That was what he wanted to know He knew the office Morse had formerly occupied was two floors from the top
7327-93289-0026	train-other-500	Tom descended the staircase trying to think up some excuse to offer in case he met the watchman or janitor But he encountered no one
none	none	 As he reached the floor where he knew Morse and his gang were wont to assemble he paused and listened At first he heard nothing 
7327-93289-0027	train-other-500	then as the sound of the storm became less he fancied he heard the murmur of voices
none	none	 Suppose it should be some of them whispered Tom He went forward 
7327-93289-0028	train-other-500	pausing at almost every other step to listen The voices became louder
none	none	 Tom was now nearly at the office where Morse had once had his quarters Now he could see it and his heart gave a 
7327-93289-0029	train-other-500	great thump as he noticed that the place was lighted The lad could read the name on the door Industrial Development Company That was the name of a fake concern headed by Morse As our hero looked he saw the shadows of two men thrown on the ground glass
none	none	 Some one s in there he whispered to himself He could now hear the voices much plainer They came from the room but the lad could not distinguish them as belonging to any of the gang with whom he had come in contact and who had escaped from jail 
7327-93289-0030	train-other-500	The low murmur went on for several seconds The listener could make out no words Suddenly the low even mumble was broken Some one cried out
7327-93289-0031	train-other-500	There s got to be a divvy soon There s no use letting Morse hold that whole seventy five thousand any longer I m going to get what s coming to me or Hush some one else cried Be quiet No I won t I want my share I ve waited long enough If I don t get what s coming to me inside of a week
none	none	 I ll go to Shagmon myself and make Morse whack up I helped on the job and I want my money Will you be quiet pleaded another and at that instant Tom heard some one s hand on the knob 
7327-93289-0032	train-other-500	The door opened a crack letting out a pencil of light The men were evidently coming out
none	none	 The young inventor did not wait to hear more He had a clue now and running on tiptoes he made his way to the staircase and out of the scuttle on the roof Chapter twenty one On The Trail What s the matter Tom asked mister Sharp as the lad came hurrying along the roof having taken the precaution to fasten the scuttle door as well as he could You seem excited So would you if you had heard what I did What You don t mean that some of the gang is down there Yes and what s more I m on the trail of the thieves who robbed the Shopton Bank of the seventy five thousand dollars No You don t mean it I certainly do Then we d better tell mister Damon He s in the cabin Of course I ll tell him He s as much concerned as I am He wants to be vindicated Isn t it great luck though But you haven t landed the men yet Do you mean to say that the same gang the Happy Harry crowd robbed the bank I think so from what I heard But come inside and I ll tell you all about it Suppose we start the ship first It s ready to run There wasn t as much the matter with it as I feared The storm is over now and we ll be safer up in the air than on this roof Did you get all the information you could All I dared to The men were coming out so I had to run They were quarreling and when that happens among thieves Why honest men get their dues everyone knows that proverb interrupted mister Damon again emerging from the cabin But bless my quotation marks I should think you d have something better to do than stand there talking proverbs We have replied mister Sharp quickly We re going to start the ship and then we have some news for you Tom you take the steering wheel and I ll start the gas machine We ll rise to some distance before starting the propellers and then we won t create any excitement But what news are you going to tell me asked mister Damon Bless my very existence but you get me all excited and then you won t gratify my curiosity In a little while we will responded mister Sharp Lively now Tom Some one may see this airship on top of the building as it s getting so much lighter now after the storm The outburst of the elements was almost over and Tom taking another look over the edge of the roof could see persons moving about in the street below The storm clouds were passing and a faint haze showed where a moon would soon make its appearance thus disclosing the craft so oddly perched upon the roof There was need of haste Fortunately the Red Cloud could be sent aloft without the use of the propellers for the gas would serve to lift her It had been found that lightning had struck the big red aluminum container but the shock had been a comparatively slight one and as the tank was insulated from the rest of the ship no danger resulted to the occupants A rent was made in two or three of the gas compartments but the others remained intact and when an increased pressure of the vapor was used the ship was almost as buoyant as before Into the cabin the three travelers hurried dripping water at every step for there was no time to change clothes Then with Tom and mister Sharp managing the machinery the craft slowly rose It was well that they had started for when a few hundred feet above the roof the moon suddenly shone from behind a bank of clouds and would most certainly have revealed their position to persons in the street As it was several were attracted by the sight of some great object in the air They called the attention of others to it but by the time glasses and telescopes had been brought to bear the Red Cloud was far away Dry clothes now some hot drinks and then Tom will tell us his secret remarked mister Sharp and with the great ship swaying high above the city of Middleville Tom told what he had heard in the office building They are the thieves who looted the bank and caused us to be unjustly accused he finished If we can capture them we ll get the reward and turn a neat trick on Andy Foger and his cronies But how can you capture them asked mister Damon You don t know where they are Perhaps not where Morse and the men who have the money are But I have a plan It s this We ll go to some quiet place leave the airship and then inform the authorities of our suspicions They can come here and arrest the men who still seem to be hanging out in Morse s office Then we can get on the trail of this Shagmon who seems to be the person in authority this time though I never heard of him before He seems to have the money according to what one of the men in the office said and he s the man we want Shagmon exclaimed mister Damon Yes Shagmon The fellow I heard talking said he d go to Shagmon and make Morse whack up Shagmon may be the real head of the gang Ha I have it cried mister Damon suddenly I wonder I didn t think of it before Shagmon is the headquarters not the head of the gang What do you mean asked Tom much excited I mean that there s a town called Shagmon about fifty miles from here That s what the fellow in the office meant He is going to the town of Shagmon and make Morse whack up That s where Morse is That s where the gang is hiding That s where the money is Hurrah Tom we re on the trail Chapter twenty two The Sheriff On Board The announcement of mister Damon came as a great surprise to Tom and mister Sharp They had supposed that the reference to Shagmon was to a person and never dreamed that it was to a locality But mister Damon s knowledge of geography stood them in good stead Well what s the first thing to do asked Tom after a pause The first thing would be to go to Shagmon or close to it I should say remarked mister Sharp In what direction is it mister Damon Northwest from where we were It s a county seat and that will suit our plans admirably for we can call on the sheriff for help That is if we locate the gang put in Tom I fancy it will be no easy job though How are we going about it Let s first get to Shagmon suggested the balloonist We ll select some quiet spot for a landing and then talk matters over We may stumble on the gang just as you did Tom on the men in the office No such good luck I m afraid Well I think we ll all be better for a little sleep declared the eccentric man Bless my eyelids but I m tired out As there was no necessity for standing watch when the airship was so high up as to be almost invisible they all turned in and were soon sleeping soundly though Tom had hard work at first to compose himself for he was excited at the prospect of capturing the scoundrels recovering the money for the bank and clearing his good name as well as those of his friends In the morning careful calculations were made to enable the travelers to tell when they had reached a point directly over the small city of Shagmon and with the skill of the veteran balloonist to aid them this was accomplished The airship was headed in the proper direction and about ten o clock having made out by using telescopes that there was plenty of uninhabited land about the city the craft was sent aloft again out of a large crowd that had caught sight of it For it was the intention of the travelers not to land until after dark as they wanted to keep their arrival quiet There were two reasons for this One was that the whole country was eager to arrest them to claim the reward offered by the bank and they did not want this to happen The other reason was that they wanted to go quietly into town tell the sheriff their story and enlist his aid All that day the Red Cloud consorted with the masses of fleecy vapor several miles above the earth a position being maintained as nearly as could be judged by instruments over a patch of woodland where mister Sharp had decided to land as there were several large clearings in it Back and forth above the clouds out of sight the airship drifted lazily to and fro sometimes when she got too far off her course being brought back to the right spot by means of the propellers It was tedious waiting but they felt it was the only thing to do mister Sharp and Tom busied themselves making adjustments to several parts of apparatus that needed it Nothing could be done toward repairing the hole in the aluminum container until a shop or shed was reached but the ship really did not need these repairs to enable it to be used mister Damon was fretful and blessed so many things during the course of the day that there seemed to be nothing left Dinner and supper took up some time really good meals being served by Tom who was temporarily acting as cook Then they anxiously waited for darkness when they could descend I hope the moon isn t too bright remarked mister Sharp as he went carefully over the motor once more for he did not want it to balk again If it shines too much it will discover us But a little light would be a fine thing and show us a good place to land argued Tom Fortune seemed to favor the adventurers There was a hazy light from the moon which was covered by swiftly moving dark clouds now and then a most effective screen for the airship as its great moving shape viewed from the earth resembled nothing so much as one of the clouds They made a good landing in a little forest glade the craft under the skillful guidance of mister Sharp and Tom coming down nicely Now for a trip to town to notify the sheriff said mister Sharp Tom I think you had better go alone You can explain matters and mister Damon and I will remain here until you come back I should say what you had best do would be to get the sheriff to help you locate the gang of bank robbers They re in this vicinity and he ought to be able with his deputies to find them I ll ask him replied Tom as he set off It was rather a lonely walk into the city from the woods where the airship had landed but Tom did not mind it and reaching Shagmon he inquired his way to the home of the sheriff for it was long after office hours He heard as he walked along the streets many persons discussing the appearance of the airship that morning and he was glad they had planned to land after dark for more than one citizen was regretting that he had not had a chance to get the five thousand dollars reward offered for the arrest of the passengers in the Red Cloud Tom found the sheriff mister Durkin by name a genial personage At the mention of the airship the official grew somewhat excited Are you one of the fellows that looted the bank he inquired when Tom told him how he and his friends had arrived at Shagmon The young inventor denied the impeachment and told his story He ended up with a request for the sheriff s aid at the same time asking if the officer knew where such a gang as the Happy Harry one might be in hiding You ve come just at the right time young man was the answer of Sheriff Durkin when he was assured of the honesty of Tom s statements I ve been on the point for the last week of raiding a camp of men who have settled at a disused summer resort about ten miles from here I think they re running a gambling game But I haven t been able to get any evidence and every time I sent out a posse some one warns the men and we can find nothing wrong I believe these men are the very ones you want If we could only get to them without their suspecting it I think I d have them right We can do that Sheriff How Go in our airship You come with us and we ll put you right over their camp where you can drop down on their heads Good land I never rode in an automobile even let alone an airship went on the officer I d be scared out of my wits and so would my deputies Send the deputies on ahead suggested Tom The sheriff hesitated Then he slapped his thigh with his big hand By golly I ll go with you he declared I ll try capturing criminals in an airship for the first time in my life Lead the way young man An hour later Sheriff Durkin was aboard the Red Cloud and plans were being talked of for the capture of the bank robbers or at least for raiding the camp where the men were supposed to be Chapter twenty three On To The Camp Well you sure have got a fine craft here remarked Sheriff Durkin as he looked over the airship after Tom and his friends had told of their voyage It will be quite up to date to raid a gang of bank robbers in a flying machine but I guess it will be the only way we can catch those fellows Now I ll go back to town and the first thing in the morning I ll round up my posse and start it off The men can surround the camp and lay quiet until we arrive in this ship Then when we descend on the heads of the scoundrels right out of the sky so to speak my men can close in and bag them all That s a good plan commented mister Sharp but are you sure these are the men we want It s pretty vague I think but of course the clue Tom got is pretty slim merely the name Shagmon Well this is Shagmon went on the sheriff and as I told your young friend I ve been trying for some time to bag the men at the summer camp They number quite a few and if they don t do anything worse they run a gambling game there I m pretty sure if the bank robbers are in this vicinity they re in that camp Of course all the men there may not have been engaged in looting the vault and they may not all know of it but it won t do any harm to round up the whole bunch After a tour of the craft and waiting to take a little refreshment with his new friends the sheriff left promising to come as early on the morrow as possible Let s go to bed suggested mister Sharp after a bit We ve got hard work ahead of us to morrow They were up early and in the seclusion of the little glade in the woods Tom and mister Sharp went over every part of the airship The sheriff arrived about nine o clock and announced that he had started off through the woods to surround the camp twenty five men They ll be there at noon mister Durkin said and will close in when I give the signal which will be two shots fired I heard just before I came here that there are some new arrivals at the camp Maybe those are the men I overheard talking in the office building suggested Tom They probably came to get their share Well we must swoop down on them before they have time to distribute the money That s what agreed the county official mister Durkin was even more impressed by the airship in the daytime than he had been at night He examined every part and when the time came to start he was almost as unconcerned as any of the three travelers who had covered many hundreds of miles in the air This is certainly great cried the sheriff as the airship rose swiftly under the influence of the powerful gas As the craft went higher and higher his enthusiasm grew He was not the least afraid but then Sheriff Durkin was accounted a nervy individual under all circumstances Lay her a little off to the left the officer advised Tom who was at the steering wheel The main camp is right over there How long before we will reach it We can get there in about fifteen minutes if we run at top speed answered the lad his hand on the switch that controlled the motor Shall we No use burning up the air Besides my men have hardly had time to surround the camp It s in deep woods If I were you I d get right over it and then rise up out of sight so they can t see you Then when it s noon you can go down I ll fire the signal and the fun will commence that is fun for us but not so much for those chaps I fancy and the sheriff smiled grimly The sheriff s plan was voted a good one and accordingly the ship after nearing a spot about over the camp was sent a mile or two into the air hovering as nearly as possible over one spot Shortly before twelve the sheriff having seen to the weapons he brought with him gave the signal to descend Down shot the Red Cloud dropping swiftly when the gas was allowed to escape from the red container and also urged toward the earth by the deflected rudder Are you all ready cried the sheriff looking at his watch All ready replied mister Sharp Then here goes went on the officer drawing his revolver and firing two shots in quick succession Two shots from the woods below answered him Faster dropped the Red Cloud toward the camp of the criminals Chapter twenty four The Raid Look for a good place to land cried mister Sharp to Tom Any small level place will do Turn on the gas full power as soon as you feel the first contact and then shut it off so as to hold her down Then jump out and take a hand in the fight That s right cried the sheriff Fight s the word They re breaking from cover now he added as he looked over the side of the cabin from one of the windows The rascals have taken the alarm The airship was descending toward a little glade in the woods surrounding the old picnic ground Men mostly of the tramp sort could be seen running to and fro I hope my deputies close in promptly murmured the sheriff There s a bigger bunch there than I counted on From the appearance of the gang rushing about it seemed as if there were at least fifty of them Some of the fellows caught sight of the airship and with yells pointed upward Nearer and nearer to the earth settled the Red Cloud The criminals in the camp were running wildly about Several squads of them darted through the woods only to come hurriedly back where they called to their companions Ha My men are evidently on the job exclaimed the sheriff They are turning the rascals back Some of the gang were so alarmed at the sight of the great airship settling down on their camp that they could only stand and stare at it Others were gathering sticks and stones as if for resistance and some could be seen to have weapons Off to one side was a small hut rather better than the rest of the tumbledown shacks in which the tramps lived Tom noticed this and saw several men gathered about it One seemed familiar to the lad He called the attention of mister Damon to the fellow Do you know him asked Tom eagerly Bless my very existence If it isn t Anson Morse One of the gang cried the eccentric man That s what I thought agreed Tom The bank robbers are here he added to the sheriff If we only recover the money we ll be doing well remarked mister Sharp Suddenly there came a shout from the fringe of woods surrounding the camp and an instant later there burst from the bushes a number of men My posse cried the sheriff We ought to be down now The airship was a hundred feet above the ground but Tom opening wider the gas outlet sent the craft more quickly down Then just as it touched the earth he forced a mass of vapor into the container making the ship buoyant so as to reduce the shock An instant later the ship was stationary Out leaped the sheriff Give it to em men he shouted With a yell his men responded and fired a volley in the air Come on Tom called mister Sharp We ll make for the hut where you saw Morse I ll come too I ll come too cried mister Damon rushing along as fast as he could a seltzer bottle in either hand Tom s chief interest was to reach the men he suspected were the bank robbers The lad dashed through the woods toward the hut near which he had seen Morse He and mister Sharp reached it about the same time As they came in front of it out dashed Happy Harry the tramp He was followed by Morse and the man named Featherton The latter carried a black valise Hey Drop that shouted mister Sharp Drop nothing yelled the man Go on Go on urged Morse Take to the woods We ll deal with these fellows Oh you will eh shouted Tom and remembering his football days he made a dive between Morse and Happy Harry for the man with the bag which he guessed contained the stolen money The lad made a good tackle and grabbed Featherton about the legs He went down in a heap with Tom on top Our hero was feeling about for the valise when he felt a stunning blow on the back of his head He turned over quickly to see Morse in the act of delivering a second kick Tom grew faint and dimly saw the leader of the gang reach down for the valise This gave our hero sudden energy He was not going to lose everything when it was just within his grasp Conquering by a strong effort his feeling of dizziness he scrambled to his feet and made a grab for Morse The latter fended him off but Tom came savagely back at him all his fighting blood up The effects of the cowardly blow were passing off The lad managed to get one hand on the handle of the bag Let go cried Morse and he dealt Tom a blow in the face It staggered the youth but he held on grimly and raised his left hand and arm as a guard At the same time he endeavored to twist the valise loose from Morse s hold The man raised his foot to kick Tom but at that moment there was a curious hissing sound and a stream of frothy liquid shot over the lad s head right into the face of the man blinding him Ha Take that And more of it shouted mister Damon and a second stream of seltzer squirted into the face of Morse With a yell of rage he let go his hold of the satchel and Tom staggered back with it The lad saw mister Damon rushing toward the now disabled leader playing both bottles of seltzer on him Then when all the liquid was gone the eccentric man began to beat Morse over the head and shoulders with the heavy bottles until the scoundrel begged for mercy Tom was congratulating himself on his success in getting the bag when Happy Harry the tramp rushed at him I guess I ll take that he roared and wheeling Tom around at the same time striking him full in the face the ugly man made a grab for the valise His hand had hardly touched it before he went down like a log the sound of a powerful blow causing Tom to look up He saw mister Sharp standing over the prostrate tramp who had been cleanly knocked out Are you all right Tom asked the balloonist Yes trifle dizzy that s all I ve got the money Are you sure Tom opened the valise A glance was enough to show that it was stuffed with bills Happy Harry showed signs of coming to and mister Sharp with a few turns of a rope he had brought along soon secured him Morse was too exhausted to fight more for the seltzer entering his mouth and nose had deprived him of breath and he fell an easy prisoner to mister Damon Morse was soon tied up The other members of the Happy Harry gang had escaped Meanwhile the sheriff and his men were having a fight with the crowd of tramps but as the posse was determined and the criminals mostly of the class known as hobos the battle was not a very severe one Several of the sheriff s men were slightly injured however and a few of the tramps escaped A most successful raid commented the sheriff when quiet was restored and a number of prisoners were lined up all tied securely Did you get the money Almost all of it answered Tom who now that Morse and Happy Harry were securely tied had busied himself with the aid of mister Sharp and mister Damon in counting the bills Only about two thousand dollars are missing I think the bank will be glad enough to charge that to profit and loss I guess so added the sheriff I m certainly much obliged to you for the use of your airship Otherwise the raid wouldn t have been so successful Well now we ll get the prisoners to jail It was necessary to hire rigs from nearby farmers to accomplish this As for Morse and Happy Harry they were placed in the airship and under guard of the sheriff and two deputies were taken to the county seat The criminals were too dazed over the rough treatment they had received and over their sudden capture to notice the fact of riding through the air to jail Now for home cried Tom when the prisoners had been disposed of Home to clear our names and take this money to the bank And receive the reward added mister Sharp with a smile Don t forget that Oh yes and I ll see that you get a share too mister Durkin went on Tom Only for your aid we never would have gotten these men and the money Oh I guess we re about even on that score responded the official I m glad to break up that gang The next morning Tom and his friends started for home in the Red Cloud They took with them evidence as to the guilt of the two men Morse and Happy Harry The men confessed that they and their pals had robbed the bank of Shopton the night before Tom and his friends sailed on their trip In fact that was the object for which the gang hung around Shopton After securing their booty they had gone to the camp of the tramps at Shagmon where they hid hoping they would not be traced But the words Tom had overheard had been their undoing The men who arrived at the camp just before the raid were the same ones the young inventor heard talking in the office building They had come to get their share of the loot which Morse held and with which he tried so desperately to get away Tom s injuries were not serious and did not bother him after being treated by a physician Chapter twenty five Andy Gets His Reward Flying swiftly through the air the young inventor and his two companions were soon within sight of Shopton As they approached the town from over the lake and a patch of woods they attracted no attention until they were near home and the craft settled down easily in the yard of the Swift property That the aged inventor was glad to see his son back need not be said and missus Baggert s welcome was scarcely less warm than that of mister Swift mister Sharp and mister Damon were also made to feel that their friends were glad to see them safe again We must go at once and see mister Pendergast the bank president declared mister Swift We must take the money to him and demand that he withdraw the offer of reward for your arrest Yes agreed Tom I guess the reward will go to some one besides Andy Foger There was considerable surprise on the part of the bank clerks when our hero and his friends walked in carrying a heavy black bag But they could only conjecture what was in the wind for the party was immediately closeted with the president mister Pendergast was so startled that he hardly knew what to say when Tom aided by mister Sharp told his story But the return of the money with documents from Sheriff Durkin certifying as to the arrest of Morse and Happy Harry soon convinced him of the truth of the account It s the most wonderful thing I ever heard said the president Well what are you going to do about it asked mister Damon You have accused Tom and myself of being thieves and I apologize I apologize most humbly exclaimed mister Pendergast I also What about the reward went on mister Damon Bless my bank notes I don t want any of it for I have enough but I think Tom and mister Sharp and the sheriff are entitled to it Certainly said the president certainly It will be paid at once I will call a meeting of the directors In fact they are all in the bank now save mister Foger and I can reach him by telephone If you will just rest yourselves in that room there I will summon you before the board when it convenes and be most happy to pay over the five thousand dollars reward It is the most wonderful thing I ever heard of most wonderful In a room adjoining that of the president Tom his father and mister Damon waited for the directors to meet mister Foger could be heard entering a little later What s this I hear Pendergast he cried rubbing his hands The bank robbers captured eh Well that s good news Of course we ll pay the reward I always knew my boy was a smart lad Five thousand dollars will be a tidy sum for him Of course his chum Sam Snedecker is entitled to some but not much So they ve caught Tom Swift and that rascally Damon eh I always knew he was a scoundrel Putting money in here as a blind mister Damon heard and shook his fist I ll make him suffer for that he whispered Tom Swift arrested eh went on mister Foger I always knew he was a bad egg Who caught them Where are they In the next room replied mister Pendergast who loved a joke almost as well as did Tom They may come out now added the president opening the door and sending Ned Newton in to summon Tom mister Swift and mister Damon who filed out before the board of directors Gentlemen began the president I have the pleasure of presenting to you mister Thomas Swift mister Barton Swift and mister Wakefield Damon I also have the honor to announce that mister Thomas Swift and mister Damon have been instrumental in capturing the burglars who recently robbed our bank and I am happy to add that young mister Swift and mister Wakefeld Damon have this morning brought to me all but a small part of the money stolen from us Which money they succeeded after a desperate fight A fight partly with seltzer bottles interrupted mister Damon proudly Don t forget them Partly with seltzer bottles conceded the president with a smile After a fight they succeeded in getting the money back Here it is and I now suggest that we pay the reward we promised What Reward Pay them The money back Isn t my son to receive the five thousand dollars for informing as to the identity of the thief isn t he demanded mister Foger almost suffocating from his astonishment at the unexpected announcement Hardly answered mister Pendergast dryly Your son s information happened to be very wrong The tools he saw Tom have in the bag were airship tools not burglar s And the same gang that once robbed mister Swift robbed our bank Tom Swift captured them and is entitled to the reward It will be necessary for us directors to make up the sum personally and I for one am very glad to do so So am I came in a chorus from the others seated at the table But er I understood that my son stammered mister Foger who did not at all relish having to see his son lose the reward It was all a mistake about your son commented mister Pendergast Gentlemen is it your desire that I write out a check for young mister Swift They all voted in the affirmative even mister Foger being obliged to do so much against his wishes He was a very much chagrined man when the directors meeting broke up Word was sent at once by telegraph to all the cities where reward posters had been displayed recalling the offer and stating that Tom Swift and mister Damon were cleared mister Sharp had never been really accused Well let s go home suggested Tom when he had the five thousand dollar check in his pocket I want another ride in the Red Cloud as soon as it s repaired So do I declared mister Damon The eccentric man and mister Swift walked on ahead and Tom strolled down toward the dock for he thought he would take a short trip in his motor boat He was near the lake not having met many persons when he saw a figure running up from the water He knew who it was in an instant Andy Foger As for the bully at the sight of Tom he hesitated than came boldly on Evidently he had not heard of our hero s arrival Ha exclaimed the red haired lad I ve been looking for you The police want you Tom Swift Oh do they asked the young inventor gently Yes for robbery I m going to get the reward too You thought you were smart but I saw those burglar tools in your valise I sent the police after you So you ve come back eh I m going to tell Chief Simonson You wait Yes answered Tom I ll wait So the police want me do they That s what they do snarled Andy I told you I d get even with you and I ve done it Well burst out Tom unable to longer contain himself as he thought of all he had suffered at the hands of the red haired bully I said I d get even with you but I haven t done it yet I m going to now Take off your coat Andy You and I are going to have a little argument Don t you dare lay a finger on me blustered the squint eyed one Tom peeled off his coat Andy who saw that he could not escape rushed forward and dealt the young inventor a blow on the chest That was all Tom wanted and the next instant he went at Andy hammer and tongs The bully tried to fight but he had no chance with his antagonist who was righteously angry and who made every blow tell It was a sorry looking Andy Foger who begged for mercy a little later Tom had no desire to administer more than a deserved reward to the bully but perhaps he did add a little for interest At any rate Andy thought so You just wait he cried as he limped off I ll make you sorry for this Oh don t go to any trouble on my account said Tom gently as he put on his coat But Andy did go to considerable trouble to be revenged on the young inventor and whether he succeeded or not you may learn by reading the fourth book of this series to be called Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat or Under the Ocean for Sunken Treasure in which I shall relate the particulars of a voyage that was marvelous in the extreme Tom reached home in a very pleasant frame of mind that afternoon Things had turned out much better than he thought they would A few weeks later the two bank robbers who were found guilty were sentenced to long terms but their companions were not captured Tom sent Sheriff Durkin a share of the reward and the lad invested his own share in bank stock after giving some to mister Sharp mister Damon refused to accept any As for mister Swift once he saw matters straightened out and his son safe he resumed his work on his prize submarine boat his son helping him As for Tom he alternated his spare time between trips in the airship and his motor boat and frequently a certain young lady from the Rocksmond Seminary was his companion I think you know her name by this time Now for a while we will take leave of Tom Swift and his friends trusting
