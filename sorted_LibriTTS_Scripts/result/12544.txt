were afloat doubting the authenticity of these letters and that these rumours would sink to rest if the history of the originals were published I hasten to adopt my reviewer s suggestion and give an outline of their story They are at present in the hands of the reverend Robert Longe at Coddenham Vicarage Suffolk where they have been for the last hundred years At Sir William Temple s death in sixteen ninety eight he left no other descendants than two grand daughters Elizabeth and Dorothy Elizabeth died without issue in seventeen seventy two Dorothy married Nicholas Bacon esquire of Shrubland Hall in the parish of Coddenham Dorothy left a son the reverend Nicholas Bacon who was vicar of Coddenham This traces the letters to Coddenham Vicarage The reverend Nicholas Bacon dying without issue bequeathed Coddenham Vicarage with the pictures and papers therein to the reverend John Longe who had married his wife s sister The reverend John Longe who died in eighteen thirty five was the father of the present owner This satisfactorily accounts for the letters being in their present hands and these stated facts will I trust set at rest the fears or hopes of sceptics EDWARD

INTRODUCTION An editor says doctor Johnson is he that revises or prepares any work for publication and this definition of an editor s duty seems wholly right and satisfactory But now that the revision of these letters is apparently complete the reader has some right to expect a formal introduction to a lady whose name he has in all probability never heard and one may not be overstepping the modest and Johnsonian limits of an editor s office when the writing of a short introduction is included among the duties of preparation Dorothy Osborne was the wife of the famous Sir William Temple and apology for her biography will be found in her own letters here for the first time published Some of them have indeed been printed in a Life of Sir William Temple by the Right Honourable Thomas Peregrine Courtenay a man better known to the Tory politician of fifty years ago than to any world of letters in that day or this Forty two extracts from these letters did Courtenay transfer to an Appendix without arrangement or any form of editing as he candidly confesses but not without misgivings as to how they would be received by a people thirsting to read the details of the negotiations which took place in connection with the Triple Alliance If Courtenay lived to learn that the world had other things to do than pore over dull excerpts from inhuman State papers we may pity his awakening but we can never quite forgive the apologetic paragraph with which he relegates Dorothy Osborne s letters to the mouldy obscurity of an Appendix When Macaulay was reviewing Courtenay s book in the Edinburgh Review he took occasion to write a short but living sketch of the early history of Sir William Temple and Dorothy Osborne And with this account so admirably written ready at hand it becomes the clear duty of the Editor to quote rather than to rewrite which he does with the greater pleasure remembering that it was this very passage that first led him to read the letters of Dorothy Osborne William Temple Sir John s eldest son was born in London in the year sixteen twenty eight He received his early education under his maternal uncle was subsequently sent to school at Bishop Stortford and at seventeen began to reside at Emmanuel College Cambridge where the celebrated Cudworth was his tutor The times were not favourable to study The Civil War disturbed even the quiet cloisters and bowling greens of Cambridge produced violent revolutions in the government and discipline of the colleges and unsettled the minds of the students Temple forgot at Emmanuel all the little Greek which he had brought from Bishop Stortford and never retrieved the loss a circumstance which would hardly be worth noticing but for the almost incredible fact that fifty years later he was so absurd as to set up his own authority against that of Bentley on questions of Greek history and philology He made no proficiency either in the old philosophy which still lingered in the schools of Cambridge or in the new philosophy of which Lord Bacon was the founder But to the end of his life he continued to speak of the former with ignorant admiration and of the latter with equally ignorant contempt After residing at Cambridge two years he departed without taking a degree and set out upon his travels He seems to have been then a lively agreeable young man of fashion not by any means deeply read but versed in all the superficial accomplishments of a gentleman and acceptable in all polite societies In politics he professed himself a Royalist His opinions on religious subjects seem to have been such as might be expected from a young man of quick parts who had received a rambling education who had not thought deeply who had been disgusted by the morose austerity of the Puritans and who surrounded from childhood by the hubbub of conflicting sects might easily learn to feel an impartial contempt for them all On his road to France he fell in with the son and daughter of Sir Peter Osborne Sir Peter held Guernsey for the King and the young people were like their father warm for the Royal cause At an inn where they stopped in the Isle of Wight the brother amused himself with inscribing on the windows his opinion of the ruling powers For this instance of malignancy the whole party were arrested and brought before the Governor The sister trusting to the tenderness which even in those troubled times scarcely any gentleman of any party ever failed to show where a woman was concerned took the crime on herself and was immediately set at liberty with her fellow travellers This incident as was natural made a deep impression on Temple He was only twenty Dorothy Osborne was twenty one She is said to have been handsome and there remains abundant proof that she possessed an ample share of the dexterity the vivacity and the tenderness of her sex Temple soon became in the phrase of that time her servant and she returned his regard But difficulties as great as ever expanded a novel to the fifth volume opposed their wishes When the courtship commenced the father of the hero was sitting in the Long Parliament the father of the heroine was commanding in Guernsey for King Charles Even when the war ended and Sir Peter Osborne returned to his seat at Chicksands the prospects of the lovers were scarcely less gloomy Sir John Temple had a more advantageous alliance in view for his son Dorothy Osborne was in the meantime besieged by as many suitors as were drawn to Belmont by the fame of Portia The most distinguished on the list was Henry Cromwell Destitute of the capacity the energy the magnanimity of his illustrious father destitute also of the meek and placid virtues of his elder brother this young man was perhaps a more formidable rival in love than either of them would have been missus Hutchinson speaking the sentiments of the grave and aged describes him as an insolent foole and a debauched ungodly cavalier These expressions probably mean that he was one who among young and dissipated people would pass for a fine gentleman Dorothy was fond of dogs of larger and more formidable breed than those which lie on modern hearthrugs and Henry Cromwell promised that the highest functionaries at Dublin should be set to work to procure her a fine Irish greyhound She seems to have felt his attentions as very flattering though his father was then only Lord General and not yet Protector Love however triumphed over ambition and the young lady appears never to have regretted her decision though in a letter written just at the time when all England was ringing with the news of the violent dissolution of the Long Parliament she could not refrain from reminding Temple with pardonable vanity how great she might have been if she had been so wise as to have taken hold of the offer of H C Nor was it only the influence of rivals that Temple had to dread The relations of his mistress regarded him with personal dislike and spoke of him as an unprincipled adventurer without honour or religion ready to render service to any party for the sake of preferment This is indeed a very distorted view of Temple s character Yet a character even in the most distorted view taken of it by the most angry and prejudiced minds generally retains something of its outline No caricaturist ever represented mister Pitt as a Falstaff or mister Fox as a skeleton nor did any libeller ever impute parsimony to Sheridan or profusion to Marlborough It must be allowed that the turn of mind which the eulogists of Temple have dignified with the appellation of philosophical indifference and which however becoming it may be in an old and experienced statesman has a somewhat ungraceful appearance in youth might easily appear shocking to a family who were ready to fight or to suffer martyrdom for their exiled King and their persecuted Church The poor girl was exceedingly hurt and irritated by these imputations on her lover defended him warmly behind his back and addressed to himself some very tender and anxious admonitions mingled with assurances of her confidence in his honour and virtue On one occasion she was most highly provoked by the way in which one of her brothers spoke of Temple We talked ourselves weary she says he renounced me and I defied him Near seven years did this arduous wooing continue We are not accurately informed respecting Temple s movements during that time But he seems to have led a rambling life sometimes on the Continent sometimes in Ireland sometimes in London He made himself master of the French and Spanish languages and amused himself by writing essays and romances an employment which at least served the purpose of forming his style The specimen which mister Courtenay has preserved of these early compositions is by no means contemptible indeed there is one passage on Like and Dislike which could have been produced only by a mind habituated carefully to reflect on its own operations and which reminds us of the best things in Montaigne Temple appears to have kept up a very active correspondence with his mistress His letters are lost but hers have been preserved and many of them appear in these volumes mister Courtenay expresses some doubt whether his readers will think him justified in inserting so large a number of these epistles We only wish that there were twice as many Very little indeed of the diplomatic correspondence of that generation is so well worth reading Here Macaulay indulges in an eloquent but lengthy philippic against that vile phrase the dignity of history which we may omit taking up the thread of his discourse where he recurs to the affairs of our two lovers Thinking thus concerning the dignity of history we are glad to learn so much and would willingly learn more about the loves of Sir William and his mistress In the seventeenth century to be sure Louis the Fourteenth was a much more important person than Temple s sweetheart But death and time equalize all things Neither the great King nor the beauty of Bedfordshire neither the gorgeous paradise of Marli nor Mistress Osborne s favourite walk in the common that lay hard by the house where a great many young wenches used to keep sheep and cows and sit in the shade singing of ballads is anything to us Louis and Dorothy are alike dust A cotton mill stands on the ruins of Marli and the Osbornes have ceased to dwell under the ancient roof of Chicksands But of that information for the sake of which alone it is worth while to study remote events we find so much in the love letters which mister Courtenay has published that we would gladly purchase equally interesting billets with ten times their weight in State papers taken at random To us surely it is as useful to know how the young ladies of England employed themselves a hundred and eighty years ago how far their minds were cultivated what were their favourite studies what degree of liberty was allowed to them what use they made of that liberty what accomplishments they most valued in men and what proofs of tenderness delicacy permitted them to give to favoured suitors as to know all about the seizure of Franche Comte and the Treaty of Nimeguen The mutual relations of the two sexes seem to us to be at least as important as the mutual relations of any two Governments in the world and a series of letters written by a virtuous amiable and sensible girl and intended for the eye of her lover alone can scarcely fail to throw some light on the relations of the sexes whereas it is perfectly possible as all who have made any historical researches can attest to read bale after bale of despatches and protocols without catching one glimpse of light about the relations of Governments mister Courtenay proclaims that he is one of Dorothy Osborne s devoted servants and expresses a hope that the publication of her letters will add to the number We must declare ourselves his rivals She really seems to have been a very charming young woman modest generous affectionate intelligent and sprightly a Royalist as was to be expected from her connections without any of that political asperity which is as unwomanly as a long beard religious and occasionally gliding into a very pretty and endearing sort of preaching yet not too good to partake of such diversions as London afforded under the melancholy rule of the Puritans or to giggle a little at a ridiculous sermon from a divine who was thought to be one of the great lights of the Assembly at Westminster with a little turn for coquetry which was yet perfectly compatible with warm and disinterested attachment and a little turn for satire which yet seldom passed the bounds of good nature She loved reading but her studies were not those of Queen Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey She read the verses of Cowley and Lord Broghill French Memoirs recommended by her lover and the Travels of Fernando Mendez Pinto But her favourite books were those ponderous French romances which modern readers know chiefly from the pleasant satire of Charlotte Lennox She could not however help laughing at the vile English into which they were translated Her own style is very agreeable nor are her letters at all the worse for some passages in which raillery and tenderness are mixed in a very engaging namby pamby When at last the constancy of the lovers had triumphed over all the obstacles which kinsmen and rivals could oppose to their union a yet more serious calamity befell them Poor Mistress Osborne fell ill of the small pox and though she escaped with life lost all her beauty To this most severe trial the affection and honour of the lovers of that age was not unfrequently subjected Our readers probably remember what missus Hutchinson tells us of herself The lofty Cornelia like spirit of the aged matron seems to melt into a long forgotten softness when she relates how her beloved Colonel married her as soon as she was able to quit the chamber when the priest and all that saw her were affrighted to look on her But God she adds with a not ungraceful vanity recompensed his justice and constancy by restoring her as well as before Temple showed on this occasion the same justice and constancy which did so much honour to Colonel Hutchinson The date of the marriage is not exactly known but mister Courtenay supposes it to have taken place about the end of the year sixteen fifty four From this time we lose sight of Dorothy and are reduced to form our opinion of the terms on which she and her husband were from very slight indications which may easily mislead us When an editor is in the pleasant position of being able to retain an historian of the eminence of Macaulay to write a large portion of his introduction it would ill become him to alter and correct his statements wherever there was a petty inaccuracy still it is necessary to say once for all that there are occasional errors in the passage as where Macaulay mentions that Chicksands is no longer the property of the Osbornes though happily not one of these errors is in itself important To our thinking too in the character that he draws of our heroine Macaulay hardly appears to be sufficiently aware of the sympathetic womanly nature of Dorothy and the dignity of her disposition so that he is persuaded to speak of her too constantly from the position of a man of the world praising with patronizing emphasis the pretty qualities of a school girl But we must remember that in forming our estimate of her character we have an extended series of letters before us and from these the reader can draw his own conclusions as to the accuracy of Macaulay s description and the importance of Dorothy s character It was this passage from Macaulay that led the Editor to Courtenay s Appendix and it was the literary and human charm of the letters themselves that suggested the idea of stringing them together into a connected story or sketch of the love affairs of Dorothy Osborne This was published in April eighteen eighty six in the English Illustrated Magazine and happened by good luck to fall into the hands of an admirer of Dorothy who having had access to the original letters had made faithful and loving copies of each one accurate even to the old world spelling These labours had been followed up by much patient research the fruits of which were now to be generously offered to the present Editor on condition that he would prepare the letters for the press The owner of the letters having courteously expressed his acquiescence nothing remained but to give to the task that patient care that it is easy to give to a labour of love A few words of explanation as to the arrangement of the letters Although few of them were dated it was found possible by minute analysis of their contents to place them in approximately correct order and if one could not date each letter one could at least assign groups of letters to specific months or seasons of the year The fact that New Year s day was at this period March twenty five a fact sometimes ignored by antiquarians of high repute adds greatly to the difficulty of ascertaining exact dates and as an instance of this we find in different chronicles of authority Sir Peter Osborne s death correctly yet differently given as happening in March sixteen fifty three and March sixteen fifty four Throughout this volume the ordinary New Year s day has been retained The further revision and preparation that the letters have undergone is shortly this The spelling has been modernized the letters punctuated and arranged in paragraphs and names indicated by initials have been wherever it was possible written in full A note has been prefixed to each letter printed in a more condensed form than the letter itself and dealing with all the allusions contained in it This system is very fit to be applied to Dorothy s letters because by its use Dorothy is left to tell her own story without the constant and irritating references to footnotes or Appendix notes that other arrangements necessitate The Editor has a holy horror of the footnote and would have it relegated to those biblia a biblia from which class he is sure Elia would cheerfully except Dorothy s letters In the notes themselves the endeavour has been to obtain where it was possible parallel references to letters diaries or memoirs and the Editor can only regret that his researches through both MSS and printed records have been so little successful In the case of well known men like Algernon Sydney Lord Manchester Edmund Waller et cetera no attempt has been made to write a complete note their lives and works being sufficiently well known but in the case of more obscure persons as for instance Dorothy s brother in law Sir Thomas Peyton all the known details of their history have been carefully collected Yet in spite of patience toil and the kindness of learned friends the Editor is bound to acknowledge that some names remain mere words to him and but too many allusions are mysteriously dim The division of the letters into chapters at first sight an arbitrary arrangement really follows their natural grouping The letters were written in the years sixteen fifty three and sixteen fifty four and form a clear and connected story of the love affairs of the young couple during that time The most important group of letters both from the number of letters contained in it and the contents of the letters themselves is that entitled Life at Chicksands sixteen fifty three The Editor regards this group as the very mainland of the epistolary archipelago that we are exploring For it is in this chapter that a clear idea of the domestic social life of these troublous times is obtainable none the less valuable in that it does not tally altogether with our preconceived and too romantic notions Here too we find what Macaulay longed for those social domestic trivialities which the historians have at length begun to value rightly Here are indeed many things of no value to Dryasdust and his friends but of moment to us who look for and find true details of life and character in nearly every line And above all things here is a living presentment of a beautiful woman pure in dissolute days passing quiet hours of domestic life amongst her own family where we may all visit her and hear her voice even in the very tones in which she spoke to her lover And now the Editor feels he must augment Macaulay s sketch of Dorothy Osborne with some account of the Osborne family of whom it consisted what part it took in the struggle of the day and what was the past position of Dorothy s ancestors All that can be promised is that such account shall be as concise as may be consistent with clearness and accuracy and that it shall contain nothing but ascertained facts There were Osbornes before there were Osbornes of Chicksands who coming out of the north settled at Purleigh in Essex where we find them in the year fourteen forty two From this date passing lightly over a hundred troubled years we find Peter Osborne Dorothy s great grandfather born in fifteen twenty one He was Keeper of the Purse to Edward VI and was twice married his second wife being Alice sister of Sir John Cheke a family we read of in Dorothy s letters One of his daughters named Catharine he had a well balanced family of eleven sons and eleven daughters afterwards married Sir Thomas Cheke Peter Osborne died in fifteen ninety two and Sir John Osborne Peter s son and Dorothy s grandfather was the first Osborne of Chicksands It was he who settled at Chicksands in Bedfordshire and purchased the neighbouring rectory at Hawnes to restore it to that Church of which he and his family were in truth militant members and having generously built and furnished a parsonage house he presented it in the first place to the celebrated preacher Thomas Brightman who died there in sixteen oh seven It is this rectory that in sixteen fifty three fifty four is in the hands of the reverend Edward Gibson who appears from time to time in Dorothy s letters and who was on occasions the medium through which Temple s letters reached their destination and avoided falling into the hands of Dorothy s jealous brother Sir John Osborne married Dorothy Barlee granddaughter of Richard Lord Rich Lord Chancellor of England in the reign of Henry VIII Sir John was Treasurer s Remembrancer in the Exchequer for many years during the reign of James I and was also a Commissioner of the Navy He died November two sixteen twenty eight and was buried in Campton Church Chicksands lies between the village of Hawnes and Campton where a tablet to his memory still exists Sir John had five sons Peter the eldest Dorothy s father who succeeded him in his hereditary office of Treasurer s Remembrancer Christopher Thomas Richard and Francis Francis Osborne may be mentioned as having taken the side of the Parliament in the Civil Wars He was Master of the Horse to the Earl of Pembroke and is noticeable to us as the only known relation of Dorothy who published a book He was the author of an Advice to his Son in two parts and some tracts published in seventeen twenty two of course long after his death Of Sir Peter himself we had at one time thought to write at some length The narrative of his defence of Castle Cornet for the King embodied in his own letters in the letters and papers of George Carteret Governor of Jersey in the detailed account left behind by a native of Guernsey and in the State papers of the period is one of the most interesting episodes in an epoch of episodes But though the collected material for some short life of Sir Peter Osborne lies at hand it seems scarcely necessary for the purpose of this book and so not without reluctance it is set aside Sir Peter was an ardent loyalist In his obstinate flesh and blood devotion to the house of Stuart he was as sincere and thorough as Sir Henry Lee Sir Geoffrey Peveril or Kentish Sir Byng He was the incarnation of the malignant of latter day fiction King Charles and who ll do him right now King Charles and who s ripe for fight now Give a rouse here s in hell s despite now King Charles To this text his life wrote the comment In sixteen twenty one James I created him Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey He had married Dorothy sister of Sir John Danvers Sir John was the younger brother and heir to the Earl of Danby and was a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to the King Clarendon tells us that he got into debt and to get out of debt found himself in Cromwell s counsel that he was a proud formal weak man between being seduced and a seducer and that he took it to be a high honour to sit on the same bench with Cromwell who employed him and contemned him at once The Earl of Danby was the Governor of Guernsey and Sir Peter was his lieutenant until sixteen forty three when the Earl died and Sir Peter was made full Governor It would be in sixteen forty three that the siege of Castle Cornet began the same year in which the rents of the Chicksands estate were assigned away from their rightful owner to one mister John Blackstone M P Sir Peter was in his stronghold on a rock in the sea he was for the King The inhabitants of the island more comfortably situated were a united party for the Parliament Thus they remained for three years the King writing to Sir Peter to reduce the inhabitants to a state of reason the Parliament sending instructions to the jurats of Guernsey to seize the person of Sir Peter and the Earl of Warwick prompted we should suppose by Sir John Danvers offering terms to Sir Peter which he indignantly rejected Meanwhile Lady Osborne Dorothy with her in all probability was doing her best to victual the castle from the mainland she living at saint Malo during the siege At length her money all spent her health broken down she returned to England and was lost to sight Sir Peter himself heard nothing of her and her sons in England who were doing all they could for their father among the King s friends did not know of her whereabouts In sixteen forty six he resigned his command He was weary and heavy laden with unjust burdens heaped on him by those for whom and with whom he was fighting he was worn out by the siege by the characteristic treachery of the King who being unable to assist him could not refrain from sending lying promises instead and by the malice of his neighbour George Carteret Governor of Jersey who himself made free with the Guernsey supplies while writing home to the King that Sir Peter has betrayed his trust Betrayed his trust indeed when he and his garrison are reduced to one biscuit a day and a little porrage for supper together with limpets and herbs in the best mess they can make nay more when they have pulled up their floors for firewood and are dying of hunger and want in the stone shell of Castle Cornet for the love of their King However circumstances and Sir George Carteret were too much for him and at the request of Prince Charles he resigned his command to Sir Baldwin Wake in May sixteen forty six remaining three years after this date at saint Malo where he did what he was able to supply the wants of the castle Sir Baldwin surrendered the castle to Blake in sixteen fifty It was the last fortress to surrender In sixteen forty nine Sir Peter finding the promises of reward made by the Prince to be as sincere as those of his father returned to England and probably through the intervention of his father in law who was a strict Parliament man his house and a portion of his estates at Chicksands were restored to him To these he retired disappointed in spirit feeble in health soon to be bereft of the company of his wife who died towards the end of sixteen fifty and but for the constant ministering of his daughter Dorothy living lonely and forgotten to see the cause for which he had fought discredited and dead He died in March sixteen fifty four after a long weary illness The parish register of Campton describes him as a friend to the poor a lover of learning a maintainer of divine exercises There is still an inscription to his memory on a marble monument on the north side of the chancel in Campton church Sir Peter had seven sons and five daughters There were only three sons living in sixteen fifty three the others died young one laying down his life for the King at Hartland in Devonshire in some skirmish we must now suppose of which no trace remains Of those living Sir John the eldest son and the first baronet married his cousin Eleanor Danvers and lived in Gloucestershire during his father s life Henry afterwards knighted was probably the jealous brother who lived at Chicksands with Dorothy and her father with whom she had many skirmishes and who wished in his kind fraternal way to see his sister well that is to say wealthily married Robert is a younger brother a year older than Dorothy who died in September sixteen fifty three and who did not apparently live at Chicksands Dorothy herself was born in sixteen twenty seven where it is impossible to say Sir Peter was presumably at Castle Cornet at that date but it is doubtful if Lady Osborne ever stayed there the accommodation within its walls being straitened and primitive even for that day Dorothy was probably born in England maybe at Chicksands Her other sisters had married and settled in various parts of England before sixteen fifty three Her eldest sister not Anne as Wotton conjectures married one Sir Thomas Peyton a Kentish Royalist of some note What little could be gleaned of his actions from amongst Kentish antiquities and history and such letters of his as lie entombed in the MSS of the British Museum is set down hereafter He appears to have acted after her father s death as Dorothy s guardian and his name occurs more than once in the pages of her letters So much for the Osbornes of Chicksands an obstinate sturdy quick witted race of Cavaliers linked by marriage to the great families of the land aristocrats in blood and in spirit of whom Dorothy was a worthy descendant Let us try now and picture for ourselves their home Chixon Chikesonds or Chicksands Priory Bedfordshire as it now stands what a pleasing various art was spelling in olden time was in the reign of Edward III a nunnery situated then as now on a slight eminence with gently rising hills at a short distance behind and a brook running to join the river Ivel thence the German Ocean along the valley in front of the house The neighbouring scenery of Bedfordshire is on a humble scale and concerns very little those who do not frequent it and live among it as we must do for the next year or more The Priory is a low built sacro secular edifice well fitted for its former service Its priestly denizens were turned out in Henry VIII s monk hunting reign fifteen thirty eight To the joy or sorrow of the neighbourhood who knows now Granted then to one Richard Snow of whom the records are silent by him sold in Elizabeth s reign to Sir John Osborne Knt thus becoming the ancestral home of our Dorothy There is a crisp etching of the house in Fisher s Collections of Bedfordshire The very exterior of it is Catholic unpuritanical no methodism about the square windows set here and there at undecided intervals wheresoever they may be wanted Six attic windows jut out from the low tiled roof At the corner of the house is a high pinnacled buttress rising the full height of the wall five buttresses flank the side wall built so that they shade the lower windows from the morning sun in one place reaching to the sill of an upper window At the further end of the wall are two Gothic windows claustral remnants lighting now perhaps the dining hall where cousin Molle and Dorothy sat in state or the saloon where the latter received her servants There are still cloisters attached to the house at the other side of it maybe Yes a sleepy country house the warm earth and her shrubs creeping close up to the very sills of the lower windows sending in morning fragrance I doubt not when Dorothy thrust back the lattice after breakfast A quiet place slow is the accurate modern epithet for it awfully slow but to Dorothy a quite suitable home at which she never repines This etching by Thomas Fisher of December twenty six eighteen sixteen is the more valuable to us since the old Chicksands Priory no longer remains having suffered martyrdom at the bloody hands of the restorer For through this partly we have attained to a knowledge of Dorothy s surroundings and through the baronetages peerages and the invincible heaps of genealogical records we have gathered some few actual facts necessary to be known of Dorothy s relations her human surroundings their lives and actions And we shall not find ourselves following Dorothy s story with the less interest that we have mastered these details about the Osbornes of Chicksands Temple too claims the consideration at our hands of a few words concerning his near relatives and their position in the country As Macaulay tells us he was born in sixteen twenty eight the place of his birth being Blackfriars in London Sir John Temple his father was Master of the Rolls and a Privy Councillor in Ireland he was in the confidence of Robert Sidney Earl of Leicester the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Algernon Sydney the Earl s son was well known to Temple and perhaps to Dorothy Sir John Temple like his son in after life refused to look on politics as a game in which it was always advisable to play on the winning side and thus we find him opposing the Duke of Ormond in Ireland in sixteen forty three and suffering imprisonment as a partisan of the Parliament In England in sixteen forty eight when he was member for Chichester he concurred with the Presbyterian vote thereby causing the more advanced section to look askance at him and he was turned out of the House or secluded to use the elegant parliamentary language of the day From that time he lived in retirement in London until sixteen fifty four when as we read in Dorothy s letters he and his son go over to Ireland He resumed his office of Master of the Rolls and in August of that year was elected to the Irish Parliament as one of the members for Leitrim Sligo and Roscommon Temple s mother was a sister of doctor Hammond to whom one doctor John Collop a poetaster unknown in these days even by name begins an ode Seraphic Doctor bright evangelist The seraphic Doctor was rector of Penshurst near Tunbridge Wells the seat of the Sydneys From Hammond who was a zealous adherent of Charles I Temple received much of his early education When the Parliament drove doctor Hammond from his living Temple was sent to school at Bishop Stortford and the rest of his early life with an account of his meeting with Dorothy has been already set down for us by Macaulay Anno Domini sixteen hundred and fifty three let us look round through historic mist for landmarks so that we may know our whereabouts The narrow streets of Worcester had been but lately stained by the blood of heaped corpses Cromwell was meditating an abolition of the Parliament and a practical coronation of himself The world had ceased to wonder at English democracy giving laws to their quondam rulers and the democracy was beginning to be a little tired of itself to disbelieve in its own irksome discipline and to sigh for the flesh pots of a modified Presbyterian monarchy Cromwell indeed was at the height of his glory his honours lie thick upon him and now if ever he is the regal Cromwell that Victor Hugo has portrayed the uncrowned King of England trampling under foot that sacred liberty the baseless ideal for which so many had fought and bled He is soon to be Lord Protector He is second to none upon earth England is again at peace with herself and takes her position as one of the great Powers of Europe Cromwell is England s king So much for our rulers and politics Now let us remember our friends those whom we love on account of the work they have done for us and bequeathed to us through which we have learned to know them One of the best beloved and gentlest of these who by the satire of heaven was born into England in these troublous times was now wandering by brook and stream scarcely annoyed by the uproar and confusion of the factions around him And what he knew of England in these days he has left in perhaps the gentlest and most peaceful volume the world has ever read I speak of Master Izaak Walton who in this year sixteen fifty three published the first edition of his Compleat Angler and left a comrade for the idle hours of all future ages Other friends we have then living but none so intimate or well beloved mister Waller whom Dorothy may have known mister Cowley Sir Peter Lely who painted our heroine s portrait and doctor Jeremy Taylor very courtly and superior persons are some of these and far removed from our world Milton is too sublime to be called our friend but he was Cromwell s friend at this time Evelyn too is already making notes in his journal at Paris and elsewhere but little prattling Pepys has not yet begun diary making Other names will come to the mind of every reader but many of these are people we know by name as the phrase runs mere acquaintances not friends Nevertheless even these leave us some indirect description of their time from which we can look back through the mind s eye to this year of grace sixteen fifty three in which Dorothy was living and writing Yes if we cannot actually visualize the past these letters will at least convince us that the past did exist a past not wholly unlike the present and if we would realize the significance of it we have the word of one of our historians that there is no lamp by which to study the history of this period that gives a brighter and more searching light than contemporary letters Thus he recommends their study and we may apply his words to the letters before us A man intent to force for himself some path through that gloomy chaos called History of the Seventeenth Century and to look face to face upon the same may perhaps try it by this method as hopefully as by another Here is an irregular row of beacon fires once all luminous as suns and with a certain inextinguishable crubescence still in the abysses of the dead deep Night Let us look here In shadowy outlines in dimmer and dimmer crowding forms the very figure of the old dead Time itself may perhaps be faintly discernible here With this I feel that I may cast off some of the forms and solemnities necessary to an editorial introduction and assuming a simpler and more personal pronoun ask the reader who shall feel the full charm of Dorothy s bright wit and tender womanly sympathy to remember the thanks due to my fellow servant whose patient single hearted toil has placed these letters within our reach And when the reader shall close this volume let it not be without a feeling of gratitude to the unknown whose modesty alone prevents me from changing the title of fellow servant to that of fellow editor CHAPTER II EARLY LETTERS WINTER AND SPRING sixteen fifty two fifty three This first chapter begins with a long letter dated from Chicksands some time in the autumn of sixteen fifty two when Temple has returned to England after a long absence It takes us up to March sixteen fifty three about the end of which time Dorothy went to London and met Temple again The engagement she mentions must have been one that her parents were forcing upon her and it was not until the London visit I fancy that her friendship progressed beyond its original limits but in this matter the reader of Dorothy s letters will be as well able to judge as myself Letter I Goring House where Dorothy and Temple had last parted was in sixteen forty six appointed by the House of Commons for the reception of the French Ambassador In sixteen sixty five it was the town house of mister Secretary Bennet afterwards Lord Arlington Its grounds stood much in the position of the present Arlington Street and Evelyn speaks of it as an ill built house but capable of being made a pretty villa Dorothy mentions among other things that she has been drinking the waters though she does not say at what place It would be either at Barnet Epsom or Tunbridge all of which places are mentioned by contemporary letter writers as health resorts At Barnet there was a calcareous spring with a small portion of sea salt in it which as we may gather from a later letter had been but recently discovered This spring was afterwards in the year sixteen seventy seven endowed by one John Owen who left the sum of Lone to keep the well in repair as long as it should be of service to the parish Towards the end of last century Lyson mentions that the well was in decay and little used One wonders what has become of John Owen s legacy The Epsom spring had been discovered earlier in the century It was the first of its kind found in England The town was already a place of fashionable resort on account of its mineral waters they are mentioned as of European celebrity and as early as sixteen oh nine a ball room was erected avenues were planted and neither Bath nor Tunbridge could rival Epsom in the splendour of their appointments Towards the beginning of the last century however the waters gradually lost their reputation Tunbridge Wells the last of the three watering places that Dorothy may have visited is still flourishing and fashionable Its springs are said to have been discovered by Lord North in sixteen oh six and the fortunes of the place were firmly established by a visit paid to the springs by Queen Henrietta Maria acting under medical advice in sixteen thirty shortly after the birth of Prince Charles At this date there was no adequate accommodation for the royal party and Her Majesty had to live in tents on the banks of the spring An interesting account of the early legends and gradual growth of Tunbridge Wells is to be found in a guide book of seventeen sixty eight edited by one mister J Sprange The elderly man who proposed to Dorothy was Sir Justinian Isham Bart of Lamport in Northamptonshire He himself was about forty two years of age at this time and had lost his first wife by whom he had four daughters in sixteen thirty eight The reverend W Betham with that optimism which is characteristic of compilers of peerages thinks that he was esteemed one of the most accomplished persons of the time being a gentleman not only of fine learning but famed for his piety and exemplary life Dorothy thinks otherwise and writes of him as the vainest impertinent self conceited learned coxcomb that ever yet I saw Peerages in Dorothy s style would perhaps be unprofitable writing The Emperor as Dorothy calls him in writing to Temple may feel thankful that his epitaph was in others hands than hers He appears to have proposed to her more than once and evidently had her brother s good offices which I fear were not much in his favour with Dorothy He ultimately married the daughter of Thomas Lord Leigh of Stoneleigh some time in the following year Sir Thomas Osborne a Yorkshire baronet afterwards Earl of Danby is a name not unknown in history He was a cousin of Dorothy his mother Elizabeth Danvers being Dorothy s aunt He afterwards married Lady Bridget Lindsay the Earl of Lindsay s daughter and the marriage is mentioned in due course with Dorothy s comments His leadership of the Country Party when the reins of government were taken from the discredited Cabal is not matter for these pages neither are we much concerned to know that he was greedy of wealth and honours corrupt himself and a corrupter of others This is the conventional character of all statesmen of all dates and in all ages reflected in the mirror of envious opposition no one believes the description to be true Judged by the moral standard of his contemporaries he seems to have been at least of average height How near was Dorothy to the high places of the State when this man and Henry Cromwell were among her suitors Had she been an ambitious woman illustrious historians would have striven to do justice to her character in brilliant periods and there would be no need at this day for her to claim her place among the celebrated women of England SIR There is nothing moves my charity like gratitude and when a beggar is thankful for a small relief I always repent it was not more But seriously this place will not afford much towards the enlarging of a letter and I am grown so dull with living in t for I am not willing to confess yet I was always so as to need all helps Yet you shall see I will endeavour to satisfy you upon condition you will tell me why you quarrelled so at your last letter I cannot guess at it unless it were that you repented you told me so much of your story which I am not apt to believe neither because it would not become our friendship a great part of it consisting as I have been taught in a mutual confidence And to let you see that I believe it so I will give you an account of myself and begin my story as you did yours from our parting at Goring House I came down hither not half so well pleased as I went up with an engagement upon me that I had little hope of shaking off for I had made use of all the liberty my friends would allow me to preserve my own and twould not do he was so weary of his that he would part with it upon any terms As my last refuge I got my brother to go down with him to see his house who when he came back made the relation I wished He said the seat was as ill as so good a country would permit and the house so ruined for want of living in t as it would ask a good proportion of time and money to make it fit for a woman to confine herself to This though it were not much I was willing to take hold of and made it considerable enough to break the engagement I had no quarrel to his person or his fortune but was in love with neither and much out of love with a thing called marriage and have since thanked God I was so for tis not long since one of my brothers writ me word of him that he was killed in a duel though since I have heard that twas the other that was killed and he is fled upon t which does not mend the matter much Both made me glad I had scaped him and sorry for his misfortune which in earnest was the least return his many civilities to me could deserve Presently after this was at an end my mother died and I was left at liberty to mourn her loss awhile At length my aunt with whom I was when you last saw me commanded me to wait on her at London and when I came she told me how much I was in her care how well she loved me for my mother s sake and something for my own and drew out a long set speech which ended in a good motion as she call d it and truly I saw no harm in t for by what I had heard of the gentleman I guessed he expected a better fortune than mine And it proved so Yet he protested he liked me so well that he was very angry my father would not be persuaded to give Lone thousand more with me and I him so ill that I vowed if I had Lone thousand less I should have thought it too much for him And so we parted Since he has made a story with a new mistress that is worth your knowing but too long for a letter I ll keep it for you After this some friends that had observed a gravity in my face which might become an elderly man s wife as they term d it and a mother in law proposed a widower to me that had four daughters all old enough to be my sisters but he had a great estate was as fine a gentleman as ever England bred and the very pattern of wisdom I that knew how much I wanted it thought this the safest place for me to engage in and was mightily pleased to think I had met with one at last that had wit enough for himself and me too But shall I tell you what I thought when I knew him you will say nothing on t twas the vainest impertinent self conceited learned coxcomb that ever yet I saw to say more were to spoil his marriage which I hear is towards with a daughter of my Lord Coleraine s but for his sake I shall take care of a fine gentleman as long as I live Before I have quite ended with him coming to town about that and some other occasions of my own I fell in Sir Thomas s way and what humour took I cannot imagine but he made very formal addresses to me and engaged his mother and my brother to appear in t This bred a story pleasanter than any I have told you yet but so long a one that I must reserve it till we meet or make it a letter of itself The next thing I designed to be rid on was a scurvy spleen that I have been subject to and to that purpose was advised to drink the waters There I spent the latter end of the summer and at my coming home found that a gentleman who has some estate in this country had been treating with my brother and it yet goes on fair and softly I do not know him so much as to give you much of his character tis a modest melancholy reserved man whose head is so taken up with little philosophic studies that I admire how I found a room there Twas sure by chance and unless he is pleased with that part of my humour which other people think the worst tis very possible the next new experiment may crowd me out again Thus you have all my late adventures and almost as much as this paper will hold The rest shall be employed in telling you how sorry I am you have got such a cold I am the more sensible of your trouble by my own for I have newly got one myself But I will send you that which was to cure me Tis like the rest of my medicines if it do no good twill be sure to do no harm and twill be no great trouble to take a little on t now and then for the taste on t as it is not excellent so tis not very ill One thing more I must tell you which is that you are not to take it ill that I mistook your age by my computation of your journey through this country for I was persuaded t other day that I could not be less than thirty years old by one that believed it himself because he was sure it was a great while since he had heard of such a one as Your humble servant Letter two This letter which is dated comes I think at some distance of time from the first letter Dorothy may have dated her letters to ordinary folk but as she writes to her servant once a week at least she seems to have considered dates to be superfluous When Temple is in Ireland her letters are generally dated with the day of the month Temple had probably returned from a journey into Yorkshire his travels in Holland were over some time ago and passing through Bedford within ten miles of Chicksands he neglected to pay his respects to Dorothy for which he is duly called to account in Letter three December twenty four sixteen fifty two Sir You may please to let my old servant as you call him know that I confess I owe much to his merits and the many obligations his kindness and civilities has laid upon me but for the ten pound he claims it is not yet due and I think you may do well to persuade him as a friend to put it in the number of his desperate debts for tis a very uncertain one In all things else pray say I am his servant And now sir let me tell you that I am extremely glad whosoever gave you the occasion to hear from you since without compliment there are very few persons in the world I am more concerned in to find that you have overcome your long journey and that you are well and in a place where tis possible for me to see you is such a satisfaction as I who have not been used to many may be allowed to doubt of Yet I will hope my eyes do not deceive me and that I have not forgot to read but if you please to confirm it to me by another you know how to direct it for I am where I was still the same and always Your humble servant D OSBORNE For missus Paynter In Covent Garden Keep this letter till it be called for Letter three January second sixteen fifty three Sir If there were anything in my letter that pleased you I am extremely glad on t twas all due to you and made it but an equal return for the satisfaction yours gave me And whatsoever you may believe I shall never repent the good opinion I have with so much reason taken up But I forget myself I meant to chide and I think this is nothing towards it Is it possible you came so near me as Bedford and would not see me Seriously I should not have believed it from another would your horse had lost all his legs instead of a hoof that he might not have been able to carry you further and you something that you valued extremely and could not hope to find anywhere but at Chicksands I could wish you a thousand little mischances I am so angry with you for my life I could not imagine how I had lost you or why you should call that a silence of six or eight weeks which you intended so much longer And when I had wearied myself with thinking of all the unpleasing accidents that might cause it I at length sat down with a resolution to choose the best to believe which was that at the end of one journey you had begun another which I had heard you say you intended and that your haste or something else had hindered you from letting me know it In this ignorance your letter from Breda found me But for God s sake let me ask you what you have done all this while you have been away what you have met with in Holland that could keep you there so long why you went no further and why I was not to know you went so far You may do well to satisfy me in all these I shall so persecute you with questions else when I see you that you will be glad to go thither again to avoid me though when that will be I cannot certainly say for my father has so small a proportion of health left him since my mother s death that I am in continual fear of him and dare not often make use of the leave he gives me to be from home lest he should at some time want such little services as I am able to lend him Yet I think to be in London in the next term and am sure I shall desire it because you are there Sir your humble servant Letter four The story of the king who renounced the league with his too fortunate friend is told in the third book of Herodotus Amasis is the king and Polycrates the confederate Dorothy may have read the story in one of the French translations either that of Pierre Saliat a cramped duodecimo published in fifteen eighty or that of P du Ryer a magnificent folio published in sixteen forty six My Lord of Holland s daughter Lady Diana Rich was one of Dorothy s dearest and most intimate friends Dorothy had a high opinion of her excellent wit and noble character which she is never tired of repeating We find allusions to her in many of these letters she is called My lady and her name is always linked to expressions of tenderness and esteem Her father Henry Rich Lord Holland the second son of the Earl of Warwick has found place in sterner history than this He was concerned in a rising in sixteen forty eight when the King was in the Isle of Wight the object of which was to rescue and restore the royal prisoner This rising like Sir Thomas Peyton s miscarried and he suffered defeat at Kingston on Thames on July seventh of that year He was pursued taken prisoner and kept in the Tower until after the King s execution Then he was brought to trial and in accordance with the forms and ceremonies of justice adjudged to death His head was struck off before the gate of Westminster Hall one cold March morning in the following year and by his side died Capel and the Duke of Hamilton By marriage he acquired Holland House Kensington which afterwards passed by purchase into the hands of a very different Lord Holland and has become famous among the houses of London Of his daughter Lady Diana I can learn nothing but that she died unmarried She seems to have been of a lively vivacious temperament and very popular with the other sex There is a slight clue to her character in the following scrap of letter writing still preserved among some old manuscript papers of the Hutton family She writes to mister Hutton to escort her in the Park adding This I am sure you will do because I am a friend to the tobacco box and such I am sure mister Hutton will have more respect for than for any other account that could be pretended unto by Your humble servant This with Dorothy s praise gives us a cheerful opinion of Lady Diana of whom we must always wish to know more January twenty second sixteen fifty three Sir Not to confirm you in your belief in dreams but to avoid your reproaches I will tell you a pleasant one of mine The night before I received your first letter I dreamt one brought me a packet and told me it was from you I that remembered you were by your own appointment to be in Italy at that time asked the messenger where he had it who told me my lady your mother sent him with it to me then my memory failed me a little for I forgot you had told me she was dead and meant to give her many humble thanks if ever I were so happy as to see her When I had opened the letter I found in it two rings one was as I remember an emerald doublet but broken in the carriage I suppose as it might well be coming so far t other was plain gold with the longest and the strangest posy that ever was half on t was Italian which for my life I could not guess at though I spent much time about it the rest was there was a Marriage in Cana of Galilee which though it was Scripture I had not that reverence for it in my sleep that I should have had I think if I had been awake for in earnest the oddness on t put me into that violent laughing that I waked myself with it and as a just punishment upon me from that hour to this I could never learn whom those rings were for nor what was in the letter besides This is but as extravagant as yours for it is as likely that your mother should send me letters as that I should make a journey to see poor people hanged or that your teeth should drop out at this age And to remove the opinions you have of my niceness or being hard to please let me assure you I am far from desiring my husband should be fond of me at threescore that I would not have him so at all Tis true I should be glad to have him always kind and know no reason why he should be wearier of being my master than he was of being my servant But it is very possible I may talk ignorantly of marriage when I come to make sad experiments on it in my own person I shall know more and say less for fear of disheartening others since tis no advantage to foreknow a misfortune that cannot be avoided and for fear of being pitied which of all things I hate Lest you should be of the same humour I will not pity you lame as you are and to speak truth if you did like it you should not have it for you do not deserve it Would any one in the world but you make such haste for a new cold before the old had left him in a year too when mere colds kill as many as a plague used to do Well seriously either resolve to have more care of yourself or I renounce my friendship and as a certain king that my learned knight is very well acquainted with who seeing one of his confederates in so happy a condition as it was not likely to last sent his ambassador presently to break off the league betwixt them lest he should be obliged to mourn the change of his fortune if he continued his friend so I with a great deal more reason do declare that I will no longer be a friend to one that s none to himself nor apprehend the loss of what you hazard every day at tennis They had served you well enough if they had crammed a dozen ounces of that medicine down your throat to have made you remember a quinzy But I have done and am now at leisure to tell you that it is that daughter of my Lord of Holland who makes as you say so many sore eyes with looking on her that is here and if I know her at all or have any judgment her beauty is the least of her excellences And now I speak of her she has given me the occasion to make a request to you it will come very seasonably after my chiding and I have great reason to expect you should be in the humour of doing anything for me She says that seals are much in fashion and by showing me some that she has has set me a longing for some too such as are oldest and oddest are most prized and if you know anybody that is lately come out of Italy tis ten to one but they have a store for they are very common there I do remember you once sealed a letter to me with as fine a one as I have seen It was a Neptune I think riding upon a dolphin but I m afraid it was not yours for I saw it no more My old Roman head is a present for a prince If such things come in your way pray remember me I am sorry my new carrier makes you rise so early tis not good for your cold how might we do that you might lie a bed and yet I have your letter You must use to write before he comes I think that it may be sure to be ready against he goes In earnest consider on t and take some course that your health and my letters may be both secured for the loss of either would be very sensible to Your humble Letter five Sir Justinian is the lover here described He had four daughters and it is one of Dorothy s favourite jests to offer Temple a mother in law s good word if he will pay court to one of them when she has married the Emperor SIR Since you are so easy to please sure I shall not miss it and if my idle dreams and thoughts will satisfy you I am to blame if you want long letters To begin this let me tell you I had not forgot you in your absence I always meant you one of my daughters You should have had your choice and trust me they say some of them are handsome but since things did not succeed I thought to have said nothing on t lest you should imagine I expected thanks for my good intention or rather lest you should be too much affected with the thought of what you have lost by my imprudence It would have been a good strengthening to my Party as you say but in earnest it was not that I aimed at I only desired to have it in my power to oblige you and tis certain I had proved a most excellent mother in law Oh my conscience we should all have joined against him as the common enemy for those poor young wenches are as weary of his government as I could have been He gives them such precepts as they say my Lord of Dorchester gives his wife and keeps them so much prisoners to a vile house he has in Northamptonshire that if but once I had let them loose they and his learning would have been sufficient to have made him mad without my help but his good fortune would have it otherwise to which I will leave him and proceed to give you some reasons why the other motion was not accepted on The truth is I had not that longing to ask a mother in law s blessing which you say you should have had for I knew mine too well to think she could make a good one besides I was not so certain of his nature as not to doubt whether she might not corrupt it nor so confident of his kindness as to assure myself that it would last longer than other people of his age and humour I am sorry to hear he looks ill though I think there is no great danger of him Tis but a fit of an ague he has got that the next charm cures yet he will be apt to fall into it again upon a new occasion and one knows not how it may work upon his thin body if it comes too often it spoiled his beauty sure before I knew him for I could never see it or else which is as likely I do not know it when I see it besides that I never look for it in men It was nothing that I expected made me refuse these but something that I feared and seriously I find I want courage to marry where I do not like If we should once come to disputes I know who would have the worst on t and I have not faith enough to believe a doctrine that is often preach d which is that though at first one has no kindness for them yet it will grow strongly after marriage Let them trust to it that think good for my part I am clearly of opinion and shall die in t that as the more one sees and knows a person that one likes one has still the more kindness for them so on the other side one is but the more weary of and the more averse to an unpleasant humour for having it perpetually by one And though I easily believe that to marry one for whom we have already some affection will infinitely increase that kindness yet I shall never be persuaded that marriage has a charm to raise love out of nothing much less out of dislike This is next to telling you what I dreamed and when I rise but you have promised to be content with it I would now if I could tell you when I shall be in town but I am engaged to my Lady Diana Rich my Lord of Holland s daughter who lies at a gentlewoman s hard by me for sore eyes that I will not leave the country till she does She is so much a stranger here and finds so little company that she is glad of mine till her eyes will give her leave to look out better They are mending and she hopes to be at London before the end of this next term and so do I though I shall make but a short stay for all my business there is at an end when I have seen you and told you my stories And indeed my brother is so perpetually from home that I can be very little unless I would leave my father altogether alone which would not be well We hear of great disorders at your masks but no particulars only they say the Spanish gravity was much discomposed I shall expect the relation from you at your best leisure and pray give me an account how my medicine agrees with your cold This if you can read it for tis strangely scribbled will be enough to answer yours which is not very long this week and I am grown so provident that I will not lay out more than I receive but I am just withal and therefore you know how to make mine longer when you please though to speak truth if I should make this so you would hardly have it this week for tis a good while since twas call d for Your humble servant Letter six The journey that Temple is about to take may be a projected journey with the Swedish Embassy which was soon to set out Temple was apparently on the look out for some employment and we hear at different times of his projected excursions into foreign lands As a matter of fact he stayed in and near London until the spring of sixteen fifty four when he went to Ireland with his father who was then reinstated in his office of Master of the Rolls Whether the mister Grey here written of made love to one or both of the ladies Jane Seymour and Anne Percy it is difficult now to say I have been able to learn nothing more on the subject than Dorothy tells us This however we know for certain that they both married elsewhere Lady Jane Seymour the Duke of Somerset s daughter marrying Lord Clifford of Lonesborough the son of the Earl of Burleigh and living to sixteen seventy nine when she was buried in Westminster Abbey Poor Lady Anne Percy daughter of the Earl of Northumberland and niece of the faithless Lady Carlisle of whom we read in these letters was already married at this date to Lord Stanhope Lord Chesterfield s heir She died probably in childbed in November of next year sixteen fifty four and was buried at Petworth with her infant son Lady Anne Wentworth was the daughter of the famous and ill fated Earl of Strafford She married Lord Rockingham The reader will remember that my lady is Lady Diana Rich March fifth sixteen fifty three SIR I know not how to oblige so civil a person as you are more than by giving you the occasion of serving a fair lady In sober earnest I know you will not think it a trouble to let your boy deliver these books and this enclosed letter where it is directed for my lady whom I would the fainest in the world have you acquainted with that you might judge whether I had not reason to say somebody was to blame But had you reason to be displeased that I said a change in you would be much more pardonable than in him Certainly you had not I spake it very innocently and out of a great sense how much she deserves more than anybody else I shall take heed though hereafter what I write since you are so good at raising doubts to persecute yourself withal and shall condemn my own easy faith no more for me tis a better natured and a less fault to believe too much than to distrust where there is no cause If you were not so apt to quarrel I would tell you that I am glad to hear your journey goes forwarder but you would presently imagine that tis because I would be glad if you were gone need I say that tis because I prefer your interest much before my own because I would not have you lose so good a diversion and so pleasing an entertainment as in all likelihood this voyage will be to you and because the sooner you go the sooner I may hope for your return If it be necessary I will confess all this and something more which is that notwithstanding all my gallantry and resolution tis much for my credit that my courage is put to no greater a trial than parting with you at this distance But you are not going yet neither and therefore we ll leave the discourse on t till then if you please for I find no great entertainment in t And let me ask you whether it be possible that mister Grey makes love they say he does to my Lady Jane Seymour If it were expected that one should give a reason for their passions what could he say for himself He would not offer sure to make us believe my Lady Jane a lovelier person than my Lady Anne Percy I did not think I should have lived to have seen his frozen heart melted tis the greatest conquest she will ever make may it be happy to her but in my opinion he has not a good natured look The younger brother was a servant a great while to my fair neighbour but could not be received and in earnest I could not blame her I was his confidante and heard him make his addresses not that I brag of the favour he did me for anybody might have been so that had been as often there and he was less scrupulous in that point than one would have been that had had less reason But in my life I never heard a man say more nor less to the purpose and if his brother have not a better gift in courtship he will owe my lady s favour to his fortune rather than to his address My Lady Anne Wentworth I hear is marrying but I cannot learn to whom nor is it easy to guess who is worthy of her In my judgment she is without dispute the finest lady I know one always excepted not that she is at all handsome but infinitely virtuous and discreet of a sober and very different humour from most of the young people of these times but has as much wit and is as good company as anybody that ever I saw What would you give that I had but the wit to know when to make an end of my letters Never anybody was persecuted with such long epistles but you will pardon my unwillingness to leave you and notwithstanding all your little doubts believe that I am very much Your faithful friend and humble servant D OSBORNE Letter seven There seem to have been two carriers bringing letters to Dorothy at this time Harrold and Collins we hear something of each of them in the following letters Those who have seen the present day carriers in some unawakened market place in the Midlands heavy rumbling two horse cars of huge capacity whose three miles an hour is fast becoming too sluggish for their enfranchised clients those who have jolted over the frozen ruts of a fen road behind their comfortable Flemish horses and heard the gossip of the farmers and their wives the grunts of the discontented baggage pig and the encouraging shouts of the carrier those in a word who have travelled in a Lincolnshire carrier s cart have I fancy a more correct idea of Dorothy s postmen and their conveyances than any I could quote from authority or draw from imagination Lord Lisle was the son of Robert Sidney Earl of Leicester and brother of the famous Algernon He sat in the Long Parliament for Yarmouth in the Isle of Wight and afterwards became a member of the Upper House Concerning his embassage to Sweden this is again proposed to him in September sixteen fifty three but as we read in the minutes of the Council when he was desired to proceed finding himself out of health he desired to be excused whereupon Council still wishing to send the embassy the Queen of Sweden being favourably inclined to the Commonwealth pitched upon Lord Whitelocke who was willing to go To Lady Sunderland and mister Smith there are several amusing references in these letters Lady Sunderland was the daughter of the Earl of Leicester and sister of Algernon Sydney She was born in sixteen twenty and at the age of nineteen married Henry Lord Spencer who was killed in the battle of Newbury in sixteen forty two After her husband s death she retired to Brington in Northamptonshire until wearied with the heavy load of housekeeping she came to live with her father and mother at Penshurst In the Earl of Leicester s journal under date Thursday July eighth sixteen fifty two we find My daughter Spencer was married to Sir Robert Smith at Penshurst my wife being present with my daughters Strangford and Lacy Pelham Algernon and Robin Sydney et cetera but I was in London From this we may imagine the Earl did not greatly approve the match The ubiquitous Evelyn was there too to see ye marriage of my old fellow collegian mister Robt Smith and the place being full of company he probably enjoyed himself vastly Lady Sunderland was the Sacharissa of Waller the poet SIR I am so great a lover of my bed myself that I can easily apprehend the trouble of rising at four o clock these cold mornings In earnest I m troubled that you should be put to it and have chid the carrier for coming out so soon he swears to me he never comes out of town before eleven o clock and that my Lady Paynter s footman as he calls him brings her letters two hours sooner than he needs to do I told him he was gone one day before the letter came he vows he was not and that your old friend Collins never brought letters of my Lady Paynter s in his life and to speak truth Collins did not bring me that letter I had it from this Harrold two hours before Collins came Yet it is possible all that he says may not be so for I have known better men than he lie therefore if Collins be more for your ease or conveniency make use of him hereafter I know not whether my letter were kind or not but I ll swear yours was not and am sure mine was meant to be so It is not kind in you to desire an increase of my friendship that is to doubt it is not as great already as it can be than which you cannot do me a greater injury Tis my misfortune indeed that it lies not in my power to give you better testimony on t than words otherwise I should soon convince you that tis the best quality I have and that where I own a friendship I mean so perfect a one as time can neither lessen nor increase If I said nothing of my coming to town twas because I had nothing to say that I thought you would like to hear For I do not know that ever I desired anything earnestly in my life but twas denied me and I am many times afraid to wish a thing merely lest my Fortune should take that occasion to use me ill She cannot see and therefore I may venture to write that I intend to be in London if it be possible on Friday or Saturday come sennight Be sure you do not read it aloud lest she hear it and prevent me or drive you away before I come It is so like my luck too that you should be going I know not whither again but trust me I have looked for it ever since I heard you were come home You will laugh sure when I shall tell you that hearing that my Lord Lisle was to go ambassador into Sweden I remember d your father s acquaintance in that family with an apprehension that he might be in the humour of sending you with him But for God s sake whither is it that you go I would not willingly be at such a loss again as I was after your Yorkshire journey If it prove as long a one I shall not forget you but in earnest I shall be so possessed with a strong splenetic fancy that I shall never see you more in this world as all the waters in England will not cure Well this is a sad story we ll have no more on t I humbly thank you for your offer of your head but if you were an emperor I should not be so bold with you as to claim your promise you might find twenty better employments for t Only with your gracious leave I think I should be a little exalted with remembering that you had been once my friend twould more endanger growing proud than being Sir Justinian s mistress and yet he thought me pretty well inclin d to t then Lord what would I give that I had a Latin letter of his for you that he writ to a great friend at Oxford where he gives him a long and learned character of me twould serve you to laugh at this seven years If I remember what was told me on t the worst of my faults was a height he would not call it pride that was as he had heard the humour of my family and the best of my commendations was that I was capable of being company and conversation for him But you do not tell me yet how you found him out If I had gone about to conceal him I had been sweetly serv d I shall take heed of you hereafter because there is no very great likelihood of your being an emperor or that if you were I should have your head I have sent into Italy for seals tis to be hoped by that time mine come over they may be of fashion again for tis an humour that your old acquaintance mister Smith and his lady have brought up they say she wears twenty strung upon a ribbon like the nuts boys play withal and I do not hear of anything else mister Howard presented his mistress but a dozen such seals as are not to be valued as times now go But a propos of Monsr Smith what a scape has he made of my Lady Barbury and who would e er have dreamt he should have had my Lady Sunderland though he be a very fine gentleman and does more than deserve her I think I shall never forgive her one thing she said of him which was that she married him out of pity it was the pitifullest saying that ever I heard and made him so contemptible that I should not have married him for that reason This is a strange letter sure I have not time to read it over but I have said anything that came into my head to put you out of your dumps For God s sake be in better humour and assure yourself I am as much as you can wish Your faithful friend and servant Letter eight The name of Algernon Sydney occurs more than once in these pages and it is therefore only right to remind the reader of some of the leading facts in his life He was born in sixteen twenty two and was the second son of Robert Earl of Leicester He was educated in Paris and Italy and first served in the army in Ireland On his recall to England he espoused the popular cause and fought on that side in the battle of Marston Moor In sixteen fifty one he was elected a member of the Council of State and in this situation he continued to act until sixteen fifty three It is unnecessary to mention his republican sympathies and after the dismissal of the Parliament his future actions concern us but little He was arrested tried and executed in sixteen eighty three on the pretence of being concerned in the Rye House Plot Arundel Howard was Henry second son of the Earl of Arundel His father died July twelve sixteen fifty two Dorothy would call him Arundel Howard to distinguish him from the Earl of Berkshire s family SIR You have made me so rich as I am able to help my neighbours There is a little head cut in an onyx that I take to be a very good one and the dolphin is as you say the better for being cut less the oddness of the figures makes the beauty of these things If you saw one that my brother sent my Lady Diana last week you would believe it were meant to fright people withal twas brought out of the Indies and cut there for an idol s head they took the devil himself for their pattern that did it for in my life I never saw so ugly a thing and yet she is as fond on t as if it were as lovely as she herself is Her eyes have not the flames they have had nor is she like I am afraid to recover them here but were they irrecoverably lost the beauty of her mind were enough to make her outshine everybody else and she would still be courted by all that knew how to value her like la belle aveugle that was Philip the second of France his mistress I am wholly ignorant of the story you mention and am confident you are not well inform d for tis impossible she should ever have done anything that were unhandsome If I knew who the person were that is concern d in t she allows me so much freedom with her that I could easily put her upon the discourse and I do not think she would use much of disguise in it towards me I should have guessed it Algernon Sydney but that I cannot see in him that likelihood of a fortune which you seem to imply by saying tis not present But if you should mean by that that tis possible his wit and good parts may raise him to one you must pardon if I am not of your opinion for I do not think these are times for anybody to expect preferment in that deserves it and in the best twas ever too uncertain for a wise body to trust to But I am altogether of your mind that my Lady Sunderland is not to be followed in her marrying fashion and that mister Smith never appear d less her servant than in desiring it to speak truth it was convenient for neither of them and in meaner people had been plain undoing one another which I cannot understand to be kindness of either side She has lost by it much of the repute she had gained by keeping herself a widow it was then believed that wit and discretion were to be reconciled in her person that have so seldom been persuaded to meet in anybody else But we are all mortal I did not mean that Howard Twas Arundel Howard And the seals were some remainders that showed his father s love to antiquities and therefore cost him dear enough if that would make them good I am sorry I cannot follow your counsel in keeping fair with Fortune I am not apt to suspect without just cause but in earnest if I once find anybody faulty towards me they lose me for ever I have forsworn being twice deceived by the same person For God s sake do not say she has the spleen I shall hate it worse than ever I did nor that it is a disease of the wits I shall think you abuse me for then I am sure it would not be mine but were it certain that they went together always I dare swear there is nobody so proud of their wit as to keep it upon such terms but would be glad after they had endured it a while to let them both go as they came I know nothing yet that is likely to alter my resolution of being in town on Saturday next but I am uncertain where I shall be and therefore it will be best that I send you word when I am there I should be glad to see you sooner but that I do not know myself what company I may have with me I meant this letter longer when I begun it but an extreme cold that I have taken lies so in my head and makes it ache so violently that I hardly see what I do I ll e en to bed as soon as I have told you that I am very much Your faithful friend and servant D OSBORNE CHAPTER III LIFE AT CHICKSANDS sixteen fifty three Letter nine Temple s sister here mentioned was his only sister Martha who married Sir Thomas Giffard in sixteen sixty two and was left a widow within two months of her marriage She afterwards lived with Temple and his wife was a great favourite with them and their confidential friend Lady Giffard has left a manuscript life of her brother from which the historian Courtenay deigned to extract some information whereby we in turn have benefited She outlived both her brother and his wife to carry on a warlike encounter with her brother s amanuensis mister Jonathan Swift over Temple s literary remains Esther Johnson the unfortunate Stella was Lady Giffard s maid Cleopatre and Le Grand Cyrus appear to have been Dorothy s literary companions at this date She would read these in the original French and as she tells us somewhere had a scorn of translations Both these romances were much admired even by people of taste a thing difficult to understand until we remember that Fielding the first and greatest English novelist was yet unborn and novels as we know them non existing Both the romances found translators Cyrus in one mysterious F G Gent the translation was published in this year Cleopatre in Richard Loveday an elegant letter writer of this time Artamenes or Le Grand Cyrus the masterpiece of Mademoiselle Madeleine de Scuderi is contained in no less than ten volumes each of which in its turn has many books it is in fact more a collection of romances than a single romance La Cleopatre a similar work was originally published in twenty three volumes of twelve parts each part containing three or four books It is but a collection of short stories Its author rejoiced in the romantic title of Gauthier de Costes Chevalier Seigneur de la Calprenede he published Cleopatre in sixteen forty two he was the author of other romances and some tragedies noted only for their worthlessness Even Richelieu quoiqu admirateur indulgent de la mediocrite could not stand Calprenede s tragedies Reine Marguerite is probably the translation by Robert Codrington of the Memorials of Margaret of Valois first wife of Henri IV Bussy is a servant of the Duke of Avenson Margaret s brother with whom Margaret is very intimate Of Lady Sunderland and mister Smith we have already sufficient knowledge As for Sir Justinian we are not to think he was already married the reference to his new wife is merely jocular meaning his new wife when he shall get one for Sir Justinian is still wife hunting and comes back to renew his suit with Dorothy after this date Your fellow servant who is as often called Jane appears to have been a friend and companion of Dorothy in a somewhat lower rank of life missus Goldsmith mentioned in a subsequent letter wife of Daniel Goldsmith the rector of Campton in which parish Chicksands was situated acted as chaperon or duenna companion to Dorothy and Jane was it seems to me in a similar position only being a younger woman than the rector s wife she was more the companion and less the duenna The servants and companions of ladies of that date were themselves gentlewomen of good breeding Waller writes verses to missus Braughton servant to Sacharissa commencing his lines Fair fellow servant Temple had he written verse to his mistress would probably have left us some Lines to Jane There is in Campton Church a tablet erected to Daniel Goldsmith Ecclesiae de Campton Pastor idem et Patronus also to Maria Goldsmith uxor dilectissima This is erected by Maria s faithful sister Jane Wright and if the astute reader shall think fit to agree with me in believing Temple s fellow servant to be this Jane Wright on such slender evidence and slight thread of argument he may well do so Failing this all search after Jane will I fear prove futile at this distant date There are constant references to Jane in the letters Her old woman in the same passage is of course a jocular allusion to Dorothy herself and the old knight is I believe Sir Robert Cook a Bedfordshire gentleman of whom nothing is known except that he was knighted at Ampthill July twenty first sixteen twenty one We hear some little more of him from Dorothy Note well the signature of this and following letters it will help us to discover what passed between the friends in London For my own part I do not think Dorothy means that she has ceased to be faithful in that she has become his affectionate friend and servant SIR I was so kind as to write to you by the coachman and let me tell you I think twas the greatest testimony of my friendship that I could give you for trust me I was so tired with my journey so dowd with my cold and so out of humour with our parting that I should have done it with great unwillingness to anybody else I lay abed all next day to recover myself and rised a Thursday to receive your letter with the more ceremony I found no fault with the ill writing twas but too easy to read methought for I am sure I had done much sooner than I could have wished But in earnest I was heartily troubled to find you in so much disorder I would not have you so kind to me as to be cruel to yourself in whom I am more concerned No for God s sake let us not make afflictions of such things as these I am afraid we shall meet with too many real ones I am glad your journey holds because I think twill be a good diversion for you this summer but I admire your father s patience that lets you rest with so much indifference when there is such a fortune offered I ll swear I have great scruples of conscience myself on the point and am much afraid I am not your friend if I am any part of the occasion that hinders you from accepting it Yet I am sure my intentions towards you are very innocent and good for you are one of those whose interests I shall ever prefer much above my own and you are not to thank me for it since to speak truth I secure my own by it for I defy my ill fortune to make me miserable unless she does it in the persons of my friends I wonder how your father came to know I was in town unless my old friend your cousin Hammond should tell him Pray for my sake be a very obedient son all your faults will be laid to my charge else and alas I have too many of my own You say nothing how your sister does which makes me hope there is no more of danger in her sickness Pray when it may be no trouble to her tell her how much I am her servant and have a care of yourself this cold weather I have read your Reine Marguerite and will return it you when you please If you will have my opinion of her I think she had a good deal of wit and a great deal of patience for a woman of so high a spirit She speaks with too much indifference of her husband s several amours and commends Bussy as if she were a little concerned in him I think her a better sister than a wife and believe she might have made a better wife to a better husband But the story of Mademoiselle de Tournon is so sad that when I had read it I was able to go no further and was fain to take up something else to divert myself withal Have you read Cleopatre I have six tomes on t here that I can lend you if you have not there are some stories in t you will like I believe But what an ass am I to think you can be idle enough at London to read romance No I ll keep them till you come hither here they may be welcome to you for want of better company Yet that you may not imagine we are quite out of the world here and so be frighted from coming I can assure you we are seldom without news such as it is and at this present we do abound with stories of my Lady Sunderland and mister Smith with what reverence he approaches her and how like a gracious princess she receives him that they say tis worth one s going twenty miles to see it All our ladies are mightily pleased with the example but I do not find that the men intend to follow it and I ll undertake Sir Solomon Justinian wishes her in the Indias for fear she should pervert his new wife Your fellow servant kisses your hands and says If you mean to make love to her old woman this is the best time you can take for she is dying this cold weather kills her I think It has undone me I am sure in killing an old knight that I have been waiting for this seven year and now he dies and will leave me nothing I believe but leaves a rich widow for somebody I think you had best come a wooing to her I have a good interest in her and it shall be all employed in your service if you think fit to make any addresses there But to be sober now again for God s sake send me word how your journey goes forward when you think you shall begin it and how long it may last when I may expect your coming this way and of all things remember to provide a safe address for your letters when you are abroad This is a strange confused one I believe for I have been called away twenty times since I sat down to write it to my father who is not well but you will pardon it we are past ceremony and excuse me if I say no more now but that I am toujours le mesme that is ever Your affectionate friend and servant Letter ten Dorothy is suffering from the spleen a disease as common to day as then though we have lost the good name for it This and the ague plague her continually My Lord Lisle s proposed embassy to Sweden is we see still delayed ultimately Bulstrode Whitelocke is chosen ambassador Dorothy s cousin Molle here mentioned seems to have been an old bachelor who spent his time at one country house or another visiting his country friends and playing the bore not a little I should fear with his gossip and imaginary ailments Temple s father was at this time trying to arrange a match for him with a certain missus Ch as Dorothy calls her Courtenay thinks she may be one Mistress Chambers an heiress who ultimately married Temple s brother John and this conjecture is here followed SIR Your last letter came like a pardon to one upon the block I had given over the hopes on t having received my letters by the other carrier who was always wont to be last The loss put me hugely out of order and you would have both pitied and laughed at me if you could have seen how woodenly I entertained the widow who came hither the day before and surprised me very much Not being able to say anything I got her to cards and there with a great deal of patience lost my money to her or rather I gave it as my ransom In the midst of our play in comes my blessed boy with your letter and in earnest I was not able to disguise the joy it gave me though one was by that is not much your friend and took notice of a blush that for my life I could not keep back I put up the letter in my pocket and made what haste I could to lose the money I had left that I might take occasion to go fetch some more but I did not make such haste back again I can assure you I took time enough to have coined myself some money if I had had the art on t and left my brother enough to make all his addresses to her if he were so disposed I know not whether he was pleased or not but I am sure I was You make so reasonable demands that tis not fit you should be denied You ask my thoughts but at one hour you will think me bountiful I hope when I shall tell you that I know no hour when you have them not No in earnest my very dreams are yours and I have got such a habit of thinking of you that any other thought intrudes and proves uneasy to me I drink your health every morning in a drench that would poison a horse I believe and tis the only way I have to persuade myself to take it Tis the infusion of steel and makes me so horridly sick that every day at ten o clock I am making my will and taking leave of all my friends You will believe you are not forgot then They tell me I must take this ugly drink a fortnight and then begin another as bad but unless you say so too I do not think I shall Tis worse than dying by the half I am glad your father is so kind to you I shall not dispute it with him because it is much more in his power than in mine but I shall never yield that tis more in his desire since he was much pleased with that which was a truth when you told it him but would have been none if he had asked the question sooner He thought there was no danger of you since you were more ignorant and less concerned in my being in town than he If I were missus Chambers he would be more my friend but however I am much his servant as he is your father I have sent you your book And since you are at leisure to consider the moon you may be enough to read Cleopatre therefore I have sent you three tomes when you have done with these you shall have the rest and I believe they will please There is a story of Artemise that I will recommend to you her disposition I like extremely it has a great deal of practical wit and if you meet with one Brittomart pray send me word how you like him I am not displeased that my Lord Lisle makes no more haste for though I am very willing you should go the journey for many reasons yet two or three months hence sure will be soon enough to visit so cold a country and I would not have you endure two winters in one year Besides I look for my eldest brother and cousin Molle here shortly and I should be glad to have nobody to entertain but you whilst you are here Lord that you had the invisible ring or Fortunatus his wishing hat now at this instant you should be here My brother has gone to wait upon the widow homewards she that was born to persecute you and I I think She has so tired me with being here but two days that I do not think I shall accept of the offer she made me of living with her in case my father dies before I have disposed of myself Yet we are very great friends and for my comfort she says she will come again about the latter end of June and stay longer with me My aunt is still in town kept by her business which I am afraid will not go well they do so delay it and my precious uncle does so visit her and is so kind that without doubt some mischief will follow Do you know his son my cousin Harry Tis a handsome youth and well natured but such a goose and she has bred him so strangely that he needs all his ten thousand a year I would fain have him marry my Lady Diana she was his mistress when he was a boy He had more wit then than he has now I think and I have less wit than he sure for spending my paper upon him when I have so little Here is hardly room for Your affectionate friend and servant Letter eleven It is a curious thing to find the Lord General s son among our loyal Dorothy s servants and to find moreover that he will be as acceptable to Dorothy as any other if she may not marry Temple Henry Cromwell was Oliver Cromwell s second son How Dorothy became acquainted with him it is impossible to say Perhaps they met in France He seems to have been entirely unlike his father Good missus Hutchinson calls him a debauched ungodly Cavalier with other similar expressions of Presbyterian abhorrence from which we need not draw any unkinder conclusion than that he was no solemn puritanical soldier but a man of the world brighter and more courteous than the frequenters of his father s Council and therefore more acceptable to Dorothy He was born at Huntingdon in sixteen twenty seven the year of Dorothy s birth He was captain under Harrison in sixteen forty seven colonel in Ireland with his father in sixteen forty nine and married at Kensington Church on May tenth sixteen fifty three to Elizabeth daughter of Sir Francis Russell of Chippenham Cambridgeshire He was made Lord Deputy in Ireland in sixteen fifty seven but he wearied of the work of transplanting the Irish and planting the new settlers which he writes only brought him disquiet of body and mind This led to his retirement from public life in sixteen fifty eight Two years afterwards at the Restoration he came to live at Spinney Abbey near Isham Cambridgeshire and died on the twenty third of March sixteen seventy three These are shortly the facts which remain to us of the life of Henry Cromwell Dorothy s favoured servant SIR I am so far from thinking you ill natured for wishing I might not outlive you that I should not have thought you at all kind if you had done otherwise no in earnest I was never yet so in love with my life but that I could have parted with it upon a much less occasion than your death and twill be no compliment to you to say it would be very uneasy to me then since tis not very pleasant to me now Yet you will say I take great pains to preserve it as ill as I like it but no I ll swear tis not that I intend in what I do all that I aim at is but to keep myself from proving a beast They do so fright me with strange stories of what the spleen will bring me to in time that I am kept in awe with them like a child they tell me twill not leave me common sense that I shall hardly be fit company for my own dogs and that it will end either in a stupidness that will make me incapable of anything or fill my head with such whims as will make me ridiculous To prevent this who would not take steel or anything though I am partly of your opinion that tis an ill kind of physic Yet I am confident that I take it the safest way for I do not take the powder as many do but only lay a piece of steel in white wine over night and drink the infusion next morning which one would think were nothing and yet tis not to be imagined how sick it makes me for an hour or two and which is the misery all that time one must be using some kind of exercise Your fellow servant has a blessed time on t that ever you saw I make her play at shuttlecock with me and she is the veriest bungler at it ever you saw Then am I ready to beat her with the battledore and grow so peevish as I grow sick that I ll undertake she wishes there were no steel in England But then to recompense the morning I am in good humour all the day after for joy that I am well again I am told twill do me good and am content to believe it if it does not I am but where I was I do not use to forget my old acquaintances Almanzor is as fresh in my memory as if I had visited his tomb but yesterday though it be at least seven year agone since You will believe I had not been used to great afflictions when I made his story such a one to me as I cried an hour together for him and was so angry with Alcidiana that for my life I could never love her after it You do not tell me whether you received the books I sent you but I will hope you did because you say nothing to the contrary They are my dear Lady Diana s and therefore I am much concerned that they should be safe And now I speak of her she is acquainted with your aunt my Lady B and says all that you say of her If her niece has so much wit will you not be persuaded to like her or say she has not quite so much may not her fortune make it up In earnest I know not what to say but if your father does not use all his kindness and all his power to make you consider your own advantage he is not like other fathers Can you imagine that he that demands Lfive thousand besides the reversion of an estate will like bare Lfour thousand Such miracles are seldom seen and you must prepare to suffer a strange persecution unless you grow conformable therefore consider what you do tis the part of a friend to advise you I could say a great deal to this purpose and tell you that tis not discreet to refuse a good offer nor safe to trust wholly to your own judgment in your disposal I was never better provided in my life for a grave admonishing discourse Would you had heard how I have been catechized for you and seen how soberly I sit and answer to interrogatories Would you think that upon examination it is found that you are not an indifferent person to me But the mischief is that what my intentions or resolutions are is not to be discovered though much pains has been taken to collect all scattering circumstances and all the probable conjectures that can be raised from thence has been urged to see if anything would be confessed And all this done with so much ceremony and compliment so many pardons asked for undertaking to counsel or inquire and so great kindness and passion for all my interests professed that I cannot but take it well though I am very weary on t You are spoken of with the reverence due to a person that I seem to like and for as much as they know of you you do deserve a very good esteem but your fortune and mine can never agree and in plain terms we forfeit our discretions and run wilfully upon our own ruins if there be such a thought To all this I make no reply but that if they will needs have it that I am not without kindness for you they must conclude withal that tis no part of my intention to ruin you and so the conference breaks up for that time All this is from my friend that is not yours and the gentleman that came upstairs in a basket I could tell him that he spends his breath to very little purpose and has but his labour for his pains Without his precepts my own judgment would preserve me from doing anything that might be prejudicial to you or unjustifiable to the world but if these be secured nothing can alter the resolution I have taken of settling my whole stock of happiness upon the affection of a person that is dear to me whose kindness I shall infinitely prefer before any other consideration whatsoever and I shall not blush to tell you that you have made the whole world beside so indifferent to me that if I cannot be yours they may dispose of me how they please Henry Cromwell will be as acceptable to me as any one else If I may undertake to counsel I think you shall do well to comply with your father as far as possible and not to discover any aversion to what he desires further than you can give reason for What his disposition may be I know not but tis that of many parents to judge their children s dislikes to be an humour of approving nothing that is chosen for them which many times makes them take up another of denying their children all they choose for themselves I find I am in the humour of talking wisely if my paper would give me leave Tis great pity here is room for no more but Your faithful friend and servant Letter twelve SIR There shall be two posts this week for my brother sends his groom up and I am resolved to make some advantage of it Pray what the paper denied me in your last let me receive by him Your fellow servant is a sweet jewel to tell tales of me The truth is I cannot deny but that I have been very careless of myself but alas who would have been other I never thought my life worth my care whilst nobody was concerned in t but myself now I shall look upon t as something that you would not lose and therefore shall endeavour to keep it for you But then you must return my kindness with the same care of a life that s much dearer to me I shall not be so unreasonable as to desire that for my satisfaction you should deny yourself a recreation that is pleasing to you and very innocent sure when tis not used in excess but I cannot consent you should disorder yourself with it and Jane was certainly in the right when she told you I would have chid if I had seen you so endanger a health that I am so much concerned in But for what she tell you of my melancholy you must not believe she thinks nobody in good humour unless they laugh perpetually as Nan and she does which I was never given to much and now I have been so long accustomed to my own natural dull humour that nothing can alter it Tis not that I am sad for as long as you and the rest of my friends are well I thank God I have no occasion to be so but I never appear to be very merry and if I had all that I could wish for in the world I do not think it would make any visible change in my humour And yet with all my gravity I could not but laugh at your encounter in the Park though I was not pleased that you should leave a fair lady and go lie upon the cold ground That is full as bad as overheating yourself at tennis and therefore remember tis one of the things you are forbidden You have reason to think your father kind and I have reason to think him very civil all his scruples are very just ones but such as time and a little good fortune if we were either of us lucky to it might satisfy He may be confident I can never think of disposing myself without my father s consent and though he has left it more in my power than almost anybody leaves a daughter yet certainly I were the worst natured person in the world if his kindness were not a greater tie upon me than any advantage he could have reserved Besides that tis my duty from which nothing can ever tempt me nor could you like it in me if I should do otherwise twould make me unworthy of your esteem but if ever that may be obtained or I left free and you in the same condition all the advantages of fortune or person imaginable met together in one man should not be preferred before you I think I cannot leave you better than with this assurance Tis very late and having been abroad all this day I knew not till e en now of this messenger Good night to you There need be no excuse for the conclusion of your letter Nothing can please me better Once more good night I am half in a dream already Your Letter thirteen There is some allusion here to an inconstant lover of my Lady Diana Rich who seems to have deserted his mistress on account of the sore eyes with which Dorothy told us in a former letter her friend was afflicted I cannot find any account of the great shop above the Exchange The Flower Pott There were two or three Flower Pots in London at this time one in Leadenhall Street and another in saint James Market An interesting account of the old sign is given in a work on London tradesmen s tokens in which it is said to be derived from the earlier representations of the salutations of the angel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary in which either lilies were placed in his hand or they were set as an accessory in a vase As Popery declined the angel disappeared and the lily pot became a vase of flowers subsequently the Virgin was omitted and there remained only the vase of flowers Since to make things more unmistakeable two debonair gentlemen with hat in hand have superseded the floral elegancies of the olden time and the poetry of the art seems lost SIR I am glad you scaped a beating but in earnest would it had lighted on my brother s groom I think I should have beaten him myself if I had been able I have expected your letter all this day with the greatest impatience that was possible and at last resolved to go out and meet the fellow and when I came down to the stables I found him come had set up his horse and was sweeping the stable in great order I could not imagine him so very a beast as to think his horses were to be serv d before me and therefore was presently struck with an apprehension he had no letter for me it went cold to my heart as ice and hardly left me courage enough to ask him the question but when he had drawled it out that he thought there was a letter for me in his bag I quickly made him leave his broom Twas well tis a dull fellow he could not but have discern d else that I was strangely overjoyed with it and earnest to have it for though the poor fellow made what haste he could to untie his bag I did nothing but chide him for being so slow Last I had it and in earnest I know not whether an entire diamond of the bigness on t would have pleased me half so well if it would it must be only out of this consideration that such a jewel would make me rich enough to dispute you with missus Chambers and perhaps make your father like me as well I like him I ll swear and extremely too for being so calm in a business where his desires were so much crossed Either he has a great power over himself or you have a great interest in him or both If you are pleased it should end thus I cannot dislike it but if it would have been happy for you I should think myself strangely unfortunate in being the cause that it went not further I cannot say that I prefer your interest before my own because all yours are so much mine that tis impossible for me to be happy if you are not so but if they could be divided I am certain I should And though you reproached me with unkindness for advising you not to refuse a good offer yet I shall not be discouraged from doing it again when there is occasion for I am resolved to be your friend whether you will or no And for example though I know you do not need my counsel yet I cannot but tell you that I think twere very well that you took some care to make my Lady B your friend and oblige her by your civilities to believe that you were sensible of the favour was offered you though you had not the grace to make good use on t In very good earnest now she is a woman by all that I have heard of her that one would not lose besides that twill become you to make some satisfaction for downright refusing a young lady twas unmercifully done Would to God you would leave that trick of making excuses Can you think it necessary to me or believe that your letters can be so long as to make them unpleasing to me Are mine so to you If they are not yours never will be so to me You see I say anything to you out of a belief that though my letters were more impertinent than they are you would not be without them nor wish them shorter Why should you be less kind If your fellow servant has been with you she has told you I part with her but for her advantage That I shall always be willing to do but whensoever she shall think fit to serve again and is not provided of a better mistress she knows where to find me I have sent you the rest of Cleopatre pray keep them all in your hands and the next week I will send you a letter and directions where you shall deliver that and the books for my lady Is it possible that she can be indifferent to anybody Take heed of telling me such stories if all those excellences she is rich in cannot keep warm a passion without the sunshine of her eyes what are poor people to expect and were it not a strange vanity in me to believe yours can be long lived It would be very pardonable in you to change but sure in him tis a mark of so great inconstancy as shows him of an humour that nothing can fix When you go into the Exchange pray call at the great shop above The Flower Pott I spoke to Heams the man of the shop when I was in town for a quart of orange flower water he had none that was good then but promised to get me some Pray put him in mind of it and let him show it you before he sends it me for I will not altogether trust to his honesty you see I make no scruple of giving you little idle commissions tis a freedom you allow me and that I should be glad you would take The Frenchman that set my seals lives between Salisbury House and the Exchange at a house that was not finished when I was there and the master of the shop his name is Walker he made me pay fiftys for three but twas too dear You will meet with a story in these parts of Cleopatre that pleased me more than any that ever I read in my life tis of one Delie pray give me your opinion of her and her prince This letter is writ in great haste as you may see tis my brother s sick day and I m not willing to leave him long alone I forgot to tell you in my last that he was come hither to try if he can lose an ague here that he got in Gloucestershire He asked me for you very kindly and if he knew I writ to you I should have something to say from him besides what I should say for myself if I had room Yrs Letter fourteen This letter contains the most interesting political reference of the whole series Either Temple has written Dorothy an account of Cromwell s dissolving the Long Parliament or perhaps some news letter has found its way to Chicksands with the astounding news All England is filled with intense excitement over Cromwell s coup d etat and it cannot be uninteresting to quote a short contemporary account of the business Algernon Sydney s father the Earl of Leicester whose journal has already been quoted under date Wednesday April twentieth sixteen fifty three writes as follows My Lord General came into the House clad in plain black clothes with grey worsted stockings and sat down as he used to do in an ordinary place Then he began to speak and presently he put on his hat went out of his place and walked up and down the stage or floor in the midst of the House with his hat on his head and chid them soundly After this had gone on for some time Colonel Harrison was called in to remove the Speaker which he did and it happened that Algernon Sydney sat next to the Speaker on the right hand The General said to Harrison Put him out Harrison spake to Sydney to go out but he said he would not go out and waited still The General said again Put him out Then Harrison and Wortley Worsley put their hands upon Sydney s shoulders as if they would force him to go out Then he rose and went towards the door Such is the story which reaches Dorothy and startles all England at this date SIR That you may be sure it was a dream that I writ that part of my letter in I do not now remember what it was I writ but seems it was very kind and possibly you owe the discovery on t to my being asleep But I do not repent it for I should not love you if I did not think you discreet enough to be trusted with the knowledge of all my kindness Therefore tis not that I desire to hide it from you but that I do not love to tell it and perhaps if you could read my heart I should make less scruple of your seeing on t there than in my letters I can easily guess who the pretty young lady is for there are but two in England of that fortune and they are sisters but I am to seek who the gallant should be If it be no secret you may tell me However I shall wish him all good success if he be your friend as I suppose he is by his confidence in you If it be neither of the Spencers I wish it were I have not seen two young men that looked as if they deserved better fortunes so much as those brothers But bless me what will become of us all now Is not this a strange turn What does my Lord Lisle Sure this will at least defer your journey Tell me what I must think on t whether it be better or worse or whether you are at all concern d in t For if you are not I am not only if I had been so wise as to have taken hold of the offer was made me by Henry Cromwell I might have been in a fair way of preferment for sure they will be greater now than ever Is it true that Algernon Sydney was so unwilling to leave the House that the General was fain to take the pains to turn him out himself Well tis a pleasant world this If mister Pim were alive again I wonder what he would think of these proceedings and whether this would appear so great a breach of the Privilege of Parliament as the demanding the five members But I shall talk treason by and by if I do not look to myself Tis safer talking of the orange flower water you sent me The carrier has given me a great charge to tell you that it came safe and that I must do him right As you say tis not the best I have seen nor the worst I shall expect your Diary next week though this will be but a short letter you may allow me to make excuses too sometimes but seriously my father is now so continuously ill that I have hardly time for anything Tis but an ague that he has but yet I am much afraid that is more than his age and weakness will be able to bear he keeps his bed and never rises but to have it made and most times faints with that You ought in charity to write as much as you can for in earnest my life here since my father s sickness is so sad that to another humour than mine it would be unsupportable but I have been so used to misfortunes that I cannot be much surprised with them though perhaps I am as sensible of them as another I ll leave you for I find these thoughts begin to put me in ill humour farewell may you be ever happy If I am so at all it is in being Your Letter fifteen What Temple had written about mister Arbry s prophecy and the falling down of the form we cannot know mister Arbry was probably William Erbury vicar of saint Mary s Cardiff a noted schismatic He is said to have been a holy harmless man but incurred both the hate and ridicule of his opponents Many of his tracts are still extant and they contain extravagant prophecies couched in the peculiar phraseology of the day The celebrated Sir Samuel Luke was a near neighbour of the Osbornes and mister Luke was one of his numerous family Sir Samuel was Lord of the Manor of Hawnes and in the Hawnes parish register there are notices of the christenings of his sons and daughters Sir Samuel was not only a colonel in the Parliament Army but Scout Master General in the counties of Bedford and Surrey Samuel Butler the author of Hudibras lived with Sir Samuel Luke as his secretary at some date prior to the Restoration and doctor Grey his learned editor believes that he wrote Hudibras about that time because he had then the opportunity to converse with those living characters of rebellion nonsense and hypocrisy which he so lively and pathetically exposes throughout the whole work Sir Samuel is said himself to be the original Hudibras and if doctor Grey s conjecture on this matter is a right one we have already in our minds a very complete portrait of Dorothy s neighbour The old ballad that Dorothy encloses to her lover has not been preserved with her letter If it is older than the ballad of The Lord of Lorne it must have been composed before Henry VIII s reign for Edward Guilpin in his Skialethia fifteen ninety eight speaks of Th olde ballad of the Lord of Lorne Whose last line in King Harrie s day was borne The Lord of Learne this was the old spelling may be found in Bishop Percy s well known collection of Ballads and Romances SIR You must pardon me I could not burn your other letter for my life I was so pleased to see I had so much to read and so sorry I had done so soon that I resolved to begin them again and had like to have lost my dinner by it I know not what humour you were in when you writ it but mister Arbry s prophecy and the falling down of the form did a little discompose my gravity But I quickly recovered myself with thinking that you deserved to be chid for going where you knew you must of necessity lose your time In earnest I had a little scruple when I went with you thither and but that I was assured it was too late to go any whither else and believed it better to hear an ill sermon than none I think I should have missed his Belles remarques You had repented you I hope of that and all other your faults before you thought of dying What a satisfaction you had found out to make me for the injuries you say you have done me And yet I cannot tell neither though tis not the remedy I should choose whether that were not a certain one for all my misfortunes for sure I should have nothing then to persuade me to stay longer where they grow and I should quickly take a resolution of leaving them and the world at once I agree with you too that I do not see any great likelihood of the change of our fortunes and that we have much more to wish than to hope for but tis so common a calamity that I dare not murmur at it better people have endured it and I can give no reason why almost all are denied the satisfaction of disposing themselves to their own desires but that it is a happiness too great for this world and might endanger one s forgetting the next whereas if we are crossed in that which only can make the world pleasing to us we are quickly tired with the length of our journey and the disquiet of our inns and long to be at home One would think it were I who had heard the three sermons and were trying to make a fourth these are truths that might become a pulpit better than mister Arbry s predictions But lest you should think I have as many worms in my head as he I ll give over in time and tell you how far mister Luke and I are acquainted He lives within three or four miles of me and one day that I had been to visit a lady that is nearer him than me as I came back I met a coach with some company in t that I knew and thought myself obliged to salute We all lighted and met and I found more than I looked for by two damsels and their squires I was afterwards told they were of the Lukes and possibly this man might be there or else I never saw him for since these times we have had no commerce with that family but have kept at great distance as having on several occasions been disobliged by them But of late I know not how Sir Sam has grown so kind as to send to me for some things he desired out of this garden and withal made the offer of what was in his which I had reason to take for a high favour for he is a nice florist and since this we are insensibly come to as good degrees of civility for one another as can be expected from people that never meet Who those demoiselles should be that were at Heamses I cannot imagine and I know so few that are concerned in me or my name that I admire you should meet with so many that seem to be acquainted with it Sure if you had liked them you would not have been so sullen and a less occasion would have served to make you entertain their discourse if they had been handsome And yet I know no reason I have to believe that beauty is any argument to make you like people unless I had more on t myself But be it what it will that displeased you I am glad they did not fright you away before you had the orange flower water for it is very good and I am so sweet with it a days that I despise roses When I have given you humble thanks for it I mean to look over your other letter and take the heads and to treat of them in order as my time and your patience shall give me leave And first for my Sheriff let me desire you to believe he has more courage than to die upon a denial No thanks be to God none of my servants are given to that I hear of many every day that do marry but of none that do worse My brother sent me word this week that my fighting servant is married too and with the news this ballad which was to be sung in the grave that you dreamt of I think but because you tell me I shall not want company then you may dispose of this piece of poetry as you please when you have sufficiently admired with me where he found it out for tis much older than that of my Lord of Lorne You are altogether in the right that my brother will never be at quiet till he sees me disposed of but he does not mean to lose me by it he knows that if I were married at this present I should not be persuaded to leave my father as long as he lives and when this house breaks up he is resolved to follow me if he can which he thinks he might better do to a house where I had some power than where I am but upon courtesy myself Besides that he thinks it would be to my advantage to be well bestowed and by that he understands richly He is much of your sister s humour and many times wishes me a husband that loved me as well as he does though he seems to doubt the possibility on t but never desires that I should love that husband with any passion and plainly tells me so He says it would not be so well for him nor perhaps for me that I should for he is of opinion that all passions have more of trouble than satisfaction in them and therefore they are happiest that have least of them You think him kind from a letter that you met with of his sure there was very little of anything in that or else I should not have employed it to wrap a book up But seriously I many times receive letters from him that were they seen without an address to me or his name nobody would believe they were from a brother and I cannot but tell him sometimes that sure he mistakes and sends me letters that were meant to his mistress till he swears to me that he has none Next week my persecution begins again he comes down and my cousin Molle is already cured of his imaginary dropsy and means to meet here I shall be baited most sweetly but sure they will not easily make me consent to make my life unhappy to satisfy their importunity I was born to be very happy or very miserable I know not which but I am very certain that you will never read half this letter tis so scribbled but tis no matter tis not much worth it Your most faithful friend and servant Letter sixteen The trial of Lord Chandos for killing mister Compton in a duel was just at this moment exciting the fickle attention of the town which had probably said its say on the subject of Cromwell s coup d etat and was only too ready for another subject of conversation The trial is not reported among the State Trials but our observant friend the Earl of Leicester has again taken note of the matter in his journal and can give us at least his own ideas of the trial and its political and social importance Under date May sixteen fifty three he writes Towards the end of Easter Term the Lord Chandos for killing in duel mister Compton the year before that is to say in March the new year begins on March twenty fifth and the Lord Arundel of Wardour one of his seconds were brought to their trial for their lives at the Upper Bench in Westminster Hall when it was found manslaughter only as by a jury at Kingston upon Thames it had been found formerly The Lords might have had the privilege of peerage Justice Rolles being Lord Chief Justice but they declined it by the advice of mister Maynard and the rest of their counsel least by that means the matter might have been brought about again therefore they went upon the former verdict of manslaughter and so were acquitted yet to be burned in the hand which was done to them both a day or two after but very favourably These were the first peers that had been burned in the hand and the democratic Earl of Leicester expresses at the event some satisfaction and derives from the whole circumstances of the trial comfortable assurance of the power and stability of the Government The Earl however misleads us in one particular Lord Arundel was Henry Compton s second He had married Cecily Compton and naturally enough acted as his brother in law s second It is also interesting to remember that Lord Chandos was known to the world as something other than a duelist He was an eminent loyalist among the first of those nobles who left Westminster and at Newbury fight had his three horses killed under him Lady Carey was Mary natural daughter of Lord Scrope who married Henry Carey commonly called Lord Leppington Lady Leppington or Carey lost her husband in sixteen forty nine and her son died May twenty four sixteen fifty three This helps us to date the letter Of her kindness to Compton of which Dorothy writes in her next letter nothing is known but she married Charles Paulet Lord saint John afterwards the Duke of Bolton early in sixteen fifty four The jealous Sir T here mentioned may be Sir Thomas Osborne who we may suppose was not well pleased at the refusal of his offer Sir Peter Lely did paint a portrait of Lady Diana Rich some months after this date It is somewhat curious that he should remain in England during the Civil Wars but his business was to paint all men s portraits He had painted Charles I now he was painting Cromwell It was to him Cromwell is said to have shouted Paint the warts paint the warts when the courtly Sir Peter would have made a presentable picture even of the Lord General himself Cromwell was a sound critic in this and had detected the main fault of Sir Peter s portraits whose value to us is greatly lessened by the artist s constant habit of flattery SIR If it were the carrier s fault that you stayed so long for your letters you are revenged for I have chid him most unreasonably But I must confess twas not for that for I did not know it then but going to meet him as I usually do when he gave me your letter I found the upper seal broken open and underneath where it uses to be only closed with a little wax there was a seal which though it were an anchor and a heart methought it did not look like yours but less and much worse cut This suspicion was so strong upon me that I chid till the poor fellow was ready to cry and swore to me that it had never been touched since he had it and that he was careful of it as he never put it with his other letters but by itself and that now it come amongst his money which perhaps might break the seal and lest I should think it was his curiosity he told me very ingenuously he could not read and so we parted for the present But since he has been with a neighbour of mine whom he sometimes delivers my letters to and begged her that she would go to me and desire my worship to write to your worship to know how the letter was sealed for it has so grieved him that he has neither eat nor slept to do him any good since he came home and in grace of God this shall be a warning to him as long as he lives He takes it so heavily that I think I must be friends with him again but pray hereafter seal your letters so that the difficulty of opening them may dishearten anybody from attempting it It was but my guess that the ladies at Heams were unhandsome but since you tell me they were remarkably so sure I know them by it they are two sisters and might have been mine if the Fates had so pleased They have a brother that is not like them and is a baronet besides Tis strange that you tell me of my Lords Shandoys Chandos and Arundel but what becomes of young Compton s estate Sure my Lady Carey cannot neither in honour nor conscience keep it besides that she needs it less now than ever her son being as I hear dead Sir T I suppose avoids you as a friend of mine My brother tells me they meet sometimes and have the most ado to pull off their hats to one another that can be and never speak If I were in town I ll undertake he would venture the being choked for want of air rather than stir out of doors for fear of meeting me But did you not say in your last that you took something very ill from me If twas my humble thanks well you shall have no more of them then nor no more servants I think that they are not necessary among friends I take it very kindly that your father asked for me and that you were not pleased with the question he made of the continuance of my friendship I can pardon it him because he does not know me but I should never forgive you if you could doubt it Were my face in no more danger of changing than my mind I should be worth the seeing at threescore and that which is but very ordinary now would then be counted handsome for an old woman but alas I am more likely to look old before my time with grief Never anybody had such luck with servants what with marrying and what with dying they all leave me Just now I have news brought me of the death of an old rich knight that has promised me this seven years to marry me whensoever his wife died and now he s dead before her and has left her such a widow it makes me mad to think on t Ltwelve hundred a year jointure and Ltwenty thousand in money and personal estate and all this I might have had if mister Death had been pleased to have taken her instead of him Well who can help these things But since I cannot have him would you had her What say you Shall I speak a good word for you She will marry for certain and perhaps though my brother may expect I should serve him in it yet if you give me commission I ll say I was engaged beforehand for a friend and leave him to shift for himself You would be my neighbour if you had her and I should see you often Think on t and let me know what you resolve My lady has writ me word that she intends very shortly to sit at Lely s for her picture for me I give you notice on t that you may have the pleasure of seeing it sometimes whilst tis there I imagine twill be so to you for I am sure it would be a great one to me and we do not use to differ in our inclinations though I cannot agree with you that my brother s kindness to me has anything of trouble in t no sure I may be just to you and him both and to be a kind sister will take nothing from my being a perfect friend Letter seventeen Lady Newcastle was Margaret Duchess of Newcastle The thrice noble chaste and virtuous but again somewhat fantastical and original brained generous Margaret Newcastle as Elia describes her She was the youngest daughter of Sir Charles Lucas and was born at Colchester towards the end of the reign of James I Her mother appears to have been remarkably careful of her education in all such lighter matters as dancing music and the learning of the French tongue but she does not seem to have made any deep study of the classics In sixteen forty three she joined the Court at Oxford and was made one of the Maids of Honour to Henrietta Maria whom she afterwards attended in exile At Paris she met the Marquis of Newcastle who married her in that city in sixteen forty five From Paris they went to Rotterdam she leaving the Queen to follow her husband s fortunes and after stopping at Rotterdam and Brabant for short periods they settled at Antwerp At the Restoration she returned to England with her husband and employed her time in writing letters plays poems philosophical discourses and orations There is a long catalogue of her works in Ballard s Memoirs but all published at a date subsequent to sixteen fifty three However from Anthony Wood and other sources one gathers somewhat different details of her life and writings and the book to which Dorothy refers here and in Letter twenty one is probably the Poems and Fancies an edition of which was published I believe in this year sixteen fifty three Many of her verses are more strangely incomprehensible than anything even in the poetry of to day Take for instance a poem of four lines from the Poems and Fancies entitled THE JOINING OF SEVERAL FIGUR D ATOMS MAKES OTHER FIGURES Several figur d Atoms well agreeing When joined do give another figure being For as those figures joined several ways The fabrick of each several creature raise This seems to be a rhyming statement of the Atomic theory but whether it is a poem or a fancy we should find it hard to decide It is not however an unfair example of Lady Newcastle s fantastic style Lady Newcastle died in sixteen seventy three and was buried in Westminster Abbey A wise witty and learned Lady which her many books do well testify SIR I received your letter to day when I thought it almost impossible that I should be sensible of anything but my father s sickness and my own affliction in it Indeed he was then so dangerously ill that we could not reasonably hope he should outlive this day yet he is now I thank God much better and I am come so much to myself with it as to undertake a long letter to you whilst I watch by him Towards the latter end it will be excellent stuff I believe but alas you may allow me to dream sometimes I have had so little sleep since my father was sick that I am never thoroughly awake Lord how I have wished for you Here do I sit all night by a poor moped fellow that serves my father and have much ado to keep him awake and myself too If you heard the wise discourse that is between us you would swear we wanted sleep but I shall leave him to night to entertain himself and try if I can write as wisely as I talk I am glad all is well again In earnest it would have lain upon my conscience if I had been the occasion of making your poor boy lose a service that if he has the wit to know how to value it he would never have forgiven me while he had lived But while I remember it let me ask you if you did not send my letter and Cleopatre where I directed you for my lady I received one from her to day full of the kindest reproaches that she has not heard from me this three weeks I have writ constantly to her but I do not so much wonder that the rest are lost as that she seems not to have received that which I sent to you nor the books I do not understand it but I know there is no fault of yours in t But mark you if you think to scape with sending me such bits of letters you are mistaken You say you are often interrupted and I believe it but you must use then to begin to write before you receive mine and whensoever you have any spare time allow me some of it Can you doubt that anything can make your letters cheap In earnest twas unkindly said and if I could be angry with you it should be for that No certainly they are and ever will be dear to me as that which I receive a huge contentment by How shall I long when you are gone your journey to hear from you how shall I apprehend a thousand accidents that are not likely nor will ever happen I hope Oh if you do not send me long letters then you are the cruellest person that can be If you love me you will and if you do not I shall never love myself You need not fear such a command as you mention Alas I am too much concerned that you should love me ever to forbid it you tis all that I propose of happiness to myself in the world The burning of my paper has waked me all this while I was in a dream But tis no matter I am content you should know they are of you and that when my thoughts are left most at liberty they are the kindest I swear my eyes are so heavy that I hardly see what I write nor do I think you will be able to read it when I have done the best on t is twill be no great loss to you if you do not for sure the greatest part on t is not sense and yet on my conscience I shall go on with it Tis like people that talk in their sleep nothing interrupts them but talking to them again and that you are not like to do at this distance besides that at this instant you are I believe more asleep than I and do not so much as dream that I am writing to you My fellow watchers have been asleep too till just now they begin to stretch and yawn they are going to try if eating and drinking can keep them awake and I am kindly invited to be of their company and my father s man has got one of the maids to talk nonsense to to night and they have got between them a bottle of ale I shall lose my share if I do not take them at their first offer Your patience till I have drunk and then I ll for you again And now on the strength of this ale I believe I shall be able to fill up this paper that s left with something or other and first let me ask you if you have seen a book of poems newly come out made by my Lady Newcastle For God s sake if you meet with it send it to me they say tis ten times more extravagant than her dress Sure the poor woman is a little distracted she could never be so ridiculous else as to venture at writing books and in verse too If I should not sleep this fortnight I should not come to that My eyes grow a little dim though for all the ale and I believe if I could see it this is most strangely scribbled Sure I shall not find fault with your writing in haste for anything but the shortness of your letter and twould be very unjust in me to tie you to a ceremony that I do not observe myself No for God s sake let there be no such thing between us a real kindness is so far beyond all compliment that it never appears more than when there is least of t other mingled with it If then you would have me believe yours to be perfect confirm it to me by a kind freedom Tell me if there be anything that I can serve you in employ me as you would do that sister that you say you love so well Chide me when I do anything that is not well but then make haste to tell me that you have forgiven me and that you are what I shall ever be a faithful friend Letter eighteen I cannot pass by this letter without saying that the first part of it is to my thinking the most dainty and pleasing piece of writing that Dorothy has left us The account of her life one day and every day is like a gust of fresh country air clearing away the mist of time and enabling one to see Dorothy at Chicksands quite clearly It is fashionable to deny Macaulay everything but memory but he had the good taste and discernment to admire this letter and quote from it in his Essay on Sir William Temple a quotation for which I shall always remain very grateful to him Sir Thomas Peyton Brother Peyton was born in sixteen nineteen being I believe the second baronet of that name his seat was at Knowlton in the county of Kent Early in the reign of Charles I we find him as Member of Parliament for Sandwich figuring in a Committee side by side with the two Sir Harry Vanes the Committee having been sent into Kent to prevent the dispersal of rumours to the scandal of Parliament no light task one would think In sixteen forty three he is in prison charged among other things with being a malignant An unjust charge as he thinks for he writes to his brother If to wish on earth peace goodwill towards men be a malignant none is greater than your affectionate brother Thomas Peyton But in spite of these peaceful thoughts in prison in May sixteen forty eight he is heading a loyalist rising in Kent The other counties not joining in at the right moment in accordance with the general procedure at Royalist risings it is defeated by Fairfax Sir Thomas s house is ransacked he himself is taken prisoner near Bury saint Edmunds brought to the House of Commons and committed to the Tower A right worthy son in law of good Sir Peter We are glad to find him at large again in sixteen fifty three his head safe on his shoulders and do not grudge him his grant of duties on sea coal dated sixteen sixty nor are we sorry that he should once again grace the House of Commons with his presence as one of the members for loyal Kent in the good days when the King enjoyed his own again SIR I have been reckoning up how many faults you lay to my charge in your last letter and I find I am severe unjust unmerciful and unkind Oh me how should one do to mend all these Tis work for an age and tis to be feared I shall be so old before I am good that twill not be considerable to anybody but myself whether I am so or not I say nothing of the pretty humour you fancied me in in your dream because twas but a dream Sure if it had been anything else I should have remembered that my Lord L loves to have his chamber and his bed to himself But seriously now I wonder at your patience How could you hear me talk so senselessly though twere but in your sleep and not be ready to beat me What nice mistaken points of honour I pretended to and yet could allow him room in the same bed with me Well dreams are pleasant things to people whose humours are so but to have the spleen and to dream upon t is a punishment I would not wish my greatest enemy I seldom dream or never remember them unless they have been so sad as to put me into such disorder as I can hardly recover when I am awake and some of those I am confident I shall never forget You ask me how I pass my time here I can give you a perfect account not only of what I do for the present but of what I am likely to do this seven years if I stay here so long I rise in the morning reasonably early and before I am ready I go round the house till I am weary of that and then into the garden till it grows too hot for me About ten o clock I think of making me ready and when that s done I go into my father s chamber from whence to dinner where my cousin Molle and I sit in great state in a room and at a table that would hold a great many more After dinner we sit and talk till mister B comes in question and then I am gone The heat of the day is spent in reading or working and about six or seven o clock I walk out into a common that lies hard by the house where a great many young wenches keep sheep and cows and sit in the shade singing of ballads I go to them and compare their voices and beauties to some ancient shepherdesses that I have read of and find a vast difference there but trust me I think these are as innocent as those could be I talk to them and find they want nothing to make them the happiest people in the world but the knowledge that they are so Most commonly when we are in the midst of our discourse one looks about her and spies her cows going into the corn and then away they all run as if they had wings at their heels I that am not so nimble stay behind and when I see them driving home their cattle I think tis time for me to return too When I have supped I go into the garden and so to the side of a small river that runs by it when I sit down and wish you were with me you had best say this is not kind neither In earnest tis a pleasant place and would be much more so to me if I had your company I sit there sometimes till I am lost with thinking and were it not for some cruel thoughts of the crossness of our fortunes that will not let me sleep there I should forget that there were such a thing to be done as going to bed Since I writ this my company is increased by two my brother Harry and a fair niece the eldest of my brother Peyton s children She is so much a woman that I am almost ashamed to say I am her aunt and so pretty that if I had any design to gain of servants I should not like her company but I have none and therefore shall endeavour to keep her here as long as I can persuade her father to spare her for she will easily consent to it having so much of my humour though it be the worst thing in her as to like a melancholy place and little company My brother John is not come down again nor am I certain when he will be here He went from London into Gloucestershire to my sister who was very ill and his youngest girl of which he was very fond is since dead But I believe by that time his wife has a little recovered her sickness and loss of her child he will be coming this way My father is reasonably well but keeps his chamber still and will hardly I am afraid ever be so perfectly recovered as to come abroad again I am sorry for poor Walker but you need not doubt of what he has of yours in his hands for it seems he does not use to do his work himself I speak seriously he keeps a Frenchman that sets all his seals and rings If what you say of my Lady Leppington be of your own knowledge I shall believe you but otherwise I can assure you I have heard from people that pretend to know her very well that her kindness to Compton was very moderate and that she never liked him so well as when he died and gave her his estate But they might be deceived and tis not so strange as that you should imagine a coldness and an indifference in my letters when I so little meant it but I am not displeased you should desire my kindness enough to apprehend the loss of it when it is safest Only I would not have you apprehend it so far as to believe it possible that were an injury to all the assurances I have given you and if you love me you cannot think me unworthy I should think myself so if I found you grew indifferent to me that I have had so long and so particular a friendship for but sure this is more than I need to say You are enough in my heart to know all my thoughts and if so you know better than I can tell you how much I am Yours Letter nineteen Lady Ruthin is Susan daughter and heiress of Charles Longueville Lord Grey de Ruthin She married Sir Harry Yelverton a match of which Dorothy thoroughly approved We hear more of Dorothy s beautiful friend at the time when the treaty with Sir Harry Yelverton is going forward Of mister Talbot I find nothing we must rest contented in knowing him to be a fellow servant R Spencer is Robert Spencer Earl of Sunderland Lady Sunderland s brother in law He was afterwards one of the inner council of four in Temple s Scheme of Government In him says Macaulay in a somewhat highly coloured character sketch the political immortality of his age was personified in the most lively manner Nature had given him a keen understanding a restless and mischievous temper a cold heart and an abject spirit His mind had undergone a training by which all his vices had been nursed up to the rankest maturity Lady Lexington was Mary daughter of Sir Anthony Leger she was the third wife of Robert Sutton Earl of Lexington I cannot find that her daughter married one of the Spencers SIR If to know I wish you with me pleases you tis a satisfaction you may always have for I do it perpetually but were it really in my power to make you happy I could not miss being so myself for I know nothing else I want towards it You are admitted to all my entertainments and twould be a pleasing surprise to me to see you amongst my shepherdesses I meet some there sometimes that look very like gentlemen for tis a road and when they are in good humour they give us a compliment as they go by but you would be so courteous as to stay I hope if we entreated you tis in your way to this place and just before the house Tis our Hyde Park and every fine evening anybody that wanted a mistress might be sure to find one there I have wondered often to meet my fair Lady Ruthin there alone methinks it should be dangerous for an heir I could find in my heart to steal her away myself but it should be rather for her person than her fortune My brother says not a word of you nor your service nor do I expect he should if I could forget you he would not help my memory You would laugh sure if I could tell you how many servants he has offered me since he came down but one above all the rest I think he is in love with himself and may marry him too if he pleases I shall not hinder him Tis one Talbot the finest gentleman he has seen this seven years but the mischief on t is he has not above fifteen or sixteen hundred pound a year though he swears he begins to think one might bate Lfive hundred a year for such a husband I tell him I am glad to hear it and if I was as much taken as he with mister Talbot I should not be less gallant but I doubted the first extremely I have spleen enough to carry me to Epsom this summer but yet I think I shall not go If I make one journey I must make more for then I have no excuse Rather than be obliged to that I ll make none You have so often reproached me with the loss of your liberty that to make you some amends I am contented to be your prisoner this summer but you shall do one favour for me into the bargain When your father goes into Ireland lay your commands upon some of his servants to get you an Irish greyhound I have one that was the General s but tis a bitch and those are always much less than the dogs I got it in the time of my favour there and it was all they had Henry Cromwell undertook to write to his brother Fleetwood for another for me but I have lost my hopes there Whomsoever it is that you employ he will need no other instructions but to get the biggest he can meet with tis all the beauty of those dogs or of any kind I think A masty mastif is handsomer to me than the most exact little dog that ever lady played withal You will not offer to take it ill that I employ you in such a commission since I have told you that the General s son did not refuse it but I shall take it ill if you do not take the same freedom with me whensoever I am capable of serving you The town must needs be unpleasant now and methinks you might contrive some way of having your letters sent to you without giving yourself the trouble of coming to town for them when you have no other business you must pardon me if I think they cannot be worth it I am told that R Spencer is a servant to a lady of my acquaintance a daughter of my Lady Lexington s Is it true And if it be what is become of the Ltwenty five hundred lady Would you think it that I have an ambassador from the Emperor Justinian that comes to renew the treaty In earnest tis true and I want your counsel extremely what to do in it You told me once that of all my servants you liked him the best If I could do so too there were no dispute in t Well I ll think on t and if it succeed I will be as good as my word you shall take your choice of my four daughters Am not I beholding to him think you He says that he has made addresses tis true in several places since we parted but could not fix anywhere and in his opinion he sees nobody that would make so fit a wife for him as I He has often inquired after me to hear if I were marrying and somebody told him I had an ague and he presently fell sick of one too so natural a sympathy there is between us and yet for all this on my conscience we shall never marry He desires to know whether I am at liberty or not What shall I tell him Or shall I send him to you to know I think that will be best I ll say that you are much my friend and that I have resolved not to dispose of myself but with your consent and approbation and therefore he must make all his court to you and when he can bring me a certificate under your hand that you think him a fit husband for me tis very likely I may have him Till then I am his humble servant and your faithful friend Letter twenty In this letter the journey into Sweden is given up finally and Temple is once more without employment or the hope of employment This was probably brought about by the alteration of the Government plans and as Lord Lisle was not to go to Sweden there was no chance of Temple s being attached to the Embassy SIR I am sorry my last letter frighted you so twas no part of my intention it should but I am more sorry to see by your first chapter that your humour is not always so good as I could wish it Twas the only thing I ever desired we might differ in and therefore I think it is denied me Whilst I read the description on t I could not believe but that I had writ it myself it was so much my own I pity you in earnest much more than I do myself and yet I may deserve yours when I shall have told you that besides all that you speak of I have gotten an ague that with two fits has made me so very weak that I doubted extremely yesterday whether I should be able to sit up to day to write to you But you must not be troubled at this that s the way to kill me indeed Besides it is impossible I should keep it long for here is my eldest brother and my cousin Molle and two or three more that have great understanding in agues as people that have been long acquainted with them and they do so tutor and govern me that I am neither to eat drink nor sleep without their leave and sure my obedience deserves they should cure me or else they are great tyrants to very little purpose You cannot imagine how cruel they are to me and yet will persuade me tis for my good I know they mean it so and therefore say nothing on t I admit and sigh to think those are not here that would be kinder to me But you were cruel yourself when you seemed to apprehend I might oblige you to make good your last offer Alack if I could purchase the empire of the world at that rate I should think it much too dear and though perhaps I am too unhappy myself ever to make anybody else happy yet sure I shall take heed that my misfortunes may not prove infectious to my friends You ask counsel of a person that is very little able to give it I cannot imagine whither you should go since this journey is broke You must e en be content to stay at home I think and see what will become of us though I expect nothing of good and sure you never made a truer remark in your life than that all changes are for the worse Will it not stay your father s journey too Methinks it should For God s sake write me all that you hear or can think of that I may have something to entertain myself withal I have a scurvy head that will not let me write longer I am your Directed For missus Paynter at her house in Bedford Street next ye Goate In Covent Garden Letter twenty one Sir Thomas Osborne is Dorothy s Cousin Osborne here mentioned He was you remember a suitor for Dorothy s hand but has now married Lady Bridget Lindsay The squire that is as good as a knight is in all probability Richard Bennet Thomas Bennet his father an alderman of the city of London had bought a seat near Cambridge called Babraham or Babram that had belonged to Sir Toby Palavicini The alderman appears to have been a loyal citizen as he was created baronet in sixteen sixty His two sons Sir Richard and Sir Thomas married daughters of Sir Lavinius Munck so we need not accuse Dorothy of irretrievably breaking hearts by her various refusals When Dorothy says she will sit like the lady of the lobster and give audience at Babram she simply means that she will sit among magnificent surroundings unsuited to her modest disposition The lady of a lobster is a curious shaped substance in the head of that fish bearing some distant resemblance to the figure of a woman The expression is still known to fishmongers and others who also refer to the Adam and Eve in a shrimp a kindred formation Curiously enough this very phrase has completely puzzled doctor Grosart the learned editor of Herrick who confesses that he can make nothing of the allusion in the following passage from The Fairie Temple The saint to which the most he prayes And offers Incense Nights and Dayes The Lady of the Lobster is Whose foot pace he doth stroak and kiss Swift too uses the phrase in his Battle of the Books in describing the encounter between Virgil and Dryden where he says The helmet was nine times too large for the head which appeared situate far in the hinder part even like the lady in a lobster or a mouse under a canopy of state or like a shrivelled beau from within the penthouse of a modern periwig SIR I do not know that anybody has frighted me or beaten me or put me into more passion than what I usually carry about me but yesterday I missed my fit and am not without hope I shall hear no more on t My father has lost his too and my eldest brother but we all look like people risen from the dead Only my cousin Molle keeps his still and in earnest I am not certain whether he would lose it or not for it gives him a lawful occasion of being nice and cautious about himself to which he in his own humour is so much inclined that twere not easy for him to forbear it You need not send me my Lady Newcastle s book at all for I have seen it and am satisfied that there are many soberer people in Bedlam I ll swear her friends are much to blame to let her go abroad But I am hugely pleased that you have seen my Lady I knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her Her conversation has more charms than can be in mere beauty and her humour and disposition would make a deformed person appear lovely You had strange luck to meet my brother so soon He went up but last Tuesday I heard from him on Thursday but he did not tell me he had seen you perhaps he did not think it convenient to put me in mind of you besides he thought he told me enough in telling me my cousin Osborne was married Why did you not send me that news and a garland Well the best on t is I have a squire now that is as good as a knight He was coming as fast as a coach and six horses could carry him but I desired him to stay till my ague was gone and give me a little time to recover my good looks for I protest if he saw me now he would never deign to see me again Oh me I can but think how I shall sit like the lady of the lobster and give audience at Babram You have been there I am sure Nobody that is at Cambridge scapes it But you were never so welcome thither as you shall be when I am mistress on t In the meantime I have sent you the first tome of Cyrus to read when you have done with it leave it at mister Hollingsworth s and I ll send you another I have had ladies with me all the afternoon that are for London to morrow and now I have as many letters to write as my Lord General s Secretary Forgive me that this is no longer for I am your Addressed For missus Paynter at her house in Bedford Street next ye Goate In Covent Garden Letter twenty two mister Fish and mister Freeman were probably neighbours of Dorothy There is a mister Ralph Freeman of Aspedon Hall in Hertfordshire mentioned in contemporary chronicles he died in seventeen fourteen aged eighty eight and was therefore about thirty seven years of age at this time His father seems to have been an ideal country gentleman who says Sir Henry Chauncy made his house neat his gardens pleasant his groves delicious his children cheerful his servants easy and kept excellent order in his family SIR You are more in my debt than you imagine I never deserved a long letter so much as now when you sent me a short one I could tell you such a story tis too long to be written as would make you see what I never discover d in myself before that I am a valiant lady In earnest we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish an occasion as I cannot tell which is strangest The Emperor and his proposals began it I talked merrily on t till I saw my brother put on his sober face and could hardly then believe he was in earnest It seems he was for when I had spoke freely my meaning it wrought so with him as to fetch up all that lay on his stomach All the people that I had ever in my life refused were brought again upon the stage like Richard the III s ghosts to reproach me withal and all the kindness his discoveries could make I had for you was laid to my charge My best qualities if I have any that are good served but for aggravations of my fault and I was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in other things that it might appear I had none in this Well twas a pretty lecture and I grew warm with it after a while in short we came so near an absolute falling out that twas time to give over and we said so much then that we have hardly spoken a word together since But tis wonderful to see what curtseys and legs pass between us and as before we were thought the kindest brother and sister we are certainly the most complimental couple in England Tis a strange change and I am very sorry for it but I ll swear I know not how to help it I look upon t as one of my great misfortunes and I must bear it as that which is not my first nor likely to be my last Tis but reasonable as you say that you should see me and yet I know not now how it can well be I am not for disguises it looks like guilt and I would not do a thing I durst not own I cannot tell whether if there were a necessity of your coming I should not choose to have it when he is at home and rather expose him to the trouble of entertaining a person whose company here would not be pleasing to him and perhaps an opinion that I did it purposely to cross him than that your coming in his absence should be thought a concealment Twas one reason more than I told you why I resolv d not to go to Epsom this summer because I knew he would imagine it an agreement between us and that something besides my spleen carried me thither but whether you see me or not you may be satisfied I am safe enough and you are in no danger to lose your prisoner since so great a violence as this has not broke her chains You will have nothing to thank me for after this my whole life will not yield such another occasion to let you see at what rate I value your friendship and I have been much better than my word in doing but what I promised you since I have found it a much harder thing not to yield to the power of a near relation and a greater kindness than I could then imagine it To let you see I did not repent me of the last commission I ll give you another Here is a seal that Walker set for me and tis dropt out pray give it him to mend If anything could be wonder d at in this age I should very much how you came by your informations Tis more than I know if mister Freeman be my servant I saw him not long since and he told me no such thing Do you know him In earnest he s a pretty gentleman and has a great deal of good nature I think which may oblige him perhaps to speak well of his acquaintances without design mister Fish is the Squire of Dames and has so many mistresses that anybody may pretend a share in him and be believed but though I have the honour to be his near neighbour to speak freely I cannot brag much that he makes any court to me and I know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often I have sent you another tome of Cyrus pray send the first to mister Hollingsworth for my Lady My cousin Molle went from hence to Cambridge on Thursday and there s an end of mister Bennet I have no company now but my niece Peyton and my brother will be shortly for the term but will make no long stay in town I think my youngest brother comes down with him Remember that you owe me a long letter and something for forgiving your last I have no room for more than Your Letter twenty three SIR I will tell you no more of my servants I can no sooner give you some little hints whereabouts they live but you know them presently and I meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance But it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if I incline him to look graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done What has kept him from marrying all this time or how the humour comes so furiously upon him now I know not but if he may be believed he is resolved to be a most romance squire and go in quest of some enchanted damsel whom if he likes as to her person for fortune is a thing below him and we do not read in history that any knight or squire was ever so discourteous as to inquire what portions their ladies had then he comes with the power of the county to demand her which for the present he may dispose of being Sheriff so I do not see who is able to resist him All that is to be hoped is that since he may reduce whomsoever he pleases to his obedience he will be very curious in his choice and then I am secure It may be I dreamt it that you had met my brother or else it was one of the reveries of my ague if so I hope I shall fall into no more of them I have missed four fits and had but five and have recovered so much strength as made me venture to meet your letter on Wednesday a mile from home Yet my recovery will be nothing towards my leaving this place where many reasons will oblige me to stay at least all this summer unless some great alteration should happen in this family that which I most own is my father s ill health which though it be not in that extremity it has been yet keeps him still a prisoner in his chamber and for the most part to his bed which is reason enough But besides I can give you others I am here much more out of people s way than in town where my aunt and such as pretend an interest in me and a power over me do so persecute me with their good nature and take it so ill that they are not accepted as I would live in a hollow tree to avoid them Here I have nobody but my brother to torment me whom I can take the liberty to dispute with and whom I have prevailed with hitherto to bring none of his pretenders to this place because of the noise all such people make in a country and the tittle tattle it breeds among neighbours that have nothing to do but to inquire who marries and who makes love If I can but keep him still in that humour mister Bennet and I are likely to preserve our state and treat at distance like princes but we have not sent one another our pictures yet though my cousin Molle who was his agent here begged mine very earnestly But I thank God an imagination took him one morning that he was falling into a dropsy and made him in such haste to go back to Cambridge to his doctor that he never remembers anything he has to ask of me but the coach to carry him away I lent it most willingly and gone he is My eldest brother goes up to town on Monday too perhaps you may see him but I cannot direct you where to find him for he is not yet resolved himself where to lie only tis likely Nan may tell you when he is there He will make no stay I believe You will think him altered and if it be possible more melancholy than he was If marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him I shall pray that all my friends may scape it Yet if I were my cousin H Danvers my Lady Diana should not if I could help it as well as I love her I would try if ten thousand pound a year with a husband that doted on her as I should do could not keep her from being unhappy Well in earnest if I were a prince that lady should be my mistress but I can give no rule to any one else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing their hearts to her may be infinitely taken with one I should not value at all for so says the Justinian wise Providence has ordained it that by their different humours everybody might find something to please themselves withal without envying their neighbours And now I have begun to talk gravely and wisely I ll try if I can go a little further without being out No I cannot for I have forgot already what twas I would have said but tis no matter for as I remember it was not much to the purpose and besides I have paper little enough left to chide you for asking so unkind a question as whether you were still the same in my thoughts Have you deserved to be otherwise that is am I no more in yours For till that be it s impossible the other should but that will never be and I shall always be the same I am My heart tells me so and I believe it for were it otherwise Fortune would not persecute me thus Oh me she s cruel and how far her power may reach I know not only I am sure she cannot call back time that is past and it is long since we resolved to be for ever Most faithful friends Letter twenty four Tom Cheeke is Sir Thomas Cheeke Knight of Purgo in the county of Essex or more probably his son from the way Dorothy speaks of him but it is difficult to discriminate among constant generations of Toms after a lapse of two hundred years We find Sir Thomas s daughter was at this time the third wife of Lord Manchester and it appears that Dorothy s great grandfather married Catherine Cheeke daughter of the then Sir Thomas This will assist us to the connection between Dorothy Tom Cheeke and Lord Manchester Sir Richard Franklin Knight married a daughter of Sir Thomas Cheeke He purchased Moor Park Hertfordshire about this time The park and the mansion he bought in sixteen fifty two from the Earl of Monmouth and the manor in sixteen fifty five from Sir Charles Harbord The gardens had been laid out by the Countess of Bedford who had sold the place in sixteen twenty six to the Earl of Pembroke The house was well known to Temple who describes the gardens in his Essay on Gardening and when he retired in later years to an estate near Farnham in Surrey he gave to it the name of Moor Park Lord Manchester was Edward Montagu second Earl of Manchester He was educated at Sidney Sussex College Cambridge and sat for Huntingdonshire in the first two Parliaments of Charles I He was called to the Upper House as Lord Kimbolton in sixteen twenty six and succeeded his father in sixteen forty two His name is well known in history as that of the leader of the Puritans in the House of Lords and as the only peer joined with the five members impeached by the King He raised a regiment and fought under Essex at Edgehill reconquered Lincolnshire and took part in the battle of Marston Moor At this time Cromwell was his subordinate and to his directions Lord Manchester s successes are in all probability due At the second battle of Newbury Lord Manchester showed some hesitation in following up his success and Cromwell accused him of lukewarmness in the cause from his place in the House of Commons An inquiry was instituted but the Committee never carried out their investigations and in parliamentary language the matter then dropped He afterwards held among other offices that of Chancellor of the University of Cambridge and inducted a visitation and reform of that University He resisted the trial of the King and the foundation of the Commonwealth refused to sit in Cromwell s new House of Lords and was among those Presbyterians who helped to bring about the Restoration Cooper and Hoskins were famous miniature painters of the day Samuel Cooper was a nephew of John Hoskins who instructed him in the art of miniature painting in which he soon out rivalled his master Cooper who is styled by contemporary eulogists the prince of limners gave a strength and freedom to the art which it had not formerly possessed but where he attempted to express more of the figure than the head his drawing is defective His painting was famous for the beauty of his carnation tints and the loose flowing lines in which he described the hair of his model He was a friend of the famous Samuel Butler Hoskins though a painter of less merit had had the honour of painting His Majesty King Charles I his Queen and many members of the Court and had passed through the varying fortunes of a fashionable portrait painter whose position leaning as it does on the fickle approbation of the connoisseurs is always liable to be wrested from him by a younger rival It is noticeable that this is the first letter in which we have intimation of the world s gossip about Dorothy s love affairs We may perhaps not unfairly trace the growth of Dorothy s affection for Temple by the actions of others First her brother raises his objections and then her relations begin to gossip meanwhile the letters do not grow less kind SIR You amaze me with your story of Tom Cheeke I am certain he could not have had it where you imagine and tis a miracle to me that he remember that there is such a one in the world as his cousin D O I am sure he has not seen her this six year and I think but once in his life If he has spread his opinion in that family I shall quickly hear on t for my cousin Molle is now gone to Kimbolton to my Lord Manchester and from there he goes to Moor Park to my cousin Franklin s and in one or both he will be sure to meet with it The matter is not great for I confess I do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best pleased never to be known in t upon any occasion whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly avoided one must satisfy oneself by doing nothing that one need care who knows I do not think a propos to tell anybody that you and I are very good friends and it were better sure if nobody knew it but we ourselves But if in spite of all our caution it be discovered tis no treason nor anything else that s ill and if anybody should tell me that I have had a greater kindness and esteem for you than for any one besides I do not think I should deny it howsoever you do oblige me by not owning any such thing for as you say I have no reason to take it ill that you endeavour to preserve me a liberty though I m never likely to make use on t Besides that I agree with you too that certainly tis much better you should owe my kindness to nothing but your own merit and my inclination than that there should lie any other necessity upon me of making good my words to you For God s sake do not complain so that you do not see me I believe I do not suffer less in t than you but tis not to be helped If I had a picture that were fit for you you should have it I have but one that s anything like and that s a great one but I will send it some time or other to Cooper or Hoskins and have a little one drawn by it if I cannot be in town to sit myself You undo me by but dreaming how happy we might have been when I consider how far we are from it in reality Alas how can you talk of defying fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you could I know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but I am certain he knows the utmost of the injuries you have received from her Tis not possible she should have used you worse than he says We have had another debate but much more calmly Twas just upon his going up to town and perhaps he thought it not fit to part in anger Not to wrong him he never said to me whate er he thought a word in prejudice of you in your own person and I never heard him accuse any but your fortune and my indiscretion And whereas I did expect that at least in compliment to me he should have said we had been a couple of fools well met he says by his troth he does not blame you but bids me not deceive myself to think you have any great passion for me If you have done with the first part of Cyrus I should be glad mister Hollingsworth had it because I mentioned some such thing in my last to my Lady but there is no haste of restoring the other unless she should send to me for it which I believe she will not I have a third tome here against you have done with that second and to encourage you let me assure you that the more you read of them you will like them still better Oh me whilst I think on t let me ask you one question seriously and pray resolve me truly do I look so stately as people apprehend I vow to you I made nothing on t when Sir Emperor said so because I had no great opinion of his judgment but mister Freeman makes me mistrust myself extremely not that I am sorry I did appear so to him since it kept me from the displeasure of refusing an offer which I do not perhaps deserve but that it is a scurvy quality in itself and I am afraid I have it in great measure if I showed any of it to him for whom I have so much respect and esteem If it be so you must needs know it for though my kindness will not let me look so upon you you can see what I do to other people And besides there was a time when we ourselves were indifferent to one another did I do so then or have I learned it since For God s sake tell me that I may try to mend it I could wish too that you would lay your commands on me to forbear fruit here is enough to kill one thousand such as I am and so extremely good that nothing but your power can secure me therefore forbid it me that I may live to be Your Letter twenty five Dorothy s dissertations on love and marriage are always amusing in their demureness Who Cousin Peters was we cannot now say but she was evidently a relation and a gossip The episode concerning Mistress Harrison and the Queen is explained by the following quotation from the autobiography of the Countess of Warwick She is writing of mister Charles Rich and says He was then in love with a Maid of Honour to the Queen one missus Hareson that had been chamber fellow to my sister in law whilst she lived at Court and that brought on the acquaintance between him and my sister He continued to be much with us for about five or six months till my brother Broghill then afterwards Earl of Orrery grew also to be passionately in love with the same missus Hareson My brother then having a quarrel with mister Thomas Howard second son to the Earl of Berkshire about missus Hareson with whom he also was in love mister Rich brought my brother a challenge from mister Howard and was second to him against my brother when they fought which they did without any great hurt of any side being parted This action made mister Rich judge it not civil to come to our house and so for some time forbore doing it but at last my brother s match with missus Hareson being unhandsomely on her side broken off when they were so near being married as the wedding clothes were to be made and she after married mister Thomas Howard to my father s great satisfaction who always was averse to it though to comply with my brother s passion he consented to it There is a reference to the duel in a letter of Lord Cork which fixes the date as sixteen thirty nine forty but mister Nevile s name is nowhere mentioned Lord Broghill is well known to the history of that time both literary and political He was Roger Boyle afterwards Earl of Orrery the fifth son of the great Earl of Cork He acted for the Parliament against the Catholics in Ireland but was still thought to retain some partiality for the King s party Cromwell however considered himself secure in Lord Broghill s attachment and indeed he continued to serve not only Cromwell during his lifetime but his son Richard after his father s death with great fidelity Lord Broghill was active in forwarding the Restoration in Ireland and in reward of his services was made Earl of Orrery He died in sixteen seventy nine SIR You have furnished me now with arguments to convince my brother if he should ever enter on the dispute again In earnest I believed all this before but twas something an ignorant kind of faith in me I was satisfied myself but could not tell how to persuade another of the truth on t and to speak indifferently there are such multitudes that abuse the names of love and friendship and so very few that either understand or practise it in reality that it may raise great doubts whether there is any such thing in the world or not and such as do not find it in themselves will hardly believe tis anywhere But it will easily be granted that most people make haste to be miserable that they put on their fetters as inconsiderately as a woodcock runs into a noose and are carried by the weakest considerations imaginable to do a thing of the greatest consequence of anything that concerns this world I was told by one who pretends to know him very well that nothing tempted my cousin Osborne to marry his lady so much as that she was an Earl s daughter which methought was the prettiest fancy and had the least of sense in it of any I had heard on considering that it was no addition to her person that he had honour enough before for his fortune and how little it is esteemed in this age if it be anything in a better which for my part I am not well satisfied in Beside that in this particular it does not sound handsomely My Lady Bridget Osborne makes a worse name a great deal methinks than plain my Lady Osborne would do I have been studying how Tom Cheeke might come by his intelligence and I verily believe he has it from my cousin Peters She lives near them in Essex and in all likelihood for want of other discourse to entertain him withal she has come out with all she knows The last time I saw her she asked me for you before she had spoke six words to me and I who of all things do not love to make secrets of trifles told her I had seen you that day She said no more nor I neither but perhaps it worked in her little brain The best on t is the matter is not great for though I confess I had rather nobody knew it yet tis that I shall never be ashamed to own How kindly do I take these civilities of your father s in earnest you cannot imagine how his letter pleased me I used to respect him merely as he was your father but I begin now to owe it to himself all that he says is so kind and so obliging so natural and so easy that one may see tis perfectly his disposition and has nothing to disguise in it Tis long since that I knew how well he writ perhaps you have forgot that you showed me a letter of his to a French Marquis I think or some such man of his acquaintance when I first knew you I remember it very well and that I thought it as handsome a letter as I had seen but I have not skill it seems for I like yours too I can pardon all my cousin Franklin s little plots of discovery if she believed herself when she said she was confident our humours would agree extremely well In earnest I think they do for I mark that I am always of your opinion unless it be when you will not allow that you write well for there I am too much concerned Jane told me t other day very soberly that we write very much alike I think she said it with an intent to please me and did not fail in t but if you write ill twas no great compliment to me A propos de Jane she bids me tell you that if you liked your marmalade of quince she would send you more and she thinks better that has been made since Twas a strange caprice as you say of missus Harrison but there is fate as well as love in those things The Queen took the greatest pains to persuade her from it that could be and as somebody says I know not who Majesty is no ill orator but all would not do When she had nothing to say for herself she told her she had rather beg with mister Howard than live in the greatest plenty that could be with either my Lord Broghill Charles Rich or mister Nevile for all these were dying for her then I am afraid she has altered her opinion since twas too late for I do not take mister Howard to be a person that can deserve one should neglect all the world for him And where there is no reason to uphold a passion it will sink of itself but where there is it may last eternally I am yours Letter twenty six SIR The day I should have received your letter I was invited to dine at a rich widow s whom I think I once told you of and offered my service in case you thought fit to make addresses there and she was so kind and in so good humour that if I had had any commission I should have thought it a very fit time to speak We had a huge dinner though the company was only of her own kindred that are in the house with her and what I brought but she is broke loose from an old miserable husband that lived so long she thinks if she does not make haste she shall not have time to spend what he left She is old and was never handsome and yet is courted a thousand times more than the greatest beauty in the world would be that had not a fortune We could not eat in quiet for the letters and presents that came in from people that would not have looked upon her when they had met her if she had been left poor I could not but laugh to myself at the meanness of their humour and was merry enough all day for the company was very good and besides I expected to find when I came home a letter from you that would be more a feast and company to me than all that was there But never anybody was so defeated as I was to find none I could not imagine the reason only I assured myself it was no fault of yours but perhaps a just punishment upon me for having been too much pleased in a company where you were not After supper my brother and I fell into dispute about riches and the great advantages of it he instanced in the widow that it made one respected in the world I said twas true but that was a respect I should not at all value when I owed it only to my fortune And we debated it so long till we had both talked ourselves weary enough to go to bed Yet I did not sleep so well but that I chid my maid for waking me in the morning till she stopped my mouth with saying she had letters for me I had not patience to stay till I could rise but made her tie up all the curtains to let in light and among some others I found my dear letter that was first to be read and which made all the rest not worth the reading I could not but wonder to find in it that my cousin Franklin should want a true friend when tis thought she has the best husband in the world he was so passionate for her before he had her and so pleased with her since that in earnest I did not think it possible she could have anything left to wish for that she had not already in such a husband with such a fortune But she can best tell whether she is happy or not only if she be not I do not see how anybody else can hope it I know her the least of all the sisters and perhaps tis to my advantage that she knows me no more since she speaks so obligingly of me But do you think it was altogether without design she spoke it to you When I remember she is Tom Cheeke s sister I am apt to think she might have heard his news and meant to try whether there was anything of truth in t My cousin Molle I think means to end the summer there They say indeed tis a very fine seat but if I did not mistake Sir Thomas Cheeke he told me there was never a good room in the house I was wondering how you came by an acquaintance there because I had never heard you speak that you knew them I never saw him in my life but he is famous for a kind husband Only twas found fault with that he could not forbear kissing his wife before company a foolish trick that young married men are apt to he has left it long since I suppose But seriously tis as ill a sight as one would wish to see and appears very rude methinks to the company What a strange fellow this goldsmith is he has a head fit for nothing but horns I chid him once for a seal he set me just of this fashion and the same colours If he were to make twenty they should be all so his invention can stretch no further than blue and red It makes me think of the fellow that could paint nothing but a flower de luce who when he met with one that was so firmly resolved to have a lion for his sign that there was no persuading him out on t Well says the painter let it be a lion then but it shall be as like a flower de luce as e er you saw So because you would have it a dolphin he consented to it but it is like an ill favoured knot of ribbon I did not say anything of my father s being ill of late I think I told you before he kept his chamber ever since his last sickness and so he does still Yet I cannot say that he is at all sick but has so general a weakness upon him that I am much afraid their opinion of him has too much of truth in it and do extremely apprehend how the winter may work upon him Will you pardon this strange scribbled letter and the disorderliness on t I know you would though I should not tell you that I am not so much at leisure as I used to be You can forgive your friends anything and when I am not the faithfullest of those never forgive me You may direct your letters how you please here will be nobody to receive it but Your Letter twenty seven Althorp in Northamptonshire was the seat of Lady Sunderland s first husband Robert Lord Spencer SIR Your last came safe and I shall follow your direction for the address of this though as you say I cannot imagine what should tempt anybody to so severe a search for them unless it be that he is not yet fully satisfied to what degree our friendship is grown and thinks he may best inform himself from them In earnest twould not be unpleasant to hear our discourse He forms his with so much art and design and is so pleased with the hopes of making some discovery and I who know him as well as he does himself cannot but give myself the recreation sometimes of confounding him and destroying all that his busy head had been working on since the last conference He gives me some trouble with his suspicions yet on my conscience he is a greater to himself and I deal with so much franchise as to tell him so and yet he has no more the heart to ask me directly what he would so fain know than a jealous man has to ask one that might tell him whether he were a cuckold or not for fear of being resolved of that which is yet a doubt to him My eldest brother is not so inquisitive he satisfies himself with persuading me earnestly to marry and takes no notice of anything that may hinder me but a carelessness of my fortune or perhaps an aversion to a kind of life that appears to have less of freedom in t than that which at present I enjoy But sure he gives himself another reason for tis not very long since he took occasion to inquire for you very kindly of me and though I could then give but little account of you he smiled as if he did not altogether believe me and afterwards maliciously said he wondered you did not marry And I seemed to do so too and said if I knew any woman that had a great fortune and were a person worthy of you I should wish her you with all my heart But sister says he would you have him love her Do you doubt it did I say he were not happy in t else He laughed and said my humour was pleasant but he made some question whether it was natural or not He cannot be so unjust as to let me lose him sure I was kind to him though I had some reason not to take it very well when he made that a secret to me which was known to so many that did not know him but we shall never fall out I believe we are not apt to it neither of us If you are come back from Epsom I may ask you how you like drinking water I have wished it might agree as well with you as it did with me and if it were as certain that the same thing would do us good as tis that the same thing would please us I should not need to doubt it Otherwise my wishes do not signify much but I am forbid complaints or to express my fears And be it so only you must pardon me if I cannot agree to give you false hopes I must be deceived myself before I can deceive you and I have so accustomed myself to tell you all that I think that I must either say nothing or that which I believe to be true I cannot say but that I have wanted Jane but it has been rather to have somebody to talk with of you than that I needed anybody to put me in mind of you and with all her diligence I should have often prevented her in that discourse Were you at Althorp when you saw my Lady Sunderland and mister Smith or are they in town I have heard indeed that they are very happy but withal that as she is a very extraordinary person herself so she aimed at doing extraordinary things and when she had married mister Smith because some people were so bold as to think she did it because she loved him she undertook to convince the world that what she had done was in mere pity to his sufferings and that she could not go a step lower to meet anybody than that led her though when she thought there were no eyes on her she was more gracious to him But perhaps this might not be true or it may be she is now grown weary of that constraint she put upon herself I should have been sadder than you if I had been their neighbour to have seen them so kind as I must have been if I had married the Emperor He used to brag to me always of a great acquaintance he had there what an esteem my lady had for him and had the vanity not to call it impudence to talk sometimes as if he would have had me believe he might have had her and would not I ll swear I blushed for him when I saw he did not He told me too that though he had carried his addresses to me with all the privacy that was possible because he saw I liked it best and that twas partly his own humour too yet she had discovered it and could tell that there had been such a thing and that it was broke off again she knew not why which certainly was a lie as well as the other for I do not think she ever heard there was such a one in the world as Your faithful friend Letter twenty eight Dorothy s allusion to the Seven Sleepers refers to a story which occurs in the Golden Legend and other places of seven noble youths of Ephesus who fled from persecution to a cave in Mount Celion After two hundred and thirty years they awoke but only to die soon afterwards The fable is said to have arisen from a misinterpretation of the text They fell asleep in the Lord SIR I did not lay it as a fault to your charge that you were not good at disguise if it be one I am too guilty on t myself to accuse another And though I have been told it shows an unpractisedness in the world and betrays to all that understand it better yet since it is a quality I was not born with nor ever like to get I have always thought good to maintain that twas better not to need it than to have it I give you many thanks for your care of my Irish dog but I am extremely out of countenance your father should be troubled with it Sure he will think I have a most extravagant fancy but do me the right as to let him know I am not so possessed with it as to consent he should be employed in such a commission Your opinion of my eldest brother is I think very just and when I said maliciously I meant a French malice which you know does not signify the same with an English one I know not whether I told it you or not but I concluded from what you said of your indisposition that it was very like the spleen but perhaps I foresaw you would not be willing to own a disease that the severe part of the world holds to be merely imaginary and affected and therefore proper only to women However I cannot but wish you had stayed longer at Epsom and drunk the waters with more order though in a less proportion But did you drink them immediately from the well I remember I was forbid it and methought with a great deal of reason for especially at this time of year the well is so low and there is such a multitude to be served out on t that you can hardly get any but what is thick and troubled and I have marked that when it stood all night for that was my direction the bottom of the vessel it stood in would be covered an inch thick with a white clay which sure has no great virtue in t and is not very pleasant to drink What a character of a young couple you give me Would you would ask some one who knew him whether he be not much more of an ass since his marriage than he was before I have some reason to doubt that it alters people strangely I made a visit t other day to welcome a lady into this country whom her husband had newly brought down and because I knew him though not her and she was a stranger here twas a civility I owed them But you cannot imagine how I was surprised to see a man that I had known so handsome so capable of being made a pretty gentleman for though he was no proud philosopher as the Frenchmen say he was that which good company and a little knowledge of the world would have made equal to many that think themselves very well and are thought so transformed into the direct shape of a great boy newly come from school To see him wholly taken up with running on errands for his wife and teaching her little dog tricks And this was the best of him for when he was at leisure to talk he would suffer no one else to do it and what he said and the noise he made if you had heard it you would have concluded him drunk with joy that he had a wife and a pack of hounds I was so weary on t that I made haste home and could not but think of the change all the way till my brother who was with me thought me sad and so to put me in better humour said he believed I repented me I had not this gentleman now I saw how absolutely his wife governed him But I assured him that though I thought it very fit such as he should be governed yet I should not like the employment by no means It becomes no woman and did so ill with this lady that in my opinion it spoiled a good face and a very fine gown Yet the woman you met upon the way governed her husband and did it handsomely It was as you say a great example of friendship and much for the credit of our sex You are too severe to Walker I ll undertake he would set me twenty seals for nothing rather than undergo your wrath I am in no haste for it and so he does it well we will not fall out perhaps he is not in the humour of keeping his word at present and nobody can blame him if he be often in an ill one But though I am merciful to him as to one that has suffered enough already I cannot excuse you that profess to be my friend and yet are content to let me live in such ignorance write to me every week and yet never send me any of the new phrases of the town I could tell you without abandoning the truth that it is part of your devoyre to correct the imperfections you find under my hand and that my trouble resembles my wonder you can let me be dissatisfied I should never have learnt any of these fine things from you and to say truth I know not whether I shall from anybody else if to learn them be to understand them Pray what is meant by wellness and unwellness and why is to some extreme better than to some extremity I believe I shall live here till there is quite a new language spoke where you are and shall come out like one of the Seven Sleepers a creature of another age But tis no matter so you understand me though nobody else do when I say how much I am Your faithful Letter twenty nine SIR I can give you leave to doubt anything but my kindness though I can assure you I spake as I meant when I said I had not the vanity to believe I deserv d yours for I am not certain whether tis possible for anybody to deserve that another should love them above themselves though I am certain many may deserve it more than me But not to dispute this with you let me tell you that I am thus far of your opinion that upon some natures nothing is so powerful as kindness and that I should give that to yours which all the merit in the world besides would not draw from me I spake as if I had not done so already but you may choose whether you will believe me or not for to say truth I do not much believe myself in that point No all the kindness I have or ever had is yours nor shall I ever repent it so unless you shall ever repent yours Without telling you what the inconveniences of your coming hither are you may believe they are considerable or else I should not deny you or myself the happiness of seeing one another and if you dare trust me where I am equally concerned with you I shall take hold of the first opportunity that may either admit you here or bring me nearer you Sure you took somebody else for my cousin Peters I can never believe her beauty able to smite anybody I saw her when I was last in town but she appear d wholly the same to me she was at saint Malo with all her innocent good nature too and asked for you so kindly that I am sure she cannot have forgot you nor do I think she had so much address as to do it merely in compliment to me No you are mistaken certainly what should she do amongst all that company unless she be towards a wedding She has been kept at home poor soul and suffered so much of purgatory in this world that she needs not fear it in the next and yet she is as merry as ever she was which perhaps might make her look young but that she laughs a little too much and that will bring wrinkles they say Oh me now I talk of laughing it makes me think of poor Jane I had a letter from her the other day she desired me to present her humble service to her master she did mean you sure for she named everybody else that she owes any service to and bid me say that she would keep her word with him God knows what you have agreed on together She tells me she shall stay long enough there to hear from me once more and then she is resolved to come away Here is a seal which pray give Walker to set for me very handsomely and not of any of those fashions he made my others but of something that may differ from the rest Tis a plain head but not ill cut I think My eldest brother is now here and we expect my youngest shortly and then we shall be altogether which I do not think we ever were twice in our lives My niece is still with me but her father threatens to fetch her away If I can keep her to Michaelmas I may perhaps bring her up to town myself and take that occasion of seeing you but I have no other business that is worth my taking a journey for I have had another summons from my aunt and I protest I am afraid I shall be in rebellion there but tis not to be helped The widow writes me word too that I must expect her here about a month hence and I find that I shall want no company but only that which I would have and for which I could willingly spare all the rest Will it be ever thus I am afraid it will There has been complaints made on me already to my eldest brother only in general or at least he takes notice of no more what offers I refuse and what a strange humour has possessed me of being deaf to the advice of all my friends I find I am to be baited by them all by turns They weary themselves and me too to very little purpose for to my thinking they talk the most impertinently that ever people did and I believe they are not in my debt but think the same of me Sometimes I tell them I will not marry and then they laugh at me sometimes I say Not yet and they laugh more and would make me believe I shall be old within this twelvemonth I tell them I shall be wiser then They say twill be to no purpose Sometimes we are in earnest and sometimes in jest but always saying something since my brother Henry found his tongue again If you were with me I could make sport of all this but patience is my penance is somebody s motto and I think it must be mine I am your Letter thirty Here is Lord Lisle s embassage discussed again We know that in the end it comes to nothing Whitelocke going but without Temple The statute commanding the marriage ceremony to be conducted before Justices of the Peace was passed in August sixteen fifty three it is to some extent by such references as these that the letters have been dated and grouped The Marriage Act of sixteen fifty three with the other statutes of this period have been erased from the Statute Book but a draft of it in Somers Tracts remains to us for reference It contained provisions for the names of those who intended being joined together in holy matrimony to be posted with certain other particulars upon the door of the common meeting house commonly called the parish church or chapel and after the space of three weeks the parties with two witnesses might go before a magistrate who having satisfied himself by means of examining witnesses on oath or otherwise that all the preliminaries commanded by the Act had been properly fulfilled further superintended the proceedings to perfect the said intended marriage as follows The man taking the woman by the hand pronounced these words I A B do hereby in the presence of God take thee C D to be my wedded wife and do also in the presence of God and before these witnesses promise to be unto thee a loving and faithful husband Then the woman in similar formula promises to be a loving faithful and obedient wife and the magistrate pronounced the parties to be man and wife This ceremony and this only was to be a legal marriage It is probable that parties might and did add a voluntary religious rite to this compulsory civil ceremony as is done at this day in many foreign countries SIR You cannot imagine how I was surpris d to find a letter that began Dear brother I thought sure it could not belong at all to me and was afraid I had lost one by it that you intended me another and in your haste had mistook this for that Therefore till I found the permission you gave me I had laid it by with a resolution not to read it but to send it again If I had done so I had missed a great deal of satisfaction which I received from it In earnest I cannot tell you how kindly I take all the obliging things you say in it of me nor how pleased I should be for your sake if I were able to make good the character you give me to your brother and that I did not owe a great part of it wholly to your friendship for me I dare call nothing on t my own but faithfulness that I may boast of with truth and modesty since tis but a simple virtue and though some are without it yet tis so absolutely necessary that nobody wanting it can be worthy of any esteem I see you speak well of me to other people though you complain always to me I know not how to believe I should misuse your heart as you pretend I never had any quarrel to it and since our friendship it has been dear to me as my own Tis rather sure that you have a mind to try another than that any dislike of yours makes you turn it over to me but be it as it will I am contented to stand to the loss and perhaps when you have changed you will find so little difference that you ll be calling for your own again Do but assure me that I shall find you almost as merry as my Lady Anne Wentworth is always and nothing shall fright me from my purpose of seeing you as soon as I can with any conveniency I would not have you insensible of our misfortunes but I would not either that you should revenge them on yourself no that shows a want of constancy which you will hardly yield to be your fault but tis certain that there was never anything more mistaken than the Roman courage when they killed themselves to avoid misfortunes that were infinitely worse than death You confess tis an age since our story began as is not fit for me to own Is it not likely then that if my face had ever been good it might be altered since then or is it as unfit for me to own the change as the time that makes it Be it as you please I am not enough concerned in t to dispute it with you for trust me if you would not have my face better I am satisfied it should be as it is since if ever I wished it otherwise twas for your sake I know not how I stumbled upon a news book this week and for want of something else to do read it it mentions my Lord Lisle s embassage again Is there any such thing towards I met with somebody else too in t that may concern anybody that has a mind to marry tis a new form for it that sure will fright the country people extremely for they apprehend nothing like going before a Justice they say no other marriage shall stand good in law In conscience I believe the old one is the better and for my part I am resolved to stay till that comes in fashion again Can your father have so perfectly forgiven already the injury I did him since you will not allow it to be any to you in hindering you of missus Chambers as to remember me with kindness Tis most certain that I am obliged to him and in earnest if I could hope it might ever be in my power to serve him I would promise something for myself But is it not true too that you have represented me to him rather as you imagine me than as I am and have you not given him an expectation that I shall never be able to satisfy If you have I can forgive you because I know you meant well in t but I have known some women that have commended others merely out of spite and if I were malicious enough to envy anybody s beauty I would cry it up to all that had not seen them there s no such way to make anybody appear less handsome than they are You must not forget that you are some letters in my debt besides the answer to this If there were not conveniences of sending I should persecute you strangely And yet you cannot wonder at it the constant desire I have to hear from you and the satisfaction your letters give me would oblige one that has less time to write often But yet I know what tis to be in the town I could never write a letter from thence in my life of above a dozen lines and though I see as little company as anybody that comes there yet I always met with something or other that kept me idle Therefore I can excuse it though you do not exactly pay all that you owe upon condition you shall tell me when I see you all that you should have writ if you had had time and all that you can imagine to say to a person that is Your faithful friend Letter thirty one Dorothy is in mourning for her youngest brother Robert who died about this time As she does not mention his death to Temple we may take it that he was though her brother practically a stranger to her living away from Chicksands and rarely visiting her General Monk s brother to whom Dorothy refers was mister Nicholas Monk vicar of Kelkhampton in Cornwall General Monk s misfortune is no less a calamity than his marriage The following extract from Guizot s Life of Monk will fully explain the allusion The return of the new admiral Monk was marked by a domestic event which was not without its influence on his public conduct and reputation Unrefined tastes and that need of repose in his private life which usually accompanies activity in public affairs had consigned him to the dominion of a woman of low character destitute even of the charms which seduce and whose manners did not belie the rumour which gave her for extraction a market stall or even according to some a much less respectable profession She had lived for some time past with Monk and united to the influence of habit an impetuosity of will and words difficult to be resisted by the tranquil apathy of her lover It is asserted that she had managed as long since as sixteen forty nine to force him to a marriage but this marriage was most certainly not declared until sixteen fifty three M Guizot then quotes a letter dated September nineteen sixteen fifty three announcing the news of General Monk s marriage and this would about correspond with the presumed date of Dorothy s letter Greenwich Palace was probably occupied by Monk at this time and Dorothy meant to say that Ann Clarges would be as much at home in Greenwich Palace as say the Lord Protector s wife at Whitehall SIR It was sure a less fault in me to make a scruple of reading your letter to your brother which in all likelihood I could not be concerned in than for you to condemn the freedom you take of giving me directions in a thing where we are equally concerned Therefore if I forgive you this you may justly forgive me t other and upon these terms we are friends again are we not No stay I have another fault to chide you for You doubted whether you had not writ too much and whether I could have the patience to read it or not Why do you dissemble so abominably you cannot think these things How I should love that plain heartedness you speak of if you would use it nothing is civil but that amongst friends Your kind sister ought to chide you too for not writing to her unless you have been with her to excuse it I hope you have and pray take some time to make her one visit from me and carry my humble service with you and tell her that tis not my fault that you are no better I do not think I shall see the town before Michaelmas therefore you may make what sallies you please I am tied here to expect my brother Peyton and then possibly we may go up together for I should be at home again before the term Then I may show you my niece and you may confess that I am a kind aunt to desire her company since the disadvantage of our being together will lie wholly upon me But I must make it my bargain that if I come you will not be frighted to see me you think I ll warrant you have courage enough to endure a worse sight You may be deceived you never saw me in mourning yet nobody that has will e er desire to do it again for their own sakes as well as mine Oh tis a most dismal dress I have not dared to look in the glass since I wore it and certainly if it did so ill with other people as it does with me it would never be worn You told me of writing to your father but you did not say whether you had heard from him or how he did May not I ask it Is it possible that he saw me Where were my eyes that I did not see him for I believe I should have guessed at least that twas he if I had They say you are very like him but tis no wonder neither that I did not see him for I saw not you when I met you there Tis a place I look upon nobody in and it was reproached to me by a kinsman but a little before you came to me that he had followed me to half a dozen shops to see when I would take notice of him and was at last going away with a belief twas not I because I did not seem to know him Other people make it so much their business to gape that I ll swear they put me so out of countenance I dare not look up for my life I am sorry for General Monk s misfortunes because you say he is your friend but otherwise she will suit well enough with the rest of the great ladies of the times and become Greenwich as well as some others do the rest of the King s houses If I am not mistaken that Monk has a brother lives in Cornwall an honest gentleman I have heard and one that was a great acquaintance of a brother of mine who was killed there during the war and so much his friend that upon his death he put himself and his family into mourning for him which is not usual I think where there is no relation of kindred I will take order that my letters shall be left with Jones and yours called for there As long as your last was I read it over thrice in less than an hour though to say truth I had skipped some on t the last time I could not read my own confession so often Love is a terrible word and I should blush to death if anything but a letter accused me on t Pray be merciful and let it run friendship in my next charge My Lady sends me word she has received those parts of Cyrus I lent you Here is another for you which when you have read you know how to dispose There are four pretty stories in it L Amant Absente L Amant non Aime L Amant Jaloux et L Amant dont La Maitresse est mort Tell me which you have most compassion for when you have read what every one says for himself Perhaps you will not think it so easy to decide which is the most unhappy as you may think by the titles their stories bear Only let me desire you not to pity the jealous one for I remember I could do nothing but laugh at him as one that sought his own vexation This and the little journeys you say you are to make will entertain you till I come which sure will be as soon as possible I can since tis equally desired by you and your faithful Letter thirty two Things being more settled in that part of the world Sir John Temple is returning to Ireland where he intends taking his seat as Master of the Rolls once again Temple joins his father soon after this and stays in Ireland a few months Lady Ormond was the wife of the first Duke of Ormond She had obtained her pass to go over to Ireland on August twenty fourth sixteen fifty three The Ormonds had indeed been in great straits for want of money and in August sixteen fifty two Lady Ormond had come over from Caen where they were then living to endeavour to claim Cromwell s promise of reserving to her that portion of their estate which had been her inheritance After great delays she obtained Lfive hundred and a grant of Ltwo thousand per annum out of their Irish lands lying most conveniently to Dunmore House It must have been this matter that Dorothy had heard of when she questions whether she will get it when she comes there Francis Annesley Lord Valentia belonged to an ancient Nottinghamshire family though he himself was born in Newport Buckinghamshire Of his daughter s marriage I can find nothing Lord Valentia was at this time Secretary of State at Dublin Sir Justinian has at length found a second wife Her name is Vere and she is the daughter of Lord Leigh of Stoneleigh Thus do Dorothy s suitors one by one recover and cease to lament her obduracy When she declares that she would rather have chosen a chain to lead her apes in than marry Sir Justinian she refers to an old superstition as to the ultimate fate of spinsters Women dying maids lead apes in hell runs the verse of an old play and that is the whole superstition the origin of which seems somewhat inexplicable The phrase is thrice used by Shakespeare and constantly occurs in the old burlesques and comedies in one instance in a comedy entitled Love s Convert sixteen fifty one it is altered to lead an ape in heaven Many will remember the fate of The young Mary Anne in the famous Ingoldsby legend Bloudie Jacke So they say she is now leading apes Bloudie Jack And mends bachelors smallclothes below No learned editor that I am acquainted with has been able to suggest an explanation of this curious expression SIR All my quarrels to you are kind ones for sure tis alike impossible for me to be angry as for you to give me the occasion therefore when I chide unless it be that you are not careful enough of yourself and hazard too much a health that I am more concerned in than my own you need not study much for excuses I can easily forgive you anything but want of kindness The judgment you have made of the four lovers I recommended to you does so perfectly agree with what I think of them that I hope it will not alter when you have read their stories L Amant Absente has in my opinion a mistress so much beyond any of the rest that to be in danger of losing her is more than to have lost the others L Amant non Aime was an ass under favour notwithstanding the Princesse Cleobuline s letter his mistress had caprices that would have suited better with our Amant Jaloux than with anybody else and the Prince Artibie was much to blame that he outlived his belle Leontine But if you have met with the beginning of the story of Amestris and Aglatides you will find the rest of it in this part I send you now and tis to me one of the prettiest I have read and the most natural They say the gentleman that writes this romance has a sister that lives with him a maid and she furnishes him with all the little stories that come between so that he only contrives the main design and when he wants something to entertain his company withal he calls to her for it She has an excellent fancy sure and a great wit but I am sorry to tell it you they say tis the most ill favoured creature that ever was born And tis often so how seldom do we see a person excellent in anything but they have some great defect with it that pulls them low enough to make them equal with other people and there is justice in t Those that have fortunes have nothing else and those that want it deserve to have it That s but small comfort though you ll say tis confessed but there is no such thing as perfect happiness in this world those that have come the nearest it had many things to wish and bless me whither am I going Sure tis the death s head I see stand before me puts me into this grave discourse pray do not think I meant that for a conceit neither how idly have I spent two sides of my paper and am afraid besides I shall not have time to write two more Therefore I ll make haste to tell you that my friendship for you makes me concerned in all your relations that I have a great respect for Sir John merely as he is your father and that tis much increased by his kindness to you that he has all my prayers and wishes for his safety and that you will oblige me in letting me know when you hear any good news from him He has met with a great deal of good company I believe My Lady Ormond I am told is waiting for a passage and divers others but this wind if I am not mistaken is not good for them In earnest tis a most sad thing that a person of her quality should be reduced to such a fortune as she has lived upon these late years and that she should lose that which she brought as well as that which was her husband s Yet I hear she has now got some of her own land in Ireland granted her but whether she will get it when she comes there is I think a question We have a lady new come into this country that I pity too extremely She is one of my Lord of Valentia s daughters and has married an old fellow that is some threescore and ten who has a house that is fitter for the hogs than for her and a fortune that will not at all recompense the least of these inconveniences Ah tis most certain I should have chosen a handsome chain to lead my apes in before such a husband but marrying and hanging go by destiny they say It was not mine it seems to have an emperor the spiteful man merely to vex me has gone and married my countrywoman my Lord Lee s daughter What a multitude of willow garlands I shall weave before I die I think I had best make them into faggots this cold weather the flame they would make in a chimney would be of more use to me than that which was in the hearts of all those that gave them me and would last as long I did not think I should have got thus far I have been so persecuted with visits all this week I have had no time to despatch anything of business so that now I have done this I have forty letters more to write how much rather would I have them all to you than to anybody else or rather how much better would it be if there needed none to you and that I could tell you without writing how much I am Yours Letter thirty three Sir Thomas Peyton we must remember had married Dorothy s eldest sister she died many years ago and Sir Thomas married again in sixteen forty eight one Dame Cicely Swan a widow whose character Dorothy gives us Lord Monmouth was the eldest son of the Earl of Monmouth and was born in fifteen ninety six He was educated at Exeter College Oxford His literary work was at least copious and included some historical writing as well as the translations mentioned by Dorothy He published among other things An Historical Relation of the United Provinces a History of the Wars in Flanders and a History of Venice Sir John Suckling in the following doggerel hails our noble author with a flunkey s enthusiasm It is so rare and new a thing to see Aught that belongs to young nobility In print but their own clothes that we must praise You as we would do those first show the ways To arts or to new worlds In such strain writes the author of Why so pale and wan fond lover and both the circumstance and the doggerel should be very instructive to the snobologist The literary work of Lord Broghill is not unknown to fame and mister Waller s verse is still read by us but I have never seen a history of the Civil Wars from mister Waller s pen and cannot find that he ever published one Prazimene and Polexander are two romances translated from the French the former a neat little duodecimo the latter a huge folio of more than three hundred and fifty closely printed pages The title page of Prazimene a very good example of its kind runs as follows Two delightful Novels or the Unlucky Fair One being the Amours of Milistrate and Prazimene Illustrated with variety of Chance and Fortune Translated from the French by a Person of Quality London Sold by Eben Tracy at the Three Bibles on London Bridge Polexander was done into English by William Browne Gent for the benefit and behoof of the Earl of Pembroke William Fiennes Lord Say and Sele was one of the chiefs of the Independent party a Republican and one of the first to bear arms against the King He had for that day extravagant notions of civil liberty and on the disappointment of his hopes he appears to have retired to the Isle of Lundy on the coast of Devon and continued a voluntary prisoner there until Cromwell s death After the Restoration he was made Lord Chamberlain of the Household and Lord Privy Seal He published some political tracts none of which are now in existence and Anthony Wood mentions having seen other things of his among which maybe was the romance that Dorothy had heard of but which is lost to us SIR Pray let not the apprehension that others say fine things to me make your letters at all the shorter for if it were so I should not think they did and so long you are safe My brother Peyton does indeed sometimes send me letters that may be excellent for aught I know and the more likely because I do not understand them but I may say to you as to a friend I do not like them and have wondered that my sister who I may tell you too and you will not think it vanity in me had a great deal of wit and was thought to write as well as most women in England never persuaded him to alter his style and make it a little more intelligible He is an honest gentleman in earnest has understanding enough and was an excellent husband to two very different wives as two good ones could be My sister was a melancholy retired woman and besides the company of her husband and her books never sought any but could have spent a life much longer than hers was in looking to her house and her children This lady is of a free jolly humour loves cards and company and is never more pleased than when she sees a great many others that are so too Now with both these he so perfectly complied that tis hard to judge which humour he is more inclined to in himself perhaps to neither which makes it so much the more strange His kindness to his first wife may give him an esteem for her sister but he was too much smitten with this lady to think of marrying anybody else and seriously I could not blame him for she had and has yet great loveliness in her she was very handsome and is very good one may read it in her face at first sight A woman that is hugely civil to all people and takes as generally as anybody that I know but not more than my cousin Molle s letters do but which yet you do not like you say nor I neither I ll swear and if it be ignorance in us both we ll forgive it one another In my opinion these great scholars are not the best writers of letters I mean of books perhaps they are I never had I think but one letter from Sir Justinian but twas worth twenty of anybody s else to make me sport It was the most sublime nonsense that in my life I ever read and yet I believe he descended as low as he could to come near my weak understanding Twill be no compliment after this to say I like your letters in themselves not as they come from one that is not indifferent to me but seriously I do All letters methinks should be free and easy as one s discourse not studied as an oration nor made up of hard words like a charm Tis an admirable thing to see how some people will labour to find out terms that may obscure a plain sense Like a gentleman I know who would never say the weather grew cold but that winter began to salute us I have no patience for such coxcombs and cannot blame an old uncle of mine that threw the standish at his man s head because he writ a letter for him where instead of saying as his master bid him that he would have writ himself but he had the gout in his hand he said that the gout in his hand would not permit him to put pen to paper The fellow thought he had mended it mightily and that putting pen to paper was much better than plain writing I have no patience neither for these translations of romances I met with Polexander and L illustre Bassa both so disguised that I who am their old acquaintance hardly know them besides that they were still so much French in words and phrases that twas impossible for one that understands not French to make anything of them If poor Prazimene be in the same dress I would not see her for the world She has suffered enough besides I never saw but four tomes of her and was told the gentleman that writ her story died when those were finished I was very sorry for it I remember for I liked so far as I had seen of it extremely Is it not my good Lord of Monmouth or some such honourable personage that presents her to the English ladies I have heard many people wonder how he spends his estate I believe he undoes himself with printing his translations Nobody else will undergo the charge because they never hope to sell enough of them to pay themselves withal I was looking t other day in a book of his where he translates Pipero as piper and twenty words more that are as false as this My Lord Broghill sure will give us something worth the reading My Lord Saye I am told has writ a romance since his retirement in the Isle of Lundy and mister Waller they say is making one of our wars which if he does not mingle with a great deal of pleasing fiction cannot be very diverting sure the subject is so sad But all this is nothing to my coming to town you ll say Tis confest and that I was willing as long as I could to avoid saying anything when I had nothing to say worth your knowing I am still obliged to wait my brother Peyton and his lady coming I had a letter from him this week which I will send you that you may see what hopes he gives As little room as I have left too I must tell you what a present I had made me to day Two of the finest young Irish greyhounds that e er I saw a gentleman that serves the General sent them me They are newly come over and sent for by Henry Cromwell he tells me but not how he got them for me However I am glad I have them and much the more because it dispenses with a very unfit employment that your father out of his kindness to you and his civility to me was content to take upon him Letter thirty four SIR Jane was so unlucky as to come out of town before your return but she tells me she left my letter with Nan Stacy for you I was in hope she would have brought me one from you and because she did not I was resolv d to punish her and kept her up till one o clock telling me all her stories Sure if there be any truth in the old observation your cheeks glowed notably and tis most certain that if I were with you I should chide notably What do you mean to be so melancholy By her report your humour is grown insupportable I can allow it not to be altogether what she says and yet it may be very ill too but if you loved me you would not give yourself over to that which will infallibly kill you if it continue I know too well that our fortunes have given us occasion enough to complain and to be weary of her tyranny but alas would it be better if I had lost you or you me unless we were sure to die both together twould but increase our misery and add to that which is more already than we can well tell how to bear You are more cruel than she regarding a life that s dearer to me than that of the whole world besides and which makes all the happiness I have or ever shall be capable of Therefore by all our friendship I conjure you and by the power you have given me command you to preserve yourself with the same care that you would have me live Tis all the obedience I require of you and will be the greatest testimony you can give me of your faith When you have promised me this tis not impossible that I may promise you shall see me shortly though my brother Peyton who says he will come down to fetch his daughter hinders me from making the journey in compliment to her Yet I shall perhaps find business enough to carry me up to town Tis all the service I expect from two girls whose friends have given me leave to provide for that some order I must take for the disposal of them may serve for my pretence to see you but then I must find you pleased and in good humour merry as you were wont to be when we first met if you will not have me show that I am nothing akin to my cousin Osborne s lady But what an age tis since we first met and how great a change it has wrought in both of us if there had been as great a one in my face it could be either very handsome or very ugly For God s sake when we meet let us design one day to remember old stories in to ask one another by what degrees our friendship grew to this height tis at In earnest I am lost sometimes with thinking on t and though I can never repent the share you have in my heart I know not whether I gave it you willingly or not at first No to speak ingenuously I think you got an interest there a good while before I thought you had any and it grew so insensibly and yet so fast that all the traverses it has met with since has served rather to discover it to me than at all to hinder it By this confession you will see I am past all disguise with you and that you have reason to be satisfied with knowing as much of my heart as I do myself Will the kindness of this letter excuse the shortness on t For I have twenty more I think to write and the hopes I had of receiving one from you last night kept me writing this when I had more time or if all this will not satisfy make your own conditions so you do not return it me by the shortness of yours Your servant kisses your hands and I am Your faithful Letter thirty five This is written on the back of a letter of Sir Thomas Peyton to Dorothy and is probably a postscript to Letter thirty four Sir Thomas s letter is a good example of the stilted letter writing in vogue at that time which Dorothy tells us was so much admired The affairs that are troubling him are legal matters in connection with his brother in law Henry Oxenden s estate There is a multitude of letters in the MSS in the British Museum referring to this business but we are not greatly concerned with Oxenden s financial difficulties Sir Edward Hales was a gentleman of noble family in Kent There is one of the same name who in sixteen eighty eight declares himself openly to be a Papist and is tried under the Test Act He is concerned in the same year in the escape of King James providing him with a fishing boat to carry him into France This is in all probability the Sir Edward Hales referred to by Sir Thomas Peyton unless it be a son of the same name Here is the letter Good sister I am very sorry to hear the loss of our good brother whose short time gives us a sad example of our frail condition But I will not say the loss knowing whom I write to whose religion and wisdom is a present stay to support in all worldly accidents Tis long since we resolved to have given you a visit and have relieved you of my daughter But I have had the following of a most laborious affair which hath cost me the travelling though in our own country style fifty and I have been less at home than elsewhere ever since I came from London which hath vext me the more in regard I have been detained from the desire I had of being with you before this time Such entertainment however must all those have that have to do with such a purse proud and wilful person as Sir Edward Hales This next week being Michaelmas week we shall end all and I be at liberty I hope to consider my own contentments In the meantime I know not what excuses to make for the trouble I have put you to already of which I grow to be ashamed and I should much more be so if I did not know you to be as good as you are fair In both which regards I have a great honour to be esteemed My good sister Your faithful brother and servant THOMAS PEYTON KNOWLTON Sept twenty two sixteen fifty three On the other side of Sir T Peyton s Letter Nothing that is paper can scape me when I have time to write and tis to you But that I am not willing to excite your envy I would tell you how many letters I have despatched since I ended yours and if I could show them you twould be a certain cure for it for they are all very short ones and most of them merely compliments which I am sure you care not for I had forgot in my other to tell you what Jane requires for the satisfaction of what you confess you owe her You must promise her to be merry and not to take cold when you are at the tennis court for there she hears you are found Because you mention my Lord Broghill and his wit I have sent you some of his verses My brother urged them against me one day in a dispute where he would needs make me confess that no passion could be long lived and that such as were most in love forgot that ever they had been so within a twelvemonth after they were married and in earnest the want of examples to bring for the contrary puzzled me a little so that I was fain to bring out those pitiful verses of my Lord Biron to his wife which was so poor an argument that I was e en ashamed on t myself and he quickly laughed me out of countenance with saying they were just such as a married man s flame would produce and a wife inspire I send you a love letter too which simple as you see it was sent me in very good earnest and by a person of quality as I was told If you read it when you go to bed twill certainly make your sleep approved I am yours Letter thirty six My Lady Carlisle was as Dorothy says an extraordinary person She was the daughter of Henry Percy Earl of Northumberland and at the age of eighteen against her father s will and under somewhat romantic circumstances married James Hay Earl of Carlisle Her sister married the Earl of Leicester and she is therefore aunt to Lady Sunderland and Algernon Sydney She was a favourite attendant of Queen Henrietta and there are evil rumours connecting her name with that of Strafford On Strafford s death it is asserted that she transferred her affections to Pym to whom she is said to have betrayed the secrets of the Court There seems little doubt that it was she who gave notice to Pym of the King s coming to the House to seize the five members In sixteen forty eight she appears however to have assisted the Royalists with money for the purpose of raising a fleet to attack England and at the Restoration she was received at Court and employed herself in intriguing for the return of Queen Henrietta to England which was opposed at the time by Clarendon and others Soon after this and in the year of the Restoration she died suddenly Poets of all grades from Waller downwards have sung of her beauty vivacity and wit and Sir Toby Matthew speaks of her as too lofty and dignified to be capable of friendship and having too great a heart to be susceptible of love an extravagance of compliment hardly satisfactory in this plain age My Lord Paget at whose house at Marlow mister Lely was staying was a prominent loyalist both in camp and council chamber He married Frances the eldest daughter of the Earl of Holland my Lady Diana s sister Whether or not Dorothy really assisted young Sir Harry Yelverton in his suit for the hand of fair Lady Ruthin we cannot say but they were undoubtedly married Sir Harry Yelverton seems to have been a man of superior accomplishments and serious learning He was at this time twenty years of age and had been educated at saint Paul s School London and afterwards at Wadham College Oxford under the tutorship of doctor Wilkins Cromwell s brother in law a learned and philosophical mathematician He was admitted gentleman commoner in sixteen fifty and it is said made great proficiency in several branches of learning being as exact a Latin and Grecian as any in the university of his age or time He succeeded to his father s title soon after coming of age and took a leading part in the politics of the day becoming Knight of the Shire of Northampton in the Restoration Parliament He was a high Tory and a great defender of the Church and its ejected ministers one of whom doctor Thomas Morton the learned theologian Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield died in his house in sixteen fifty nine He wrote a discourse on the Truth and Reasonableness of the Religion delivered by Jesus Christ a Preface to doctor Morton s work on Episcopacy and a vindication of the Church of England against the attacks of the famous Edward Bagshawe In this letter Dorothy describes some husbands whom she could not marry See what she expects in a lover Have we not here some local squires hit off to the life Could George Eliot herself have done more for us in like space SIR Why are you so sullen and why am I the cause Can you believe that I do willingly defer my journey I know you do not Why then should my absence now be less supportable to you than heretofore Nay it shall not be long if I can help it and I shall break through all inconveniences rather than deny you anything that lies in my power to grant But by your own rules then may I not expect the same from you Is it possible that all I have said cannot oblige you to a care of yourself What a pleasant distinction you make when you say that tis not melancholy makes you do these things but a careless forgetfulness Did ever anybody forget themselves to that degree that was not melancholy in extremity Good God how you are altered and what is it that has done it I have known you when of all the things in the world you would not have been taken for a discontent you were as I thought perfectly pleased with your condition what has made it so much worse since I know nothing you have lost and am sure you have gained a friend that is capable of the highest degree of friendship you can propound that has already given an entire heart for that which she received and tis no more in her will than in her power ever to recall it or divide it if this be not enough to satisfy you tell me what I can do more There are a great many ingredients must go to the making me happy in a husband First as my cousin Franklin says our humours must agree and to do that he must have that kind of breeding that I have had and used that kind of company That is he must not be so much a country gentleman as to understand nothing but hawks and dogs and be fonder of either than his wife nor of the next sort of them whose aim reaches no further than to be Justice of the Peace and once in his life High Sheriff who reads no book but statutes and studies nothing but how to make a speech interlarded with Latin that may amaze his disagreeing poor neighbours and fright them rather than persuade them into quietness He must not be a thing that began the world in a free school was sent from thence to the university and is at his furthest when he reaches the Inns of Court has no acquaintance but those of his form in these places speaks the French he has picked out of old laws and admires nothing but the stories he has heard of the revels that were kept there before his time He must not be a town gallant neither that lives in a tavern and an ordinary that cannot imagine how an hour should be spent without company unless it be in sleeping that makes court to all the women he sees thinks they believe him and laughs and is laughed at equally Nor a travelled Monsieur whose head is all feather inside and outside that can talk of nothing but dances and duets and has courage enough to wear slashes when every one else dies with cold to see him He must not be a fool of no sort nor peevish nor ill natured nor proud nor covetous and to all this must be added that he must love me and I him as much as we are capable of loving Without all this his fortune though never so great would not satisfy me and with it a very moderate one would keep me from ever repenting my disposal I have been as large and as particular in my descriptions as my cousin Molle is in his of Moor Park but that you know the place so well I would send it you nothing can come near his patience in writing it but my reading on t Would you had sent me your father s letter it would not have been less welcome to me than to you and you may safely believe that I am equally concerned with you in anything I should be pleased to see something of my Lady Carlisle s writing because she is so extraordinary a person I have been thinking of sending you my picture till I could come myself but a picture is but dull company and that you need not besides I cannot tell whether it be very like me or not though tis the best I ever had drawn for me and mister Lilly Lely will have it that he never took more pains to make a good one in his life and that was it I think that spoiled it He was condemned for making the first he drew for me a little worse than I and in making this better he has made it as unlike as t other He is now I think at my Lord Pagett s at Marloe Marlow where I am promised he shall draw a picture of my Lady for me she gives it me she says as the greatest testimony of her friendship to me for by her own rule she is past the time of having pictures taken of her After eighteen she says there is no face but decays apparently I would fain have had her excepted such as had never been beauties for my comfort but she would not When you see your friend mister Heningham you may tell him in his ear there is a willow garland coming towards him He might have sped better in his suit if he had made court to me as well as to my Lady Ruthin She has been my wife this seven years and whosoever pretends there must ask my leave I have now given my consent that she shall marry a very pretty little gentleman Sir Christopher Yelverton s son and I think we shall have a wedding ere it be long My Lady her mother in great kindness would have recommended Heningham to me and told me in a compliment that I was fitter for him than her daughter who was younger and therefore did not understand the world so well that she was certain if he knew me he would be extremely taken for I would make just that kind of wife he looked for I humbly thanked her but said I was certain he would not make that kind of husband I looked for and so it went no further I expect my eldest brother here shortly whose fortune is well mended by my other brother s death so as if he were satisfied himself with what he has done I know no reason why he might not be very happy but I am afraid he is not I have not seen my sister since I knew she was so but sure she can have lost no beauty for I never saw any that she had but good black eyes which cannot alter He loves her I think at the ordinary rate of husbands but not enough I believe to marry her so much to his disadvantage if it were to do again and that would kill me were I as she for I could be infinitely better satisfied with a husband that had never loved me in hopes he might than with one that began to love me less than he had done I am yours Letter thirty seven SIR You say I abuse you and Jane says you abuse me when you say you are not melancholy which is to be believed Neither I think for I could not have said so positively as it seems she did that I should not be in town till my brother came back he was not gone when she writ nor is not yet and if my brother Peyton had come before his going I had spoiled her prediction But now it cannot be he goes on Monday or Tuesday at farthest I hope you did truly with me too in saying that you are not melancholy though she does not believe it I am thought so many times when I am not at all guilty on t How often do I sit in company a whole day and when they are gone am not able to give an account of six words that was said and many times could be so much better pleased with the entertainment my own thoughts give me that tis all I can do to be so civil as not to let them see they trouble me This may be your disease However remember you have promised me to be careful of yourself and that if I secure what you have entrusted me with you will answer for the rest Be this our bargain then and look that you give me as good an account of one as I shall give you of t other In earnest I was strangely vexed to see myself forced to disappoint you so and felt your trouble and my own too How often I have wished myself with you though but for a day for an hour I would have given all the time I am to spend here for it with all my heart You could not but have laughed if you had seen me last night My brother and mister Gibson were talking by the fire and I sat by but as no part of the company Amongst other things which I did not at all mind they fell into a discourse of flying and both agreed it was very possible to find out a way that people might fly like birds and despatch their journeys so I that had not said a word all night started up at that and desired they would say a little more on t for I had not marked the beginning but instead of that they both fell into so violent a laughing that I should appear so much concerned in such an art but they little knew of what use it might have been to me Yet I saw you last night but twas in a dream and before I could say a word to you or you to me the disorder my joy to see you had put me into awakened me Just now I was interrupted too and called away to entertain two dumb gentlemen you may imagine whether I was pleased to leave my writing to you for their company they have made such a tedious visit too and I am so tired with making of signs and tokens for everything I had to say Good God how do those that live with them always They are brothers and the eldest is a baronet has a good estate a wife and three or four children He was my servant heretofore and comes to see me still for old love s sake but if he could have made me mistress of the world I could not have had him and yet I ll swear he has nothing to be disliked in him but his want of tongue which in a woman might have been a virtue I sent you a part of Cyrus last week where you will meet with one Doralise in the story of Abradah and Panthee The whole story is very good but the humour makes the best part of it I am of her opinion in most things that she says in her character of L honnest homme that she is in search of and her resolution of receiving no heart that had been offered to anybody else Pray tell me how you like her and what fault you find in my Lady Carlisle s letter Methinks the hand and the style both show her a great person and tis writ in the way that s now affected by all that pretend to wit and good breeding only I am a little scandalized to confess that she uses that word faithful she that never knew how to be so in her life I have sent you my picture because you wished for it but pray let it not presume to disturb my Lady Sunderland s Put it in some corner where no eyes may find it out but yours to whom it is only intended Tis not a very good one but the best I shall ever have drawn of me for as my Lady says my time for pictures is past and therefore I have always refused to part with this because I was sure the next would be a worse There is a beauty in youth that every one has once in their lives and I remember my mother used to say there was never anybody that was not deformed but were handsome to some reasonable degree once between fourteen and twenty It must hang with the light on the left hand of it and you may keep it if you please till I bring you the original But then I must borrow it for tis no more mine if you like it because my brother is often bringing people into my closet where it hangs to show them other pictures that are there and if he miss this long thence twould trouble his jealous head You are not the first that has told me I knew better what quality I would not have in a husband than what I would but it was more pardonable in them I thought you had understood better what kind of person I liked than anybody else could possibly have done and therefore did not think it necessary to make you that description too Those that I reckoned up were only such as I could not be persuaded to have upon no terms though I had never seen such a person in my life as mister Temple not but that all those may make very good husbands to some women but they are so different from my humour that tis not possible we should ever agree for though it might be reasonably enough expected that I should conform mine to theirs to my shame be it spoken I could never do it And I have lived so long in the world and so much at my own liberty that whosoever has me must be content to take me as they find me without hope of ever making me other than I am I cannot so much as disguise my humour When it was designed that I should have had Sir Jus my brother used to tell he was confident that with all his wisdom any woman that had wit and discretion might make an ass of him and govern him as she pleased I could not deny that possibly it might be so but twas that I was sure I could never do and though tis likely I should have forced myself to so much compliance as was necessary for a reasonable wife yet farther than that no design could ever have carried me and I could not have flattered him into a belief that I admired him to gain more than he and all his generation are worth Tis such an ease as you say not to be solicitous to please others in earnest I am no more concerned whether people think me handsome or ill favoured whether they think I have wit or that I have none than I am whether they think my name Elizabeth or Dorothy I would do nobody no injury but I should never design to please above one and that one I must love too or else I should think it a trouble and consequently not do it I have made a general confession to you will you give me absolution Methinks you should for you are not much better by your own relation therefore tis easiest to forgive one another When you hear anything from your father remember that I am his humble servant and much concerned in his good health I am yours Letter thirty eight Lady Isabella is Lady Isabella Rich my Lady Diana s eldest sister She married Sir James Thynne Many years ago she had an intrigue with the Duke of Ormond by whom she had a son but Dorothy speaks I think of some later scandal than this My Lady Pembroke was the daughter of the Earl of Cumberland She first married Richard Earl of Dorset and afterwards the Earl of Pembroke She is described as a woman whose mind was endowed by nature with very extraordinary attributes Lord Pembroke on the other hand according to Clarendon pretended to no other qualification than to understand horses and dogs very well and to be believed honest and generous His stables vied with palaces and his falconry was furnished at immense expense but in his private life he was characterized by gross ignorance and vice and his public character was marked by ingratitude and instability The life of Lady Pembroke was embittered by this man for near twenty years and she was at length compelled to separate from him She lived alone until her husband s death which took place in January sixteen fifty One can understand that they were entirely unsuited to each other when Lady Pembroke in her Memorials is found to write thus of her husband He was no scholar having passed but three or four months at Oxford when he was taken thence after his father s death He was of quick apprehension sharp understanding very crafty withal of a discerning spirit but a choleric nature increased by the office he held of Chamberlain to the King Why then did the accomplished Lady Anne Clifford unite herself to so worthless a person Does she not answer this question for us when she writes that he was the greatest nobleman in England It is of some interest to us to remember that Francis Osborne Dorothy s uncle her father s youngest brother was Master of the Horse to this great nobleman Whether Lord and Lady Leicester were as Dorothy says in great disorder at this time it is impossible to say Lady Leicester is said to have been of a warm and irritable temper and Lord Leicester is described by Clarendon as staggering and irresolute in his nature However nothing is said of their quarrels but on the other hand there is a very pathetic account in Lord Leicester s journal of his wife s death in sixteen fifty nine which shows that whatever this disorder may have been a complete reconciliation was afterwards effected SIR You would have me say something of my coming Alas how fain I would have something to say but I know no more than you saw in that letter I sent you How willingly would I tell you anything that I thought would please you but I confess I do not like to give uncertain hopes because I do not care to receive them And I thought there was no need of saying I would be sure to take the first occasion and that I waited with impatience for it because I hoped you had believed all that already and so you do I am sure Say what you will you cannot but know my heart enough to be assured that I wish myself with you for my own sake as well as yours Tis rather that you love to hear me say it often than that you doubt it for I am no dissembler I could not cry for a husband that were indifferent to me like your cousin no nor for a husband that I loved neither I think twould break my heart sooner than make me shed a tear Tis ordinary griefs that make me weep In earnest you cannot imagine how often I have been told that I had too much franchise in my humour and that twas a point of good breeding to disguise handsomely but I answered still for myself that twas not to be expected I should be exactly bred that had never seen a Court since I was capable of anything Yet I know so much that my Lady Carlisle would take it very ill if you should not let her get the point of honour tis all she aims at to go beyond everybody in compliment But are you not afraid of giving me a strong vanity with telling me I write better than the most extraordinary person in the world If I had not the sense to understand that the reason why you like my letters better is only because they are kinder than hers such a word might have undone me But my Lady Isabella that speaks and looks and sings and plays and all so prettily why cannot I say that she is free from faults as her sister believes her No I am afraid she is not and sorry that those she has are so generally known My brother did not bring them for an example but I did and made him confess she had better have married a beggar than that beast with all his estate She cannot be excused but certainly they run a strange hazard that have such husbands as makes them think they cannot be more undone whatever course they take Oh tis ten thousand pities I remember she was the first woman that ever I took notice of for extremely handsome and in earnest she was then the loveliest lady that could be looked on I think But what should she do with beauty now Were I as she I should hide myself from all the world I should think all people that looked on me read it in my face and despised me in their hearts and at the same time they made me a leg or spoke civilly to me I should believe they did not think I deserved their respect I ll tell you who he urged for an example though my Lord Pembroke and my Lady who they say are upon parting after all his passion for her and his marrying her against the consent of all his friends but to that I answered that though he pretended great kindness he had for her I never heard of much she had for him and knew she married him merely for advantage Nor is she a woman of that discretion as to do all that might become her when she must do it rather as things fit to be done than as things she inclined to Besides that what with a spleenatick side and a chemical head he is but an odd body himself But is it possible what they say that my Lord Leicester and my Lady are in great disorder and that after forty years patience he has now taken up the cudgels and resolved to venture for the mastery Methinks he wakes out of his long sleep like a froward child that wrangles and fights with all that comes near it They say he has turned away almost every servant in the house and left her at Penshurst to digest it as she can What an age do we live in where tis a miracle if in ten couples that are married two of them live so as not to publish to the world that they cannot agree I begin to be of your opinion of him that when the Roman Church first propounded whether it were not convenient for priests not to marry said that it might be convenient enough but sure it was not our Saviour s intention for He commanded that all should take up their cross and follow Him and for his part he was confident there was no such cross as a wife This is an ill doctrine for me to preach but to my friends I cannot but confess that I am afraid much of the fault lies in us for I have observed that formerly in great families the men seldom disagree but the women are always scolding and tis most certain that let the husband be what he will if the wife have but patience which sure becomes her best the disorder cannot be great enough to make a noise his anger alone when it meets with nothing that resists it cannot be loud enough to disturb the neighbours And such a wife may be said to do as a kinswoman of ours that had a husband who was not always himself and when he was otherwise his humour was to rise in the night and with two bedstaves labour on the table an hour together She took care every night to lay a great cushion upon the table for him to strike on that nobody might hear him and so discover his madness But tis a sad thing when all one s happiness is only that the world does not know you are miserable For my part I think it were very convenient that all such as intend to marry should live together in the same house some years of probation and if in all that time they never disagreed they should then be permitted to marry if they please but how few would do it then I do not remember that I ever saw or heard of any couple that were bred up so together as many you know are that are designed for one another from children but they always disliked one another extremely parted if it were left in their choice If people proceeded with this caution the world would end sooner than is expected I believe and because with all my wariness tis not impossible but I may be caught nor likely that I should be wiser than anybody else twere best I think that I said no more on this point What would I give to know that sister of yours that is so good at discovering sure she is excellent company she has reason to laugh at you when you would have persuaded her the moss was sweet I remember Jane brought some of it to me to ask me if I thought it had no ill smell and whether she might venture to put it in the box or not I told her as I thought she could not put a more innocent thing there for I did not find it had any smell at all besides I was willing it should do me some service in requital for the pains I had taken for it My niece and I wandered through some eight hundred acres of wood in search of it to make rocks and strange things that her head is full of and she admires it more than you did If she had known I had consented it should have been used to fill up a box she would have condemned me extremely I told Jane that you liked her present and she I find is resolved to spoil your compliment and make you confess at last that they are not worth the eating she threatens to send you more but you would forgive her if you saw how she baits me every day to go to London all that I can say will not satisfy her When I urge as tis true that there is a necessity of my stay here she grows furious cries you will die with melancholy and confounds me so with stories of your ill humour that I ll swear I think I should go merely to be at quiet if it were possible though there were no other reason for it But I hope tis not so ill as she would have me believe it though I know your humour is strangely altered from what it was and am sorry to see it Melancholy must needs do you more hurt than to another to whom it may be natural as I think it is to me therefore if you loved me you would take heed on t Can you believe that you are dearer to me than the whole world beside and yet neglect yourself If you do not you wrong a perfect friendship and if you do you must consider my interest in you and preserve yourself to make me happy Promise me this or I shall haunt you worse than she does me Scribble how you please so you make your letter long enough you see I give you good example besides I can assure you we do perfectly agree if you receive not satisfaction but from my letters I have none but what yours give me Letter thirty nine Dorothy has been in London since her last letter but unfortunately she has either not met with Temple or he has left town suddenly whilst she was there on some unexplained errand This would therefore seem a natural place to begin a new chapter but as we have very shortly to come to a series of unhappy letters quite distinct in their character from these I have thought fit to place in this long chapter yet a few more letters after Dorothy s autumn visit to London Stephen Marshall was like Hugh Peters one of those preachers who was able to exchange the obscurity of a country parish for the public fame of a London pulpit by reason of a certain gift of rhetorical power the value of which it is impossible to estimate to day Such of his sermons as are still extant are prosy long winded dogmatic absurdities overloaded with periphrastic illustrations in scriptural language They are meaningless to a degree which would make one wonder at the docility and patience of a seventeenth century congregation if one had not witnessed a similar spirit in congregations of to day There is no honest biography of Stephen Marshall In the news books and tracts of the day we find references to sermons preached by him by command before the Army of the Parliament and we have reprints of some of these I have searched in vain to find the sermon which Dorothy heard but it was probably not a sermon given on any great occasion and we may believe it was never printed There is an amusing scandalous tract called the Life and Death of Stephen Marshall which is so full of evil speaking lying and slandering as to be quite unworthy of quotation From this we may take it however that he was born at Gormanchester in Cromwell s county was educated at Emmanuel College Cambridge and that before he came to London his chief cure of souls was at Finchingfield in Essex These and the records of his London preaching are the only facts in his life s history which have come to my notice My Lord Whitelocke did go to Sweden as Dorothy surmises setting sail from Plymouth with one hundred honest men on October twenty six sixteen fifty three or very soon afterwards as one may read in his journal of the progress of the Embassy That he should fill this office appears to have been proposed to him by Cromwell in September of this year An Act of Parliament to abolish the Chancery was indeed passed in the August of this year Well may Lord Keble sore lament and the rest of the world rejoice at such news Joseph Keble was a well known law reporter a son of Serjeant Richard Keble He was a Fellow of All Souls and a Bencher of Gray s Inn and furthermore was one of the Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal from sixteen forty eight sixteen fifty four There was some debate says Whitelocke whether they should be styled Commissioners or Lords Commissioners and though the word Lords was far less acceptable at this time than formerly yet that they might not seem to lessen their own authority nor the honour of their office constituted by them they voted the title to be Lords Commissioners SIR If want of kindness were the only crime I exempted from pardon twas not that I had the least apprehension you could be guilty of it but to show you by excepting only an impossible thing that I excepted nothing No in earnest I can fancy no such thing of you or if I could the quarrel would be to myself I should never forgive my own folly that let me to choose a friend that could be false But I ll leave this which is not much to the purpose and tell you how with my usual impatience I expected your letter and how cold it went to my heart to see it so short a one Twas so great a pain to me that I am resolv d you shall not feel it nor can I in justice punish you for a fault unwillingly committed If I were your enemy I could not use you ill when I saw Fortune do it too and in gallantry and good nature both I should think myself rather obliged to protect you from her injury if it lay in my power than double them upon you These things considered I believe this letter will be longer than ordinary kinder I think it cannot be I always speak my heart to you and that is so much your friend it never furnishes me with anything to your disadvantage I am glad you are an admirer of Telesile as well as I in my opinion tis a fine Lady but I know you will pity poor Amestris strongly when you have read her story I ll swear I cried for her when I read it first though she were but an imaginary person and sure if anything of that kind can deserve it her misfortunes may God forgive me I was as near laughing yesterday where I should not Would you believe that I had the grace to go hear a sermon upon a week day In earnest tis true a mister Marshall was the man that preached but never anybody was so defeated He is so famed that I expected rare things of him and seriously I listened to him as if he had been saint Paul and what do you think he told us Why that if there were no kings no queens no lords no ladies nor gentlemen nor gentlewomen in the world twould be no loss to God Almighty at all This we had over some forty times which made me remember it whether I would or not The rest was much at this rate interlarded with the prettiest odd phrases that I had the most ado to look soberly enough for the place I was in that ever I had in my life He does not preach so always sure If he does I cannot believe his sermons will do much towards bringing anybody to heaven more than by exercising their patience Yet I ll say that for him he stood stoutly for tithes though in my opinion few deserve them less than he and it may be he would be better without them Yet you are not convinced you say that to be miserable is the way to be good to some natures I think it is not but there are many of so careless and vain a temper that the least breath of good fortune swells them with so much pride that if they were not put in mind sometimes by a sound cross or two that they are mortal they would hardly think it possible and though tis a sign of a servile nature when fear produces more of reverence in us than love yet there is more danger of forgetting oneself in a prosperous fortune than in the contrary and affliction may be the surest though not the pleasantest guide to heaven What think you might not I preach with mister Marshall for a wager But you could fancy a perfect happiness here you say that is not much many people do so but I never heard of anybody that ever had it more than in fancy so that will not be strange if you should miss on t One may be happy to a good degree I think in a faithful friend a moderate fortune and a retired life further than this I know nothing to wish but if there be anything beyond it I wish it you You did not tell me what carried you out of town in such haste I hope the occasion was good you must account to me for all that I lost by it I shall expect a whole packet next week Oh me I have forgot this once or twice to tell you that if it be no inconvenience to you I could wish you would change the place of direction for my letters Certainly that Jones knows my name I bespoke a saddle of him once and though it be a good while agone yet I was so often with him about it having much ado to make him understand how I would have it it being of a fashion he had never seen though sure it be common that I am confident he has not forgot me Besides that upon it he got my brother s custom and I cannot tell whether he does not use the shop still Jane presents her humble service to you and has sent you something in a box tis hard to imagine what she can find here to present you withal and I am much in doubt whether you will not pay too dear for it if you discharge the carriage Tis a pretty freedom she takes but you may thank yourself she thinks because you call her fellow servant she may use you accordingly I bred her better but you have spoiled her Is it true that my Lord Whitlocke goes Ambassador where my Lord Lisle should have gone I know not how he may appear in a Swedish Court but he was never meant for a courtier at home I believe Yet tis a gracious Prince he is often in this country and always does us the favour to send for his fruit hither He was making a purchase of one of the best houses in the county I know not whether he goes on with it but tis such a one as will not become anything less than a lord And there is a talk as if the Chancery were going down if so his title goes with it I think Twill be sad news for my Lord Keble s son he will have nothing left to say when my Lord my father is taken from him Were it not better that I had nothing to say neither than that I should entertain you with such senseless things I hope I am half asleep nothing else can excuse me if I were quite asleep I should say fine things to you I often dream I do but perhaps if I could remember them they are no wiser than my wakening discourses Good night Letter forty A letter has been lost whether Harrold or Collins the two carriers were either or both of them guilty of carelessness in the delivery of these letters it is quite impossible to say now Dorothy seems to think Harrold delivered the letter and it was mislaid in London Perhaps it was this letter and what was written about it that caused all those latent feelings of despair and discontent to awaken in the breasts of the two lovers Was this the spark that loneliness and absence fanned into flame You shall judge for yourself reader in the next chapter SIR That you may be at more certainty hereafter what to think let me tell you that nothing could hinder me from writing to you as well for my own satisfaction as yours but an impossibility of doing it nothing but death or a dead palsy in my hands or something that had the same effect I did write it and gave it Harrold but by an accident his horse fell lame so that he could not set out on Monday but on Tuesday he did come to town on Wednesday carried the letter himself as he tells me where twas directed which was to mister Copyn in Fleet Street Twas the first time I made use of that direction no matter and I had not done it then since it proves no better Harrold came late home on Thursday night with such an account as your boy gave you that coming out of town the same day he came in he had been at Fleet Street again but there was no letter for him I was sorry but I did not much wonder at it because he gave so little time and resolved to make my best of that I had by Collins I read it over often enough to make it equal with the longest letter that ever was writ and pleased myself in earnest as much as it was possible for me in the humour I was in to think how by that time you had asked me pardon for the little reproaches you had made me and that the kindness and length of my letter had made you amends for the trouble it had given you in expecting it But I am not a little annoyed to find you had it not I am very confident it was delivered and therefore you must search where the fault lies Were it not that you had suffered too much already I would complain a little of you Why should you think me so careless of anything that you were concerned in as to doubt that I had writ Though I had received none from you I should not have taken that occasion to revenge myself Nay I should have concluded you innocent and have imagined a thousand ways how it might happen rather than have suspected your want of kindness Why should not you be as just to me But I will not chide it may be as long as we have been friends you do not know me so well yet as to make an absolute judgment of me but if I know myself at all if I am capable of being anything tis a perfect friend Yet I must chide too Why did you get such a cold Good God how careless you are of a life that by your own confession I have told you makes all the happiness of mine Tis unkindly done What is left for me to say when that will not prevail with you or how can you persuade me to a cure of myself when you refuse to give me the example I have nothing in the world that gives me the least desire of preserving myself but the opinion I have you would not be willing to lose me and yet if you saw with what caution I live at least to what I did before you would reproach it to yourself sometimes and might grant perhaps that you have not got the advantage of me in friendship so much as you imagine What besides your consideration could oblige me to live and lose all the rest of my friends thus one after another Sure I am not insensible nor very ill natured and yet I ll swear I think I do not afflict myself half so much as another would do that had my losses I pay nothing of sadness to the memory of my poor brother but I presently disperse it with thinking what I owe in thankfulness that tis not you I mourn for Well give me no more occasions to complain of you you know not what may follow Here was mister Freeman yesterday that made me a very kind visit and said so many fine things to me that I was confounded with his civilities and had nothing to say for myself I could have wished then that he had considered me less and my niece more but if you continue to use me thus in earnest I ll not be so much her friend hereafter Methinks I see you laugh at all my threatenings and not without reason mister Freeman you believe is designed for somebody that deserves him better I think so too and am not sorry for it and you have reason to believe I never can be other than Your faithful friend CHAPTER IV DESPONDENCY CHRISTMAS sixteen fifty three This chapter of letters is a sad note sounding out from among its fellows with mournful clearness There had seemed a doubt whether all these letters must be regarded as of one series or whether more correctly it was to be assumed that Dorothy and Temple had their lovers quarrels for the well understood pleasure of kissing friends again But you will agree that these lovers were not altogether as other lovers are that their troubles were too real and too many for their love to need the stimulus of constant April shower quarrels and these letters are very serious in their sadness imprinting themselves in the mind after constant reading as landmarks clearly defining the course and progress of an unusual event in these lovers history a misunderstanding The letters are written at Christmastide sixteen fifty three Dorothy had returned from London to Chicksands and either had not seen Temple or he had left London hurriedly whilst she was there There is a letter lost Dorothy s youngest brother is lately dead her niece has left her her companion Jane is sick her father growing daily weaker and weaker was sinking into his grave before her eyes No bright chance seemed to open before her and their marriage seemed an impossibility For a moment she loses faith not in Temple but in fortune faith once gone hope missing her comrade flies away in search of her She is alone in the old house with her dying father and with her brother pouring his unkind gossip into her unwilling ear whilst the sad long year draws slowly to its close and there is no sign of better fortune for the lovers can we wonder then that Dorothy lonely and unaided pacing in the damp garden beneath the bare trees with all the bright summer changed into decay lost faith and hope Temple when Dorothy s thoughts reach him must have replied with some impatience There are stories too set about concerning her good name by one mister B to disturb Temple Temple can hardly have given credence to these but he may have complained of them to Dorothy who is led to declare I am the most unfortunate woman breathing but I was never false though she forgives her lover all those strange thoughts he has had of her Whatever were the causes of the quarrel or rather the despondency we shall never know accurately Dorothy was not the woman to vapour for months about an early and a quiet grave When she writes this it is written in the deepest earnest of despair when this mood is over it is over for ever and we emerge into a clear atmosphere of hope and content The despondency has been agonizing but the agony is sharp and rapid and gives place to the wisdom of hope Temple now comes to Chicksands at an early date There is a new interchange of vows Never again will their faith be shaken by fretting and despair and these vows are never broken but remain with the lovers until they are set aside by others taken under the solemn sanction of the law and the old troubles vanish in new responsibilities and a new life Letter forty one Lady Anne Blunt was a daughter of the Earl of Newport Her mother had turned Catholic in sixteen thirty seven which had led to an estrangement between her and her husband and we may conclude poor Lady Anne had by no means a happy home There are two scandals connected with her name She appears to have run away with one William Blunt the mister Blunt mentioned by Dorothy in her next letter and on April eighteen sixteen fifty four she petitioned the Protector to issue a special commission upon her whole case mister Blunt pretended that she was contracted to him for the sake it is said of gaining money thereby There being no Bishop s Court at this time there are legal difficulties in the way and we never hear the result of the petition Again in February sixteen fifty five one mister Porter finds himself committed to Lambeth House for carrying away the Lady Anne Blunt and endeavouring to marry her without her father s consent SIR Having tired myself with thinking I mean to weary you with reading and revenge myself that way for all the unquiet thoughts you have given me But I intended this a sober letter and therefore sans raillerie let me tell you I have seriously considered all our misfortunes and can see no end of them but by submitting to that which we cannot avoid and by yielding to it break the force of a blow which if resisted brings a certain ruin I think I need not tell you how dear you have been to me nor that in your kindness I placed all the satisfaction of my life twas the only happiness I proposed to myself and had set my heart so much upon it that it was therefore made my punishment to let me see that how innocent soever I thought my affection it was guilty in being greater than is allowable for things of this world Tis not a melancholy humour gives me these apprehensions and inclinations nor the persuasions of others tis the result of a long strife with myself before my reason could overcome my passion or bring me to a perfect resignation to whatsoever is allotted for me Tis now done I hope and I have nothing left but to persuade you to that which I assure myself your own judgment will approve in the end and your reason has often prevailed with you to offer that which you would have done then out of kindness to me and point of honour I would have you do now out of wisdom and kindness to yourself Not that I would disclaim my part in it or lessen my obligation to you no I am your friend as much as ever I was in my life I think more and I am sure I shall never be less I have known you long enough to discern that you have all the qualities that make an excellent friend and I shall endeavour to deserve that you may be so to me but I would have you do this upon the justest grounds and such as may conduce most to your quiet and future satisfaction When we have tried all ways to happiness there is no such thing to be found but in a mind conformed to one s condition whatever it be and in not aiming at anything that is either impossible or improbable all the rest is but vanity and vexation of spirit and I durst pronounce it so from that little knowledge I have had of the world though I had not Scripture for my warrant The shepherd that bragged to the traveller who asked him What weather it was like to be that it should be what weather pleased him and made it good by saying it should be what weather pleased God and what pleased God should please him said an excellent thing in such language and knew enough to make him the happiest person in the world if he made a right use on t There can be no pleasure in a struggling life and that folly which we condemn in an ambitious man that s ever labouring for that which is hardly got and more uncertainly kept is seen in all according to their several humours in some tis covetousness in others pride in some stubbornness of nature that chooses always to go against the tide and in others an unfortunate fancy to things that are in themselves innocent till we make them otherwise by desiring them too much Of this sort you and I are I think we have lived hitherto upon hopes so airy that I have often wondered how they could support the weight of our misfortunes but passion gives a strength above nature we see it in mad people and not to flatter ourselves ours is but a refined degree of madness What can it be else to be lost to all things in the world but that single object that takes up one s fancy to lose all the quiet and repose of one s life in hunting after it when there is so little likelihood of ever gaining it and so many more probable accidents that will infallibly make us miss on t And which is more than all tis being mastered by that which reason and religion teaches us to govern and in that only gives us a pre eminence over beasts This soberly consider d is enough to let us see our error and consequently to persuade us to redeem it To another person I should justify myself that tis not a lightness in my nature nor any interest that is not common to us both that has wrought this change in me To you that know my heart and from whom I shall never hide it to whom a thousand testimonies of my kindness can witness the reality of it and whose friendship is not built upon common grounds I have no more to say but that I impose not my opinions upon you and that I had rather you took them up as your own choice than upon my entreaty But if as we have not differed in anything else we could agree in this too and resolve upon a friendship that will be much the perfecter for having nothing of passion in it how happy might we be without so much as a fear of the change that any accident could bring We might defy all that fortune could do and putting off all disguise and constraint with that which only made it necessary make our lives as easy to us as the condition of this world will permit I may own you as a person that I extremely value and esteem and for whom I have a particular friendship and you may consider me as one that will always be Your faithful This was written when I expected a letter from you how came I to miss it I thought at first it might be the carrier s fault in changing his time without giving notice but he assures me he did to Nan My brother s groom came down to day too and saw her he tells me but brings me nothing from her if nothing of ill be the cause I am contented You hear the noise my Lady Anne Blunt has made with her marrying I am so weary with meeting it in all places where I go from what is she fallen they talked but the week before that she should have my Lord of Strafford Did you not intend to write to me when you writ to Jane That bit of paper did me great service without it I should have had strange apprehension and my sad dreams and the several frights I have waked in would have run so in my head that I should have concluded something of very ill from your silence Poor Jane is sick but she will write she says if she can Did you send the last part of Cyrus to mister Hollingsworth Letter forty two SIR I am extremely sorry that your letter miscarried but I am confident my brother has it not As cunning as he is he could not hide from me but that I should discover it some way or other No he was here and both his men when this letter should have come and not one of them stirred out that day indeed the next day they went all to London The note you writ to Jane came in one of Nan s by Collins but nothing else it must be lost by the porter that was sent with it and twas very unhappy that there should be anything in it of more consequence than ordinary it may be numbered amongst the rest of our misfortunes all which an inconsiderate passion has occasioned You must pardon me I cannot be reconciled to it it has been the ruin of us both Tis true that nobody must imagine to themselves ever to be absolute master on t but there is great difference betwixt that and yielding to it between striving with it and soothing it up till it grows too strong for one Can I remember how ignorantly and innocently I suffered it to steal upon me by degrees how under a mask of friendship I cozened myself into that which had it appeared to me at first in its true shape I had feared and shunned Can I discern that it has made the trouble of your life and cast a cloud upon mine that will help to cover me in my grave Can I know that it wrought so upon us both as to make neither of us friends to one another but agree in running wildly to our own destruction and that perhaps of some innocent persons who might live to curse our folly that gave them so miserable a being Ah if you love yourself or me you must confess that I have reason to condemn this senseless passion that wheresoe er it comes destroys all that entertain it nothing of judgment or discretion can live with it and it puts everything else out of order before it can find a place for itself What has it brought my poor Lady Anne Blunt to She is the talk of all the footmen and boys in the street and will be company for them shortly and yet is so blinded by her passion as not at all to perceive the misery she has brought herself to and this fond love of hers has so rooted all sense of nature out of her heart that they say she is no more moved than a statue with the affliction of a father and mother that doted on her and had placed the comfort of their lives in her preferment With all this is it not manifest to the whole world that mister Blunt could not consider anything in this action but his own interest and that he makes her a very ill return for all her kindness if he had loved her truly he would have died rather than have been the occasion of this misfortune to her My cousin Franklin as you observe very well may say fine things now she is warm in Moor Park but she is very much altered in her opinions since her marriage if these be her own She left a gentleman that I could name whom she had much more of kindness for than ever she had for mister Franklin because his estate was less and upon the discovery of some letters that her mother intercepted suffered herself to be persuaded that twenty three hundred pound a year was better than twelve hundred though with a person she loved and has recovered it so well that you see she confesses there is nothing in her condition she desires to alter at the charge of a wish She s happier by much than I shall ever be but I do not envy her may she long enjoy it and I an early and a quiet grave free from the trouble of this busy world where all with passion pursue their own interests at their neighbour s charges where nobody is pleased but somebody complains on t and where tis impossible to be without giving and receiving injuries You would know what I would be at and how I intend to dispose of myself Alas were I in my own disposal you should come to my grave to be resolved but grief alone will not kill All that I can say then is that I resolve on nothing but to arm myself with patience to resist nothing that is laid upon me nor struggle for what I have no hope to get I have no ends nor no designs nor will my heart ever be capable of any but like a country wasted by a civil war where two opposing parties have disputed their right so long till they have made it worth neither of their conquests tis ruined and desolated by the long strife within it to that degree as twill be useful to none nobody that knows the condition tis in will think it worth the gaining and I shall not trouble anybody with it No really if I may be permitted to desire anything it shall be only that I may injure nobody but myself I can bear anything that reflects only upon me or if I cannot I can die but I would fain die innocent that I might hope to be happy in the next world though never in this I take it a little ill that you should conjure me by anything with a belief that tis more powerful with me than your kindness No assure yourself what that alone cannot gain will be denied to all the world You would see me you say You may do so if you please though I know not to what end You deceive yourself if you think it would prevail upon me to alter my intentions besides I can make no contrivances it must be here and I must endure the noise it will make and undergo the censures of a people that choose ever to give the worst interpretation that anything will bear Yet if it can be any ease to you to make me more miserable than I am never spare me consider yourself only and not me at all tis no more than I deserve for not accepting what you offered me whilst twas in your power to make it good as you say it then was You were prepared it seems but I was surprised I confess Twas a kind fault though and you may pardon it with more reason than I have to forgive it myself And let me tell you this too as lost and as wretched as I am I have still some sense of my reputation left in me I find that to my cost I shall attempt to preserve it as clear as I can and to do that I must if you see me thus make it the last of our interviews What can excuse me if I should entertain any person that is known to pretend to me when I can have no hope of ever marrying him And what hope can I have of that when the fortune that can only make it possible to me depends upon a thousand accidents and contingencies the uncertainty of the place tis in and the government it may fall under your father s life or his success his disposal of himself and of his fortune besides the time that must necessarily be required to produce all this and the changes that may probably bring with it which tis impossible for us to foresee All this considered what have I to say for myself when people shall ask what tis I expect Can there be anything vainer than such a hope upon such grounds You must needs see the folly on t yourself and therefore examine your own heart what tis fit for me to do and what you can do for a person you love and that deserves your compassion if nothing else a person that will always have an inviolable friendship for you a friendship that shall take up all the room my passion held in my heart and govern there as master till death come and take possession and turn it out Why should you make an impossibility where there is none A thousand accidents might have taken me from you and you must have borne it Why would not your own resolution work as much upon you as necessity and time does infallibly upon people Your father would take it very ill I believe if you should pretend to love me better than he did my Lady yet she is dead and he lives and perhaps may do to love again There is a gentlewoman in this country that loved so passionately for six or seven years that her friends who kept her from marrying fearing her death consented to it and within half a year her husband died which afflicted her so strongly nobody thought she would have lived She saw no light but candles in three years nor came abroad in five and now that tis some nine years past she is passionately taken again with another and how long she has been so nobody knows but herself This is to let you see tis not impossible what I ask nor unreasonable Think on t and attempt it at least but do it sincerely and do not help your passion to master you As you have ever loved me do this The carrier shall bring your letters to Suffolk House to Jones I shall long to hear from you but if you should deny the only hope that s left me I must beg you will defer it till Christmas Day be past for to deal freely with you I have some devotions to perform then which must not be disturbed with anything and nothing is like to do it as so sensible an affliction Adieu Letter forty three SIR I can say little more than I did I am convinced of the vileness of the world and all that s in it and that I deceived myself extremely when I expected anything of comfort from it No I have no more to do in t but to grow every day more and more weary of it if it be possible that I have not yet reached the highest degree of hatred for it But I thank God I hate nothing else but the base world and the vices that make a part of it I am in perfect charity with my enemies and have compassion for all people s misfortunes as well as for my own especially for those I may have caused and I may truly say I bear my share of such But as nothing obliges me to relieve a person that is in extreme want till I change conditions with him and come to be where he began and that I may be thought compassionate if I do all that I can without prejudicing myself too much so let me tell you that if I could help it I would not love you and that as long as I live I shall strive against it as against that which had been my ruin and was certainly sent me as a punishment for my sin But I shall always have a sense of your misfortunes equal if not above my own I shall pray that you may obtain a quiet I never hope for but in my grave and I shall never change my condition but with my life Yet let not this give you a hope Nothing ever can persuade me to enter the world again I shall in a short time have disengaged myself of all my little affairs in it and settled myself in a condition to apprehend nothing but too long a life therefore I wish you would forget me and to induce you to it let me tell you freely that I deserve you should If I remember anybody tis against my will I am possessed with that strange insensibility that my nearest relations have no tie upon me and I find myself no more concerned in those that I have heretofore had great tenderness of affection for than in my kindred that died long before I was born Leave me to this and seek a better fortune I beg it of you as heartily as I forgive you all those strange thoughts you have had of me Think me so still if that will do anything towards it For God s sake do take any course that may make you happy or if that cannot be less unfortunate at least than Your friend and humble servant D OSBORNE I can hear nothing of that letter but I hear from all people that I know part of my unhappy story and from some that I do not know A lady whose face I never saw sent it me as news she had out of Ireland Letter forty four SIR If you have ever loved me do not refuse the last request I shall ever make you tis to preserve yourself from the violence of your passion Vent it all upon me call me and think me what you please make me if it be possible more wretched than I am I ll bear it all without the least murmur Nay I deserve it all for had you never seen me you had certainly been happy Tis my misfortunes only that have that infectious quality as to strike at the same time me and all that s dear to me I am the most unfortunate woman breathing but I was never false No I call heaven to witness that if my life could satisfy for the least injury my fortune has done you I cannot say twas I that did them you I would lay it down with greater joy than any person ever received a crown and if I ever forget what I owe you or ever entertained a thought of kindness for any person in the world besides may I live a long and miserable life Tis the greatest curse I can invent if there be a greater may I feel it This is all I can say Tell me if it be possible I can do anything for you and tell me how I may deserve your pardon for all the trouble I have given you I would not die without it Directed For mister Temple Letter forty five SIR Tis most true what you say that few have what they merit if it were otherwise you would be happy I think but then I should be so too and that must not be a false and an inconstant person cannot merit it I am sure You are kind in your good wishes but I aim at no friends nor no princes the honour would be lost upon me I should become a crown so ill there would be no striving for it after me and sure I should not wear it long Your letter was a much greater loss to me than that of Henry Cromwell and therefore tis that with all my care and diligence I cannot inquire it out You will not complain I believe of the shortness of my last whatever else you dislike in it and if I spare you at any time tis because I cannot but imagine since I am so wearisome to myself that I must needs be so to everybody else though at present I have other occasions that will not permit this to be a long one I am sorry it should be only in my power to make a friend miserable and that where I have so great a kindness I should do so great injuries but tis my fortune and I must bear it twill be none to you I hope to pray for you nor to desire that you would all passion laid aside freely tell me my faults that I may at least ask your forgiveness where tis not in my power to make you better satisfaction I would fain make even with all the world and be out of danger of dying in anybody s debt then I have nothing more to do in it but to expect when I shall be so happy as to leave it and always to remember that my misfortune makes all my faults towards you and that my faults to God make all my misfortunes Your unhappy Letter forty six SIR That which I writ by your boy was in so much haste and distraction as I cannot be satisfied with it nor believe it has expressed my thoughts as I meant them No I find it is not easily done at more leisure and I am yet to seek what to say that is not too little nor too much I would fain let you see that I am extremely sensible of your affliction that I would lay down my life to redeem you from it but that s a mean expression my life is of so little value that I will not mention it No let it be rather what in earnest if I can tell anything I have left that is considerable enough to expose for it it must be that small reputation I have amongst my friends that s all my wealth and that I could part with to restore you to that quiet you lived in when I first knew you But on the other side I would not give you hopes of that I cannot do If I loved you less I would allow you to be the same person to me and I would be the same to you as heretofore But to deal freely with you that were to betray myself and I find that my passion would quickly be my master again if I gave it any liberty I am not secure that it would not make me do the most extravagant things in the world and I shall be forced to keep a continual war alive with it as long as there are any remainders of it left I think I might as well have said as long as I lived Why should you give yourself over so unreasonably to it Good God no woman breathing can deserve half the trouble you give yourself If I were yours from this minute I could not recompense what you have suffered from the violence of your passion though I were all that you can imagine me when God knows I am an inconsiderable person born to a thousand misfortunes which have taken away all sense of anything else from me and left me a walking misery only I do from my soul forgive you all the injuries your passion has done me though let me tell you I was much more at my ease whilst I was angry Scorn and despite would have cured me in some reasonable time which I despair of now However I am not displeased with it and if it may be of any advantage to you I shall not consider myself in it but let me beg then that you will leave off those dismal thoughts I tremble at the desperate things you say in your letter for the love of God consider seriously with yourself what can enter into comparison with the safety of your soul Are a thousand women or ten thousand worlds worth it No you cannot have so little reason left as you pretend nor so little religion For God s sake let us not neglect what can only make us happy for trifles If God had seen it fit to have satisfied our desires we should have had them and everything would not have conspired thus to have crossed them Since He has decreed it otherwise at least as far as we are able to judge by events we must submit and not by striving make an innocent passion a sin and show a childish stubbornness I could say a thousand things more to this purpose if I were not in haste to send this away that it may come to you at least as soon as the other Adieu I cannot imagine who this should be that mister doctor meant and am inclined to believe twas a story meant to disturb you though perhaps not by him Letter forty seven SIR Tis never my humour to do injuries nor was this meant as any to you No in earnest if I could have persuaded you to have quitted a passion that injures you I had done an act of real friendship and you might have lived to thank me for it but since it cannot be I will attempt it no more I have laid before you the inconveniences it brings along how certain the trouble is and how uncertain the reward how many accidents may hinder us from ever being happy and how few there are and those so unlikely to make up our desire All this makes no impression on you you are still resolved to follow your blind guide and I to pity where I cannot help It will not be amiss though to let you see that what I did was merely in consideration of your interest and not at all of my own that you may judge of me accordingly and to do that I must tell you that unless it were after the receipt of those letters that made me angry I never had the least hope of wearing out my passion nor to say truth much desire For to what purpose should I have strived against it Twas innocent enough in me that resolved never to marry and would have kept me company in this solitary place as long as I lived without being a trouble to myself or anybody else Nay in earnest if I could have hoped you would be so much your own friend as to seek out a happiness in some other person nothing under heaven could have satisfied me like entertaining myself with the thought of having done you service in diverting you from a troublesome pursuit of what is so uncertain and by that giving you the occasion of a better fortune Otherwise whether you loved me still or whether you did not was equally the same to me your interest set aside I will not reproach you how ill an interpretation you made of this because we will have no more quarrels On the contrary because I see tis in vain to think of curing you I ll study only to give you what ease I can and leave the rest to better physicians to time and fortune Here then I declare that you have still the same power in my heart that I gave you at our last parting that I will never marry any other and that if ever our fortunes will allow us to marry you shall dispose of me as you please but this to deal freely with you I do not hope for No tis too great a happiness and I that know myself best must acknowledge I deserve crosses and afflictions but can never merit such a blessing You know tis not a fear of want that frights me I thank God I never distrusted His providence nor I hope never shall and without attributing anything to myself I may acknowledge He has given me a mind that can be satisfied with as narrow a compass as that of any person living of my rank But I confess that I have an humour will not suffer me to expose myself to people s scorn The name of love is grown so contemptible by the folly of such as have falsely pretended to it and so many giddy people have married upon that score and repented so shamefully afterwards that nobody can do anything that tends towards it without being esteemed a ridiculous person Now as my young Lady Holland says I never pretended to wit in my life but I cannot be satisfied that the world should think me a fool so that all I can do for you will be to preserve a constant kindness for you which nothing shall ever alter or diminish I ll never give you any more alarms by going about to persuade you against that you have for me but from this hour we ll live quietly no more fears no more jealousies the wealth of the whole world by the grace of God shall not tempt me to break my word with you nor the importunity of all my friends I have Keep this as a testimony against me if ever I do and make me a reproach to them by it therefore be secure and rest satisfied with what I can do for you You should come hither but that I expect my brother every day not but that he designed a longer stay when he went but since he keeps his horses with him tis an infallible token that he is coming We cannot miss fitter times than this twenty in a year and I shall be as ready to give you notice of such as you can be to desire it only you would do me a great pleasure if you could forbear writing unless it were sometimes on great occasions This is a strange request for me to make that have been fonder of your letters than my Lady Protector is of her new honour and in earnest would be so still but there are a thousand inconveniences in t that I could tell you Tell me what you can do in the meantime think of some employment for yourself this summer Who knows what a year may produce If nothing we are but where we were and nothing can hinder us from being at least perfect friends Adieu There s nothing so terrible in my other letter but you may venture to read it Have not you forgot my Lady s book CHAPTER V THE LAST OF CHICKSANDS FEBRUARY AND MARCH sixteen fifty four The quarrel is over happily over and Dorothy and Temple are more than reconciled again Temple has been down to Chicksands to see her and some more definite arrangement has been come to between them Dorothy has urged Temple to go to Ireland and join his father who has once again taken possession of his office of Master of the Rolls As soon as an appointment can be found for Temple they are to be married that is as far as one can gather the state of affairs between them but it would seem as if nothing of this was as yet to be known to the outer world not even to Dorothy s brother Letter forty eight SIR Tis but an hour since you went and I am writing to you already is not this kind How do you after your journey are you not weary do you not repent that you took it to so little purpose Well God forgive me and you too you made me tell a great lie I was fain to say you came only to take your leave before you went abroad and all this not only to keep quiet but to keep him from playing the madman for when he has the least suspicion he carries it so strangely that all the world takes notice on t and so often guess at the reason or else he tells it Now do but you judge whether if by mischance he should discover the truth whether he would not rail most sweetly at me and with some reason for abusing him Yet you helped to do it a sadness that he discovered at your going away inclined him to believe you were ill satisfied and made him credit what I said He is kind now in extremity and I would be glad to keep him so till a discovery is absolutely necessary Your going abroad will confirm him much in his belief and I shall have nothing to torment me in this place but my own doubts and fears Here I shall find all the repose I am capable of and nothing will disturb my prayers and wishes for your happiness which only can make mine Your journey cannot be to your disadvantage neither you must needs be pleased to visit a place you are so much concerned in and to be a witness yourself of your hopes though I will believe you need no other inducements to this voyage than my desiring it I know you love me and you have no reason to doubt my kindness Let us both have patience to wait what time and fortune will do for us they cannot hinder our being perfect friends Lord there were a thousand things I remembered after you were gone that I should have said and now I am to write not one of them will come into my head Sure as I live it is not settled yet Good God the fears and surprises the crosses and disorders of that day twas confused enough to be a dream and I am apt to think sometimes it was no more But no I saw you when I shall do it again God only knows Can there be a romancer story than ours would make if the conclusion prove happy Ah I dare not hope it something that I cannot describe draws a cloud over all the light my fancy discovers sometimes and leaves me so in the dark with all my fears about me that I tremble to think on t But no more of this sad talk Who was that mister doctor told you I should marry I cannot imagine for my life tell me or I shall think you made it to excuse yourself Did not you say once you knew where good French tweezers were to be had Pray send me a pair they shall cut no love Before you go I must have a ring from you too a plain gold one if I ever marry it shall be my wedding ring when I die I ll give it you again What a dismal story this is you sent me but who could expect better from a love begun upon such grounds I cannot pity neither of them they were both so guilty Yes they are the more to be pitied for that Here is a note comes to me just now will you do this service for a fine lady that is my friend have not I taught her well she writes better than her mistress How merry and pleased she is with her marrying because there is a plentiful fortune otherwise she would not value the man at all This is the world would you and I were out of it for sure we were not made to live in it Do you remember Arme and the little house there Shall we go thither that s next to being out of the world There we might live like Baucis and Philemon grow old together in our little cottage and for our charity to some shipwrecked strangers obtain the blessing of dying both at the same time How idly I talk tis because the story pleases me none in Ovid so much I remember I cried when I read it Methought they were the perfectest characters of a contented marriage where piety and love were all their wealth and in their poverty feasted the gods when rich men shut them out I am called away farewell Your faithful Letter forty nine The beginning of this letter is lost and with it perhaps the name of Dorothy s lover who had written some verses on her beauty However we have the tag of them with which we must rest content Tis pity I cannot show you what his wit could do upon so ill a subject but my Lady Ruthin keeps them to abuse me withal and has put a tune to them that I may hear them all manner of ways and yet I do protest I remember nothing more of them than this lame piece A stately and majestic brow Of force to make Protectors bow Indeed if I have any stately looks I think he has seen them but yet it seems they could not keep him from playing the fool My Lady Grey told me that one day talking of me to her as he would find ways to bring in that discourse by the head and shoulders whatsoever anybody else could interpose he said he wondered I did not marry She that understood him well enough but would not seem to do so said she knew not unless it were that I liked my present condition so well that I did not care to change it which she was apt to believe because to her knowledge I had refused very good fortunes and named some so far beyond his reach that she thought she had dashed all his hopes But he confident still said twas perhaps that I had no fancy to their persons as if his own were so taking that I was to be looked upon as one that had it in my power to please myself and that perhaps in a person I liked would bate something of fortune To this my Lady answered again for me that twas not impossible but I might do so but in that point she thought me nice and curious enough And still to dishearten him the more she took occasion upon his naming some gentlemen of the county that had been talked of heretofore as of my servants and are since disposed of to say very plainly that twas true they had some of them pretended but there was an end of my Bedfordshire servants she was sure there were no more that could be admitted into the number After all this which would have satisfied an ordinary young man did I this last Thursday receive a letter from him by Collins which he sent first to London that it might come thence to me I threw it into the fire and do you but keep my counsel nobody shall ever know that I had it and my gentleman shall be kept at such a distance as I hope to hear no more of him Yet I ll swear of late I have used him so near to rudely that there is little left for me to do Fye what a deal of paper I have spent upon this idle fellow if I had thought his story would have proved so long you should have missed on t and the loss would not have been great I have not thanked you yet for my tweezers and essences they are both very good I kept one of the little glasses myself remember my ring and in return if I go to London whilst you are in Ireland I ll have my picture taken in little and send it you The sooner you despatch away will be the better I think since I have no hopes of seeing you before you go there lies all your business your father and fortune must do all the rest I cannot be more yours than I am You are mistaken if you think I stand in awe of my brother No I fear nobody s anger I am proof against all violence but when people haunt me with reasoning and entreaties when they look sadly and pretend kindness when they beg upon that score tis a strange pain to me to deny When he rants and renounces me I can despise him but when he asks my pardon with tears pleads to me the long and constant friendship between us and calls heaven to witness that nothing upon earth is dear to him in comparison of me then I confess I feel a stronger unquietness within me and I would do anything to evade his importunity Nothing is so great a violence to me as that which moves my compassion I can resist with ease any sort of people but beggars If this be a fault in me tis at least a well natured one and therefore I hope you will forgive it me you that can forgive me anything you say and be displeased with nothing whilst I love you may I never be pleased with anything when I do not Yet I could beat you for writing this last strange letter was there ever anything said like If I had but a vanity that the world should admire me I would not care what they talked of me In earnest I believe there is nobody displeased that people speak well of them and reputation is esteemed by all of much greater value than life itself Yet let me tell you soberly that with all my vanity I could be very well contented nobody should blame me or any action of mine to quit all my part of the praises and admiration of the world and if I might be allowed to choose my happiest part of it should consist in concealment there should not be above two persons in the world know that there was such a one in it as your faithful Stay I have not done yet Here s another good side I find here then I ll tell you that I am not angry for all this No I allow it to your ill humour and that to the crosses that have been common to us but now that is cleared up I should expect you should say finer things to me Yet take heed of being like my neighbour s servant he is so transported to find no rubs in his way that he knows not whether he stands on his head or his feet Tis the most troublesome busy talking little thing that ever was born his tongue goes like the clack of a mill but to much less purpose though if it were all oracle my head would ache to hear that perpetual noise I admire at her patience and her resolution that can laugh at his fooleries and love his fortune You would wonder to see how tired she is with his impertinences and yet how pleased to think she shall have a great estate with him But this is the world and she makes a part of it betimes Two or three great glistening jewels have bribed her to wink at all his faults and she hears him as unmoved and unconcerned as if another were to marry him What think you have I not done fair for once would you wish a longer letter See how kind I grow at parting who would not go into Ireland to have such another In earnest now go as soon as you can twill be the better I think who am your faithful friend Letter fifty Wrest in Bedfordshire where Dorothy met her importunate lover was the seat of Anthony Grey Earl of Kent There is said to be a picture there of Sir William Temple a copy of Lely s picture Wrest Park is only a few miles from Chicksands SIR Who would be kind to one that reproaches one so cruelly Do you think in earnest I could be satisfied the world should think me a dissembler full of avarice or ambition No you are mistaken but I ll tell you what I could suffer that they should say I married where I had no inclination because my friends thought it fit rather than that I had run wilfully to my own ruin in pursuit of a fond passion of my own To marry for love were no reproachful thing if we did not see that of the thousand couples that do it hardly one can be brought for an example that it may be done and not repented afterwards Is there anything thought so indiscreet or that makes one more contemptible Tis true that I do firmly believe we should be as you say toujours les mesmes but if as you confess tis that which hardly happens once in two ages we are not to expect the world should discern we were not like the rest I ll tell you stories another time you return them so handsomely upon me Well the next servant I tell you of shall not be called a whelp if twere not to give you a stick to beat myself with I would confess that I looked upon the impudence of this fellow as a punishment upon me for my over care in avoiding the talk of the world yet the case is very different and no woman shall ever be blamed that an inconsolable person pretends to her when she gives no allowance to it whereas none shall scape that owns a passion though in return of a person much above her The little tailor that loved Queen Elizabeth was suffered to talk out and none of her Council thought it necessary to stop his mouth but the Queen of Sweden s kind letter to the King of Scots was intercepted by her own ambassador because he thought it was not for his mistress s honour at least that was his pretended reason and thought justifiable enough But to come to my Beagle again I have heard no more of him though I have seen him since we met at Wrest again I do not doubt but I shall be better able to resist his importunity than his tutor was but what do you think it is that gives him his encouragement He was told I had thought of marrying a gentleman that had not above two hundred pound a year only out of my liking to his person And upon that score his vanity allows him to think he may pretend as far as another Thus you see tis not altogether without reason that I apprehend the noise of the world since tis so much to my disadvantage Is it in earnest that you say your being there keeps me from the town If so tis very unkind No if I had gone it had been to have waited on my neighbour who has now altered her resolution and goes not herself I have no business there and am so little taken with the place that I could sit here seven years without so much as thinking once of going to it Tis not likely as you say that you should much persuade your father to what you do not desire he should do but it is hard if all the testimonies of my kindness are not enough to satisfy without my publishing to the world that I can forget my friends and all my interest to follow my passion though perhaps it will admit of a good sense tis that which nobody but you or I will give it and we that are concerned in t can only say twas an act of great kindness and something romance but must confess it had nothing of prudence discretion nor sober counsel in t Tis not that I expect by all your father s offers to bring my friends to approve it I don t deceive myself thus far but I would not give them occasion to say that I hid myself from them in the doing it nor of making my action appear more indiscreet than it is It will concern me that all the world should know what fortune you have and upon what terms I marry you that both may not be made to appear ten times worse than they are Tis the general custom of all people to make those that are rich to have more mines of gold than are in the Indies and such as have small fortunes to be beggars If an action take a little in the world it shall be magnified and brought into comparison with what the heroes or senators of Rome performed but on the contrary if it be once condemned nothing can be found ill enough to compare it with and people are in pain till they find out some extravagant expression to represent the folly on t Only there is this difference that as all are more forcibly inclined to ill than good they are much apter to exceed in detraction than in praises Have I not reason then to desire this from you and may not my friendship have deserved it I know not tis as you think but if I be denied it you will teach me to consider myself Tis well the side ended here If I had not had occasion to stop there I might have gone too far and showed that I had more passions than one Yet tis fit you should know all my faults lest you should repent your bargain when twill not be in your power to release yourself besides I may own my ill humour to you that cause it tis the discontent my crosses in this business have given me makes me thus peevish Though I say it myself before I knew you I was thought as well an humoured young person as most in England nothing displeased nothing troubled me When I came out of France nobody knew me again I was so altered from a cheerful humour that was always alike never over merry but always pleased I was grown heavy and sullen froward and discomposed and that country which usually gives people a jolliness and gaiety that is natural to the climate had wrought in me so contrary effects that I was as new a thing to them as my clothes If you find all this to be sad truth hereafter remember that I gave you fair warning Here is a ring it must not be at all wider than this which is rather too big for me than otherwise but that is a good fault and counted lucky by superstitious people I am not so though tis indifferent whether there be any word in t or not only tis as well without and will make my wearing it the less observed You must give Nan leave to cut a lock of your hair for me too Oh my heart what a sigh was there I will not tell you how many this journey causes nor the fear and apprehensions I have for you No I long to be rid of you am afraid you will not go soon enough do not you believe this No my dearest I know you do not whate er you say you cannot doubt that I am yours Letter fifty one Lady Newport was the wife of the Earl of Newport and mother of Lady Anne Blunt of whom we heard something in former letters She is mentioned as a prominent leader of London society In March sixteen fifty two she is granted a pass to leave the country on condition that she gives security to do nothing prejudicial to the State from which we may draw the inference that she was a political notability My Lady Devonshire was Christian daughter of Lord Bruce of Kinloss She married William Cavendish second Earl of Devonshire Her daughter Anne married Lord Rich and died suddenly in sixteen thirty eight Pomfret Godolphin and Falkland celebrated her virtues in verse and Waller wrote her funeral hymn which is still known to some of us The Lady Rich is dead Heartrending news and dreadful to those few Who her resemble and her steps pursue That Death should license have to range among The fair the wise the virtuous and the young It was the only son of Lady Rich who married Frances Cromwell Lord Warwick was the father of Robert Lord Rich and we may gather from this letter that at Lady Devonshire s instigation he had interfered in a proposed second marriage between his son and some fair unknown Parthenissa is only just out It is the latest thing in literary circles We find it advertised in Mercurius Politicus nineteenth January sixteen fifty four Parthenissa that most famous romance composed by the Lord Broghill and dedicated to the Lady Northumberland It is a romance of the style of Cleopatre and Cyrus to enjoy which in the nineteenth century would require a curious and acquired taste L illustre Bassa was a romance of Scuderi and the passage in the epistle to which Dorothy refers we quote it from a translation by one Henry Cogan sixteen fifty two runs as follows And if you see not my hero persecuted with love by women it is not because he was not amiable and that he could not be loved but because it would clash with civility in the persons of ladies and with true resemblance in that of men who rarely show themselves cruel unto them nor in doing it could have any good grace SIR The lady was in the right You are a very pretty gentleman and a modest were there ever such stories as these you tell The best on t is I believe none of them unless it be that of my Lady Newport which I must confess is so like her that if it be not true twas at least excellently well fancied But my Lord Rich was not caught tho he was near it My Lady Devonshire whose daughter his first wife was has engaged my Lord Warwick to put a stop to the business Otherwise I think his present want of fortune and the little sense of honour he has might have been prevailed on to marry her Tis strange to see the folly that possesses the young people of this age and the liberty they take to themselves I have the charity to believe they appear very much worse than they are and that the want of a Court to govern themselves by is in great part the cause of their ruin though that was no perfect school of virtue yet Vice there wore her mask and appeared so unlike herself that she gave no scandal Such as were really discreet as they seemed to be gave good example and the eminency of their condition made others strive to imitate them or at least they durst not own a contrary course All who had good principles and inclinations were encouraged in them and such as had neither were forced to put on a handsome disguise that they might not be out of countenance at themselves Tis certain what you say that where divine or human laws are not positive we may be our own judges nobody can hinder us nor is it in itself to be blamed But sure it is not safe to take all liberty that is allowed us there are not many that are sober enough to be trusted with the government of themselves and because others judge us with more severity than our indulgence to ourselves will permit it must necessarily follow that tis safer being ruled by their opinions than by our own I am disputing again though you told me my fault so plainly I ll give it over and tell you that Parthenissa is now my company My brother sent it down and I have almost read it Tis handsome language you would know it to be writ by a person of good quality though you were not told it but on the whole I am not very much taken with it All the stories have too near a resemblance with those of other romances there is nothing new or surprenant in them the ladies are all so kind they make no sport and I meet only with one that took me by doing a handsome thing of the kind She was in a besieged town and persuaded all those of her sex to go out with her to the enemy which were a barbarous people and die by their swords that the provisions of the town might last the longer for such as were able to do service in defending it But how angry was I to see him spoil this again by bringing out a letter this woman left behind her for the governor of the town where she discovers a passion for him and makes that the reason why she did it I confess I have no patience for our faiseurs de Romance when they make a woman court It will never enter into my head that tis possible any woman can love where she is not first loved and much less that if they should do that they could have the face to own it Methinks he that writes L illustre Bassa says well in his epistle that we are not to imagine his hero to be less taking than those of other romances because the ladies do not fall in love with him whether he will or not Twould be an injury to the ladies to suppose they could do so and a greater to his hero s civility if he should put him upon being cruel to them since he was to love but one Another fault I find too in the style tis affected Ambitioned is a great word with him and ignore my concern or of great concern is it seems properer than concernment and though he makes his people say fine handsome things to one another yet they are not easy and naive like the French and there is a little harshness in most of the discourse that one would take to be the fault of a translator rather than of an author But perhaps I like it the worse for having a piece of Cyrus by me that I am hugely pleased with and that I would fain have you read I ll send it you At least read one story that I ll mark you down if you have time for no more I am glad you stay to wait on your sister I would have my gallant civil to all much more when it is so due and kindness too I have the cabinet and tis in earnest a pretty one though you will not own it for a present I ll keep it as one and tis like to be yours no more but as tis mine I ll warrant you would ne er have thought of making me a present of charcoal as my servant James would have done to warm my heart I think he meant it But the truth is I had been inquiring for some as tis a commodity scarce enough in this country and he hearing it told the baily bailiff he would give him some if twere for me But this is not all I cannot forbear telling you the other day he made me a visit and I to prevent his making discourse to me made missus Goldsmith and Jane sit by all the while But he came better provided than I could have imagined He brought a letter with him and gave it me as one he had met with directed to me he thought it came out of Northamptonshire I was upon my guard and suspecting all he said examined him so strictly where he had it before I would open it that he was hugely confounded and I confirmed that twas his I laid it by and wished that they would have left us that I might have taken notice on t to him But I had forbid it them so strictly before that they offered not to stir farther than to look out of window as not thinking there was any necessity of giving us their eyes as well as their ears but he that saw himself discovered took that time to confess to me in a whispering voice that I could hardly hear myself that the letter as my Lord Broghill says was of great concern to him and begged I would read it and give him my answer I took it up presently as if I had meant it but threw it sealed as it was into the fire and told him as softly as he had spoke to me I thought that the quickest and best way of answering it He sat awhile in great disorder without speaking a word and so ris and took his leave Now what think you shall I ever hear of him more You do not thank me for using your rival so scurvily nor are not jealous of him though your father thinks my intentions were not handsome towards you which methinks is another argument that one is not to be one s own judge for I am very confident they were and with his favour shall never believe otherwise I am sure I have no ends to serve of my own in what I did it could be no advantage to me that had firmly resolved not to marry but I thought it might be an injury to you to keep you in expectation of what was never likely to be as I apprehended Why do I enter into this wrangling discourse Let your father think me what he pleases if he ever comes to know me the rest of my actions shall justify me in this if he does not I ll begin to practise on him what you so often preached to me to neglect the report of the world and satisfy myself in my own innocency Twill be pleasinger to you I am sure to tell you how fond I am of your lock Well in earnest now and setting aside all compliments I never saw finer hair nor of a better colour but cut no more on t I would not have it spoiled for the world If you love me be careful on t I am combing and curling and kissing this lock all day and dreaming on t all night The ring too is very well only a little of the biggest Send me a tortoise one that is a little less than that I sent for a pattern I would not have the rule so absolutely true without exception that hard hairs be ill natured for then I should be so But I can allow that all soft hairs are good and so are you or I am deceived as much as you are if you think I do not love you enough Tell me my dearest am I You will not be if you think I am Yours Letter fifty two It is interesting to find Dorothy reading the good Jeremy Taylor s Holy Living a book too little known in this day For amidst its old fashioned piety there are many sentiments of practical goodness expressed with clear insistence combined with a quaint grace of literary style which we have long ago cast aside in the pursuit of other things Dorothy loved this book and knew it well Compare the following extract from the chapter on Christian Justice with what Dorothy has written in this letter Has she been recently reading this passage Perhaps she has but more probably it is the recollection of what is well known that she is reproducing from a memory not unstored with such learning Thus writes doctor Taylor There is very great peace and immunity from sin in resigning our wills up to the command of others for provided our duty to God be secured their commands are warrants to us in all things else and the case of conscience is determined if the command be evident and pressing and it is certain the action that is but indifferent and without reward if done only upon our own choice is an action of duty and of religion and rewardable by the grace and favour of God if done in obedience to the command of our superiors Little and Great Brickhill where Temple is to receive a letter from Dorothy kindly favoured by mister Gibson stand due west of Chicksands some seventeen miles and about forty six miles along the high road from London to Chester Temple would probably arrange to stay there receive Dorothy s letter and send one in return Dorothy has apparently tired of Calprenede and Scuderi of Cleopatre and Cyrus and has turned to travels to amuse her Fernando Mendez Pinto did I believe actually visit China and is said to have landed in the Gulf of Pekin What he writes of China seems to bear some resemblance to what later writers have said It is hard to say how and where his conversations with the Chinese were carried on as he himself admits that he did not understand one word of the language Lady Grey s sister missus Pooley is unknown to history Of mister Fish we know as has already been said nothing more than that he was Dorothy s lover and a native of Bedfordshire probably her near neighbour James B must be another lover and he is altogether untraceable missus Goldsmith is as you will remember wife of the Vicar of Campton The Valentine stories will date this letter for us as written in the latter half of February SIR They say you gave order for this waste paper how do you think I could ever fill it or with what I am not always in the humour to wrangle and dispute For example now I had rather agree to what you say than tell you that doctor Taylor whose devote you must know I am says there is a great advantage to be gained in resigning up one s will to the command of another because the same action which in itself is wholly indifferent if done upon our own choice becomes an act of duty and religion if done in obedience to the command of any person whom nature the laws or ourselves have given a power over us so that though in an action already done we can only be our own judges because we only know with what intentions it was done yet in any we intend tis safest sure to take the advice of another Let me practise this towards you as well as preach it to you and I ll lay a wager you will approve on t But I am chiefly of your opinion that contentment which the Spanish proverb says is the best paint gives the lustre to all one s enjoyment puts a beauty upon things which without it would have none increases it extremely where tis already in some degree and without it all that we call happiness besides loses its property What is contentment must be left to every particular person to judge for themselves since they only know what is so to them which differs in all according to their several humours Only you and I agree tis to be found by us in a true friend a moderate fortune and a retired life the last I thank God I have in perfection My cell is almost finished and when you come back you ll find me in it and bring me both the rest I hope I find it much easier to talk of your coming back than your going You shall never persuade me I send you this journey No pray let it be your father s commands or a necessity your fortune puts upon you Twas unkindly said to tell me I banish you your heart never told it you I dare swear nor mine ne er thought it No my dear this is our last misfortune let s bear it nobly Nothing shows we deserve a punishment so much as our murmuring at it and the way to lessen those we feel and to scape those we fear is to suffer patiently what is imposed making a virtue of necessity Tis not that I have less kindness or more courage than you but that mistrusting myself more as I have more reason I have armed myself all that is possible against this occasion I have thought that there is not much difference between your being at Dublin or at London as our affairs stand You can write and hear from the first and I should not see you sooner if you continued still at the last Besides I hope this journey will be of advantage to us when your father pressed your coming over he told you you needed not doubt either his power or his will Have I done anything since that deserves he should alter his intentions towards us Or has any accident lessened his power If neither we may hope to be happy and the sooner for this journey I dare not send my boy to meet you at Brickhill nor any other of the servants they are all too talkative But I can get mister Gibson if you will to bring you a letter Tis a civil well natured man as can be of excellent principles and exact honesty I durst make him my confessor though he is not obliged by his orders to conceal anything that is told him But you must tell me then which Brickhill it is you stop at Little or Great they are neither of them far from us If you stay there you will write back by him will you not a long letter I shall need it besides that you owe it me for the last being so short Would you saw what letters my brother writes me you are not half so kind Well he is always in the extremes since our last quarrel he has courted me more than ever he did in his life and made me more presents which considering his humour is as great a testimony of his kindness as twas of mister Smith s to my Lady Sunderland when he presented missus Camilla He sent me one this week which in earnest is as pretty a thing as I have seen a China trunk and the finest of the kind that e er I saw By the way this puts me in mind on t have you read the story of China written by a Portuguese Fernando Mendez Pinto I think his name is If you have not take it with you tis as diverting a book of the kind as ever I read and is as handsomely written You must allow him the privilege of a traveller and he does not abuse it His lies are as pleasant harmless ones as lies can be and in no great number considering the scope he has for them There is one in Dublin now that ne er saw much farther has told me twice as many I dare swear of Ireland If I should ever live to see that country and be in t I should make excellent sport with them Tis a sister of my Lady Grey s her name is Pooley her husband lives there too but I am afraid in no very good condition They were but poor and she lived here with her sisters when I knew her tis not half a year since she went I think If you hear of her send me word how she makes a shift there And hark you can you tell me whether the gentleman that lost a crystal box the first of February in saint James Park or Old Spring Gardens has found it again or not I have strong curiosity to know Tell me and I ll tell you something that you don t know which is that I am your Valentine and you are mine I did not think of drawing any but missus Goldsmith and Jane would need make me some for them and myself so I writ down our three names and for men mister Fish James B and you I cut them all equal and made them up myself before them and because I would owe it wholly to my good fortune if I were pleased I made both them choose first that had never seen what was in them and they left me you Then I made them choose again for theirs and my name was left You cannot imagine how I was delighted with this little accident but by taking notice that I cannot forbear telling you it I was not half so pleased with my encounter next morning I was up early but with no design of getting another Valentine and going out to walk in my night cloak and night gown I met mister Fish going a hunting I think he was but he stayed to tell me I was his Valentine and I should not have been rid on him quickly if he had not thought himself a little too negligee his hair was not powdered and his clothes were but ordinary to say truth he looked then methought like other mortal people Yet he was as handsome as your Valentine I ll swear you wanted one when you took her and had very ill fortune that nobody met you before her Oh if I had not terrified my little gentleman when he brought me his own letter now sure I had had him for my Valentine On my conscience I shall follow your counsel if e er he comes again but I am persuaded he will not I writ my brother that story for want of something else and he says I did very well there was no other way to be rid on him and he makes a remark upon t that I can be severe enough when I please and wishes I would practise it somewhere else as well as there Can you tell where that is I never understand anybody that does not speak plain English and he never uses that to me of late but tells me the finest stories I may apply them how I please of people that have married when they thought there was great kindness and how miserably they have found themselves deceived how despicable they have made themselves by it and how sadly they have repented on t He reckons more inconveniency than you do that follows good nature says it makes one credulous apt to be abused betrays one to the cunning of people that make advantage on t and a thousand such things which I hear half asleep and half awake and take little notice of unless it be sometimes to say that with all these faults I would not be without it No in earnest nor I could not love any person that I thought had it not to a good degree Twas the first thing I liked in you and without it I should never have liked anything I know tis counted simple but I cannot imagine why Tis true some people have it that have not wit but there are at least as many foolish people I have ever observed to be fullest of tricks little ugly plots and designs unnecessary disguises and mean cunnings which are the basest qualities in the world and makes one the most contemptible I think when I once discover them they lose their credit with me for ever Some will say they are cunning only in their own defence and that there is no living in this world without it but I cannot understand how anything more is necessary to one s own safety besides a prudent caution that I now think is though I can remember when nobody could have persuaded me that anybody meant ill when it did not appear by their words and actions I remember my mother who if it may be allowed me to say it was counted as wise a woman as most in England when she seemed to distrust anybody and saw I took notice on t would ask if I did not think her too jealous and a little ill natured Come I know you do says she if you would confess it and I cannot blame you When I was young as you are I thought my father in law who was a wise man the most unreasonably suspicious man that ever was and disliked him for it hugely but I have lived to see it is almost impossible to think people worse than they are and so will you I did not believe her and less that I should have more to say to you than this paper would hold It shall never be said I began another at this time of night though I have spent this idly that should have told you with a little more circumstance how perfectly I am yours Letter fifty three Dorothy s brother seems to have got hold of a new weapon of attack in Temple s religious opinions which might have led to a strategic success in more skilful hands He only manages to exasperate Dorothy with himself not with Temple As for Temple he has not altogether escaped the censure of the orthodox Gossiping Bishop Burnet in one of his more ill natured passages tells us that Temple was an Epicurean thinking religion to be fit only for the mob and a corrupter of all that came near him Unkind words these with just perhaps those dregs of truth in them which make gossip so hard to bear patiently Was it true as Courtenay thinks that jealousy of King William s attachment to Temple disturbed the episcopal equipoise of soul rendering his Lordship slanderous even a backbiter Robin C is probably one of the Cheeke family Bagshawe is Edward Bagshawe the Elder B A of Brasenose Oxford and of the Middle Temple barrister at law In the early part of the century he had been a Puritan among Puritans and in the old hall of the Middle Temple had delivered two lectures to show that bishops may not meddle in civil affairs and that a Parliament may be held without bishops questions still unsettled Laud appears to have prohibited these lectures Bagshawe in after life joined the King at Oxford and suffered imprisonment at the hands of his former friends in the King s Bench Prison from sixteen forty four to sixteen forty six Young Sir Harry Yelverton Lady Ruthin s husband broke a theological lance with his son the younger Edward Bagshawe to vindicate the cause of the Church of England The elder Bagshawe died in sixteen sixty two and was buried at Morton Pinckney in Northamptonshire How and why he railed at love and marriage it is impossible now to know Edward Bagshawe the younger published in sixteen seventy one an Antidote against mister Baxter s Treatise of Love and Marriage The preaching woman at Somerset House was in all probability missus Hannah Trupnel She that in April of this year is spoken of in an old news book as having lately acted her part in a trance so many days at Whitehall She appears to have been full of mystical anti Puritan prophecies and was indicted in Cornwall as a rogue and vagabond convicted and bound over in recognizances to behave herself in future After this she abandoned her design of passing from county to county disaffecting the people with her prophecies and we hear no more of her SIR Tis well you have given over your reproaches I can allow you to tell me of my faults kindly and like a friend Possibly it is a weakness in me to aim at the world s esteem as if I could not be happy without it but there are certain things that custom has made almost of absolute necessity and reputation I take to be one of these If one could be invisible I should choose that but since all people are seen or known and shall be talked of in spite of their teeth who is it that does not desire at least that nothing of ill may be said of them whether justly or otherwise I never knew any so satisfied with their own innocence as to be content that the world should think them guilty Some out of pride have seemed to contemn ill reports when they have found they could not avoid them but none out of strength of reason though many have pretended to it No not my Lady Newcastle with all her philosophy therefore you must not expect it from me I shall never be ashamed to own that I have a particular value for you above any other but tis not the greatest merit of person will excuse a want of fortune in some degree I think it will at least with the most rational part of the world and as far as that will read I desire it should I would not have the world believe I married out of interest and to please my friends I had much rather they should know I chose the person and took his fortune because twas necessary and that I prefer a competency with one I esteem infinitely before a vast estate in other hands Tis much easier sure to get a good fortune than a good husband but whosoever marries without any consideration of fortune shall never be allowed to do it but of so reasonable an apprehension the whole world without any reserve shall pronounce they did it merely to satisfy their giddy humour Besides though you imagine twere a great argument of my kindness to consider nothing but you in earnest I believe twould be an injury to you I do not see that it puts any value upon men when women marry them for love as they term it tis not their merit but our folly that is always presumed to cause it and would it be any advantage to you to have your wife thought an indiscreet person All this I can say to you but when my brother disputes it with me I have other arguments for him and I drove him up so close t other night that for want of a better gap to get out at he was fain to say that he feared as much your having a fortune as your having none for he saw you held my Lord L t s Lieutenant s principles That religion and honour were things you did not consider at all and that he was confident you would take any engagement serve in employment or do anything to advance yourself I had no patience for this To say you were a beggar your father not worth Lfour thousand in the whole world was nothing in comparison of having no religion nor no honour I forgot all my disguise and we talked ourselves weary he renounced me and I defied him but both in as civil language as it would permit and parted in great anger with the usual ceremony of a leg and a courtesy that you would have died with laughing to have seen us The next day I not being at dinner saw him not till night then he came into my chamber where I supped but he did not Afterwards mister Gibson and he and I talked of indifferent things till all but we two went to bed Then he sat half an hour and said not one word nor I to him At last in a pitiful tone Sister says he I have heard you say that when anything troubles you of all things you apprehend going to bed because there it increases upon you and you lie at the mercy of all your sad thought which the silence and darkness of the night adds a horror to I am at that pass now I vow to God I would not endure another night like the last to gain a crown I who resolved to take no notice what ailed him said twas a knowledge I had raised from my spleen only and so fell into a discourse of melancholy and the causes and from that I know not how into religion and we talked so long of it and so devoutly that it laid all our anger We grew to a calm and peace with all the world Two hermits conversing in a cell they equally inhabit ne er expressed more humble charitable kindness one towards another than we He asked my pardon and I his and he has promised me never to speak of it to me whilst he lives but leave the event to God Almighty until he sees it done he will always be the same to me that he is then he shall leave me he says not out of want of kindness to me but because he cannot see the ruin of a person that he loves so passionately and in whose happiness he has laid up all his These are the terms we are at and I am confident he will keep his word with me so that you have no reason to fear him in any respect for though he should break his promise he should never make me break mine No let me assure you this rival nor any other shall ever alter me therefore spare your jealousy or turn it all into kindness I will write every week and no miss of letters shall give us any doubts of one another Time nor accidents shall not prevail upon our hearts and if God Almighty please to bless us we will meet the same we are or happier I will do all you bid me I will pray and wish and hope but you must do so too then and be so careful of yourself that I may have nothing to reproach you with when you come back That vile wench lets you see all my scribbles I believe how do you know I took care your hair should not be spoiled Tis more than e er you did I think you are so negligent on t and keep it so ill tis pity you should have it May you have better luck in the cutting it than I had with mine I cut it two or three years agone and it never grew since Look to it if I keep the lock you give me better than you do all the rest I shall not spare you expect to be soundly chidden What do you mean to do with all my letters Leave them behind you If you do it must be in safe hands some of them concern you and me and other people besides us very much and they will almost load a horse to carry Does not my cousin at Moor Park mistrust us a little I have a great belief they do I am sure Robin C told my brother of it since I was last in town Of all things I admire my cousin Molle has not got it by the end he that frequents that family so much and is at this instant at Kimbolton If he has and conceals it he is very discreet I could never discern by anything that he knew it I shall endeavour to accustom myself to the noise on t and make it as easy to me as I can though I had much rather it were not talked of till there were an absolute necessity of discovering it and you can oblige me in nothing more than in concealing it I take it very kindly that you promise to use all your interest in your father to persuade him to endeavour our happiness and he appears so confident of his power that it gives me great hopes Dear shall we ever be so happy think you Ah I dare not hope it Yet tis not want of love gives me these fears No in earnest I think nay I m sure I love you more than ever and tis that only gives me these despairing thoughts when I consider how small a proportion of happiness is allowed in this world and how great mine would be in a person for whom I have a passionate kindness and who has the same for me As it is infinitely above what I can deserve and more than God Almighty usually allots to the best people I can find nothing in reason but seems to be against me and methinks tis as vain in me to expect it as twould be to hope I might be a queen if that were really as desirable a thing as tis thought to be and it is just it should be so We complain of this world and the variety of crosses and afflictions it abounds in and yet for all this who is weary on t more than in discourse who thinks with pleasure of leaving it or preparing for the next We see old folks who have outlived all the comforts of life desire to continue in it and nothing can wean us from the folly of preferring a mortal being subject to great infirmity and unavoidable decays before an immortal one and all the glories that are promised with it Is this not very like preaching Well tis too good for you you shall have no more on t I am afraid you are not mortified enough for such discourse to work upon though I am not of my brother s opinion neither that you have no religion in you In earnest I never took anything he ever said half so ill as nothing sure is so great an injury It must suppose one to be a devil in human shape Oh me now I am speaking of religion let me ask you is not his name Bagshawe that you say rails on love and women Because I heard one t other day speaking of him and commending his wit but withal said he was a perfect atheist If so I can allow him to hate us and love which sure has something of divine in it since God requires it of us I am coming into my preaching vein again What think you were it not a good way of preferment as the times are If you ll advise me to it I ll venture The woman at Somerset House was cried up mightily Think on t Dear I am yours Letter fifty four Temple has really started on his journey and is now past Brickhill far away in the north of England The journey to Ireland was made via Holyhead in those days as it is now It was a four days journey to Chester and no good road after The great route through Wales to Holyhead was in such a state that in sixteen eighty five the Viceroy going to Ireland was five hours in travelling the fourteen miles from saint Asaph to Conway between Conway and Beaumaris he walked and his lady was carried in a litter A carriage was often taken to pieces at Conway and carried to the Menai Straits on the peasants shoulders round the dangerous cliff of Penmaenmawr mister B and mister D remain mysterious symbolic initials of gossip and scandalmongering saint Gregory s near saint Paul s was a church entirely destroyed by the great fire Sir John Tufton of The Mote near Maidstone married Mary the third daughter and company heiress of Thomas Lord Wotton For your Master seal with coat of arms when your Mistress pleases SIR You bid me write every week and I am doing it without considering how it will come to you Let Nan look to that with whom I suppose you have left the orders of conveyance I have your last letter but Jane to whom you refer me is not yet come down On Tuesday I expect her and if she be not engaged I shall give her no cause hereafter to believe that she is a burden to me though I have no employment for her but that of talking to me when I am in the humour of saying nothing Your dog is come too and I have received him with all the kindness that is due to anything you send I have defended him from the envy and malice of a troop of greyhounds that used to be in favour with me and he is so sensible of my care over him that he is pleased with nobody else and follows me as if we had been of long acquaintance Tis well you are gone past my recovery My heart has failed me twenty times since you went and had you been within my call I had brought you back as often though I know thirty miles distance and three hundred are the same thing You will be so kind I am sure as to write back by the coach and tell me what the success of your journey so far has been After that I expect no more unless you stay for a wind till you arrive at Dublin I pity your sister in earnest a sea voyage is welcome to no lady but you are beaten to it and twill become you now you are a conductor to show your valour and keep your company in heart When do you think of coming back again I am asking that before you are at your journey s end You will not take it ill that I desire it should be soon In the meantime I ll practise all the rules you give me Who told you I go to bed late In earnest they do me wrong I have been faulty in that point heretofore I confess but tis a good while since I gave it over with my reading o nights but in the daytime I cannot live without it and tis all my diversion and infinitely more pleasing to me than any company but yours And yet I am not given to it in any excess now I have been very much more Tis Jane I know tells all these tales of me I shall be even with her some time or other but for the present I long for her with some impatience that she may tell me all you have told her Never trust me if I had not a suspicion from the first that twas that ill looked fellow B who made that story mister D told you That which gave me the first inclination to that belief was the circumstance you told me of their seeing me at saint Gregory s For I remembered to have seen B there and had occasion to look up into the gallery where he sat to answer a very civil salute given me from thence by mister Freeman and saw B in a great whisper with another that sat next him and pointing to me If mister D had not been so nice in discovering his name you would quickly have been cured of your jealousy Never believe I have a servant that I do not tell you of as soon as I know it myself As for example my brother Peyton has sent to me for a countryman of his Sir John Tufton he married one of my Lady Wotton s heirs who is lately dead and to invite me to think of it Besides his person and his fortune without exception he tells me what an excellent husband he was to this lady that s dead who was but a crooked ill favoured woman only she brought him Lfifteen hundred a year I tell him I believe Sir John Tufton could be content I were so too upon the same terms But his loving his first wife can be no argument to persuade me for if he had loved her as he ought to do I cannot hope he should love another so well as I expect anybody should that has me and if he did not love her I have less to expect he should me I do not care for a divided heart I must have all or none at least the first place in it Poor James I have broke his He says twould pity you to hear what sad complaints he makes and but that he has not the heart to hang himself he would be very well contented to be out of the world That house of your cousin R is fatal to physicians doctor Smith that took it is dead already but maybe this was before you went and so is no news to you I shall be sending you all I hear which though it cannot be much living as I do yet it may be more than ventures into Ireland I would have you diverted whilst you are there as much as possible but not enough to tempt you to stay one minute longer than your father and your business obliges you Alas I have already repented all my share in your journey and begin to find I am not half so valiant as I sometimes take myself to be The knowledge that our interests are the same and that I shall be happy or unfortunate in your person as much or more than in my own does not give me that confidence you speak of It rather increases my doubts and I durst trust your fortune alone rather than now that mine is joined with it Yet I will hope yours may be so good as to overcome the ill of mine and shall endeavour to mend my own all I can by striving to deserve it maybe better My dearest will you pardon me that I am forced to leave you so soon The next shall be longer though I can never be more than I am Yours Letter fifty five This sad letter fully dated eighteenth March sixteen fifty four was written after Sir Peter Osborne was buried in Campton Church Even as Dorothy wrote this the stone mason might be slowly carving words that may be read to this day The maintainer of divine exercises the friend to the poor Her father is no longer living and she is now even more lonely than before To depend upon kindred that are not friends to be under the protection of a brother who is her lover s avowed enemy this is her lot in life unless Temple can release her from it Alas poor Dorothy who will now forbear to pity you March the eighteenth sixteen fifty four How true it is that a misfortune never comes single we live in expectation of some one happiness that we propose to ourselves an age almost and perhaps miss it at the last but sad accidents have wings to overtake us and come in flocks like ill boding ravens You were no sooner gone but as if that had not been enough I lost the best father in the world and though as to himself it was an infinite mercy in God Almighty to take him out of a world that can be pleasing to none and was made more uneasy to him by many infirmities that were upon him yet to me it is an affliction much greater than people judge it Besides all that is due to nature and the memory of many more than ordinary kindnesses received from him besides what he was to all that knew him and what he was to me in particular I am left by his death in the condition which of all others is the most unsupportable to my nature to depend upon kindred that are not friends and that though I pay as much as I should do to a stranger yet think they do me a courtesy I expect my eldest brother to day if he comes I shall be able to tell you before I seal this up where you are likely to find me If he offers me to stay here this hole will be more agreeable to my humour than any place that is more in the world I take it kindly that you used art to conceal our story and satisfy my nice apprehensions but I ll not impose that constraint upon you any longer for I find my kind brother publishes it with more earnestness than ever I strove to conceal it and with more disadvantage than anybody else would Now he has tried all ways to do what he desires and finds it is in vain he resolves to revenge himself upon me by representing this action in such colours as will amaze all people that know me and do not know him enough to discern his malice to me he is not able to forbear showing it now when my condition deserves pity from all the world I think and that he himself has newly lost a father as well as I but takes this time to torment me which appears at least to me so barbarous a cruelty that though I thank God I have charity enough perfectly to forgive all the injury he can do me yet I am afraid I shall never look upon him as a brother more And now do you judge whether I am not very unhappy and whether that sadness in my face you used to complain of was not suited to my fortune You must confess it and that my kindness for you is beyond example all these troubles are persecutions that make me weary of the world before my time and lessen the concernment I have for you and instead of being persuaded as they would have me by their malicious stories methinks I am obliged to love you more in recompense of all the injuries they have done you upon my score I shall need nothing but my own heart to fortify me in this resolution and desire nothing in return of it but that your care of yourself may answer to that which I shall always have for your interests I received your letter of the tenth of this month and I hope this will find you at your journey s end In earnest I have pitied your sister extremely and can easily apprehend how troublesome this voyage must needs be to her by knowing what others have been to me yet pray assure her I would not scruple at undertaking it myself to gain such an acquaintance and would go much farther than where I hope she now is to serve her I am afraid she will not think me a fit person to choose for a friend that cannot agree with my own brother but I must trust you to tell my story for me and will hope for a better character from you than he gives me who lest I should complain resolves to prevent me and possess my friends first that he is the injured party I never magnified my patience to you but I begin to have a good opinion on t since this trial yet perhaps I have no reason and it may be as well a want of sense in me as of passion however you will not be displeased to know that I can endure all that he or anybody else can say and that setting aside my father s death and your absence I make nothing an affliction to me though I am sorry I confess to see myself forc d to keep such distances with one of his relations because religion and nature and the custom of world teaches otherwise I see I shall not be able to satisfy you in this how I shall dispose of myself for my brother is not come the next will certainly tell you In the meantime I expect with great impatience to hear of your safe arrival Twas a disappointment that you missed those fair winds I pleased myself extremely with a belief that they had made your voyage rather a diversion than a trouble either to you or your company but I hope your passage was as happy if not as sudden as you expected it let me hear often from you and long letters I do not count this so Have no apprehensions from me but all the care of yourself that you please My melancholy has no anger in it and I believe the accidents of my life would work more upon any other than they do upon me whose humour is always more prepared for them than that of gayer persons I hear nothing that is worth your knowing when I do you shall know it Tell me if there s anything I can do for you and assure yourself I am perfectly Yours Letter fifty six Temple has reached Dublin at last and begins to write from there This letter also is dated and from this time forth there is less trouble in arranging the letters in order of date as many of them have at least the day of the month if nothing more The Marquis of Hertford was the Duke of Somerset s great grandson He married Lady Arabella Stuart daughter of Charles Stuart Earl of Lennox uncle of King James I for which matrimonial adventure he was imprisoned in the Tower His second wife was Frances daughter of Robert Earl of Essex and sister to the great general of the Parliamentary Army She was the mother of young Lord Beauchamp whose death Dorothy deplores He was twenty eight years of age when he died He married Mary daughter of Lord Capel of Hadham who afterwards married the Duke of Beaufort Baptist Noel Viscount Camden was a noted loyalist After the Restoration we find him appointed Lord Lieutenant of Rutland Of his duel with mister Stafford there seems to be no account It did not carry him into the King s Bench Court like Lord Chandos duel so history is silent about it April the second sixteen fifty four SIR There was never any lady more surprised than I was with your last I read it so coldly and was so troubled to find that you were so forward on your journey but when I came to the last and saw Dublin at the date I could scarce believe my eyes In earnest it transported me so that I could not forbear expressing my joy in such a manner as had anybody been by to have observed me they would have suspected me no very sober person You are safe arrived you say and pleased with the place already only because you meet with a letter of mine there In your next I expect some other commendation on t or else I shall hardly make such haste to it as people here believe I will All the servants have been to take their leaves on me and say how sorry they are to hear I am going out of the land some beggar at the door has made so ill a report of Ireland to them that they pity me extremely but you are pleased I hope to hear I am coming to you the next fair wind expect me Tis not to be imagined the ridiculous stories they have made nor how J B cries out on me for refusing him and choosing his chamber fellow yet he pities me too and swears I am condemned to be the miserablest person upon earth With all his quarrel to me he does not wish me so ill as to be married to the proudest imperious insulting ill natured man that ever was one that before he has had me a week shall use me with contempt and believe that the favour was of his side Is not this very comfortable But pray make it no quarrel I make it none I assure you And though he knew you before I did I do not think he knows you so well besides that his testimony is not of much value I am to spend this next week in taking leave of this country and all the company in t perhaps never to see it more From hence I must go into Northamptonshire to my Lady Ruthin and so to London where I shall find my aunt and my brother Peyton betwixt whom I think to divide this summer Nothing has happened since you went worth your knowledge My Lord Marquis Hertford has lost his son my Lord Beauchamp who has left a fine young widow In earnest tis great pity at the rate of our young nobility he was an extraordinary person and remarkable for an excellent husband My Lord Cambden too has fought with mister Stafford but there s no harm done You may discern the haste I m in by my writing There will come a time for a long letter again but there will never come any wherein I shall not be Yours Sealed with black wax and directed For mister William Temple at Sir John Temple s home in Damask Street Dublin Thus Dorothy leaves Chicksands her last words from her old home to Temple breathing her love and affection for him It is no great sorrow at the moment to leave Chicksands for its latest memories are scenes of sickness grief and death And now the only home on earth for Dorothy lies in the future it is not a particular spot on earth but to be by his side wherever that may be CHAPTER VI VISITING SUMMER sixteen fifty four This chapter opens with a portion of a letter written by Sir William Temple to his mistress dated Ireland May eighteen sixteen fifty four It is the only letter or rather scrap of letter which we have of his and by some good chance it has survived with the rest of Dorothy s letters It will I think throw great light on his character as a lover showing him to have been ardent and ecstatic in his suit making quite clear Dorothy s wisdom in insisting as she often does on the necessity of some more material marriage portion than mere love and hope His reference to the unhappy differences strengthens my view that the letters of the former chapter belong all to one date Letter fifty seven Letter of Sir William Temple May eighteenth sixteen fifty four I am called upon for my letter but must have leave first to remember you of yours For God s sake write constantly while I am here or I am undone past all recovery I have lived upon them ever since I came but had thrived much better had they been longer Unless you use to give me better measure I shall not be in case to undertake a journey to England The despair I was in at not hearing from you last week and the belief that all my letters had miscarried by some treachery among my good friends who I am sorry have the name of yours made me press my father by all means imaginable to give me leave to go presently if I heard not from you this post But he would never yield to that because he said upon your silence he should suspect all was not likely to be well between us and then he was sure I should not be in condition to be alone He remembered too well the letters I writ upon our last unhappy differences and would not trust me from him in such another occasion But withal he told me he would never give me occasion of any discontent which he could remedy that if you desired my coming over and I could not be content without he would not hinder me though he very much desired my company a month or two longer and that in that time twas very likely I might have his as well Now in very good earnest do you think tis time for me to come or no Would you be very glad to see me there and could you do it in less disorder and with less surprise than you did at Chicksands I ask you these questions very seriously but yet how willingly would I venture all to be with you I know you love me still you promised me and that s all the security I can have in this world Tis that which makes all things else seem nothing to it so high it sets me and so high indeed that should I ever fall twould dash me all to pieces Methinks your very charity should make you love me more now than ever by seeing me so much more unhappy than I used by being so much farther from you for that is all the measure can be taken of my good or ill condition Justice I am sure will oblige you to it since you have no other means left in the world of rewarding such a passion as mine which sure is of a much richer value than anything in the world besides Should you save my life again should you make me absolute master of your fortune and your person too I should accept none of all this in any part of payment but look upon you as one behindhand with me still Tis no vanity this but a true sense of how pure and how refined a nature my passion is which none can ever know except my own heart unless you find it out by being there How hard it is to think of ending when I am writing to you but it must be so and I must ever be subject to other people s occasions and so never I think master of my own This is too true both in respect of this fellow s post that is bawling at me for my letter and of my father s delays They kill me but patience would anybody but I were here Yet you may command me ever at one minute s warning Had I not heard from you by this last in earnest I had resolved to have gone with this and given my father the slip for all his caution He tells me still of a little time but alas who knows not what mischances and how great changes have often happened in a little time For God s sake let me hear of all your motions when and where I may hope to see you Let us but hope this cloud this absence that has overcast all my contentment may pass away and I am confident there s a clear sky attends us My dearest dear adieu Yours Pray where is your lodging Have a care of all the despatch and security that can be in our intelligence Remember my fellow servant sure by the next I shall write some learned epistle to her I have been so long about it Letter fifty eight Dorothy is now in London staying probably with that aunt whom she mentioned before as one who was always ready to find her a husband other than Temple Of the plot against the Protector in which my Lord of Dorchester is said to be engaged an account is given in connection with Letter fifty nine that is presuming it to be the same plot and that Lord Dorchester is one of the many persons arrested under suspicion of being concerned in it I cannot find anything which identifies him with a special plot Lady Sandis Sandys who seems so fond of race meetings and other less harmless amusements was the wife of William Lord Sandys and daughter of the Earl of Salisbury Lord Sandys country house was Motesfont or Mottisfont Priory in Hampshire which the King had given him in exchange for Chelsea in Westminster So says Leland the antiquary and scholar in his Itinerary but it is a little puzzling to the modern mind with preconceived notions of Chelsea to hear it spoken of as a seat or estate in Westminster Colonel Tom Paunton is to me merely a name and J Morton is nothing more unless we may believe him to be Sir John Morton Bart of Milbourne saint Andrew in Nottinghamshire This addition of a local habitation and a name gives us no further knowledge however of the scandal to which Dorothy alludes Mistress Stanley and Mistress Witherington have left no trace of their identity that I can find but Mistress Philadelphia Carey is not wholly unknown She was the second daughter of Thomas Carey one of the Earl of Monmouth s sons and readers may be pleased to know that she did marry Sir Henry Littleton Of the scandal concerning Lord Rich I am not sorry to know nothing May twenty fifth sixteen fifty four This world is composed of nothing but contrarieties and sudden accidents only the proportions are not at all equal for to a great measure of trouble it allows so small a quantity of joy that one may see tis merely intended to keep us alive withal This is a formal preface and looks as if there were something of very useful to follow but I would not wish you to expect it I was only considering my own ill humour last night I had not heard from you in a week or more my brother had been with me and we had talked ourselves both out of breath and patience too I was not very well and rose this morning only because I was weary of lying in bed When I had dined I took a coach and went to see whether there was ever a letter for me and was this once so lucky as to find one I am not partial to myself I know and am contented that the pleasure I have received with this shall serve to sweeten many sad thoughts that have interposed since your last and more that I may reasonably expect before I have another and I think I may without vanity say that nobody is more sensible of the least good fortune nor murmurs less at an ill than I do since I owe it merely to custom and not to any constancy in my humour or something that is better No in earnest anything of good comes to me like the sun to the inhabitants of Greenland it raises them to life when they see it and when they miss it it is not strange they expect a night of half a year long You cannot imagine how kindly I take it that you forgive my brother and let me assure you I shall never press you to anything unreasonable I will not oblige you to court a person that has injured you I only beg that whatsoever he does in that kind may be excused by his relation to me and that whenever you are moved to think he does you wrong you will at the same time remember that his sister loves you passionately and nobly that if he values nothing but fortune she despises it and could love you as much a beggar as she could do a prince and shall without question love you eternally but whether with any satisfaction to herself or you is a sad doubt I am not apt to hope and whether it be the better or the worse I know not All sorts of differences are natural to me and that which if your kindness would give you leave you would term a weakness in me is nothing but a reasonable distrust of my own judgment which makes me desire the approbation of my friends I never had the confidence in my life to presume anything well done that I had nobody s opinion in but my own and as you very well observe there are so many that think themselves wise when nothing equals their folly but their pride that I dread nothing so much as discovering such a thought in myself because of the consequences of it Whenever you come you must not doubt your welcome but I can promise you nothing for the manner on t I am afraid my surprise and disorder will be more than ever I have good reason to think so and none that you can take ill But I would not have you attempt it till your father is ready for the journey too No really he deserves that all your occasions should wait for his and if you have not much more than an ordinary obedience for him I shall never believe you have more than an ordinary kindness for me since if you will pardon me the comparison I believe we both merit it from you upon the same score he as a very indulgent father and I as a very kind mistress Don t laugh at me for commending myself you will never do it for me and so I am forced to it I am still here in town but had no hand I can assure you in the new discovered plot against the Protector But my Lord of Dorchester they say has and so might I have had if I were as rich as he and then you might have been sure of me at the Tower now a worse lodging must serve my turn Tis over against Salisbury House where I have the honour of seeing my Lady M Sandis every day unless some race or other carry her out of town The last week she went to one as far as Winchester with colonel Paunton if you know such a one and there her husband met her and because he did so though it twere by accident thought himself obliged to invite her to his house but seven miles off and very modestly said no more for it but that he thought it better than an Inn or at least a crowded one as all in the town were now because of the race But she was so good a companion that she would not forsake her company So he invited them too but could prevail with neither Only my Lady grew kind at parting and said indeed if Tom Paunton and J Morton and the rest would have gone she could have been contented to have taken his offer Thus much for the married people now for those that are towards it There is mister Stanley and missus Witherington Sir H Littleton and missus Philadelphia Carey who in earnest is a fine woman such a one as will make an excellent wife and some say my Lord Rich and my Lady Betty Howard but others that pretend to know more say his court to her is but to countenance a more serious one to missus Howard her sister in law he not having courage to pretend so openly as some do to another s wife Oh but your old acquaintance poor mister Heningham has no luck He was so near as he thought at least marrying missus Gerherd that anybody might have got his whole estate in wagers upon t that would have ventured but a reasonable proportion of their own And now he looks more like an ass than ever he did She has cast him off most unhandsomely that s the truth on t and would have tied him to such conditions as he might have been her slave withal but could never be her husband Is not this a great deal of news for me that never stir abroad Nay I had brought me to day more than all this that I am marrying myself And the pleasantness on t is that it should be to my Lord saint John Would he look on me think you that had pretty missus Fretcheville My comfort is I have not seen him since he was a widower and never spoke to him in my life I found myself so innocent that I never blushed when they told it me What would I give I could avoid it when people speak of you In earnest I do prepare myself all that is possible to hear it spoken of yet for my life I cannot hear your name without discovering that I am more than ordinarily concerned in t A blush is the foolishest thing that can be and betrays one more than a red nose does a drunkard and yet I would not so wholly have lost them as some women that I know has as much injury as they do me I can assure you now that I shall be here a fortnight longer they tell me no lodger upon pain of his Highness s displeasure must remove sooner but when I have his leave I go into Suffolk for a month and then come hither again to go into Kent where I intend to bury myself alive again as I did in Bedfordshire unless you call me out and tell me I may be happy Alas how fain I would hope it but I cannot and should it ever happen twould be long before I should believe twas meant for me in earnest or that twas other than a dream To say truth I do not love to think on t I find so many things to fear and so few to hope Tis better telling you that I will send my letters where you direct that they shall be as long ones as possibly my time will permit and when at any time you miss of one I give you leave to imagine as many kind things as you please and to believe I mean them all to you Farewell Letter fifty nine It is a little astonishing to read as one does in this and the last letter of race meetings and Dorothy habited in a mask disporting herself at New Spring Gardens or in the Park It opens one s eyes to the exaggerated gloom that has been thrown over England during the Puritan reign by those historians who have derived their information solely from State papers and proclamations It is one thing to proclaim amusements another to abolish them The first was undoubtedly done but we doubt if there was ever any long continued effort to do the last and in the latter part of Cromwell s reign the gloom and the strait laced regulations that caused it must have almost entirely disappeared Spring Gardens seems at one time to have had no very good reputation Lady Alice Halkett writing in sixteen forty four tells us that so scrupulous was I of giving any occasion to speak of me as I know they did of others that though I loved well to see plays and to walk in the Spring Gardens sometimes before it grew something scandalous by the abuses of some yet I cannot remember three times that ever I went with any man besides my brother However fashions change in ten years and Spring Gardens is doubtless now quite demure and respectable or we should not find Dorothy there Spring Gardens was enclosed and laid out towards the end of the reign of James I The clump of houses which still bears its name is supposed to indicate its position with tolerable exactness Evelyn tells us that Cromwell shut up the Spring Gardens in sixteen hundred and Knight thinks they were closed until the Restoration in which small matter we may allow Dorothy to correct him The fact of the old gardens having been closed may account for Dorothy referring to the place as New Spring Gardens Knight also quotes at second hand from an account of Spring Gardens complaining that the author is unknown to him This quotation is however from one of Somers Tracts entitled A Character of England as it was lately represented in a Letter to a Nobleman of France sixteen fifty nine The Frenchman by whom the letter is written probably an English satirist in disguise gives us such a graphic account of the Parks before the Restoration that as the matter is fresh and bears upon the subject I have no hesitation in quoting it at length I did frequently in the spring accompany my Lord N into a field near the town which they call Hyde Park the place not unpleasant and which they use as our Course but with nothing that order equipage and splendour being such an assembly of wretched jades and hackney coaches as next to a regiment of car men there is nothing approaches the resemblance The Park was it seems used by the late King and nobility for the freshness of the air and the goodly prospect but it is that which now besides all other exercises they pay for here in England though it be free in all the world beside every coach and horse which enters buying his mouthful and permission of the publican who has purchased it for which the entrance is guarded with porters and long staves The manner is as the company returns to stop at the Spring Gardens so called in order to the Park as our Thuilleries is to the Course the inclosure not disagreeable for the solemnness of the groves the warbling of the birds and as it opens into the spacious walks of saint James But the company walk in it at such a rate as you would think all the ladies were so many Atalantas contending with their wooers and my Lord there was no appearance that I should prove the Hippomenes who could with very much ado keep pace with them But as fast as they run they stay there so long as if they wanted not to finish the race for it is usual here to find some of the young company till midnight and the thickets of the garden seem to be contrived to all the advantages of gallantry after they have refreshed with the collation which is here seldom omitted at a certain cabaret in the middle of this paradise where the forbidden fruits are certain trifling tarts neats tongues salacious meats and bad Rhenish for which the gallants pay sauce as indeed they do at all such houses throughout England for they think it a piece of frugality beneath them to bargain or account for what they eat in any place however unreasonably imposed upon Dorothy is quite right in her correction concerning Will Spencer He was the first Earl of Sunderland and married Elizabeth daughter of Lord Gerard June the sixth sixteen fifty four I see you know how to punish me In earnest I was so frightened with your short letter as you cannot imagine and as much troubled at the cause on t What is it your father ails and how long has he been ill If my prayers are heard he will not be so long Why do you say I failed you Indeed I did not Jane is my witness She carried my letter to the White Hart by saint James s and twas a very long one too I carried one thither since myself and the woman of the house was so very angry because I desired her to have a care on t that I made the coachman drive away with all possible speed lest she should have beaten me To say truth I pressed her too much considering how little the letter deserved it Twas writ in such disorder the company prating about me and some of them so bent on doing me little mischiefs that I know not what I did and believe it was the most senseless disjointed thing that ever was read I remember now that I writ Robin Spencer instead of Will Tis he that has married missus Gerherd and I admire their courage She will have eight hundred pounds a year tis true after her mother s death but how they will live till then I cannot imagine I shall be even with you for your short letter I ll swear they will not allow me time for anything and to show how absolutely I am governed I need but tell you that I am every night in the Park and at New Spring Gardens where though I come with a mask I cannot escape being known nor my conversion being admired Are you not in some fear what will become on me These are dangerous courses I do not find though that they have altered me yet I am much the same person at heart I was in being Yours Letter sixty June thirteenth sixteen fifty four You have satisfied me very much with this last long letter and made some amends for the short one I received before I am convinced too happiness is much such a kind of thing as you describe or rather such a nothing For there is no one thing can properly be called so but every one is left to create it to themselves in something which they either have or would have and so far it s well enough But I do not like that one s happiness should depend upon a persuasion that this is happiness because nobody knows how long they shall continue in a belief built upon no grounds only to bring it to what you say and to make it absolutely of the same nature with faith We must conclude that nobody can either create or continue such a belief in themselves but where it is there is happiness And for my part at this present I verily believe I could find it in the long walk at Dublin You say nothing of your father s sickness therefore I hope he is well again for though I have a quarrel to him it does not extend so far as to wish him ill But he made no good return for the counsel I gave you to say that there might come a time when my kindness might fail Do not believe him I charge you unless you doubt yourself that you may give me occasion to change and when he tells you so again engage what you please upon t and put it upon my account I shall go out of town this week and so cannot possibly get a picture drawn for you till I come up again which will be within these six weeks but not to make any stay at all I should be glad to find you here then I would have had one drawn since I came and consulted my glass every morning when to begin and to speak freely to you that are my friend I could never find my face in a condition to admit on t and when I was not satisfied with it myself I had no reason to hope that anybody else should But I am afraid as you say that time will not mend it and therefore you shall have it as it is as soon as mister Cooper will vouchsafe to take the pains to draw it for you I am in great trouble to think how I shall write out of Suffolk to you or receive yours However do not fail to write though they lie awhile I shall have them at last and they will not be the less welcome and though you should miss of some of mine let it not trouble you but if it be by my fault I ll give you leave to demand satisfaction for it when you come Jane kisses your hands and says she will be ready in all places to do you service but I ll prevent her now you have put me into a jealous humour I ll keep her in chains before she shall quit scores with me Do not believe sir I beseech you that the young heirs are for you content yourself with your old mistress You are not so handsome as Will Spencer nor I have not so much courage nor wealth as his mistress nor she has not so much as her aunt says by all the money I shall not have called her his mistress now they have been married almost this fortnight I ll write again before I leave the town and should have writ more now but company is come in Adieu my dearest Letter sixty one Lady Talmash was the eldest daughter of mister Murray Charles I s page and whipping boy She married Sir Lionel Talmash of Suffolk a gentleman of noble family After her father s death she took the title of Countess of Dysart although there was some dispute about the right of her father to any title Bishop Burnet says She was a woman of great beauty but of far greater parts She had a wonderful quickness of apprehension and an amazing vivacity in conversation She had studied not only divinity and history but mathematics and philosophy She was violent in everything she set about a violent friend but a much more violent enemy She had a restless ambition lived at a vast expense and was ravenously covetous and would have stuck at nothing by which she might compass her ends She had been early in a correspondence with Lord Lauderdale that had given occasion to censure When he was a prisoner after Worcester fight she made him believe he was in great danger of his life and that she saved it by her intrigues with Cromwell which was not a little taken notice of Cromwell was certainly fond of her and she took care to entertain him in it till he finding what was said upon it broke it off Upon the King s Restoration she thought that Lord Lauderdale made not those returns she expected They lived for some years at a distance But upon her husband s death she made up all quarrels so that Lord Lauderdale and she lived so much together that his Lady was offended at it and went to Paris where she died about three years after This was in sixteen seventy two and soon afterwards Lady Dysart and Lord Lauderdale were married She had great power over him and employed it in trafficking with such State patronage as was in Lord Lauderdale s power to bestow Cousin Hammond who was going to take Ludlow s place in Ireland would be the Colonel Robert Hammond who commanded Carisbrooke when the King was imprisoned there He was one of a new council formed in August and sent into Ireland about the end of that month Lady Vavasour was Ursula daughter of Walter Gifford of Chillington Staffordshire Her husband was Sir Thomas Vavasour Bart The Vavasours were a Roman Catholic family and claimed descent from those who held the ancient office of King s Valvasour and we need not therefore be surprised to find Lady Vavasour engaged in one of the numerous plots that surrounded and endangered the Protector s power The plot itself seems to have created intense excitement in the capital and resulted in three persons being tried for high treason and two executed John Gerard gentleman Peter Vowel schoolmaster of Islington and one Summerset Fox who pleaded guilty and whose life was spared Some wise men writes one Thomas Gower in a contemporary letter still unprinted believe that a couple of coy ducks drew in the rest then revealed all and were employed to that purpose that the execution of a few mean persons might deter wiser and more considerable persons This seems not improbable On June sixth the official Mercurius Politicus speaks of this plot as follows The traitorous conspiracy mentioned heretofore it appears every day more desperate and bloody It is discovered that their design was to have destroyed his Highness s person and all others at the helm of Government that they could have laid hands on Immediately upon the villainous assassination they intended to have proclaimed Charles Stuart by the assistance of a tumult et cetera et cetera This with constant accounts of further arrests troubles the public mind at this time The passage of Cowley which Dorothy refers to is in the second book of Cowley s Davideis It opens with a description of the friendship between David and Jonathan and upon that occasion a digression concerning the nature of love The poem was written by Cowley when a young man at Cambridge One can picture Dorothy reading and musing over lines like these with sympathy and admiration What art thou love thou great mysterious thing From what hid stock does thy strange nature spring Tis thou that mov saint the world through ev ry part And hold saint the vast frame close that nothing start From the due place and office first ordained By thee were all things made and are sustained Sometimes we see thee fully and can say From hence thou took saint thy rise and went saint that way But oft ner the short beams of reason s eye See only there thou art not how nor why His lines on love though overcharged with quaint conceits are often noble and true and end at least with one fine couplet Thus dost thou sit like men e er sin had framed A guilty blush naked but not ashamed I promised in my last to write again before I went out of town and now I ll be as good as my word They are all gone this morning and have left me much more at liberty than I have been of late therefore I believe this will be a long letter perhaps too long at least if my letters are as little entertaining as my company is I was carried yesterday abroad to a dinner that was designed for mirth but it seems one ill humoured person in the company is enough to put all the rest out of tune for I never saw people perform what they intended worse and could not forbear telling them so but to excuse themselves and silence my reproaches they all agreed to say that I spoiled their jollity by wearing the most unreasonable looks that could be put on for such an occasion I told them I knew no remedy but leaving me behind next time and could have told them that my looks were suitable to my fortune though not to a feast Fye I am got into my complaining humour that tires myself as well as everybody else and which as you observe helps not at all Would it would leave me and then I could believe I shall not always have occasion for it But that s in nobody s power and my Lady Talmash that says she can do whatsoever she will cannot believe whatsoever she pleases Tis not unpleasant methinks to hear her talk how at such a time she was sick and the physicians told her she would have the small pox and showed her where they were coming out upon her but she bethought herself that it was not at all convenient for her to have them at that time some business she had that required her going abroad and so she resolved she would not be sick nor was not Twenty such stories as these she tells and then falls into discoveries of strength of reason and the power of philosophy till she confounds herself and all that hear her You have no such ladies in Ireland Oh me but I heard to day your cousin Hammond is going thither to be in Ludlow s place Is it true You tell me nothing what is done there but tis no matter The less one knows of State affairs I find it is the better My poor Lady Vavasour is carried to the Tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against the Protector and did not discover it She has told now all that was told her but vows she will never say from whence she had it we shall see whether her resolutions are as unalterable as those of my Lady Talmash I wonder how she behaved herself when she was married I never saw any one yet that did not look simply and out of countenance nor ever knew a wedding well designed but one and that was of two persons who had time enough I confess to contrive it and nobody to please in t but themselves He came down into the country where she was upon a visit and one morning married her As soon as they came out of the church they took coach and came for the town dined at an inn by the way and at night came into lodgings that were provided for them where nobody knew them and where they passed for married people of seven years standing The truth is I could not endure to be missus Bride in a public wedding to be made the happiest person on earth Do not take it ill for I would endure it if I could rather than fail but in earnest I do not think it were possible for me You cannot apprehend the formalities of a treaty more than I do nor so much the success on t Yet in earnest your father will not find my brother Peyton wanting in civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters to me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set a higher value upon her sister than she deserves I know not how he may be prejudiced as to the business but he is not deaf to reason when tis civilly delivered and is as easily gained with compliance and good usage as anybody I know but by no other way When he is roughly dealt with he is like me ten times the worse for t I make it a case of conscience to discover my faults to you as fast as I know them that you may consider what you have to do My aunt told me no longer agone than yesterday that I was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome Take heed you see I give you fair warning I have missed a letter this Monday What is the reason By the next I shall be gone into Kent and my other journey is laid aside which I am not displeased at because it would have broken our intercourse very much Here are some verses of Cowley s Tell me how you like them Tis only a piece taken out of a new thing of his the whole is very long and is a description of or rather a paraphrase upon the friendship of David and Jonathan Tis I think the best I have seen of his and I like the subject because tis that I would be perfect in Adieu Je suis vostre Letter sixty two June the twenty sixth sixteen fifty four I told you in my last that my Suffolk journey was laid aside and that into Kent hastened I am beginning it to day and have chosen to go as far as Gravesend by water though it be very gloomy weather If I drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will I bequeath all my kindness to you in it with a charge never to bestow it all upon another mistress lest my ghost rise again and haunt you I am in such haste that I can say little else to you now When you are come over we l think where to meet for at this distance I can design nothing only I should be as little pleased with the constraint of my brother s house as you Pray let me know whether your man leaves you and how you stand inclined to him I offer you Indeed I like him extremely and he is commended to me by people that know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible I ll keep him unengaged till I hear from you Adieu My next shall make amends for this short one P S I received your last of June twenty second since I sealed up my letter and I durst not but make an excuse for another short one after you have chid me so for those you have received already indeed I could not help it nor cannot now but if that will satisfy I can assure you I shall make a much better wife than I do a husband if I ever am one Pardon mon Cher Coeur on m attend Adieu mon Ame Je vous souhait tout ce que vous desire Letter sixty three July the fourth sixteen fifty four Because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than they I did not intend it so though I can assure you But last night my brother told me he did not send his till ten o clock this morning and now he calls for mine at seven before I am up and I can only be allowed time to tell you that I am in Kent and in a house so strangely crowded with company that I am weary as a dog already though I have been here but three or four days that all their mirth has not mended my humour and that I am here the same I was in other places that I hope merely because you bid me and lose that hope as often as I consider anything but yours Would I were easy of belief they say one is so to all that one desires I do not find it though I am told I was so extremely when I believed you loved me That I would not find and you have only power to make me think it But I am called upon How fain I would say more yet tis all but the saying with more circumstance than I am Yours Directed For your master Letter sixty four I see you can chide when you please and with authority but I deserve it I confess and all I can say for myself is that my fault proceeded from a very good principle in me I am apt to speak what I think and to you have so accustomed myself to discover all my heart that I do not believe it will ever be in my power to conceal a thought from you Therefore I am afraid you must resolve to be vexed with all my senseless apprehensions as my brother Peyton is with some of his wife s who is thought a very good woman but the most troublesome one in a coach that ever was We dare not let our tongues lie more on one side of our mouths than t other for fear of overturning it You are satisfied I hope ere this that I scaped drowning However tis not amiss that my will made you know now how to dispose of all my wealth whensoever I die But I am troubled much you should make so ill a journey to so little purpose indeed I writ by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters Is your father returned yet and do you think of coming over immediately How welcome you will be But alas I cannot talk on t at the rate that you do I am sensible that such an absence is misfortune enough but I dare not promise myself that it will conclude ours and tis more my belief that you yourself speak it rather to encourage me and to your wishes than your hopes My humour is so ill at present that I dare say no more lest you chide me again I find myself fit for nothing but to converse with a lady below that is fallen out with all the world because her husband and she cannot agree Tis the pleasantest thing that can be to hear us discourse She takes great pains to dissuade me from ever marrying and says I am the veriest fool that ever lived if I do not take her counsel Now we do not absolutely agree in that point but I promise her never to marry unless I can find such a husband as I describe to her and she believes is never to be found so that upon the matter we differ very little Whensoever she is accused of maintaining opinions very destructive of society and absolutely prejudicial to all the young people of both sexes that live in the house she calls out me to be her second and by it has lost me the favour of all our young gallants who have got a custom of expressing anything that is nowhere but in fiction by the name of missus O s husband For my life I cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to no decay an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission They laugh to hear me say that one unkind word would destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that I should expect our kindness should increase every day if it were possible but never lessen All this is perfect nonsense in their opinion but I should not doubt the convincing them if I could hope to be so happy as to be Yours Letter sixty five Of William Lilly a noted and extraordinary character of that day the following account is taken from his own Life and Times a lively book full of amusing lies and astrological gossip in which the author describes himself as a student of the Black Art He was born in sixteen oh two at Diseworth an obscure town in the north of Leicestershire His family appear to have been yeomen in this town for many generations Passing over the measles of his infancy and other trivial details of childhood which he describes minutely we find him as a boy at Ashby de la Zouche where he is the pupil of one mister John Brinsley Here he learned Latin and Greek and began to study Hebrew In the sixteenth year of his age he was greatly troubled with dreams concerning his damnation or salvation and at the age of eighteen he returned to his father s house and there kept a school in great penury He then appears to have come up to London leaving his father in a debtor s prison and proceeded in pursuit of fortune with a new suit of clothes and seven shillings and sixpence in his pocket In London he entered the service of one Gilbert Wright an independent citizen of small means and smaller education To him Lilly was both man servant and secretary The second missus Wright seems to have had a taste for astrology and consulted some of the quacks who then preyed on the silly women of the city She was very fond of young Lilly who attended her in her last illness and in return for his care and attention she bequeathed to him several sigils or talismanic seals Probably it was the foolishness of this poor woman that first suggested to Lilly the advantages to be gained from the profession of astrology mister Wright married a third wife and soon afterwards died leaving his widow comfortably off She fell in love with Lilly who married her in sixteen twenty seven and for five years until her death they lived happily together Lilly was now a man of means and was enabled to study that science which he afterwards practised with so much success There were a good many professors of the black art at this date and Lilly studied under one Evans a scoundrelly ex parson from Wales until according to Lilly s own account he discovered Evans to be the cheat he undoubtedly was Lilly when he set up for himself wrote many astrological works which seem to have been very successful He was known and visited by all the great men of the day and probably had brains enough only to prophesy when he knew His description of his political creed is beautifully characteristic of the man I was more Cavalier than Round head and so taken notice of but afterwards I engaged body and soul in the cause of the Parliament but still with much affection to his Majesty s person and unto Monarchy which I ever loved and approved beyond any government whatsoever Lilly was in a word a self seeking but successful knave People who had been robbed women in love men in debt all in trouble and doubt from the King downwards sought his aid He pretended to be a man of science not a man gifted with supernatural powers Whether he succeeded in believing in astrology and deceiving himself it is impossible to say he was probably too clever for that but he deceived others admirably and was one of the noted and most successful of the old astrologers How long this letter will be I cannot tell You shall have all the time that is allowed me but upon condition that you shall not examine the sense on t too strictly for you must know I want sleep extremely The sun was up an hour before I went to bed to day and this is not the first time I have done this since I came hither Twill not be for your advantage that I should stay here long for in earnest I shall be good for nothing if I do We go abroad all day and play all night and say our prayers when we have time Well in sober earnest now I would not live thus a twelvemonth to gain all that the King has lost unless it were to give it him again Tis a miracle to me how my brother endures it Tis as contrary to his humour as darkness is to light and only shows the power he lets his wife have over him Will you be so good natured He has certainly as great a kindness for her as can be and to say truth not without reason but all the people that ever I saw I do not like his carriage towards her He is perpetually wrangling and finding fault and to a person that did not know him would appear the worst husband and the most imperious in the world He is so amongst his children too though he loves them passionately He has one son and tis the finest boy that e er you saw and has a noble spirit but yet stands in that awe of his father that one word from him is as much as twenty whippings You must give me leave to entertain you thus with discourses of the family for I can tell you nothing else from hence Yet now I remember I have another story for you You little think I have been with Lilly and in earnest I was the day before I came out of town and what do you think I went for Not to know when you would come home I can assure you nor for any other occasion of my own but with a cousin of mine that had long designed to make herself sport with him and did not miss of her aim I confess I always thought him an impostor but I could never have imagined him so simple a one as we found him In my life I never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was He asked us more questions than we did him and caught at everything we said without discerning that we abused him and said things purposely to confound him which we did so perfectly that we made him contradict himself the strangest that ever you saw Ever since this adventure I have had so great a belief in all things of this nature that I could not forbear laying a peas cod with nine peas in t under my door yesterday and was informed by it that my husband s name should be Thomas How do you like that But what Thomas I cannot imagine for all the servants I have got since I came hither I know none of that name Here is a new song I do not send it to you but to your sister the tune is not worth the sending so far If she pleases to put any to it I am sure it will be a better than it has here Adieu Letter sixty six The Lost Lady is a tragi comedy by Sir William Berkely and is advertised to be sold at the shop of the Holy Lamb in the year sixteen thirty nine which we may take as the probable date of its publication Dorothy would play Hermione the heroine We can imagine her speaking with sympathetic accent lines such as these With what harsh fate does Heaven afflict me That all the blessings which make others happy Must be my ruin The five Portugals to whom Dorothy refers as being hanged were the Portuguese ambassador s brother Don Pantaleon Sa and four of his men The Mercurius Politicus of November sixteen fifty three gives the following account of the matters that led to the execution and as it is illustrative of the manners of the day the account is here quoted at length NEW EXCHANGE IN THE STRAND November twenty one In the evening there happened a quarrel between the Portugal ambassador s brother and two or three others of that nation with one mister Gerard an English gentleman whom they all fell upon but he being rescued out of their hands by one mister Anstruther they retired home and within an hour after returned with about twelve more of their nation armed with breastplates and headpieces but after two or three hours taken there not finding Anstruther they went home again for that night November twenty two At night the ambassador s brother and the rest returned again and walking the upper Exchange they met with one colonel Mayo who being a proper man they supposed him to have been the same Anstruther that repelled them the night before and so shooting off a pistol which was as the watchword the rest of the Portugals supposed about fifty came in with drawn swords and leaving a sufficient number to keep the stairs the rest went up with the ambassador s brother and there they fell upon colonel Mayo who very gallantly defending himself received seven dangerous wounds and lies in a mortal condition They fell also upon one mister Greenway of Lincoln s Inn as he was walking with his sister in one hand and his mistress in the other to whom as I am informed he was to have been married on Tuesday next and pistoled him in the head whereof he died immediately They brought with them several earthen jars stuffed with gunpowder stopped with wax and fitted with matches intending it seems to have done some mischief to the Exchange that they might complete their revenge but they were prevented There is an account of their trial in the State Trials of some interest to lawyers it resulted in the execution of Don Pantaleon Sa and four of his servants By one of those curious fateful coincidences with which fact often outbids fiction mister Gerard who was the first Englishman attacked by the Portuguese suffers on the same scaffold as his would be murderers his offence being high treason Vowel the other plotter is also executed but the third saves himself as we know by confession July twentieth sixteen fifty four in pencil I am very sorry I spoke too late for I am confident this was an excellent servant He was in the same house where I lay and I had taken a great fancy to him upon what was told me of him and what I saw The poor fellow too was so pleased that I undertook to inquire out a place for him that though mine was as I told him uncertain yet upon the bare hopes on t he refused two or three good conditions but I shall set him now at liberty and not think at all the worse of him for his good nature Sure you go a little too far in your condemnation on t I know it may be abused as the best things are most subject to be but in itself tis so absolutely necessary that where it is wanting nothing can recompense the miss on t The most contemptible person in the world if he has that cannot be justly hated and the most considerable without it cannot deserve to be loved Would to God I had all that good nature you complain you have too much of I could find ways enough to dispose on t amongst myself and my friends but tis well where it is and I should sooner wish you more on t than less I wonder with what confidence you can complain of my short letters that are so guilty yourself in the same kind I have not seen a letter this month which has been above half a sheet Never trust me if I write more than you that live in a desolated country where you might finish a romance of ten tomes before anybody interrupted you I that live in a house the most filled of any since the Ark and where I can assure you one has hardly time for the most necessary occasions Well there was never any one thing so much desired and apprehended at the same time as your return is by me it will certainly I think conclude me a very happy or a most unfortunate person Sometimes methinks I would fain know my doom whatever it be and at others I dread it so extremely that I am confident the five Portugals and the three plotters which were t other day condemned by the High Court of Justice had not half my fears upon them I leave you to judge the constraint I live in what alarms my thoughts give me and yet how unconcerned this company requires I should be they will have me at my part in a play The Lost Lady it is and I am she Pray God it be not an ill omen I shall lose my eyes and you this letter if I make it longer Farewell I am yours Letter sixty seven Elizabeth Queen of Bohemia was the daughter of James I She married the Elector Frederick who was driven from his throne owing to his own misconduct and folly when his wife was forced to return and live as a pensioner in her native country She is said to have been gifted in a superlative degree with all that is considered most lovely in a woman s character On her husband s death in sixteen thirty two she went to live at the Hague where she remained until the Restoration There is a report that she married William Earl of Craven but there is no proof of this He was however her friend and adviser through her years of widowhood and it was to his house in Drury Lane that she returned to live in sixteen sixty one She is said to have been a lover of literature and Francis Quarles and Sir Henry Wotton were her intimate friends The latter has written some quaint and elegant verses to his mistress the last verse in which he apostrophizes her as the sun is peculiarly graceful It runs thus You meaner beauties of the night That poorly satisfy our eyes More by your number than your light You common people of the skies What are you when the sun shall rise But the sun is set and the beautiful Queen s sad romantic story almost forgotten Sir John Grenvile was a son of the valiant and loyal cavalier Sir Bevil Grenvile of Kelkhampton Cornwall He served the King successfully in the west of England and was dangerously wounded at Newbury He was entrusted by Charles II to negotiate with General Monk Monk s brother was vicar of Kelkhampton so that Grenvile and Monk would in all probability be well acquainted before the time of the negotiation We may remember too that Dorothy s younger brother was on intimate terms with General Monk s relations in Cornwall There must be letters missing here for we cannot believe more than a month passed without Dorothy writing a single letter I wonder you did not come before your last letter Twas dated the twenty fourth of August but I received it not till the first of September Would to God your journey were over Every little storm of wind frights me so that I pass here for the greatest coward that ever was born though in earnest I think I am as little so as most women yet I may be deceived too for now I remember me you have often told me I was one and sure you know what kind of heart mine is better than anybody else I am glad you are pleased with that description I made you of my humour for though you had disliked it I am afraid tis past my power to help You need not make excuses neither for yours no other would please me half so well That gaiety which you say is only esteemed would be insupportable to me and I can as little endure a tongue that s always in motion as I could the click of a mill Of all the company this place is stored with there is but two persons whose conversation is at all easy one is my eldest niece who sure was sent into the world to show tis possible for a woman to be silent the other a gentleman whose mistress died just when they should have married and though tis many years since one may read it in his face still His humour was very good I believe before that accident for he will yet say things pleasant enough but tis so seldom that he speaks at all and when he does tis with so sober a look that one may see he is not moved at all himself when he diverts the company most You will not be jealous though I say I like him very much If you were not secure in me you might be so in him He would expect his mistress should rise again to reproach his inconstancy if he made court to anything but her memory Methinks we three that is my niece and he and I do become this house the worst that can be unless I should take into the number my brother Peyton himself too for to say truth his for another sort of melancholy is not less than ours What can you imagine we did this last week when to our constant company there was added a colonel and his lady a son of his and two daughters a maid of honour to the Queen of Bohemia and another colonel or a major I know not which besides all the tongue they brought with them the men the greatest drinkers that ever I saw which did not at all agree with my brother who would not be drawn to it to save a kingdom if it lay at stake and no other way to redeem it But in earnest there was one more to be pitied besides us and that was Colonel Thornhill s wife as pretty a young woman as I have seen She is Sir John Greenvil s sister and has all his good nature with a great deal of beauty and modesty and wit enough This innocent creature is sacrificed to the veriest beast that ever was The first day she came hither he intended it seems to have come with her but by the way called in to see an old acquaintance and bid her go on he would overtake her but did not come till next night and then so drunk he was led immediately to bed whither she was to follow him when she had supped I blest myself at her patience as you may do that I could find anything to fill up this paper withal Adieu Letter sixty eight In this scrap of writing we find that Temple is again in England with certain proposals from his father and ready to discuss the treaty as Dorothy calls it with her brother Peyton The few remaining letters deal with the treaty Temple would probably return to London when he left Ireland and letters would pass frequently between them There seems to have been some hitch as to who should appear in the treaty Dorothy s brother had spoken of and behaved to Temple with all disrespect but now that he is reconciled to the marriage Dorothy would have him appear at least formally in the negotiations The last letter of this chapter which is dated October second calls on Temple to come down to Kent to Peyton s house and it is reasonable to suppose that at this interview all was practically settled to the satisfaction of those two who were most deeply concerned in the negotiation I did so promise myself a letter on Friday that I am very angry I had it not though I know you were not come to town when it should have been writ But did not you tell me you should not stay above a day or two What is it that has kept you longer I am pleased though that you are out of the power of so uncertain things as the winds and the sea which I never feared for myself but did extremely apprehend for you You will find a packet of letters to read and maybe have met with them already If you have you are so tired that tis but reasonable I should spare you in this For to say truth I have not time to make this longer besides that if I had my pen is so very good that it writes an invisible hand I think I am sure I cannot read it myself If your eyes are better you will find that I intended to assure you I am Yours Letter sixty nine I am but newly waked out of an unquiet sleep and I find it so late that if I write at all it must be now Some company that was here last night kept us up till three o clock and then we lay three in a bed which was all the same to me as if we had not gone to bed at all Since dinner they are all gone and our company with them part of the way and with much ado I got to be excused that I might recover a little sleep but am so moped yet that sure this letter will be nonsense I would fain tell you though that your father is mistaken and that you are not if you believe that I have all the kindness and tenderness for you my heart is capable of Let me assure you whatever your father thinks that had you Ltwenty thousand a year I could love you no more than I do and should be far from showing it so much lest it should look like a desire of your fortune which as to myself I value as little as anybody in the world and in this age of changes but certainly I know what an estate is I have seen my father s reduced better than Lfour thousand to not Lfour hundred a year and I thank God I never felt the change in anything that I thought necessary I never wanted nor am confident I never shall But yet I would not be thought so inconsiderate a person as not to remember that it is expected from all people that have sense that they should act with reason that to all persons some proportion of fortune is necessary according to their several qualities and though it is not required that one should tie oneself to just so much and something is left for one s inclination and the difference in the persons to make yet still within such a compass and such as lay more upon these considerations than they will bear shall infallibly be condemned by all sober persons If any accident out of my power should bring me to necessity though never so great I should not doubt with God s assistance but to bear it as well as anybody and I should never be ashamed on t if He pleased to send it me but if by my own folly I had put it upon myself the case would be extremely altered If ever this comes to a treaty I shall declare that in my own choice I prefer you much before any other person in the world and all that this inclination in me in the judgment of any persons of honour and discretion will bear I shall desire may be laid upon it to the uttermost of what they can allow And if your father please to make up the rest I know nothing that is like to hinder me from being yours But if your father out of humour shall refuse to treat with such friends as I have let them be what they will it must end here for though I was content for your sake to lose them and all the respect they had for me yet now I have done that I ll never let them see that I have so little interest in you and yours as not to prevail that my brother may be admitted to treat for me Sure when a thing of course and so much reason as that unless I did disclose to all the world he were my enemy it must be expected whensoever I dispose of myself he should be made no stranger to it When that shall be refused me I may be justly reproached that I deceived myself when I expected to be at all valued in a family that I am a stranger to or that I should be considered with any respect because I had a kindness for you that made me not value my own interests I doubt much whether all this be sense or not I find my head so heavy But that which I would say is in short this if I did say once that my brother should have nothing to do in t twas when his carriage towards me gave me such an occasion as could justify the keeping that distance with him but now it would look extremely unhandsome in me and sure I hope your father would not require it of me If he does I must conclude he has no value for me and sure I never disobliged him to my knowledge and should with all the willingness imaginable serve him if it lay in my power Good God what an unhappy person am I All the world is so almost Just now they are telling me of a gentleman near us that is the most wretched creature made by the loss of a wife that he passionately loved that can be If your father would but in some measure satisfy my friends that I might but do it in any justifiable manner you should dispose me as you pleased carry me whither you would all places of the world would be alike to me where you were and I should not despair of carrying myself so towards him as might deserve a better opinion from him I am yours Letter seventy My doubts and fears were not at all increased by that which gives you so many nor did I apprehend that your father might not have been prevailed with to have allowed my brother s being seen in the treaty for as to the thing itself whether he appears in t or not twill be the same He cannot but conclude my brother Peyton would not do anything in it without the others consent I do not pretend to any share in your father s kindness as having nothing in me to merit it but as much a stranger as I am to him I should have taken it very ill if I had desired it of him and he had refused it me I do not believe my brother has said anything to his prejudice unless it were in his persuasions to me and there it did not injure him at all If he takes it ill that my brother appears so very averse to the match I may do so too that he was the same and nothing less than my kindness for you could have made me take so patiently as I did his saying to some that knew me at York that he was forced to bring you thither and afterwards to send you over lest you should have married me This was not much to my advantage nor hardly civil I think to any woman yet I never so much as took the least notice on t nor had not now but for this occasion yet sure it concerns me to be at least as nice as he in point of honour I think tis best for me to end here lest my anger should make me lose that respect I would always have for your father and twere not amiss I think that I devoted it all towards you for being so idle as to run out of your bed to catch such a cold If you come hither you must expect to be chidden so much that you will wish that you had stayed till we came up when perhaps I might have almost forgot half my quarrel to you At this present I can assure you I am pleased with nobody but your sister and her I love extremely and will call her pretty say what you will I know she must be so though I never saw more of her than what her letters show She shall have two spots carriage dogs if she please for I had just such another given me after you were gone or anything else that is in the power of Yours Letter seventy one Monday October the second sixteen fifty four After a long debate with myself how to satisfy you and remove that rock as you call it which in your apprehensions is of so great danger I am at last resolved to let you see that I value your affections for me at as high a rate as you yourself can set it and that you cannot have more of tenderness for me and my interests than I shall ever have for yours The particulars how I intend to make this good you shall know when I see you which since I find them here more irresolute in point of time though not as to the journey itself than I hoped they would have been notwithstanding your quarrel to me and the apprehension you would make me believe you had that I do not care to see you pray come hither and try whether you shall be welcome or not In sober earnest now I must speak with you and to that end if your occasions will serve come down to Canterbury Send some one when you are there and you shall have further directions You must be contented not to stay here above two or three hours I shall tell you my reason when you come And pray inform yourself of all that your father will do on this occasion that you may tell it me only therefore let it be plainly and sincerely what he intends and all I will not hinder your coming away so much as the making this letter a little longer might take away from your time in reading it Tis enough to tell you I am ever Yours CHAPTER VII THE END OF THE THIRD VOLUME This short series of notes was written I think during a visit to London after the formal betrothal and before the marriage These notes were evidently written upon the trivial occasions of the day more perhaps for the sake of writing something than for any more serious reason The note in French is somewhat of a curiosity on account of its quaint orthography which is purposely left uncorrected Was Dorothy in London to purchase her trousseau Where did she and Jane spend their days if that was the case when Regent Street was green fields These questions cannot be satisfactorily answered but the notes themselves without any history or explanation are so full of interest so fresh and vivacious even for Dorothy that they place themselves from the freedom and joy of their style and manner at the end of the third volume You are like to have an excellent housewife of me

none	none	 And now we have finished Dorothy Osborne is passing away will soon be translated into Dorothy Temple with the romance of her life all past history and fast becoming as much a romance to herself as it seems to us looking back at it after more than two centuries Something it is becoming to her over which she can muse and dream and weave into tales for the children who will gather round her Something the reality of which will grow doubtful to her if she find idle hours for dreaming and doubting in her new name Her last lover s letter is written We are ready for the marriage ceremony and listen for the wedding march and happy jingle of village bells or if we may not have these in Puritan days at least we may hear the pompous magistrate pronounce the blessing of the State over its two happy subjects But no There is yet a moment of suspense a last trial to the lover s constancy The bride is taken dangerously ill so dangerously ill that the doctors rejoice when the disease pronounces itself to be small pox Alas who shall now say what are the inmost thoughts of our Dorothy Does she not need all her faith in her lover in herself ay and in God to uphold her in this new affliction She rises from her bed her beauty of face destroyed her fair looks living only on the painter s canvas unless we may believe that they were etched in deeply bitten lines on Temple s heart But the skin beauty is not the firmest hold she has on Temple s affections this was not the beauty that had attracted her lover and held him enchained in her service for seven years of waiting and suspense this was not the only light leading him through dark days of doubt almost of despair constant unwavering in his troth to her Other beauty not outward of which we too may have seen something mirrowed darkly in these letters which we too as well as Temple may know existed in Dorothy For it is not beauty of face and form but of what men call the soul that made Dorothy to Temple in fact as she was in name the gift of God Appendix LADY TEMPLE Of Lady Temple there is very little to be known and what there is can be best understood by following the career of her husband which has been written at some length and with laboured care by mister Courtenay After her marriage which took place in London January thirty first sixteen fifty five they lived for a year at the home of a friend in the country They then removed to Ireland where they lived for five years with Temple s father Lady Giffard Temple s widowed sister joining them In sixteen sixty three they were living in England Lady Giffard continued to live with them through the rest of their lives and survived them both In sixteen sixty five Temple was sent to Brussels as English representative and his family joined him in the following year In sixteen sixty eight he was removed from Brussels to the Hague where the successful negotiations which led to the Triple Alliance took place and these have given him an honourable place in history There is a letter of Lady Temple s written to her husband in sixteen seventy which shows how interested she was in the part he took in political life and how he must have consulted her in all State matters It is taken from Courtenay s Life of Sir William Temple vol i p three hundred forty five He quotes it as the only letter written after Lady Temple s marriage which has come into his hands THE HAGUE October thirty first sixteen seventy My Dearest Heart I received yours from Yarmouth and was very glad you made so happy a passage Tis a comfortable thing when one is on this side to know that such a thing can be done in spite of contrary winds I have a letter from P who says in character that you may take it from him that the Duke of Buckingham has begun a negotiation there but what success in England he may have he knows not that it were to be wished our politicians at home would consider well that there is no trust to be put in alliances with ambitious kings especially such as make it their fundamental maxim to be base These are bold words but they are his own Besides this there is nothing but that the French King grows very thrifty that all his buildings except fortifications are ceased and that his payments are not so regular as they used to be The people here are of another mind they will not spare their money but are resolved at least the States of Holland if the rest will consent to raise fourteen regiments of foot and six of horse that all the companies both old and new shall be of one hundred twenty men that used to be of fifty and every troop eighty that used to be of forty five Nothing is talked of but these new levies and the young men are much pleased Downton says they have strong suspicions here you will come back no more and that they shall be left in the lurch that something is striking up with France and that you are sent away because you are too well inclined to these countries and my cousin Temple he says told him that a nephew of Sir Robert Long s who is lately come to Utrecht told my cousin Temple three weeks since you were not to stay long here because you were too great a friend to these people and that he had it from mister Williamson who knew very well what he said My cousin Temple says he told it to Major Scott as soon as he heard it and so tis like you knew it before but there is such a want of something to say that I catch at everything I am my best dear s most affectionate D T In the summer of sixteen seventy one there occurred an incident that reminds us considerably of the Dorothy Osborne of former days The Triple Alliance had lost some of its freshness and was not so much in vogue as heretofore Charles II had been coquetting with the French King and at length the Government throwing off its mask formally displaced Temple from his post in Holland The critical position of affairs says Courtenay induced the Dutch to keep a fleet at sea and the English Government hoped to draw from that circumstance an occasion of quarrel A yacht was sent for Lady Temple the captain had orders to sail through the Dutch fleet if he should meet it and to fire into the nearest ships until they should either strike sail to the flag which he bore or return his shot so as to make a quarrel He saw nothing of the Dutch Fleet in going over but on his return he fell in with it and fired without warning and ceremony into the ships that were next him The Dutch admiral Van Ghent was puzzled he seemed not to know and probably did not know what the English captain meant he therefore sent a boat thinking it possible that the yacht might be in distress when the captain told his orders mentioning also that he had the ambassadress on board Van Ghent himself then came on board with a handsome compliment to Lady Temple and making his personal inquiries of the captain received the same answer as before The Dutchman said he had no orders upon the point which he rightly believed to be still unsettled and could not believe that the fleet commanded by an admiral was to strike to the King s pleasure boat When the Admiral returned to his ship the captain also perplexed enough applied to Lady Temple who soon saw that he desired to get out of his difficulty by her help but the wife of Sir William Temple called forth the spirit of Dorothy Osborne He knew she told the captain his orders best and what he was to do upon them which she left to him to follow as he thought fit without any regard to her or her children The Dutch and English commanders then proceeded each upon his own course and Lady Temple was safely landed in England There is an account of this incident in a letter of Sir Charles Lyttelton to Viscount Hatton in the Hatton Correspondence He tells us that the poor captain Captain Crow of The Monmouth found himself in the Tower about it but he does not add any further information as to the part which Dorothy played in the matter After their retirement to Sheen and Moor Park Surrey we know nothing distinctively of Lady Temple and little is known of their family life They had only two children living having lost as many as seven in their infancy In sixteen eighty four one of these children their only daughter died of small pox she was buried in Westminster Abbey There is a letter of hers written to her father which shows some signs of her mother s affectionate teaching and which we cannot forbear to quote It is copied from Courtenay vol ii p one hundred thirteen SIR I deferred writing to you till I could tell you that I had received all my fine things which I have just now done but I thought never to have done giving you thanks for them They have made me so very happy in my new clothes and everybody that comes does admire them above all things but yet not so much as I think they deserve and now if papa was near I should think myself a perfect pope though I hope I should not be burned as there was one at Nell Gwyn s door the fifth of November who was set in a great chair with a red nose half a yard long with some hundreds of boys throwing squibs at it Monsieur Gore and I agree mighty well and he makes me believe I shall come to something at last that is if he stays which I don t doubt but he will because all the fine ladies will petition for him We are got rid of the workmen now and our house is ready to entertain you Come when you please and you will meet nobody more glad to see you than your most obedient and dutiful daughter D TEMPLE Temple s son John Temple married in sixteen eighty five a rich heiress in France the daughter of Monsieur Duplessis Rambouillet a French Protestant he brought his wife to live at his father s house at Sheen After King William and Queen Mary were actually placed on the throne Sir William Temple in sixteen eighty nine permitted his son to accept the office of Secretary at War For reasons now obscure and unknowable he drowned himself in the Thames within a week of his acceptance of office leaving this writing behind him My folly in undertaking what I was not able to perform has done the King and kingdom a great deal of prejudice I wish him all happiness and abler servants than John Temple The following letter was written on that occasion by Lady Temple to her nephew Sir John Osborne The original of it is at Chicksands To Sir John Osborne thanking him for his consolation on the death of her son SHEEN May sixth sixteen eighty nine Dear Nephew I give you many thanks for your kind letter and the sense you have of my affliction which truly is very great But since it is laid upon me by the hand of an Almighty and Gracious God that always proportions His punishments to the support He gives with them I may hope to bear it as a Christian ought to do and more especially one that is conscious to herself of having many ways deserved it The strange revolution we have seen might well have taught me what this world is yet it seems it was necessary that I should have a near example of the uncertainty of all human blessings that so having no tie to the world I may the better prepare myself to leave it and that this correction may suffice to teach me my duty must be the prayer of your affectionate aunt and humble servant D TEMPLE During the remaining years of her life Lady Temple was honoured to use the conventional phrase by the friendship of Queen Mary and there is said to have been a continuous correspondence between them though I can find on inquiry no trace of its existence at the present day Early in the year sixteen ninety five after forty years of married life and in the sixty seventh year of her age she died She lies with her husband and children on the north side of the nave of Westminster Abbey close to the little door that leads to the organ gallery Her body sleeps in Capel s monument And her immortal part with angels lives END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LOVE LETTERS OF DOROTHY OSBORNE TO SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE sixteen fifty
