3664_11714_000012_000000	train-clean-100	On the eighth of April fourteen ninety two in a bedroom of the Carneggi Palace about three miles from Florence were three men grouped about a bed whereon a fourth lay dying 
none	none	The first of these three men sitting at the foot of the bed and half hidden that he might conceal his tears in the gold brocaded curtains was Ermolao Barbaro author of the treatise On Celibacy and of Studies in Pliny the year before when he was at Rome in the capacity of ambassador of the Florentine Republic he had been appointed Patriarch of Aquileia by Innocent VIII The second who was kneeling and holding one hand of the dying man between his own was Angelo Poliziano the Catullus of the fifteenth century a classic of the lighter sort who in his Latin verses might have been mistaken for a poet of the Augustan age The third who was standing up and leaning against one of the twisted columns of the bed head following with profound sadness the progress of the malady which he read in the face of his departing friend was the famous Pico della Mirandola who at the age of twenty could speak twenty two languages and who had offered to reply in each of these languages to any seven hundred questions that might be put to him by the twenty most learned men in the whole world if they could be assembled at Florence 
3664_11714_000016_000000	train-clean-100	The man on the bed was Lorenzo the Magnificent who at the beginning of the year had been attacked by a severe and deep seated fever to which was added the gout a hereditary ailment in his family 
none	none	He had found at last that the draughts containing dissolved pearls which the quack doctor Leoni di Spoleto prescribed for him as if he desired to adapt his remedies rather to the riches of his patient than to his necessities were useless and unavailing and so he had come to understand that he must part from those gentle tongued women of his those sweet voiced poets his palaces and their rich hangings therefore he had summoned to give him absolution for his sins in a man of less high place they might perhaps have been called crimes the Dominican Giralamo Francesco Savonarola 
3664_11714_000017_000000	train-clean-100	It was not however without an inward fear against which the praises of his friends availed nothing that the pleasure seeker and usurper awaited that severe and gloomy preacher by whose words all Florence was stirred and on whose pardon henceforth depended all his hope for another world 
3664_11714_000018_000000	train-clean-100	Indeed Savonarola was one of those men of stone coming like the statue of the Commandante to knock at the door of a Don Giovanni and in the midst of feast and orgy to announce that it is even now the moment to begin to think of Heaven 
none	none	He had been born at Ferrara whither his family one of the most illustrious of Padua had been called by Niccolo Marchese d Este and at the age of twenty three summoned by an irresistible vocation had fled from his father s house and had taken the vows in the cloister of Dominican monks at Florence 
3664_11714_000018_000002	train-clean-100	There where he was appointed by his superiors to give lessons in philosophy the young novice had from the first to battle against the defects of a voice that was both harsh and weak a defective pronunciation and above all the depression of his physical powers exhausted as they were by too severe abstinence 
3664_11714_000019_000000	train-clean-100	Savonarola from that time condemned himself to the most absolute seclusion and disappeared in the depths of his convent as if the slab of his tomb had already fallen over him 
3664_11714_000019_000001	train-clean-100	There kneeling on the flags praying unceasingly before a wooden crucifix fevered by vigils and penances he soon passed out of contemplation into ecstasy and began to feel in himself that inward prophetic impulse which summoned him to preach the reformation of the Church 
3664_11714_000020_000000	train-clean-100	Nevertheless the reformation of Savonarola more reverential than Luther s which followed about five and twenty years later respected the thing while attacking the man and had as its aim the altering of teaching that was human not faith that was of God 
3664_11714_000020_000001	train-clean-100	He did not work like the German monk by reasoning but by enthusiasm 
3664_11714_000020_000002	train-clean-100	With him logic always gave way before inspiration he was not a theologian but a prophet 
3664_11714_000020_000003	train-clean-100	Yet although hitherto he had bowed his head before the authority of the Church he had already raised it against the temporal power 
3664_11714_000020_000004	train-clean-100	To him religion and liberty appeared as two virgins equally sacred so that in his view Lorenzo in subjugating the one was as culpable as Pope Innocent VIII in dishonouring the other 
3664_11714_000020_000005	train-clean-100	The result of this was that so long as Lorenzo lived in riches happiness and magnificence Savonarola had never been willing whatever entreaties were made to sanction by his presence a power which he considered illegitimate 
3664_11714_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 never 
none	none	been willing whatever entreaties were made to sanction by his presence a power which he considered illegitimate 
3664_11714_000020_000006	train-clean-100	But Lorenzo on his deathbed sent for him and that was another matter 
3664_11714_000020_000007	train-clean-100	The austere preacher set forth at once bareheaded and barefoot hoping to save not only the soul of the dying man but also the liberty of the republic 
3664_11714_000021_000000	train-clean-100	Lorenzo as we have said was awaiting the arrival of Savonarola with an impatience mixed with uneasiness so that when he heard the sound of his steps his pale face took a yet more deathlike tinge while at the same time he raised himself on his elbow and ordered his three friends to go away 
3664_11714_000021_000001	train-clean-100	They obeyed at once and scarcely had they left by one door than the curtain of the other was raised and the monk pale immovable solemn appeared on the threshold 
3664_11714_000021_000002	train-clean-100	When he perceived him Lorenzo dei Medici reading in his marble brow the inflexibility of a statue fell back on his bed breathing a sigh so profound that one might have supposed it was his last 
3664_11714_000022_000000	train-clean-100	The monk glanced round the room as though to assure himself that he was really alone with the dying man then he advanced with a slow and solemn step towards the bed 
3664_11714_000022_000001	train-clean-100	Lorenzo watched his approach with terror then when he was close beside him he cried 
3664_11714_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 O my father I have been a very great sinner 
none	none	The mercy of God is infinite replied the monk and I come into your presence laden with the divine mercy You believe then that God will forgive my sins cried the dying man renewing his hope as he heard from the lips of the monk such unexpected words
3664_11714_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 Your sins and also your crimes God will forgive them all replied Savonarola 
3664_11714_000026_000001	train-clean-100	 God will forgive your vanities your adulterous pleasures your obscene festivals so much for your sins 
none	none	God will forgive you for promising two thousand florins reward to the man who should bring you the head of Dietisalvi Nerone Nigi Angelo Antinori Niccalo Soderini and twice the money if they were handed over alive God will forgive you for dooming to the scaffold or the gibbet the son of Papi Orlandi Francesco di Brisighella Bernardo Nardi Jacopo Frescobaldi Amoretto Baldovinetti Pietro Balducci Bernardo di Banding Francesco Frescobaldi and more than three hundred others whose names were none the less dear to Florence because they were less renowned so much for your crimes And at each of these names which Savonarola pronounced slowly his eyes fixed on the dying man he replied with a groan which proved the monk s memory to be only too true 
3664_11714_000026_000003	train-clean-100	Then at last when he had finished Lorenzo asked in a doubtful tone 
none	none	Then do you believe my father that God will forgive me everything both my sins and my crimes
3664_11714_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 Everything said Savonarola but on three conditions 
3664_11714_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 What are they asked the dying man 
3664_11714_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 The first said Savonarola is that you feel a complete faith in the power and the mercy of God 
3664_11714_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 My father replied Lorenzo eagerly I feel this faith in the very depths of my heart 
3664_11714_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 The second said Savonarola is that you give back the property of others which you have unjustly confiscated and kept 
3664_11714_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 My father shall I have time asked the dying man 
3664_11714_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 God will give it to you replied the monk 
3664_11714_000035_000000	train-clean-100	Lorenzo shut his eyes as though to reflect more at his ease then after a moment s silence he replied 
3664_11714_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes my father I will do it 
3664_11714_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 The third resumed Savonarola is that you restore to the republic her ancient independence and her former liberty 
3664_11714_000038_000000	train-clean-100	Lorenzo sat up on his bed shaken by a convulsive movement and questioned with his eyes the eyes of the Dominican as though he would find out if he had deceived himself and not heard aright 
3664_11714_000038_000001	train-clean-100	Savonarola repeated the same words 
none	none	Never 
3664_11714_000039_000001	train-clean-100	never exclaimed Lorenzo falling back on his bed and shaking his head never 
3664_11714_000040_000000	train-clean-100	The monk without replying a single word made a step to withdraw 
3664_11714_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 My father my father said the dying man do not leave me thus have pity on me 
3664_11714_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 Have pity on Florence said the monk 
3664_11714_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 But my father cried Lorenzo Florence is free Florence is happy 
none	none	Florence is a slave Florence is poor cried Savonarola poor in genius poor in money and poor in courage poor in genius because after you Lorenzo will come your son Piero poor in money because from the funds of the republic you have kept up the magnificence of your family and the credit of your business houses poor in courage because you have robbed the rightful magistrates of the authority which was constitutionally theirs and diverted the citizens from the double path of military and civil life wherein before they were enervated by your luxuries they had displayed the virtues of the ancients and therefore when the day shall dawn which is not far distant continued the monk his eyes fixed and glowing as if he were reading in the future whereon the barbarians shall descend from the mountains the walls of our towns like those of Jericho shall fall at the blast of their trumpets And do you desire that I should yield up on my deathbed the power that has made the glory of my whole life cried Lorenzo dei Medici
3664_11714_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 It is not I who desire it it is the Lord replied Savonarola coldly 
3664_11714_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 Impossible impossible murmured Lorenzo 
none	none	Very well then die as you have lived cried the monk in the midst of your courtiers and flatterers let them ruin your soul as they have ruined your body And at these words the austere Dominican without listening to the cries of the dying man left the room as he had entered it with face and step unaltered far above human things he seemed to soar a spirit already detached from the earth At the cry which broke from Lorenzo dei Medici when he saw him disappear Ermolao Poliziano and Pico delta Mirandola who had heard all returned into the room and found their friend convulsively clutching in his arms a magnificent crucifix which he had just taken down from the bed head In vain did they try to reassure him with friendly words Lorenzo the Magnificent only replied with sobs and one hour after the scene which we have just related his lips clinging to the feet of the Christ he breathed his last in the arms of these three men of whom the most fortunate though all three were young was not destined to survive him more than two years Since his death was to bring about many calamities says Niccolo Macchiavelli it was the will of Heaven to show this by omens only too certain the dome of the church of Santa Regarata was struck by lightning and Roderigo Borgia was elected pope CHAPTER I Towards the end of the fifteenth century that is to say at the epoch when our history opens the Piazza of saint Peter s at Rome was far from presenting so noble an aspect as that which is offered in our own day to anyone who approaches it by the Piazza dei Rusticucci In fact the Basilica of Constantine existed no longer while that of Michael Angelo the masterpiece of thirty popes which cost the labour of three centuries and the expense of two hundred and sixty millions existed not yet The ancient edifice which had lasted for eleven hundred and forty five years had been threatening to fall in about fourteen forty and Nicholas V artistic forerunner of Julius II and Leo X had had it pulled down together with the temple of Probus Anicius which adjoined it In their place he had had the foundations of a new temple laid by the architects Rossellini and Battista Alberti but some years later after the death of Nicholas V Paul II the Venetian had not been able to give more than five thousand crowns to continue the project of his predecessor and thus the building was arrested when it had scarcely risen above the ground and presented the appearance of a still born edifice even sadder than that of a ruin As to the piazza itself it had not yet as the reader will understand from the foregoing explanation either the fine colonnade of Bernini or the dancing fountains or that Egyptian obelisk which according to Pliny was set up by the Pharaoh at Heliopolis and transferred to Rome by Caligula who set it up in Nero s Circus where it remained till fifteen eighty six Now as Nero s Circus was situated on the very ground where saint Peter s now stands and the base of this obelisk covered the actual site where the vestry now is it looked like a gigantic needle shooting up from the middle of truncated columns walls of unequal height and half carved stones On the right of this building a ruin from its cradle arose the Vatican a splendid Tower of Babel to which all the celebrated architects of the Roman school contributed their work for a thousand years at this epoch the two magnificent chapels did not exist nor the twelve great halls the two and twenty courts the thirty staircases and the two thousand bedchambers for Pope Sixtus V the sublime swineherd who did so many things in a five years reign had not yet been able to add the immense building which on the eastern side towers above the court of saint Damasius still it was truly the old sacred edifice with its venerable associations in which Charlemagne received hospitality when he was crowned emperor by Pope Leo III All the same on the ninth of August fourteen ninety two the whole of Rome from the People s Gate to the Coliseum and from the Baths of Diocletian to the castle of Sant Angelo seemed to have made an appointment on this piazza the multitude thronging it was so great as to overflow into all the neighbouring streets which started from this centre like the rays of a star The crowds of people looking like a motley moving carpet were climbing up into the basilica grouping themselves upon the stones hanging on the columns standing up against the walls they entered by the doors of houses and reappeared at the windows so numerous and so densely packed that one might have said each window was walled up with heads Now all this multitude had its eyes fixed on one single point in the Vatican for in the Vatican was the Conclave and as Innocent VIII had been dead for sixteen days the Conclave was in the act of electing a pope Rome is the town of elections since her foundation down to our own day that is to say in the course of nearly twenty six centuries she has constantly elected her kings consuls tribunes emperors and popes thus Rome during the days of Conclave appears to be attacked by a strange fever which drives everyone to the Vatican or to Monte Cavallo according as the scarlet robed assembly is held in one or the other of these two palaces it is in fact because the raising up of a new pontiff is a great event for everybody for according to the average established in the period between saint Peter and Gregory XVI every pope lasts about eight years and these eight years according to the character of the man who is elected are a period either of tranquillity or of disorder of justice or of venality of peace or of war Never perhaps since the day when the first successor of saint Peter took his seat on the pontifical throne until the interregnum which now occurred had so great an agitation been shown as there was at this moment when as we have shown all these people were thronging on the Piazza of saint Peter and in the streets which led to it It is true that this was not without reason for Innocent VIII who was called the father of his people because he had added to his subjects eight sons and the same number of daughters had as we have said after living a life of self indulgence just died after a death struggle during which if the journal of Stefano Infessura may be believed two hundred and twenty murders were committed in the streets of Rome The authority had then devolved in the customary way upon the Cardinal Camerlengo who during the interregnum had sovereign powers but as he had been obliged to fulfil all the duties of his office that is to get money coined in his name and bearing his arms to take the fisherman s ring from the finger of the dead pope to dress shave and paint him to have the corpse embalmed to lower the coffin after nine days obsequies into the provisional niche where the last deceased pope has to remain until his successor comes to take his place and consign him to his final tomb lastly as he had been obliged to wall up the door of the Conclave and the window of the balcony from which the pontifical election is proclaimed he had not had a single moment for busying himself with the police so that the assassinations had continued in goodly fashion and there were loud cries for an energetic hand which should make all these swords and all these daggers retire into their sheaths Now the eyes of this multitude were fixed as we have said upon the Vatican and particularly upon one chimney from which would come the first signal when suddenly at the moment of the Ave Maria that is to say at the hour when the day begins to decline great cries went up from all the crowd mixed with bursts of laughter a discordant murmur of threats and raillery the cause being that they had just perceived at the top of the chimney a thin smoke which seemed like a light cloud to go up perpendicularly into the sky This smoke announced that Rome was still without a master and that the world still had no pope for this was the smoke of the voting tickets which were being burned a proof that the cardinals had not yet come to an agreement Scarcely had this smoke appeared to vanish almost immediately when all the innumerable crowd knowing well that there was nothing else to wait for and that all was said and done until ten o clock the next morning the time when the cardinals had their first voting went off in a tumult of noisy joking just as they would after the last rocket of a firework display so that at the end of one minute nobody was there where a quarter of an hour before there had been an excited crowd except a few curious laggards who living in the neighbourhood or on the very piazza itself were less in a hurry than the rest to get back to their homes again little by little these last groups insensibly diminished for half past nine had just struck and at this hour the streets of Rome began already to be far from safe then after these groups followed some solitary passer by hurrying his steps one after another the doors were closed one after another the windows were darkened at last when ten o clock struck with the single exception of one window in the Vatican where a lamp might be seen keeping obstinate vigil all the houses piazzas and streets were plunged in the deepest obscurity At this moment a man wrapped in a cloak stood up like a ghost against one of the columns of the uncompleted basilica and gliding slowly and carefully among the stones which were lying about round the foundations of the new church advanced as far as the fountain which formed the centre of the piazza erected in the very place where the obelisk is now set up of which we have spoken already when he reached this spot he stopped doubly concealed by the darkness of the night and by the shade of the monument and after looking around him to see if he were really alone drew his sword and with its point rapping three times on the pavement of the piazza each time made the sparks fly This signal for signal it was was not lost the last lamp which still kept vigil in the Vatican went out and at the same instant an object thrown out of the window fell a few paces off from the young man in the cloak he guided by the silvery sound it had made in touching the flags lost no time in laying his hands upon it in spite of the darkness and when he had it in his possession hurried quickly away Thus the unknown walked without turning round half way along the Borgo Vecchio but there he turned to the right and took a street at the other end of which was set up a Madonna with a lamp he approached the light and drew from his pocket the object he had picked up which was nothing else than a Roman crown piece but this crown unscrewed and in a cavity hollowed in its thickness enclosed a letter which the man to whom it was addressed began to read at the risk of being recognised so great was his haste to know what it contained We say at the risk of being recognised for in his eagerness the recipient of this nocturnal missive had thrown back the hood of his cloak and as his head was wholly within the luminous circle cast by the lamp it was easy to distinguish in the light the head of a handsome young man of about five or six and twenty dressed in a purple doublet slashed at the shoulder and elbow to let the shirt come through and wearing on his head a cap of the same colour with a long black feather falling to his shoulder It is true that he did not stand there long for scarcely had he finished the letter or rather the note which he had just received in so strange and mysterious a manner when he replaced it in its silver receptacle and readjusting his cloak so as to hide all the lower part of his face resumed his walk with a rapid step crossed Borgo San Spirito and took the street of the Longara which he followed as far as the church of Regina Coeli When he arrived at this place he gave three rapid knocks on the door of a house of good appearance which immediately opened then slowly mounting the stairs he entered a room where two women were awaiting him with an impatience so unconcealed that both as they saw him exclaimed together Well Francesco what news Good news my mother good my sister replied the young man kissing the one and giving his hand to the other Our father has gained three votes to day but he still needs six to have the majority Then is there no means of buying them cried the elder of the two women while the younger instead of speaking asked him with a look Certainly my mother certainly replied the young man and it is just about that that my father has been thinking He is giving Cardinal Orsini his palace at Rome and his two castles of Monticello and Soriano to Cardinal Colanna his abbey of Subiaca he gives Cardinal Sant Angelo the bishopric of Porto with the furniture and cellar to the Cardinal of Parma the town of Nepi to the Cardinal of Genoa the church of Santa Maria in Via Lata and lastly to Cardinal Savelli the church of Santa Maria Maggiore and the town of Civita Castellana as to Cardinal Ascanio Sforza he knows already that the day before yesterday we sent to his house four mules laden with silver and plate and out of this treasure he has engaged to give five thousand ducats to the Cardinal Patriarch of Venice But how shall we get the others to know the intentions of Roderigo asked the elder of the two women My father has provided for everything and proposes an easy method you know my mother with what sort of ceremonial the cardinals dinner is carried in Yes on a litter in a large basket with the arms of the cardinal for whom the meal is prepared My father has bribed the bishop who examines it to morrow is a feast day to the Cardinals Orsini Colonna Savelli Sant Angelo and the Cardinals of Parma and of Genoa chickens will be sent for hot meat and each chicken will contain a deed of gift duly drawn up made by me in my father s name of the houses palaces or churches which are destined for each Capital said the elder of the two women now I am certain all will go well And by the grace of God added the younger with a strangely mocking smile our father will be pope Oh it will be a fine day for us cried Francesco And for Christendom replied his sister with a still more ironical expression Lucrezia Lucrezia said the mother you do not deserve the happiness which is coming to us What does that matter if it comes all the same Besides you know the proverb mother Large families are blessed of the Lord and still more so our family which is so patriarchal At the same time she cast on her brother a look so wanton that the young man blushed under it but as at the moment he had to think of other things than his illicit loves he ordered that four servants should be awakened and while they were getting armed to accompany him he drew up and signed the six deeds of gift which were to be carried the next day to the cardinals for not wishing to be seen at their houses he thought he would profit by the night time to carry them himself to certain persons in his confidence who would have them passed in as had been arranged at the dinner hour Then when the deeds were quite ready and the servants also Francesco went out with them leaving the two women to dream golden dreams of their future greatness From the first dawn of day the people hurried anew as ardent and interested as on the evening before to the Piazza of the Vatican where at the ordinary time that is at ten o clock in the morning the smoke rose again as usual evoking laughter and murmuring as it announced that none of the cardinals had secured the majority A report however began to be spread about that the chances were divided between three candidates who were Roderigo Borgia Giuliano delta Rovera and Ascanio Sforza for the people as yet knew nothing of the four mules laden with plate and silver which had been led to Sforza s house by reason of which he had given up his own votes to his rival In the midst of the agitation excited in the crowd by this new report a solemn chanting was heard it proceeded from a procession led by the Cardinal Camerlengo with the object of obtaining from Heaven the speedy election of a pope this procession starting from the church of Ara Coeli at the Capitol was to make stations before the principal Madonnas and the most frequented churches As soon as the silver crucifix was perceived which went in front the most profound silence prevailed and everyone fell on his knees thus a supreme calm followed the tumult and uproar which had been heard a few minutes before and which at each appearance of the smoke had assumed a more threatening character there was a shrewd suspicion that the procession as well as having a religious end in view had a political object also and that its influence was intended to be as great on earth as in heaven In any case if such had been the design of the Cardinal Camerlengo he had not deceived himself and the effect was what he desired when the procession had gone past the laughing and joking continued but the cries and threats had completely ceased The whole day passed thus for in Rome nobody works You are either a cardinal or a lacquey and you live nobody knows how The crowd was still extremely numerous when towards two o clock in the afternoon another procession which had quite as much power of provoking noise as the first of imposing silence traversed in its turn the Piazza of saint Peter s this was the dinner procession The people received it with the usual bursts of laughter without suspecting for all their irreverence that this procession more efficacious than the former had just settled the election of the new pope The hour of the Ave Maria came as on the evening before but as on the evening before the waiting of the whole day was lost for as half past eight struck the daily smoke reappeared at the top of the chimney But when at the same moment rumours which came from the inside of the Vatican were spread abroad announcing that in all probability the election would take place the next day the good people preserved their patience Besides it had been very hot that day and they were so broken with fatigue and roasted by the sun these dwellers in shade and idleness that they had no strength left to complain The morning of the next day which was the eleventh of August fourteen ninety two arose stormy and dark this did not hinder the multitude from thronging the piazzas streets doors houses churches Moreover this disposition of the weather was a real blessing from Heaven for if there were heat at least there would be no sun Towards nine o clock threatening storm clouds were heaped up over all the Trastevere but to this crowd what mattered rain lightning or thunder They were preoccupied with a concern of a very different nature they were waiting for their pope a promise had been made them for to day and it could be seen by the manner of all that if the day should pass without any election taking place the end of it might very well be a riot therefore in proportion as the time advanced the agitation grew greater Nine o clock half past nine a quarter to ten struck without anything happening to confirm or destroy their hopes At last the first stroke of ten was heard all eyes turned towards the chimney ten o clock struck slowly each stroke vibrating in the heart of the multitude At last the tenth stroke trembled then vanished shuddering into space and a great cry breaking simultaneously from a hundred thousand breasts followed the silence Non v e fumo There is no smoke In other words We have a pope At this moment the rain began to fall but no one paid any attention to it so great were the transports of joy and impatience among all the people At last a little stone was detached from the walled window which gave on the balcony and upon which all eyes were fixed a general shout saluted its fall little by little the aperture grew larger and in a few minutes it was large enough to allow a man to come out on the balcony The Cardinal Ascanio Sforza appeared but at the moment when he was on the point of coming out frightened by the rain and the lightning he hesitated an instant and finally drew back immediately the multitude in their turn broke out like a tempest into cries curses howls threatening to tear down the Vatican and to go and seek their pope themselves At this noise Cardinal Sforza more terrified by the popular storm than by the storm in the heavens advanced on the balcony and between two thunderclaps in a moment of silence astonishing to anyone who had just heard the clamour that went before made the following proclamation I announce to you a great joy the most Eminent and most Reverend Signor Roderigo Lenzuolo Borgia Archbishop of Valencia Cardinal Deacon of San Nicolao in Carcere Vice Chancellor of the Church has now been elected Pope and has assumed the name of Alexander VI The news of this nomination was received with strange joy Roderigo Borgia had the reputation of a dissolute man it is true but libertinism had mounted the throne with Sixtus IV and Innocent VIII so that for the Romans there was nothing new in the singular situation of a pope with a mistress and five children The great thing for the moment was that the power fell into strong hands and it was more important for the tranquillity of Rome that the new pope inherited the sword of saint Paul than that he inherited the keys of saint Peter And so in the feasts that were given on this occasion the dominant character was much more warlike than religious and would have appeared rather to suit with the election of some young conqueror than the exaltation of an old pontiff there was no limit to the pleasantries and prophetic epigrams on the name of Alexander which for the second time seemed to promise the Romans the empire of the world and the same evening in the midst of brilliant illuminations and bonfires which seemed to turn the town into a lake of flame the following epigram was read amid the acclamation of the people Rome under Caesar s rule in ancient story At home and o er the world victorious trod But Alexander still extends his glory Caesar was man but Alexander God As to the new pope scarcely had he completed the formalities of etiquette which his exaltation imposed upon him and paid to each man the price of his simony when from the height of the Vatican he cast his eyes upon Europe a vast political game of chess which he cherished the hope of directing at the will of his own genius CHAPTER II The world had now arrived at one of those supreme moments of history when every thing is transformed between the end of one period and the beginning of another in the East Turkey in the South Spain in the West France and in the North German all were going to assume together with the title of great Powers that influence which they were destined to exert in the future over the secondary States Accordingly we too with Alexander VI will cast a rapid glance over them and see what were their respective situations in regard to Italy which they all coveted as a prize Constantine Palaeologos Dragozes besieged by three hundred thousand Turks after having appealed in vain for aid to the whole of Christendom had not been willing to survive the loss of his empire and had been found in the midst of the dead close to the Tophana Gate and on the thirtieth of May fourteen fifty three Mahomet II had made his entry into Constantinople where after a reign which had earned for him the surname of Fatile or the Conqueror he had died leaving two sons the elder of whom had ascended the throne under the name of Bajazet II The accession of the new sultan however had not taken place with the tranquillity which his right as elder brother and his father s choice of him should have promised His younger brother D jem better known under the name of Zizimeh had argued that whereas he was born in the purple that is born during the reign of Mahomet Bajazet was born prior to his epoch and was therefore the son of a private individual This was rather a poor trick but where force is all and right is naught it was good enough to stir up a war The two brothers each at the head of an army met accordingly in Asia in fourteen eighty two D jem was defeated after a seven hours fight and pursued by his brother who gave him no time to rally his army he was obliged to embark from Cilicia and took refuge in Rhodes where he implored the protection of the Knights of saint John They not daring to give him an asylum in their island so near to Asia sent him to France where they had him carefully guarded in one of their commanderies in spite of the urgency of Cait Bey Sultan of Egypt who having revolted against Bajazet desired to have the young prince in his army to give his rebellion the appearance of legitimate warfare The same demand moreover with the same political object had been made successively by Mathias Corvinus King of Hungary by Ferdinand King of Aragon and Sicily and by Ferdinand King of Naples On his side Bajazet who knew all the importance of such a rival if he once allied himself with any one of the princes with whom he was at war had sent ambassadors to Charles VIII offering if he would consent to keep D jem with him to give him a considerable pension and to give to France the sovereignty of the Holy Land so soon as Jerusalem should be conquered by the Sultan of Egypt The King of France had accepted these terms But then Innocent VIII had intervened and in his turn had claimed D jem ostensibly to give support by the claims of the refugee to a crusade which he was preaching against the Turks but in reality to appropriate the pension of forty thousand ducats to be given by Bajazet to any one of the Christian princes who would undertake to be his brother s gaoler Charles VIII had not dared to refuse to the spiritual head of Christendom a request supported by such holy reasons and therefore D jem had quitted France accompanied by the Grand Master d Aubusson under whose direct charge he was but his guardian had consented for the sake of a cardinal s hat to yield up his prisoner Thus on the thirteenth of March fourteen eighty nine the unhappy young man cynosure of so many interested eyes made his solemn entry into Rome mounted on a superb horse clothed in a magnificent oriental costume between the Prior of Auvergne nephew of the Grand Master d Aubusson and Francesco Cibo the son of the pope After this he had remained there and Bajazet faithful to promises which it was so much his interest to fulfil had punctually paid to the sovereign pontiff a pension of forty thousand ducats So much for Turkey Ferdinand and Isabella were reigning in Spain and were laying the foundations of that vast power which was destined five and twenty years later to make Charles V declare that the sun never set on his dominions In fact these two sovereigns on whom history has bestowed the name of Catholic had reconquered in succession nearly all Spain and driven the Moors out of Granada their last entrenchment while two men of genius Bartolome Diaz and Christopher Columbus had succeeded much to the profit of Spain the one in recovering a lost world the other in conquering a world yet unknown They had accordingly thanks to their victories in the ancient world and their discoveries in the new acquired an influence at the court of Rome which had never been enjoyed by any of their predecessors So much for Spain In France Charles VIII had succeeded his father Louis XI on the thirtieth of August fourteen eighty three Louis by dint of executions had tranquillised his kingdom and smoothed the way for a child who ascended the throne under the regency of a woman And the regency had been a glorious one and had put down the pretensions of princes of the blood put an end to civil wars and united to the crown all that yet remained of the great independent fiefs The result was that at the epoch where we now are here was Charles VIII about twenty two years of age a prince if we are to believe La Tremouille little of body but great of heart a child if we are to believe Commines only now making his first flight from the nest destitute of both sense and money feeble in person full of self will and consorting rather with fools than with the wise lastly if we are to believe Guicciardini who was an Italian might well have brought a somewhat partial judgment to bear upon the subject a young man of little wit concerning the actions of men but carried away by an ardent desire for rule and the acquisition of glory a desire based far more on his shallow character and impetuosity than on any consciousness of genius he was an enemy to all fatigue and all business and when he tried to give his attention to it he showed himself always totally wanting in prudence and judgment If anything in him appeared at first sight to be worthy of praise on a closer inspection it was found to be something nearer akin to vice than to virtue He was liberal it is true but without thought with no measure and no discrimination He was sometimes inflexible in will but this was through obstinacy rather than a constant mind and what his flatterers called goodness deserved far more the name of insensibility to injuries or poverty of spirit As to his physical appearance if we are to believe the same author it was still less admirable and answered marvellously to his weakness of mind and character He was small with a large head a short thick neck broad chest and high shoulders his thighs and legs were long and thin and as his face also was ugly and was only redeemed by the dignity and force of his glance and all his limbs were disproportionate with one another he had rather the appearance of a monster than a man Such was he whom Fortune was destined to make a conqueror for whom Heaven was reserving more glory than he had power to carry So much for France The Imperial throne was occupied by Frederic III who had been rightly named the Peaceful not for the reason that he had always maintained peace but because having constantly been beaten he had always been forced to make it The first proof he had given of this very philosophical forbearance was during his journey to Rome whither he betook himself to be consecrated In crossing the Apennines he was attacked by brigands They robbed him but he made no pursuit And so encouraged by example and by the impunity of lesser thieves the greater ones soon took part in the robberies Amurath seized part of Hungary Mathias Corvinus took Lower Austria and Frederic consoled himself for these usurpations by repeating the maxim Forgetfulness is the best cure for the losses we suffer At the time we have now reached he had just after a reign of fifty three years affianced his son Maximilian to Marie of Burgundy and had put under the ban of the Empire his son in law Albert of Bavaria who laid claim to the ownership of the Tyrol He was therefore too full of his family affairs to be troubled about Italy Besides he was busy looking for a motto for the house of Austria an occupation of the highest importance for a man of the character of Frederic III This motto which Charles V was destined almost to render true was at last discovered to the great joy of the old emperor who judging that he had nothing more to do on earth after he had given this last proof of sagacity died on the nineteenth of August fourteen ninety three leaving the empire to his son Maximilian This motto was simply founded on the five vowels a e i o u the initial letters of these five words AUSTRIAE EST IMPERARE ORBI UNIVERSO This means It is the destiny of Austria to rule over the whole world So much for Germany Now that we have cast a glance over the four nations which were on the way as we said before to become European Powers let us turn our attention to those secondary States which formed a circle more contiguous to Rome and whose business it was to serve as armour so to speak to the spiritual queen of the world should it please any of these political giants whom we have described to make encroachments with a view to an attack on the seas or the mountains the Adriatic Gulf or the Alps the Mediterranean or the Apennines These were the kingdom of Naples the duchy of Milan the magnificent republic of Florence and the most serene republic of Venice The kingdom of Naples was in the hands of the old Ferdinand whose birth was not only illegitimate but probably also well within the prohibited degrees His father Alfonso of Aragon received his crown from Giovanna of Naples who had adopted him as her successor But since in the fear of having no heir the queen on her deathbed had named two instead of one Alfonso had to sustain his rights against Rene The two aspirants for some time disputed the crown At last the house of Aragon carried the day over the house of Anjou and in the course of the year fourteen forty two Alfonso definitely secured his seat on the throne Of this sort were the claims of the defeated rival which we shall see Charles VIII maintaining later on Ferdinand had neither the courage nor the genius of his father and yet he triumphed over his enemies one after another he had two rivals both for superior in merit to him self The one was his nephew the Count of Viana who basing his claim on his uncle s shameful birth commanded the whole Aragonese party the other was Duke John of Calabria who commanded the whole Angevin party Still he managed to hold the two apart and to keep himself on the throne by dint of his prudence which often verged upon duplicity He had a cultivated mind and had studied the sciences above all law He was of middle height with a large handsome head his brow open and admirably framed in beautiful white hair which fell nearly down to his shoulders Moreover though he had rarely exercised his physical strength in arms this strength was so great that one day when he happened to be on the square of the Mercato Nuovo at Naples he seized by the horns a bull that had escaped and stopped him short in spite of all the efforts the animal made to escape from his hands Now the election of Alexander had caused him great uneasiness and in spite of his usual prudence he had not been able to restrain himself from saying before the bearer of the news that not only did he fail to rejoice in this election but also that he did not think that any Christian could rejoice in it seeing that Borgia having always been a bad man would certainly make a bad pope To this he added that even were the choice an excellent one and such as would please everybody else it would be none the less fatal to the house of Aragon although Roderigo was born her subject and owed to her the origin and progress of his fortunes for wherever reasons of state come in the ties of blood and parentage are soon forgotten and a fortiori relations arising from the obligations of nationality Thus one may see that Ferdinand judged Alexander VI with his usual perspicacity this however did not hinder him as we shall soon perceive from being the first to contract an alliance with him The duchy of Milan belonged nominally to John Galeazzo grandson of Francesco Sforza who had seized it by violence on the twenty sixth of February fourteen fifty and bequeathed it to his son Galeazzo Maria father of the young prince now reigning we say nominally because the real master of the Milanese was at this period not the legitimate heir who was supposed to possess it but his uncle Ludovico surnamed il Moro because of the mulberry tree which he bore in his arms After being exiled with his two brothers Philip who died of poison in fourteen seventy nine and Ascanio who became the cardinal he returned to Milan some days after the assassination of Galeazzo Maria which took place on the twenty sixth of December fourteen seventy six in saint Stephen s Church and assumed the regency for the young duke who at that time was only eight years old From now onward even after his nephew had reached the age of two and twenty Ludovico continued to rule and according to all probabilities was destined to rule a long time yet for some days after the poor young man had shown a desire to take the reins himself he had fallen sick and it was said and not in a whisper that he had taken one of those slow but mortal poisons of which princes made so frequent a use at this period that even when a malady was natural a cause was always sought connected with some great man s interests However it may have been Ludovico had relegated his nephew now too weak to busy himself henceforward with the affairs of his duchy to the castle of Pavia where he lay and languished under the eyes of his wife Isabella daughter of King Ferdinand of Naples As to Ludovico he was an ambitious man full of courage and astuteness familiar with the sword and with poison which he used alternately according to the occasion without feeling any repugnance or any predilection for either of them but quite decided to be his nephew s heir whether he died or lived Florence although she had preserved the name of a republic had little by little lost all her liberties and belonged in fact if not by right to Piero dei Medici to whom she had been bequeathed as a paternal legacy by Lorenzo as we have seen at the risk of his soul s salvation The son unfortunately was far from having the genius of his father he was handsome it is true whereas Lorenzo on the contrary was remarkably ugly he had an agreeable musical voice whereas Lorenzo had always spoken through his nose he was instructed in Latin and Greek his conversation was pleasant and easy and he improvised verses almost as well as the so called Magnificent but he was both ignorant of political affairs and haughtily insolent in his behaviour to those who had made them their study Added to this he was an ardent lover of pleasure passionately addicted to women incessantly occupied with bodily exercises that should make him shine in their eyes above all with tennis a game at which he very highly excelled he promised himself that when the period of mourning was fast he would occupy the attention not only of Florence but of the whole of Italy by the splendour of his courts and the renown of his fetes Piero dei Medici had at any rate formed this plan but Heaven decreed otherwise As to the most serene republic of Venice whose doge was Agostino Barbarigo she had attained at the time we have reached to her highest degree of power and splendour From Cadiz to the Palus Maeotis there was no port that was not open to her thousand ships she possessed in Italy beyond the coastline of the canals and the ancient duchy of Venice the provinces of Bergamo Brescia Crema Verona Vicenza and Padua she owned the marches of Treviso which comprehend the districts of Feltre Belluno Cadore Polesella of Rovigo and the principality of Ravenna she also owned the Friuli except Aquileia Istria except Trieste she owned on the east side of the Gulf Zara Spalatra and the shore of Albania in the Ionian Sea the islands of Zante and Corfu in Greece Lepanto and Patras in the Morea Morone Corone Neapolis and Argos lastly in the Archipelago besides several little towns and stations on the coast she owned Candia and the kingdom of Cyprus Thus from the mouth of the Po to the eastern extremity of the Mediterranean the most serene republic was mistress of the whole coastline and Italy and Greece seemed to be mere suburbs of Venice In the intervals of space left free between Naples Milan Florence and Venice petty tyrants had arisen who exercised an absolute sovereignty over their territories thus the Colonnas were at Ostia and at Nettuna the Montefeltri at Urbino the Manfredi at Faenza the Bentivogli at Bologna the Malatesta family at Rimini the Vitelli at Citta di Castello the Baglioni at Perugia the Orsini at Vicovaro and the princes of Este at Ferrara Finally in the centre of this immense circle composed of great Powers of secondary States and of little tyrannies Rome was set on high the most exalted yet the weakest of all without influence without lands without an army without gold It was the concern of the new pope to secure all this let us see therefore what manner of man was this Alexander VI for undertaking and accomplishing such a project CHAPTER III RODERIGO LENZUOLO was born at Valencia in Spain in fourteen thirty or fourteen thirty one and on his mother s side was descended as some writers declare of a family of royal blood which had cast its eyes on the tiara only after cherishing hopes of the crowns of Aragon and Valencia Roderigo from his infancy had shown signs of a marvellous quickness of mind and as he grew older he exhibited an intelligence extremely apt for the study of sciences especially law and jurisprudence the result was that his first distinctions were gained in the law a profession wherein he soon made a great reputation by his ability in the discussion of the most thorny cases All the same he was not slow to leave this career and abandoned it quite suddenly for the military profession which his father had followed but after various actions which served to display his presence of mind and courage he was as much disgusted with this profession as with the other and since it happened that at the very time he began to feel this disgust his father died leaving a considerable fortune he resolved to do no more work but to live according to his own fancies and caprices About this time he became the lover of a widow who had two daughters The widow dying Roderigo took the girls under his protection put one into a convent and as the other was one of the loveliest women imaginable made her his mistress This was the notorious Rosa Vanozza by whom he had five children Francesco Caesar Lucrezia and Goffredo the name of the fifth is unknown Roderigo retired from public affairs was given up entirely to the affections of a lover and a father when he heard that his uncle who loved him like a son had been elected pope under the name of Calixtus III But the young man was at this time so much a lover that love imposed silence on ambition and indeed he was almost terrified at the exaltation of his uncle which was no doubt destined to force him once more into public life Consequently instead of hurrying to Rome as anyone else in his place would have done he was content to indite to His Holiness a letter in which he begged for the continuation of his favours and wished him a long and happy reign This reserve on the part of one of his relatives contrasted with the ambitious schemes which beset the new pope at every step struck Calixtus III in a singular way he knew the stuff that was in young Roderigo and at a time when he was besieged on all sides by mediocrities this powerful nature holding modestly aside gained new grandeur in his eyes so he replied instantly to Roderigo that on the receipt of his letter he must quit Spain for Italy Valencia for Rome This letter uprooted Roderigo from the centre of happiness he had created for himself and where he might perhaps have slumbered on like an ordinary man if fortune had not thus interposed to drag him forcibly away Roderigo was happy Roderigo was rich the evil passions which were natural to him had been if not extinguished at least lulled he was frightened himself at the idea of changing the quiet life he was leading for the ambitious agitated career that was promised him and instead of obeying his uncle he delayed the preparations for departure hoping that Calixtus would forget him It was not so two months after he received the letter from the pope there arrived at Valencia a prelate from Rome the bearer of Roderigo s nomination to a benefice worth twenty thousand ducats a year and also a positive order to the holder of the post to come and take possession of his charge as soon as possible Holding back was no longer feasible so Roderigo obeyed but as he did not wish to be separated from the source whence had sprung eight years of happiness Rosa Vanozza also left Spain and while he was going to Rome she betook herself to Venice accompanied by two confidential servants and under the protection of a Spanish gentleman named Manuel Melchior Fortune kept the promises she had made to Roderigo the pope received him as a son and made him successively Archbishop of Valencia Cardinal Deacon and Vice Chancellor To all these favours Calixtus added a revenue of twenty thousand ducats so that at the age of scarcely thirty five Roderigo found himself the equal of a prince in riches and power Roderigo had had some reluctance about accepting the cardinalship which kept him fast at Rome and would have preferred to be General of the Church a position which would have allowed him more liberty for seeing his mistress and his family but his uncle Calixtus made him reckon with the possibility of being his successor some day and from that moment the idea of being the supreme head of kings and nations took such hold of Roderigo that he no longer had any end in view but that which his uncle had made him entertain From that day forward there began to grow up in the young cardinal that talent for hypocrisy which made of him the most perfect incarnation of the devil that has perhaps ever existed and Roderigo was no longer the same man with words of repentance and humility on his lips his head bowed as though he were bearing the weight of his past sins disparaging the riches which he had acquired and which according to him were the wealth of the poor and ought to return to the poor he passed his life in churches monasteries and hospitals acquiring his historian tells us even in the eyes of his enemies the reputation of a Solomon for wisdom of a Job for patience and of a very Moses for his promulgation of the word of God Rosa Vanozza was the only person in the world who could appreciate the value of this pious cardinal s conversion It proved a lucky thing for Roderiga that he had assumed this pious attitude for his protector died after a reign of three years three months and nineteen days and he was now sustained by his own merit alone against the numerous enemies he had made by his rapid rise to fortune so during the whole of the reign of Pius II he lived always apart from public affairs and only reappeared in the days of Sixtus IV who made him the gift of the abbacy of Subiaco and sent him in the capacity of ambassador to the kings of Aragon and Portugal On his return which took place during the pontificate of Innocent VIII he decided to fetch his family at last to Rome thither they came escorted by Don Manuel Melchior who from that moment passed as the husband of Rosa Vanozza and took the name of Count Ferdinand of Castile The Cardinal Roderigo received the noble Spaniard as a countryman and a friend and he who expected to lead a most retired life engaged a house in the street of the Lungara near the church of Regina Coeli on the banks of the Tiber There it was that after passing the day in prayers and pious works Cardinal Roderigo used to repair each evening and lay aside his mask And it was said though nobody could prove it that in this house infamous scenes passed Report said the dissipations were of so dissolute a character that their equals had never been seen in Rome With a view to checking the rumours that began to spread abroad Roderigo sent Caesar to study at Pisa and married Lucrezia to a young gentleman of Aragon thus there only remained at home Rosa Vanozza and her two sons such was the state of things when Innocent VIII died and Roderigo Borgia was proclaimed pope We have seen by what means the nomination was effected and so the five cardinals who had taken no part in this simony namely the Cardinals of Naples Sierra Portugal Santa Maria in Porticu and saint Peter in Vinculis protested loudly against this election which they treated as a piece of jobbery but Roderigo had none the less however it was done secured his majority Roderigo was none the less the two hundred and sixtieth successor of saint Peter Alexander VI however though he had arrived at his object did not dare throw off at first the mask which the Cardinal Bargia had worn so long although when he was apprised of his election he could not dissimulate his joy indeed on hearing the favourable result of the scrutiny he lifted his hands to heaven and cried in the accents of satisfied ambition Am I then pope Am I then Christ s vicar Am I then the keystone of the Christian world Yes holy father replied Cardinal Ascanio Sforza the same who had sold to Roderigo the nine votes that were at his disposal at the Conclave for four mules laden with silver and we hope by your election to give glory to God repose to the Church and joy to Christendom seeing that you have been chosen by the Almighty Himself as the most worthy among all your brethren But in the short interval occupied by this reply the new pope had already assumed the papal authority and in a humble voice and with hands crossed upon his breast he spoke We hope that God will grant us His powerful aid in spite of our weakness and that He will do for us that which He did for the apostle when aforetime He put into his hands the keys of heaven and entrusted to him the government of the Church a government which without the aid of God would prove too heavy a burden for mortal man but God promised that His Spirit should direct him God will do the same I trust for us and for your part we fear not lest any of you fail in that holy obedience which is due unto the head of the Church even as the flock of Christ was bidden to follow the prince of the apostles Having spoken these words Alexander donned the pontifical robes and through the windows of the Vatican had strips of paper thrown out on which his name was written in Latin These blown by the wind seemed to convey to the whole world the news of the great event which was about to change the face of Italy The same day couriers started for all the courts of Europe Caesar Borgia learned the news of his father s election at the University of Pisa where he was a student His ambition had sometimes dreamed of such good fortune yet his joy was little short of madness He was then a young man about twenty two or twenty four years of age skilful in all bodily exercises and especially in fencing he could ride barebacked the most fiery steeds could cut off the head of a bull at a single sword stroke moreover he was arrogant jealous and insincere According to Tammasi he was great among the godless as his brother Francesco was good among the great As to his face even contemporary authors have left utterly different descriptions for same have painted him as a monster of ugliness while others on the contrary extol his beauty This contradiction is due to the fact that at certain times of the year and especially in the spring his face was covered with an eruption which so long as it lasted made him an object of horror and disgust while all the rest of the year he was the sombre black haired cavalier with pale skin and tawny beard whom Raphael shows us in the fine portrait he made of him And historians both chroniclers and painters agree as to his fixed and powerful gaze behind which burned a ceaseless flame giving to his face something infernal and superhuman Such was the man whose fortune was to fulfil all his desires He had taken for his motto Aut Caesar aut nihil Caesar or nothing Caesar posted to Rome with certain of his friends and scarcely was he recognised at the gates of the city when the deference shown to him gave instant proof of the change in his fortunes at the Vatican the respect was twice as great mighty men bowed down before him as before one mightier than themselves And so in his impatience he stayed not to visit his mother or any other member of his family but went straight to the pope to kiss his feet and as the pope had been forewarned of his coming he awaited him in the midst of a brilliant and numerous assemblage of cardinals with the three other brothers standing behind him His Holiness received Caesar with a gracious countenance still he did not allow himself any demonstration of his paternal love but bending towards him kissed him on the forehead and inquired how he was and how he had fared on his journey Caesar replied that he was wonderfully well and altogether at the service of His Holiness that as to the journey the trifling inconveniences and short fatigue had been compensated and far more than compensated by the joy which he felt in being able to adore upon the papal throne a pope who was so worthy At these words leaving Caesar still on his knees and reseating himself for he had risen from his seat to embrace him the pope assumed a grave and composed expression of face and spoke as follows loud enough to be heard by all and slowly enough for everyone present to be able to ponder and retain in his memory even the least of his words We are convinced Caesar that you are peculiarly rejoiced in beholding us on this sublime height so far above our deserts whereto it has pleased the Divine goodness to exalt us This joy of yours is first of all our due because of the love we have always borne you and which we bear you still and in the second place is prompted by your own personal interest since henceforth you may feel sure of receiving from our pontifical hand those benefits which your own good works shall deserve But if your joy and this we say to you as we have even now said to your brothers if your joy is founded on ought else than this you are very greatly mistaken Caesar and you will find yourself sadly deceived Perhaps we have been ambitious we confess this humbly before the face of all men passionately and immoderately ambitious to attain to the dignity of sovereign pontiff and to reach this end we have followed every path that is open to human industry but we have acted thus vowing an inward vow that when once we had reached our goal we would follow no other path but that which conduces best to the service of God and to the advancement of the Holy See so that the glorious memory of the deeds that we shall do may efface the shameful recollection of the deeds we have already done Thus shall we let us hope leave to those who follow us a track where upon if they find not the footsteps of a saint they may at least tread in the path of a true pontiff God who has furthered the means claims at our hands the fruits and we desire to discharge to the full this mighty debt that we have incurred to Him and accordingly we refuse to arouse by any deceit the stern rigour of His judgments One sole hindrance could have power to shake our good intentions and that might happen should we feel too keen an interest in your fortunes Therefore are we armed beforehand against our love and therefore have we prayed to God beforehand that we stumble not because of you for in the path of favouritism a pope cannot slip without a fall and cannot fall without injury and dishonour to the Holy See Even to the end of our life we shall deplore the faults which have brought this experience home to us and may it please God that our uncle Calixtus of blessed memory bear not this day in purgatory the burden of our sins more heavy alas than his own Ah he was rich in every virtue he was full of good intentions but he loved too much his own people and among them he loved me chief And so he suffered this love to lead him blindly astray all this love that he bore to his kindred who to him were too truly flesh of his flesh so that he heaped upon the heads of a few persons only and those perhaps the least worthy benefits which would more fittingly have rewarded the deserts of many In truth he bestowed upon our house treasures that should never have been amassed at the expense of the poor or else should have been turned to a better purpose He severed from the ecclesiastical State already weak and poor the duchy of Spoleto and other wealthy properties that he might make them fiefs to us he confided to our weak hands the vice chancellorship the vice prefecture of Rome the generalship of the Church and all the other most important offices which instead of being monopolised by us should have been conferred on those who were most meritorious Moreover there were persons who were raised on our recommendation to posts of great dignity although they had no claims but such as our undue partiality accorded them others were left out with no reason for their failure except the jealousy excited in us by their virtues To rob Ferdinand of Aragon of the kingdom of Naples Calixtus kindled a terrible war which by a happy issue only served to increase our fortune and by an unfortunate issue must have brought shame and disaster upon the Holy See Lastly by allowing himself to be governed by men who sacrificed public good to their private interests he inflicted an injury not only upon the pontifical throne and his own reputation but what is far worse far more deadly upon his own conscience And yet O wise judgments of God hard and incessantly though he toiled to establish our fortunes scarcely had he left empty that supreme seat which we occupy to day when we were cast down from the pinnacle whereon we had climbed abandoned to the fury of the rabble and the vindictive hatred of the Roman barons who chose to feel offended by our goodness to their enemies Thus not only we tell you Caesar not only did we plunge headlong from the summit of our grandeur losing the worldly goods and dignities which our uncle had heaped at our feet but for very peril of our life we were condemned to a voluntary exile we and our friends and in this way only did we contrive to escape the storm which our too good fortune had stirred up against us Now this is a plain proof that God mocks at men s designs when they are bad ones How great an error is it for any pope to devote more care to the welfare of a house which cannot last more than a few years than to the glory of the Church which will last for ever What utter folly for any public man whose position is not inherited and cannot be bequeathed to his posterity to support the edifice of his grandeur on any other basis than the noblest virtue practised for the general good and to suppose that he can ensure the continuance of his own fortune otherwise than by taking all precautions against sudden whirlwinds which are want to arise in the midst of a calm and to blow up the storm clouds I mean the host of enemies Now any one of these enemies who does his worst can cause injuries far more powerful than any help that is at all likely to come from a hundred friends and their lying promises If you and your brothers walk in the path of virtue which we shall now open for you every wish of your heart shall be instantly accomplished but if you take the other path if you have ever hoped that our affection will wink at disorderly life then you will very soon find out that we are truly pope Father of the Church not father of the family that vicar of Christ as we are we shall act as we deem best for Christendom and not as you deem best for your own private good And now that we have come to a thorough understanding Caesar receive our pontifical blessing And with these words Alexander VI rose up laid his hands upon his son s head for Caesar was still kneeling and then retired into his apartments without inviting him to follow The young man remained awhile stupefied at this discourse so utterly unexpected so utterly destructive at one fell blow to his most cherished hopes He rose giddy and staggering like a drunken man and at once leaving the Vatican hurried to his mother whom he had forgotten before but sought now in his despair Rosa Vanozza possessed all the vices and all the virtues of a Spanish courtesan her devotion to the Virgin amounted to superstition her fondness for her children to weakness and her love for Roderigo to sensuality In the depth of her heart she relied on the influence she had been able to exercise over him for nearly thirty years and like a snake she knew how to envelop him in her coils when the fascination of her glance had lost its power Rosa knew of old the profound hypocrisy of her lover and thus she was in no difficulty about reassuring Caesar Lucrezia was with her mother when Caesar arrived the two young people exchanged a lover like kiss beneath her very eyes and before he left Caesar had made an appointment for the same evening with Lucrezia who was now living apart from her husband to whom Roderigo paid a pension in her palace of the Via del Pelegrino opposite the Campo dei Fiori and there enjoying perfect liberty In the evening at the hour fixed Caesar appeared at Lucrezia s but he found there his brother Francesco The two young men had never been friends Still as their tastes were very different hatred with Francesco was only the fear of the deer for the hunter but with Caesar it was the desire for vengeance and that lust for blood which lurks perpetually in the heart of a tiger The two brothers none the less embraced one from general kindly feeling the other from hypocrisy but at first sight of one another the sentiment of a double rivalry first in their father s and then in their sister s good graces had sent the blood mantling to the cheek of Francesco and called a deadly pallor into Caesar s So the two young men sat on each resolved not to be the first to leave when all at once there was a knock at the door and a rival was announced before whom both of them were bound to give way it was their father Rosa Vanazza was quite right in comforting Caesar Indeed although Alexander VI had repudiated the abuses of nepotism he understood very well the part that was to be played for his benefit by his sons and his daughter for he knew he could always count on Lucrezia and Caesar if not on Francesco and Goffredo In these matters the sister was quite worthy of her brother Lucrezia was wanton in imagination godless by nature ambitious and designing she had a craving for pleasure admiration honours money jewels gorgeous stuffs and magnificent mansions A true Spaniard beneath her golden tresses a courtesan beneath her frank looks she carried the head of a Raphael Madonna and concealed the heart of a Messalina She was dear to Roderigo both as daughter and as mistress and he saw himself reflected in her as in a magic mirror every passion and every vice Lucrezia and Caesar were accordingly the best beloved of his heart and the three composed that diabolical trio which for eleven years occupied the pontifical throne like a mocking parody of the heavenly Trinity Nothing occurred at first to give the lie to Alexander s professions of principle in the discourse he addressed to Caesar and the first year of his pontificate exceeded all the hopes of Rome at the time of his election He arranged for the provision of stores in the public granaries with such liberality that within the memory of man there had never been such astonishing abundance and with a view to extending the general prosperity to the lowest class he organised numerous doles to be paid out of his private fortune which made it possible for the very poor to participate in the general banquet from which they had been excluded for long enough The safety of the city was secured from the very first days of his accession by the establishment of a strong and vigilant police force and a tribunal consisting of four magistrates of irreproachable character empowered to prosecute all nocturnal crimes which during the last pontificate had been so common that their very numbers made impunity certain these judges from the first showed a severity which neither the rank nor the purse of the culprit could modify This presented such a great contrast to the corruption of the last reign in the course of which the vice chamberlain one day remarked in public when certain people were complaining of the venality of justice God wills not that a sinner die but that he live and pay that the capital of the Christian world felt for one brief moment restored to the happy days of the papacy So at the end of a year Alexander VI had reconquered that spiritual credit so to speak which his predecessors lost His political credit was still to be established if he was to carry out the first part of his gigantic scheme To arrive at this he must employ two agencies alliances and conquests His plan was to begin with alliances The gentleman of Aragon who had married Lucrezia when she was only the daughter of Cardinal Roderigo Borgia was not a man powerful enough either by birth and fortune or by intellect to enter with any sort of effect into the plots and plans of Alexander VI the separation was therefore changed into a divorce and Lucrezia Borgia was now free to remarry Alexander opened up two negotiations at the same time he needed an ally to keep a watch on the policy of the neighbouring States John Sforza grandson of Alexander Sforza brother of the great Francis I Duke of Milan was lord of Pesaro the geographical situation of this place on the coast on the way between Florence and Venice was wonderfully convenient for his purpose so Alexander first cast an eye upon him and as the interest of both parties was evidently the same it came about that John Sforza was very soon Lucrezia s second husband At the same time overtures had been made to Alfonso of Aragon heir presumptive to the crown of Naples to arrange a marriage between Dana Sancia his illegitimate daughter and Goffreda the pope s third son but as the old Ferdinand wanted to make the best bargain he could out of it he dragged on the negotiations as long as possible urging that the two children were not of marriageable age and so highly honoured as he felt in such a prospective alliance there was no hurry about the engagement Matters stopped at this point to the great annoyance of Alexander VI who saw through this excuse and understood that the postponement was nothing more or less than a refusal Accordingly Alexander and Ferdinand remained in statu quo equals in the political game both on the watch till events should declare for one or other The turn of fortune was for Alexander Italy though tranquil was instinctively conscious that her calm was nothing but the lull which goes before a storm She was too rich and too happy to escape the envy of other nations As yet the plains of Pisa had not been reduced to marsh lands by the combined negligence and jealousy of the Florentine Republic neither had the rich country that lay around Rome been converted into a barren desert by the wars of the Colonna and Orsini families not yet had the Marquis of Marignan razed to the ground a hundred and twenty villages in the republic of Siena alone and though the Maremma was unhealthy it was not yet a poisonous marsh it is a fact that Flavio Blando writing in fourteen fifty describes Ostia as being merely less flourishing than in the days of the Romans when she had numbered fifty thousand inhabitants whereas now in our own day there are barely thirty in all The Italian peasants were perhaps the most blest on the face of the earth instead of living scattered about the country in solitary fashion they lived in villages that were enclosed by walls as a protection for their harvests animals and farm implements their houses at any rate those that yet stand prove that they lived in much more comfortable and beautiful surroundings than the ordinary townsman of our day Further there was a community of interests and many people collected together in the fortified villages with the result that little by little they attained to an importance never acquired by the boorish French peasants or the German serfs they bore arms they had a common treasury they elected their own magistrates and whenever they went out to fight it was to save their common country Also commerce was no less flourishing than agriculture Italy at this period was rich in industries silk wool hemp fur alum sulphur bitumen those products which the Italian soil could not bring forth were imported from the Black Sea from Egypt from Spain from France and often returned whence they came their worth doubled by labour and fine workmanship The rich man brought his merchandise the poor his industry the one was sure of finding workmen the other was sure of finding work Art also was by no means behindhand Dante Giotto Brunelleschi and Donatello were dead but Ariosto Raphael Bramante and Michael Angelo were now living Rome Florence and Naples had inherited the masterpieces of antiquity and the manuscripts of AEschylus Sophocles and Euripides had come thanks to the conquest of Mahomet II to rejoin the statue of Xanthippus and the works of Phidias and Praxiteles The principal sovereigns of Italy had come to understand when they let their eyes dwell upon the fat harvests the wealthy villages the flourishing manufactories and the marvellous churches and then compared with them the poor and rude nations of fighting men who surrounded them on all sides that some day or other they were destined to become for other countries what America was for Spain a vast gold mine for them to work In consequence of this a league offensive and defensive had been signed about fourteen eighty by Naples Milan Florence and Ferrara prepared to take a stand against enemies within or without in Italy or outside Ludovico Sforza who was more than anyone else interested in maintaining this league because he was nearest to France whence the storm seemed to threaten saw in the new pope s election means not only of strengthening the league but of making its power and unity conspicuous in the sight of Europe CHAPTER IV On the occasion of each new election to the papacy it is the custom for all the Christian States to send a solemn embassy to Rome to renew their oath of allegiance to the Holy Father Ludovico Sforza conceived the idea that the ambassadors of the four Powers should unite and make their entry into Rome on the same day appointing one of their envoys viz the representative of the King of Naples to be spokesman for all four Unluckily this plan did not agree with the magnificent projects of Piero dei Medici That proud youth who had been appointed ambassador of the Florentine Republic had seen in the mission entrusted to him by his fellow citizens the means of making a brilliant display of his own wealth From the day of his nomination onwards his palace was constantly filled with tailors jewellers and merchants of priceless stuffs magnificent clothes had been made for him embroidered with precious stones which he had selected from the family treasures All his jewels perhaps the richest in Italy were distributed about the liveries of his pages and one of them his favourite was to wear a collar of pearls valued by itself at one hundred thousand ducats or almost a million of our francs In his party the Bishop of Arezzo Gentile who had once been Lorenzo dei Medici s tutor was elected as second ambassador and it was his duty to speak Now Gentile who had prepared his speech counted on his eloquence to charm the ear quite as much as Piero counted on his riches to dazzle the eye But the eloquence of Gentile would be lost completely if nobody was to speak but the ambassador of the King of Naples and the magnificence of Piero dei Medici would never be noticed at all if he went to Rome mixed up with all the other ambassadors These two important interests compromised by the Duke of Milan s proposition changed the whole face of Italy Ludovico Sforza had already made sure of Ferdinand s promise to conform to the plan he had invented when the old king at the solicitation of Piero suddenly drew back Sforza found out how this change had come about and learned that it was Piero s influence that had overmastered his own He could not disentangle the real motives that had promised the change and imagined there was some secret league against himself he attributed the changed political programme to the death of Lorenzo dei Medici But whatever its cause might be it was evidently prejudicial to his own interests Florence Milan s old ally was abandoning her for Naples He resolved to throw a counter weight into the scales so betraying to Alexander the policy of Piero and Ferdinand he proposed to form a defensive and offensive alliance with him and admit the republic of Venice Duke Hercules III of Ferrara was also to be summoned to pronounce for one or other of the two leagues Alexander VI wounded by Ferdinand s treatment of himself accepted Ludovico Sforza s proposition and an Act of Confederation was signed on the twenty second of April fourteen ninety three by which the new allies pledged themselves to set on foot for the maintenance of the public peace an army of twenty thousand horse and six thousand infantry Ferdinand was frightened when he beheld the formation of this league but he thought he could neutralise its effects by depriving Ludovico Sforza of his regency which he had already kept beyond the proper time though as yet he was not strictly an usurper Although the young Galeazzo his nephew had reached the age of two and twenty Ludovico Sforza none the less continued regent Now Ferdinand definitely proposed to the Duke of Milan that he should resign the sovereign power into the hands of his nephew on pain of being declared an usurper This was a bold stroke but there was a risk of inciting Ludovico Sforza to start one of those political plots that he was so familiar with never recoiling from any situation however dangerous it might be This was exactly what happened Sforza uneasy about his duchy resolved to threaten Ferdinand s kingdom Nothing could be easier he knew the warlike notions of Charles VIII and the pretensions of the house of France to the kingdom of Naples He sent two ambassadors to invite the young king to claim the rights of Anjou usurped by Aragon and with a view to reconciling Charles to so distant and hazardous an expedition offered him a free and friendly passage through his own States Such a proposition was welcome to Charles VIII as we might suppose from our knowledge of his character a magnificent prospect was opened to him as by an enchanter what Ludovica Sforza was offering him was virtually the command of the Mediterranean the protectorship of the whole of Italy it was an open road through Naples and Venice that well might lead to the conquest of Turkey or the Holy Land if he ever had the fancy to avenge the disasters of Nicapolis and Mansourah So the proposition was accepted and a secret alliance was signed with Count Charles di Belgiojasa and the Count of Cajazza acting for Ludovica Sforza and the Bishop of saint Malo and Seneschal de Beaucaire for Charles VIII By this treaty it was agreed That the King of France should attempt the conquest of the kingdom of Naples That the Duke of Milan should grant a passage to the King of France through his territories and accompany him with five hundred lances That the Duke of Milan should permit the King of France to send out as many ships of war as he pleased from Genoa Lastly that the Duke of Milan should lend the King of France two hundred thousand ducats payable when he started On his side Charles VIII agreed To defend the personal authority of Ludowico Sforza over the duchy of Milan against anyone who might attempt to turn him out To keep two hundred French lances always in readiness to help the house of Sforza at Asti a town belonging to the Duke of Orleans by the inheritance of his mother Valentina Visconti Lastly to hand over to his ally the principality of Tarentum immediately after the conquest of Naples was effected This treaty was scarcely concluded when Charles VIII who exaggerated its advantages began to dream of freeing himself from every let or hindrance to the expedition Precautions were necessary for his relations with the great Powers were far from being what he could have wished Indeed Henry VII had disembarked at Calais with a formidable army and was threatening France with another invasion Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain if they had not assisted at the fall of the house of Anjou had at any rate helped the Aragon party with men and money Lastly the war with the emperor acquired a fresh impetus when Charles VIII sent back Margaret of Burgundy to her father Maximilian and contracted a marriage with Anne of Brittany By the treaty of Etaples on the third of November fourteen ninety two Henry VII cancelled the alliance with the King of the Romans and pledged himself not to follow his conquests This cost Charles VIII seven hundred forty five thousand gold crowns and the expenses of the war with England By the treaty of Barcelona dated the nineteenth of January fourteen ninety three Ferdinand the Catholic and Isabella agreed never to grant aid to their cousin Ferdinand of Naples and never to put obstacles in the way of the French king in Italy This cost Charles VIII Perpignan Roussillon and the Cerdagne which had all been given to Louis XI as a hostage for the sum of three hundred thousand ducats by John of Aragon but at the time agreed upon Louis XI would not give them up for the money for the old fox knew very well how important were these doors to the Pyrenees and proposed in case of war to keep them shut Lastly by the treaty of Senlis dated the twenty third of May fourteen ninety three Maximilian granted a gracious pardon to France for the insult her king had offered him It cost Charles VIII the counties of Burgundy Artois Charalais and the seigniory of Noyers which had come to him as Margaret s dowry and also the towns of Aire Hesdin and Bethune which he promised to deliver up to Philip of Austria on the day he came of age By dint of all these sacrifices the young king made peace with his neighbours and could set on foot the enterprise that Ludavico Sforza had proposed We have already explained that the project came into Sforza s mind when his plan about the deputation was refused and that the refusal was due to Piero dei Medici s desire to make an exhibition of his magnificent jewels and Gentile s desire to make his speech Thus the vanity of a tutor and the pride of his scholar together combined to agitate the civilized world from the Gulf of Tarentum to the Pyrenees Alexander VI was in the very centre of the impending earthquake and before Italy had any idea that the earliest shocks were at hand he had profited by the perturbed preoccupation of other people to give the lie to that famous speech we have reported He created cardinal John Borgia a nephew who during the last pontificate had been elected Archbishop of Montreal and Governor of Rome This promotion caused no discontent because of John s antecedents and Alexander encouraged by the success of this promised to Caesar Borgia the archbishopric of Valencia a benefice he had himself enjoyed before his elevation to the papacy But here the difficulty arose on the side of the recipient The young man full blooded with all the vices and natural instincts of a captain of condottieri had very great trouble in assuming even the appearance of a Churchman s virtue but as he knew from his own father s mouth that the highest secular dignities were reserved for his elder brother he decided to take what he could get for fear of getting nothing but his hatred for Francesco grew stronger for from henceforth he was doubly his rival both in love and ambition Suddenly Alexander beheld the old King Ferdinand returning to his side and at the very moment when he least expected it The pope was too clever a politician to accept a reconciliation without finding out the cause of it he soon learned what plots were hatching at the French court against the kingdom of Naples and the whole situation was explained Now it was his turn to impose conditions He demanded the completion of a marriage between Goffreda his third son and Dada Sancia Alfonso s illegitimate daughter He demanded that she should bring her husband as dowry the principality of Squillace and the county of Cariati with an income of ten thousand ducats and the office of protonotary one of the seven great crown offices which are independent of royal control He demanded for his eldest son whom Ferdinand the Catholic had just made Duke of Gandia the principality of Tricarico the counties of Chiaramonte Lauria and Carinola an income of twelve thousand ducats and the first of the seven great offices which should fall vacant He demanded that Virginio Orsini his ambassador at the Neapolitan court should be given a third great office viz that of Constable the most important of them all Lastly he demanded that Giuliano delta Rovere one of the five cardinals who had opposed his election and was now taking refuge at Ostia where the oak whence he took his name and bearings is still to be seen carved on all the walls should be driven out of that town and the town itself given over to him In exchange he merely pledged himself never to withdraw from the house of Aragon the investiture of the kingdom of Naples accorded by his predecessors Ferdinand was paying somewhat dearly for a simple promise but on the keeping of this promise the legitimacy of his power wholly depended For the kingdom of Naples was a fief of the Holy See and to the pope alone belonged the right of pronouncing on the justice of each competitor s pretensions the continuance of this investiture was therefore of the highest conceivable importance to Aragon just at the time when Anjou was rising up with an army at her back to dispossess her For a year after he mounted the papal throne Alexander VI had made great strides as we see in the extension of his temporal power In his own hands he held to be sure only the least in size of the Italian territories but by the marriage of his daughter Lucrezia with the lord of Pesaro he was stretching out one hand as far as Venice while by the marriage of the Prince of Squillace with Dona Sancia and the territories conceded to the Duke of Sandia he was touching with the other hand the boundary of Calabria When this treaty so advantageous for himself was duly signed he made Caesar Cardinal of Santa Maria Novella for Caesar was always complaining of being left out in the distribution of his father s favours Only as there was as yet no precedent in Church history for a bastard s donning the scarlet the pope hunted up four false witnesses who declared that Caesar was the son of Count Ferdinand of Castile who was as we know that valuable person Don Manuel Melchior and who played the father s part with just as much solemnity as he had played the husband s The wedding of the two bastards was most splendid rich with the double pomp of Church and King As the pope had settled that the young bridal pair should live near him Caesar Borgia the new cardinal undertook to manage the ceremony of their entry into Rome and the reception and Lucrezia who enjoyed at her father s side an amount of favour hitherto unheard of at the papal court desired on her part to contribute all the splendour she had it in her power to add He therefore went to receive the young people with a stately and magnificent escort of lords and cardinals while she awaited them attended by the loveliest and noblest ladies of Rome in one of the halls of the Vatican A throne was there prepared for the pope and at his feet were cushions for Lucrezia and Dona Sancia Thus writes Tommaso Tommasi by the look of the assembly and the sort of conversation that went on for hours you would suppose you were present at some magnificent and voluptuous royal audience of ancient Assyria rather than at the severe consistory of a Roman pontiff whose solemn duty it is to exhibit in every act the sanctity of the name he bears But continues the same historian if the Eve of Pentecost was spent in such worthy functions the celebrations of the coming of the Holy Ghost on the following day were no less decorous and becoming to the spirit of the Church for thus writes the master of the ceremonies in his journal The pope made his entry into the Church of the Holy Apostles and beside him on the marble steps of the pulpit where the canons of saint Peter are wont to chant the Epistle and Gospel sat Lucrezia his daughter and Sancia his son s wife round about them a disgrace to the Church and a public scandal were grouped a number of other Roman ladies far more fit to dwell in Messalina s city than in saint Peter s So at Rome and Naples did men slumber while ruin was at hand so did they waste their time and squander their money in a vain display of pride and this was going on while the French thoroughly alive were busy laying hands upon the torches with which they would presently set Italy on fire Indeed the designs of Charles VIII for conquest were no longer for anybody a matter of doubt The young king had sent an embassy to the various Italian States composed of Perrone dei Baschi Brigonnet d Aubigny and the president of the Provencal Parliament The mission of this embassy was to demand from the Italian princes their company operation in recovering the rights of the crown of Naples for the house of Anjou The embassy first approached the Venetians demanding aid and counsel for the king their master But the Venetians faithful to their political tradition which had gained for them the sobriquet of the Jews of Christendom replied that they were not in a position to give any aid to the young king so long as they had to keep ceaselessly on guard against the Turks that as to advice it would be too great a presumption in them to give advice to a prince who was surrounded by such experienced generals and such able ministers Perrone dei Baschi when he found he could get no other answer next made for Florence Piero dei Medici received him at a grand council for he summoned on this occasion not only the seventy but also the gonfalonieri who had sat for the last thirty four years in the Signoria The French ambassador put forward his proposal that the republic should permit their army to pass through her States and pledge herself in that case to supply for ready money all the necessary victual and fodder The magnificent republic replied that if Charles VIII had been marching against the Turks instead of against Ferdinand she would be only too ready to grant everything he wished but being bound to the house of Aragon by a treaty she could not betray her ally by yielding to the demands of the King of France The ambassadors next turned their steps to Siena The poor little republic terrified by the honour of being considered at all replied that it was her desire to preserve a strict neutrality that she was too weak to declare beforehand either for or against such mighty rivals for she would naturally be obliged to join the stronger party Furnished with this reply which had at least the merit of frankness the French envoys proceeded to Rome and were conducted into the pope s presence where they demanded the investiture of the kingdom of Naples for their king Alexander VI replied that as his predecessors had granted this investiture to the house of Aragon he could not take it away unless it were first established that the house of Anjou had a better claim than the house that was to be dispossessed Then he represented to Perrone dei Baschi that as Naples was a fief of the Holy See to the pope alone the choice of her sovereign properly belonged and that in consequence to attack the reigning sovereign was to attack the Church itself The result of the embassy we see was not very promising for Charles VIII so he resolved to rely on his ally Ludovico Sforza alone and to relegate all other questions to the fortunes of war A piece of news that reached him about this time strengthened him in this resolution this was the death of Ferdinand The old king had caught a severe cold and cough on his return from the hunting field and in two days he was at his last gasp On the twenty fifth of January fourteen ninety four he passed away at the age of seventy after a thirty six years reign leaving the throne to his elder son Alfonso who was immediately chosen as his successor Ferdinand never belied his title of the happy ruler His death occurred at the very moment when the fortune of his family was changing The new king Alfonso was not a novice in arms he had already fought successfully against Florence and Venice and had driven the Turks out of Otranto besides he had the name of being as cunning as his father in the tortuous game of politics so much in vogue at the Italian courts He did not despair of counting among his allies the very enemy he was at war with when Charles VIII first put forward his pretensions we mean Bajazet II So he despatched to Bajazet one of his confidential ministers Camillo Pandone to give the Turkish emperor to understand that the expedition to Italy was to the King of France nothing but a blind for approaching the scene of Mahomedan conquests and that if Charles VIII were once at the Adriatic it would only take him a day or two to get across and attack Macedonia from there he could easily go by land to Constantinople Consequently he suggested that Bajazet for the maintenance of their common interests should supply six thousand horse and six thousand infantry he himself would furnish their pay so long as they were in Italy It was settled that Pandone should be joined at Tarentum by Giorgia Bucciarda Alexander VI s envoy who was commissioned by the pope to engage the Turks to help him against the Christians But while he was waiting for Bajazet s reply which might involve a delay of several months Alfonso requested that a meeting might take place between Piero dei Medici the pope and himself to take counsel together about important affairs This meeting was arranged at Vicovaro near Tivoli and the three interested parties duly met on the appointed day The intention of Alfonso who before leaving Naples had settled the disposition of his naval forces and given his brother Frederic the command of a fleet that consisted of thirty six galleys eighteen large and twelve small vessels with injunctions to wait at Livorno and keep a watch on the fleet Charles VIII was getting ready at the port of Genoa was above all things to check with the aid of his allies the progress of operations on land Without counting the contingent he expected his allies to furnish he had at his immediate disposal a hundred squadrons of heavy cavalry twenty men in each and three thousand bowmen and light horse He proposed therefore to advance at once into Lombardy to get up a revolution in favour of his nephew Galeazzo and to drive Ludovico Sforza out of Milan before he could get help from France so that Charles VIII at the very time of crossing the Alps would find an enemy to fight instead of a friend who had promised him a safe passage men and money This was the scheme of a great politician and a bold commander but as everybody had come in pursuit of his own interests regardless of the common agreemnent this plan was very coldly received by Piero dei Medici who was afraid lest in the war he should play only the same poor part he had been threatened with in the affair of the embassy by Alexander VI it was rejected because he reckoned on employing the troops of Alfonso an his own account He reminded the King of Naples of one of the conditions of the investiture he had promised him viz that he should drive out the Cardinal Giuliano delta Rovere from the town of Ostia and give up the town to him according to the stipulation already agreed upon Besides the advantages that had accrued to Virginio Orsini Alexander s favourite from his embassy to Naples had brought upon him the ill will of Prospero and Fabrizio Colonna who owned nearly all the villages round about Rome Now the pope could not endure to live in the midst of such powerful enemies and the most important matter was to deliver him from all of them seeing that it was really of moment that he should be at peace who was the head and soul of the league whereof the others were only the body and limbs Although Alfonso had clearly seen through the motives of Piero s coldness and Alexander had not even given him the trouble of seeking his he was none the less obliged to bow to the will of his allies leaving the one to defend the Apennines against the French and helping the other to shake himself free of his neighbours in the Romagna Consequently he pressed on the siege of Ostia and added to Virginio s forces which already amounted to two hundred men of the papal army a body of his own light horse this little army was to be stationed round about Rome and was to enforce obedience from the Colonnas The rest of his troops Alfonso divided into two parties one he left in the hands of his son Ferdinand with orders to scour the Romagna and worry the petty princes into levying and supporting the contingent they had promised while with the other he himself defended the defiles of the Abruzzi On the twenty third of April at three o clock in the morning Alexander VI was freed from the first and fiercest of his foes Giuliano delta Rovere seeing the impossibility of holding out any longer against Alfonso s troops embarked on a brigantine which was to carry him to Savona From that day forward Virginio Orsini began that famous partisan warfare which reduced the country about Rome to the most pathetic desolation the world has ever seen During all this time Charles VIII was at Lyons not only uncertain as to the route he ought to take for getting into Italy but even beginning to reflect a little on the chances and risks of such an expedition He had found no sympathy anywhere except with Ludovico Sforza so it appeared not unlikely that he would have to fight not the kingdom of Naples alone but the whole of Italy to boot In his preparations for war he had spent almost all the money at his disposal the Lady of Beaujeu and the Duke of Bourbon both condemned his enterprise Briconnet who had advised it did not venture to support it now at last Charles more irresolute than ever had recalled several regiments that had actually started when Cardinal Giuliano delta Rovere driven out of Italy by the pope arrived at Lyons and presented himself before the king The cardinal full of hatred full of hope hastened to Charles and found him on the point of abandoning that enterprise on which as Alexander s enemy delta Rovere rested his whole expectation of vengeance He informed Charles of the quarrelling among his enemies he showed him that each of them was seeking his own ends Piero dei Medici the gratification of his pride the pope the aggrandisement of his house He pointed out that armed fleets were in the ports of Villefranche Marseilles and Genoa and that these armaments would be lost he reminded him that he had sent Pierre d Urfe his grand equerry on in advance to have splendid accommodation prepared in the Spinola and Doria palaces Lastly he urged that ridicule and disgrace would fall on him from every side if he renounced an enterprise so loudly vaunted beforehand for whose successful execution moreover he had been obliged to sign three treaties of peace that were all vexatious enough viz with Henry VII with Maximilian and with Ferdinand the Catholic Giuliano della Rovere had exercised true insight in probing the vanity of the young king and Charles did not hesitate for a single moment He ordered his cousin the Duke of Orleans who later on became Louis XII to take command of the French fleet and bring it to Genoa he despatched a courier to Antoine de Bessay Baron de Tricastel bidding him take to Asti the two thousand Swiss foot soldiers he had levied in the cantons lastly he started himself from Vienne in Dauphine on the twenty third of August fourteen ninety four crossed the Alps by Mont Genevre without encountering a single body of troops to dispute his passage descended into Piedmont and Monferrato both just then governed by women regents the sovereigns of both principalities being children Charles John Aime and William John aged respectively six and eight The two regents appeared before Charles VIII one at Turin one at Casale each at the head of a numerous and brilliant court and both glittering with jewels and precious stones Charles although he quite well knew that for all these friendly demonstrations they were both bound by treaty to his enemy Alfonso of Naples treated them all the same with the greatest politeness and when they made protestations of friendship asked them to let him have a proof of it suggesting that they should lend him the diamonds they were covered with The two regents could do no less than obey the invitation which was really a command They took off necklaces rings and earrings Charles VIII gave them a receipt accurately drawn up and pledged the jewels for twenty thousand ducats Then enriched by this money he resumed his journey and made his way towards Asti The Duke of Orleans held the sovereignty of Asti as we said before and hither came to meet Charles both Ludovico Sforza and his father in law Hercules d Este Duke of Ferrara They brought with them not only the promised troops and money but also a court composed of the loveliest women in Italy The balls fetes and tourneys began with a magnificence surpassing anything that Italy had ever seen before But suddenly they were interrupted by the king s illness This was the first example in Italy of the disease brought by Christopher Columbus from the New World and was called by Italians the French by Frenchmen the Italian disease The probability is that some of Columbus s crew who were at Genoa or thereabouts had already brought over this strange and cruel complaint that counter balanced the gains of the American gold mines The king s indisposition however did not prove so grave as was at first supposed He was cured by the end of a few weeks and proceeded on his way towards Pavia where the young Duke John Galeazzo lay dying He and the King of France were first cousins sons of two sisters of the house of Savoy So Charles VIII was obliged to see him and went to visit him in the castle where he lived more like prisoner than lord He found him half reclining on a couch pale and emaciated some said in consequence of luxurious living others from the effects of a slow but deadly poison But whether or not the poor young man was desirous of pouring out a complaint to Charles he did not dare say a word for his uncle Ludovico Sforza never left the King of France for an instant But at the very moment when Charles VIII was getting up to go the door opened and a young woman appeared and threw herself at the king s feet she was the wife of the unlucky John Galeazzo and came to entreat his cousin to do nothing against her father Alfonso nor against her brother Ferdinand At sight of her Sforza scowled with an anxious and threatening aspect for he knew not what impression might be produced on his ally by this scene But he was soon reassured for Charles replied that he had advanced too far to draw back now and that the glory of his name was at stake as well as the interests of his kingdom and that these two motives were far too important to be sacrificed to any sentiment of pity he might feel however real and deep it might be and was The poor young woman who had based her last hope an this appeal then rose from her knees and threw herself sobbing into her husband s arms Charles VIII and Ludavico Sforza took their leave John Galeazzo was doomed Two days after Charles VIII left for Florence accompanied by his ally but scarcely had they reached Parma when a messenger caught them up and announced to Ludovico that his nephew was just dead Ludovico at once begged Charles to excuse his leaving him to finish the journey alone the interests which called him back to Milan were so important he said that he could not under the circumstances stay away a single day longer As a fact he had to make sure of succeeding the man he had assassinated But Charles VIII continued his road not without some uneasiness The sight of the young prince on his deathbed had moved him deeply for at the bottom of his heart he was convinced that Ludovico Sforza was his murderer and a murderer might very well be a traitor He was going forward into an unfamiliar country with a declared enemy in front of him and a doubtful friend behind he was now at the entrance to the mountains and as his army had no store of provisions and only lived from hand to mouth a forced delay however short would mean famine In front of him was Fivizzano nothing it is true but a village surrounded by walls but beyond Fivizzano lay Sarzano and Pietra Santa both of them considered impregnable fortresses worse than this they were coming into a part of the country that was especially unhealthy in October had no natural product except oil and even procured its own corn from neighbouring provinces it was plain that a whole army might perish there in a few days either from scarcity of food or from the unwholesome air both of which were more disastrous than the impediments offered at every step by the nature of the ground The situation was grave but the pride of Piero dei Medici came once more to the rescue of the fortunes of Charles VIII CHAPTER V PIERO DEI MEDICI had as we may remember undertaken to hold the entrance to Tuscany against the French when however he saw his enemy coming dawn from the Alps he felt less confident about his own strength and demanded help from the pope but scarcely had the rumour of foreign invasion began to spread in the Romagna than the Colonna family declared themselves the French king s men and collecting all their forces seized Ostia and there awaited the coming of the French fleet to offer a passage through Rome The pope therefore instead of sending troops to Florence was obliged to recall all his soldiers to be near the capital the only promise he made to Piero was that if Bajazet should send him the troops that he had been asking for he would despatch that army for him to make use of Piero dei Medici had not yet taken any resolution or formed any plan when he suddenly heard two startling pieces of news A jealous neighbour of his the Marquis of Torderiovo had betrayed to the French the weak side of Fivizzano so that they had taken it by storm and had put its soldiers and inhabitants to the edge of the sword on another side Gilbert of Montpensier who had been lighting up the sea coast so as to keep open the communications between the French army and their fleet had met with a detachment sent by Paolo Orsini to Sarzano to reinforce the garrison there and after an hour s fighting had cut it to pieces No quarter had been granted to any of the prisoners every man the French could get hold of they had massacred This was the first occasion on which the Italians accustomed as they were to the chivalrous contests of the fifteenth century found themselves in contact with savage foreigners who less advanced in civilisation had not yet come to consider war as a clever game but looked upon it as simply a mortal conflict So the news of these two butcheries produced a tremendous sensation at Florence the richest city in Italy and the most prosperous in commerce and in art Every Florentine imagined the French to be like an army of those ancient barbarians who were wont to extinguish fire with blood The prophecies of Savonarola who had predicted the foreign invasion and the destruction that should follow it were recalled to the minds of all and so much perturbation was evinced that Piero dei Medici bent on getting peace at any price forced a decree upon the republic whereby she was to send an embassy to the conqueror and obtained leave resolved as he was to deliver himself in person into the hands of the French monarch to act as one of the ambassadors He accordingly quitted Florence accompanied by four other messengers and on his arrival at Pietra Santa sent to ask from Charles VIII a safe conduct for himself alone The day after he made this request Brigonnet and de Piennes came to fetch him and led him into the presence of Charles VIII Piero dei Medici in spite of his name and influence was in the eyes of the French nobility who considered it a dishonourable thing to concern oneself with art or industry nothing more than a rich merchant with whom it would be absurd to stand upon any very strict ceremony So Charles VIII received him on horseback and addressing him with a haughty air as a master might address a servant demanded whence came this pride of his that made him dispute his entrance into Tuscany Piero dei Medici replied that with the actual consent of Louis XI his father Lorenzo had concluded a treaty of alliance with Ferdinand of Naples that accordingly he had acted in obedience to prior obligations but as he did not wish to push too far his devotion to the house of Aragon or his opposition to France he was ready to do whatever Charles VIII might demand of him The king who had never looked for such humility in his enemy demanded that Sarzano should be given up to him to this Piero dei Medici at once consented Then the conqueror wishing to see how far the ambassador of the magnificent republic would extend his politeness replied that this concession was far from satisfying him and that he still must have the keys of Pietra Santa Pisa Librafatta and Livorno Piero saw no more difficulty about these than about Sarzano and consented on Charles s mere promise by word of mouth to restore the town when he had achieved the conquest of Naples At last Charles VIII seeing that this man who had been sent out to negotiate with him was very easy to manage exacted as a final condition a sine qua non however of his royal protection that the magnificent republic should lend him the sum of two hundred thousand florins Piero found it no harder to dispose of money than of fortresses and replied that his fellow citizens would be happy to render this service to their new ally Then Charles VIII set him on horseback and ordered him to go on in front so as to begin to carry out his promises by yielding up the four fortresses he had insisted on having Piero obeyed and the French army led by the grandson of Cosimo the Great and the son of Lorenzo the Magnificent continued its triumphal march through Tuscany On his arrival at Lucca Piero dei Medici learnt that his concessions to the King of France were making a terrible commotion at Florence The magnificent republic had supposed that what Charles VIII wanted was simply a passage through her territory so when the news came there was a general feeling of discontent which was augmented by the return of the other ambassadors whom Piero had not even consulted when he took action as he did Piero considered it necessary that he should return so he asked Charles s permission to precede him to the capital As he had fulfilled all his promises except the matter of the loan which could not be settled anywhere but at Florence the king saw no objection and the very evening after he quitted the French army Piero returned incognito to his palace in the Via Largo The next day he proposed to present himself before the Signoria but when he arrived at the Piazza del Palazzo Vecchio he perceived the gonfaloniere Jacopo de Nerli coming towards him signalling to him that it was useless to attempt to go farther and pointing out to him the figure of Luca Corsini standing at the gate sword in hand behind him stood guards ordered if need were to dispute his passage Piero dei Medici amazed by an opposition that he was experiencing for the first time in his life did not attempt resistance He went home and wrote to his brother in law Paolo Orsini to come and help him with his gendarmes Unluckily for him his letter was intercepted The Signoria considered that it was an attempt at rebellion They summoned the citizens to their aid they armed hastily sallied forth in crowds and thronged about the piazza of the palace Meanwhile Cardinal Gian dei Medici had mounted on horseback and under the impression that the Orsini were coming to the rescue was riding about the streets of Florence accompanied by his servants and uttering his battle cry Palle Palle But times had changed there was no echo to the cry and when the cardinal reached the Via dei Calizaioli a threatening murmur was the only response and he understood that instead of trying to arouse Florence he had much better get away before the excitement ran too high He promptly retired to his own palace expecting to find there his two brothers Piero and Giuliano But they under the protection of Orsini and his gendarmes had made their escape by the Porto San Gallo The peril was imminent and Gian dei Medici wished to follow their example but wherever he went he was met by a clamour that grew more and more threatening At last as he saw that the danger was constantly increasing he dismounted from his horse and ran into a house that he found standing open This house by a lucky chance communicated with a convent of Franciscans one of the friars lent the fugitive his dress and the cardinal under the protection of this humble incognito contrived at last to get outside Florence and joined his two brothers in the Apennines The same day the Medici were declared traitors and rebels and ambassadors were sent to the King of France They found him at Pisa where he was granting independence to the town which eighty seven years ago had fallen under the rule of the Florentines Charles VIII made no reply to the envoys but merely announced that he was going to march on Florence Such a reply one may easily understand terrified the republic Florence had no time to prepare a defence and no strength in her present state to make one But all the powerful houses assembled and armed their own servants and retainers and awaited the issue intending not to begin hostilities but to defend themselves should the French make an attack It was agreed that if any necessity should arise for taking up arms the bells of the various churches in the town should ring a peal and so serve as a general signal Such a resolution was perhaps of more significant moment in Florence than it could have been in any other town For the palaces that still remain from that period are virtually fortresses and the eternal fights between Guelphs and Ghibellines had familiarised the Tuscan people with street warfare The king appeared an the seventeenth of November in the evening at the gate of San Friano He found there the nobles of Florence clad in their most magnificent apparel accompanied by priests chanting hymns and by a mob who were full of joy at any prospect of change and hoped for a return of liberty after the fall of the Medici Charles VIII stopped for a moment under a sort of gilded canopy that had been prepared for him and replied in a few evasive words to the welcoming speeches which were addressed to him by the Signoria then he asked for his lance he set it in rest and gave the order to enter the town the whole of which he paraded with his army following him with arms erect and then went down to the palace of the Medici which had been prepared for him The next day negotiations commenced but everyone was out of his reckoning The Florentines had received Charles VIII as a guest but he had entered the city as a conqueror So when the deputies of the Signoria spoke of ratifying the treaty of Piero dei Medici the king replied that such a treaty no longer existed as they had banished the man who made it that he had conquered Florence as he proved the night before when he entered lance in hand that he should retain the sovereignty and would make any further decision whenever it pleased him to do so further he would let them know later on whether he would reinstate the Medici or whether he would delegate his authority to the Signoria all they had to do was to come back the next day and he would give them his ultimatum in writing This reply threw Florence into a great state of consternation but the Florentines were confirmed in their resolution of making a stand Charles for his part had been astonished by the great number of the inhabitants not only was every street he had passed through thickly lined with people but every house from garret to basement seemed overflowing with human beings Florence indeed thanks to her rapid increase in population could muster nearly one hundred fifty thousand souls The next day at the appointed hour the deputies made their appearance to meet the king They were again introduced into his presence and the discussion was reopened At last as they were coming to no sort of understanding the royal secretary standing at the foot of the throne upon which Charles viii sat with covered head unfolded a paper and began to read article by article the conditions imposed by the King of France But scarcely had he read a third of the document when the discussion began more hotly than ever before Then Charles VIII said that thus it should be or he would order his trumpets to be sounded Hereupon Piero Capponi secretary to the republic commonly called the Scipio of Florence snatched from the royal secretary s hand the shameful proposal of capitulation and tearing it to pieces exclaimed Very good sire blow your trumpets and we will ring our bells He threw the pieces in the face of the amazed reader and dashed out of the room to give the terrible order that would convert the street of Florence into a battlefield Still against all probabilities this bold answer saved the town The French supposed from such audacious words addressed as they were to men who so far had encountered no single obstacle that the Florentines were possessed of sure resources to them unknown the few prudent men who retained any influence over the king advised him accordingly to abate his pretensions the result was that Charles VIII offered new and more reasonable conditions which were accepted signed by both parties and proclaimed on the twenty sixth of November during mass in the cathedral of Santa Maria Del Fiore These were the conditions The Signoria were to pay to Charles VIII as subsidy the sum of one hundred twenty thousand florins in three instalments The Signoria were to remove the sequestration imposed upon the property of the Medici and to recall the decree that set a price on their heads The Signoria were to engage to pardon the Pisans on condition of their again submitting to the rule of Florence Lastly the Signoria were to recognise the claims of the Duke of Milan over Sarzano and Pietra Santa and these claims thus recognised were to be settled by arbitration In exchange for this the King of France pledged himself to restore the fortresses that had been given up to him either after he had made himself master of the town of Naples or when this war should be ended by a peace or a two years truce or else when for any reason whatsoever he should have quitted Italy Two days after this proclamation Charles VIII much to the joy of the Signoria left Florence and advanced towards Rome by the route of Poggibondi and Siena The pope began to be affected by the general terror he had heard of the massacres of Fivizzano of Lunigiane and of Imola he knew that Piero dei Medici had handed over the Tuscan fortresses that Florence had succumbed and that Catherine Sforza had made terms with the conqueror he saw the broken remnants of the Neapolitan troops pass disheartened through Rome to rally their strength in the Abruzzi and thus he found himself exposed to an enemy who was advancing upon him with the whole of the Romagna under his control from one sea to the other in a line of march extending from Piombina to Ancona It was at this juncture that Alexander VI received his answer from Bajazet II the reason of so long a delay was that the pope s envoy and the Neapolitan ambassador had been stopped by Gian della Rovere the Cardinal Giuliano s brother just as they were disembarking at Sinigaglia They were charged with a verbal answer which was that the sultan at this moment was busied with a triple war first with the Sultan of Egypt secondly with the King of Hungary and thirdly with the Greeks of Macedonia and Epirus and therefore he could not with all the will in the world help His Holiness with armed men But the envoys were accompanied by a favourite of the sultan s bearing a private letter to Alexander VI in which Bajazet offered on certain conditions to help him with money Although as we see the messengers had been stopped on the way the Turkish envoy had all the same found a means of getting his despatch sent to the pope we give it here in all its naivete Bajazet the Sultan son of the Sultan Mahomet II by the grace of God Emperor of Asia and Europe to the Father and Lord of all the Christians Alexander VI Roman pontiff and pope by the will of heavenly Providence first greetings that we owe him and bestow with all our heart We make known to your Highness by the envoy of your Mightiness Giorgio Bucciarda that we have been apprised of your convalescence and received the news thereof with great joy and comfort Among other matters the said Bucciarda has brought us word that the King of France now marching against your Highness has shown a desire to take under his protection our brother D jem who is now under yours a thing which is not only against our will but which would also be the cause of great injury to your Highness and to all Christendom In turning the matter over with your envoy Giorgio we have devised a scheme most conducive to peace and most advantageous and honourable for your Highness at the same time satisfactory to ourselves personally it would be well if our aforesaid brother D jem who being a man is liable to death and who is now in the hands of your Highness should quit this world as soon as possible seeing that his departure a real good to him in his position would be of great use to your Highness and very conducive to your peace while at the same time it would be very agreeable to us your friend If this proposition is favourably received as we hope by your Highness in your desire to be friendly towards us it would be advisable both in the interests of your Highness and for our own satisfaction that it should occur rather sooner than later and by the surest means you might be pleased to employ so that our said brother D jem might pass from the pains of this world into a better and more peaceful life where at last he may find repose If your Highness should adapt this plan and send us the body of our brother We the above named Sultan Bajazet pledge ourselves to send to your Highness wheresoever and by whatsoever hands you please the sum of three hundred thousand ducats With which sum you could purchase some fair domain for your children In order to facilitate this purchase we would be willing while awaiting the issue to place the three hundred thousand ducats in the hands of a third party so that your Highness might be quite certain of receiving the money on an appointed day in return for the despatch of our brother s body Moreover we promise your Highness herewith for your greater satisfaction that never so long as you shall remain on the pontifical throne shall there be any hurt done to the Christians neither by us nor by our servants nor by any of our compatriots of whatsoever kind or condition they may be neither on sea nor on land And for the still further satisfaction of your Highness and in order that no doubt whatever may remain concerning the fulfilment of our promises we have sworn and affirmed in the presence of Bucciarda your envoy by the true God whom we adore and by our holy Gospels that they shall be faithfully kept from the first point unto the last And now for the final and complete assurance of your Highness in order that no doubt may still remain in your heart and that you may be once again and profoundly convinced of our good faith we the aforesaid Sultan Bajazet do swear by the true God who has created the heavens and the earth and all that therein is that we will religiously observe all that has been above said and declared and in the future will do nothing and undertake nothing that may be contrary to the interests of your Highness Given at Constantinople in our palace on the twelfth of September A D fourteen ninety four This letter was the cause of great joy to the Holy Father the aid of four or five thousand Turks would be insufficient under the present circumstances and would only serve to compromise the head of Christendom while the sum of three hundred thousand ducats that is nearly a million francs was good to get in any sort of circumstances It is true that so long as D jem lived Alexander was drawing an income of one hundred eighty thousand livres which as a life annuity represented a capital of nearly two millions but when one needs ready money one ought to be able to make a sacrifice in the way of discount All the same Alexander formed no definite plan resolved on acting as circumstances should indicate But it was a more pressing business to decide how he should behave to the King of France he had never anticipated the success of the French in Italy and we have seen that he laid all the foundations of his family s future grandeur upon his alliance with the house of Aragon But here was this house tattering and a volcano more terrible than her own Vesuvius was threatening to swallow up Naples He must therefore change his policy and attach himself to the victor no easy matter for Charles VIII was bitterly annoyed with the pope for having refused him the investiture and given it to Aragon In consequence he sent Cardinal Francesco Piccolomini as an envoy to the king This choice looked like a mistake at first seeing that the ambassador was a nephew of Pius II who had vigorously opposed the house of Anjou but Alexander in acting thus had a second design which could not be discerned by those around him In fact he had divined that Charles would not be quick to receive his envoy and that in the parleyings to which his unwillingness must give rise Piccolomini would necessarily be brought into contact with the young king s advisers Now besides his ostensible mission to the king Piccalamini had also secret instructions for the more influential among his counsellors These were Briconnet and Philippe de Luxembourg and Piccolomini was authorised to promise a cardinal s hat to each of them The result was just what Alexander had foreseen his envoy could not gain admission to Charles and was obliged to confer with the people about him This was what the pope wished Piccolomini returned to Rome with the king s refusal but with a promise from Briconnet and Philippe de Luxembourg that they would use all their influence with Charles in favour of the Holy Father and prepare him to receive a fresh embassy But the French all this time were advancing and never stopped more than forty eight hours in any town so that it became more and more urgent to get something settled with Charles The king had entered Siena and Viterbo without striking a blow Yves d Alegre and Louis de Ligny had taken over Ostia from the hands of the Colonnas Civita Vecchia and Corneto had opened their gates the Orsini had submitted even Gian Sforza the pope s son in law had retired from the alliance with Aragon Alexander accordingly judged that the moment had came to abandon his ally and sent to Charles the Bishops of Concordia and Terni and his confessor Mansignore Graziano They were charged to renew to Briconnet and Philippe de Luxembourg the promise of the cardinalship and had full powers of negotiation in the name of their master both in case Charles should wish to include Alfonso II in the treaty and in case he should refuse to sign an agreement with any other but the pope alone They found the mind of Charles influenced now by the insinuation of Giuliano della Rovere who himself a witness of the pope s simony pressed the king to summon a council and depose the head of the Church and now by the secret support given him by the Bishops of Mans and saint Malo The end of it was that the king decided to form his own opinion about the matter and settle nothing beforehand and continued this route sending the ambassadors back to the pope with the addition of the Marechal de Gie the Seneschal de Beaucaire and Jean de Gannay first president of the Paris Parliament They were ordered to say to the pope one That the king wished above all things to be admitted into Rome without resistance that on condition of a voluntary frank and loyal admission he would respect the authority of the Holy Father and the privileges of the Church two That the king desired that D jem should be given up to him in order that he might make use of him against the sultan when he should carry the war into Macedonia or Turkey or the Holy Land three That the remaining conditions were so unimportant that they could be brought forward at the first conference The ambassadors added that the French army was now only two days distant from Rome and that in the evening of the day after next Charles would probably arrive in person to demand an answer from His Holiness It was useless to think of parleying with a prince who acted in such expeditious fashion as this Alexander accordingly warned Ferdinand to quit Rome as soon as possible in the interests of his own personal safety But Ferdinand refused to listen to a word and declared that he would not go out at one gate while Charles VIII came in at another His sojourn was not long Two days later about eleven o clock in the morning a sentinel placed on a watch tower at the top of the Castle S Angelo whither the pope had retired cried out that the vanguard of the enemy was visible on the horizon At once Alexander and the Duke of Calabria went up on the terrace which tops the fortress and assured themselves with their own eyes that what the soldier said was true Then and not till then did the duke of Calabria mount on horseback and to use his own words went out at the gate of San Sebastiana at the same moment that the French vanguard halted five hundred feet from the Gate of the People This was on the thirty first of December fourteen ninety four At three in the afternoon the whole army had arrived and the vanguard began their march drums beating ensigns unfurled It was composed says Paolo Giove an eye witness book ii p forty one of his History of Swiss and German soldiers with short tight coats of various colours they were armed with short swords with steel edges like those of the ancient Romans and carried ashen lances ten feet long with straight and sharp iron spikes only one fourth of their number bore halberts instead of lances the spikes cut into the form of an axe and surmounted by a four cornered spike to be used both for cutting like an axe and piercing like a bayonet the first row of each battalion wore helmets and cuirasses which protected the head and chest and when the men were drawn up for battle they presented to the enemy a triple array of iron spikes which they could raise or lower like the spines of a porcupine To each thousand of the soldiery were attached a hundred fusiliers their officers to distinguish them from the men wore lofty plumes on their helmets After the Swiss infantry came the archers of Gascony there were five thousand of them wearing a very simple dress that contrasted with the rich costume of the Swiss soldiers the shortest of whom would have been a head higher than the tallest of the Gascons But they were excellent soldiers full of courage very light and with a special reputation for quickness in stringing and drawing their iron bows Behind them rode the cavalry the flower of the French nobility with their gilded helmets and neck bands their velvet and silk surcoats their swords each of which had its own name their shields each telling of territorial estates and their colours each telling of a lady love Besides defensive arms each man bore a lance in his hand like an Italian gendarme with a solid grooved end and on his saddle bow a quantity of weapons some for cutting and some for thrusting Their horses were large and strong but they had their tails and ears cropped according to the French custom These horses unlike those of the Italian gendarmes wore no caparisons of dressed leather which made them more exposed to attack Every knight was followed by three horses the first ridden by a page in armour like his own the two others by equerries who were called lateral auxiliaries because in a fray they fought to right and left of their chief This troop was not only the most magnificent but the most considerable in the whole army for as there were twenty five hundred knights they formed each with their three followers a total of ten thousand men Five thousand light horse rode next who carried huge wooden bows and shot long arrows from a distance like English archers They were a great help in battle for moving rapidly wherever aid was required they could fly in a moment from one wing to another from the rear to the van then when their quivers were empty could go off at so swift a gallop that neither infantry or heavy cavalry could pursue them Their defensive armour consisted of a helmet and half cuirass some of them carried a short lance as well with which to pin their stricken foe to the ground they all wore long cloaks adorned with shoulder knots and plates of silver whereon the arms of their chief were emblazoned At last came the young king s escort there were four hundred archers among whom a hundred Scots formed a line on each side while two hundred of the most illustrious knights marched on foot beside the prince carrying heavy arms on their shoulders In the midst of this magnificent escort advanced Charles VIII both he and his horse covered with splendid armour an his right and left marched Cardinal Ascanio Sforza the Duke of Milan s brother and Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere of whom we have spoken so often who was afterwards Pope Julius II The Cardinals Colonna and Savelli followed immediately after and behind them came Prospero and Fabrizia Colonna and all the Italian princes and generals who had thrown in their lot with the conqueror and were marching intermingled with the great French lords For a long time the crowd that had collected to see all these foreign soldiers go by a sight so new and strange listened uneasily to a dull sound which got nearer and nearer The earth visibly trembled the glass shook in the windows and behind the king s escort thirty six bronze cannons were seen to advance bumping along as they lay on their gun carriages These cannons were eight feet in length and as their mouths were large enough to hold a man s head it was supposed that each of these terrible machines scarcely known as yet to the Italians weighed nearly six thousand pounds After the cannons came culverins sixteen feet long and then falconets the smallest of which shot balls the size of a grenade This formidable artillery brought up the rear of the procession and formed the hindmost guard of the French army It was six hours since the front guard entered the town and as it was now night and for every six artillery men there was a torch bearer this illumination gave to the objects around a more gloomy character than they would have shown in the sunlight The young king was to take up his quarters in the Palazzo di Venezia and all the artillery was directed towards the plaza and the neighbouring streets The remainder of the army was dispersed about the town The same evening they brought to the king less to do honour to him than to assure him of his safety the keys of Rome and the keys of the Belvedere Garden just the same thing had been done for the Duke of Calabria The pope as we said had retired to the Castle S Angelo with only six cardinals so from the day after his arrival the young king had around him a court of very different brilliance from that of the head of the Church Then arose anew the question of a convocation to prove Alexander s simony and proceed to depose him but the king s chief counsellors gained over as we know pointed out that this was a bad moment to excite a new schism in the Church just when preparations were being made for war against the infidels As this was also the king s private opinion there was not much trouble in persuading him and he made up his mind to treat with His Holiness But the negotiations had scarcely begun when they had to be broken off for the first thing Charles VIII demanded was the surrender of the Castle S Angelo and as the pope saw in this castle his only refuge it was the last thing he chose to give up Twice in his youthful impatience Charles wanted to take by force what he could not get by goodwill and had his cannons directed towards the Holy Father s dwelling place but the pope was unmoved by these demonstrations and obstinate as he was this time it was the French king who gave way This article therefore was set aside and the following conditions were agreed upon That there should be from this day forward between His Majesty the King of France and the Holy Father a sincere friendship and a firm alliance Before the completion of the conquest of the kingdom of Naples the King of France should occupy for the advantage and accommodation of his army the fortresses of Civita Vecchia Terracina and Spoleto Lastly the Cardinal Valentino this was now the name of Caesar Borgia after his archbishopric of Valencia should accompany the king in the capacity of apostolic ambassador really as a hostage These conditions fixed the ceremonial of an interview was arranged The king left the Palazzo di Venezia and went to live in the Vatican At the appointed time he entered by the door of a garden that adjoined the palace while the pope who had not had to quit the Castle S Angelo thanks to a corridor communicating between the two palaces came down into the same garden by another gate The result of this arrangement was that the king the next moment perceived the pope and knelt down but the pope pretended not to see him and the king advancing a few paces knelt a second time as His Holiness was at that moment screened by some masonry this supplied him with another excuse and the king went on with the performance got up again once more advanced several steps and was on the point of kneeling down the third time face to face when the Holy Father at last perceived him and walking towards him as though he would prevent him from kneeling took off his own hat and pressing him to his heart raised him up and tenderly kissed his forehead refusing to cover until the king had put his cap upon his head with the aid of the pope s own hands Then after they had stood for a moment exchanging polite and friendly speeches the king lost no time in praying His Holiness to be so good as to receive into the Sacred College William Bricannet the Bishop of saint Malo As this matter had been agreed upon beforehand by that prelate and His Holiness though the king was not aware of it Alexander was pleased to get credit by promptly granting the request and he instantly ordered one of his attendants to go to the house of his son Cardinal Valentino and fetch a cape and hat Then taking the king by the hand he conducted him into the hall of Papagalli where the ceremony was to take place of the admission of the new cardinal The solemn oath of obedience which was to be taken by Charles to His Holiness as supreme head of the Christian Church was postponed till the following day When that solemn day arrived every person important in Rome noble cleric or soldier assembled around His Holiness Charles on his side made his approach to the Vatican with a splendid following of princes prelates and captains At the threshold of the palace he found four cardinals who had arrived before him two of them placed themselves one on each side of him the two others behind him and all his retinue following they traversed a long line of apartments full of guards and servants and at last arrived in the reception room where the pope was seated on his throne with his son Caesar Borgia behind him On his arrival at the door the King of France began the usual ceremonial and when he had gone on from genuflexions to kissing the feet the hand and the forehead he stood up while the first president of the Parliament of Paris in his turn stepping forward said in a loud voice Very Holy Father behold my king ready to offer to your Holiness that oath of obedience that he owes to you but in France it is customary that he who offers himself as vassal to his lord shall receive in exchange therefor such boons as he may demand His Majesty therefore while he pledges himself for his own part to behave unto your Holiness with a munificence even greater than that wherewith your Holiness shall behave unto him is here to beg urgently that you accord him three favours These favours are first the confirmation of privileges already granted to the king to the queen his wife and to the dauphin his son secondly the investiture for himself and his successors of the kingdom of Naples lastly the surrender to him of the person of the sultan D jem brother of the Turkish emperor At this address the pope was for a moment stupefied for he did not expect these three demands which were moreover made so publicly by Charles that no manner of refusal was possible But quickly recovering his presence of mind he replied to the king that he would willingly confirm the privileges that had been accorded to the house of France by his predecessors that he might therefore consider his first demand granted that the investiture of the kingdom was an affair that required deliberation in a council of cardinals but he would do all he possibly could to induce them to accede to the king s desire lastly he must defer the affair of the sultan s brother till a time more opportune for discussing it with the Sacred College but would venture to say that as this surrender could not fail to be for the good of Christendom as it was demanded for the purpose of assuring further the success of a crusade it would not be his fault if on this point also the king should not be satisfied At this reply Charles bowed his head in sign of satisfaction and the first president stood up uncovered and resumed his discourse as follows Very Holy Father it is an ancient custom among Christian kings especially the Most Christian kings of France to signify through their ambassadors the respect they feel for the Holy See and the sovereign pontiffs whom Divine Providence places thereon but the Most Christian king having felt a desire to visit the tombs of the holy apostles has been pleased to pay this religious debt which he regards as a sacred duty not by ambassadors or by delegates but in his own person This is why Very Holy Father His Majesty the King of France is here to acknowledge you as the true vicar of Christ the legitimate successor of the apostles saint Peter and saint Paul and with promise and vow renders you that filial and respectful devotion which the kings his predecessors have been accustomed to promise and vow devoting himself and all his strength to the service of your Holiness and the interests of the Holy See The pope arose with a joyful heart for this oath so publicly made removed all his fears about a council so inclined from this moment to yield to the King of France anything he might choose to ask he took him by his left hand and made him a short and friendly reply dubbing him the Church s eldest son The ceremony over they left the hall the pope always holding the king s hand in his and in this way they walked as far as the room where the sacred vestments are put off the pope feigned a wish to conduct the king to his own apartments but the king would not suffer this and embracing once more they separated each to retire to his own domicile The king remained eight days longer at the Vatican then returned to the Palazzo San Marco During these eight days all his demands were debated and settled to his satisfaction The Bishop of Mans was made cardinal the investiture of the kingdom of Naples was promised to the conqueror lastly it was agreed that on his departure the King of France should receive from the pope s hand the brother of the Emperor of Constantinople for a sum of one hundred twenty thousand livres But the pope desiring to extend to the utmost the hospitality he had been bestowing invited D jem to dinner on the very day that he was to leave Rome with his new protector When the moment of departure arrived Charles mounted his horse in full armour and with a numerous and brilliant following made his way to the Vatican arrived at the door he dismounted and leaving his escort at the Piazza of saint Peter went up with a few gentlemen only He found His Holiness waiting for him with Cardinal Valentino on his right and on his left D jem who as we said before was dining with him and round the table thirteen cardinals The king at once bending on his knee demanded the pope s benediction and stooped to kiss his feet But this Alexander would not suffer he took him in his arms and with the lips of a father and heart of an enemy kissed him tenderly on his forehead Then the pope introduced the son of Mahomet II who was a fine young man with something noble and regal in his air presenting in his magnificent oriental costume a great contrast in its fashion and amplitude to the narrow severe cut of the Christian apparel D jem advanced to Charles without humility and without pride and like an emperor s son treating with a king kissed his hand and then his shoulder then turning towards the Holy Father he said in Italian which he spoke very well that he entreated he would recommend him to the young king who was prepared to take him under his protection assuring the pontiff that he should never have to repent giving him his liberty and telling Charles that he hoped he might some day be proud of him if after taking Naples he carried out his intention of going on to Greece These words were spoken with so much dignity and at the same time with such gentleness that the King of France loyally and frankly grasped the young sultan s hand as though he were his companion in arms Then Charles took a final farewell of the pope and went down to the piazza There he was awaited by Cardinal Valentino who was about to accompany him as we know as a hostage and who had remained behind to exchange a few words with his father In a moment Caesar Borgia appeared riding on a splendidly harnessed mule and behind him were led six magnificent horses a present from the Holy Father to the King of France Charles at once mounted one of these to do honour to the gift the pope had just conferred on him and leaving Rome with the rest of his troops pursued his way towards Marino where he arrived the same evening He learned there that Alfonso belying his reputation as a clever politician and great general had just embarked with all his treasures in a flotilla of four galleys leaving the care of the war and the management of his kingdom to his son Ferdinand Thus everything went well for the triumphant march of Charles the gates of towns opened of themselves at his approach his enemies fled without waiting for his coming and before he had fought a single battle he had won for himself the surname of Conqueror The day after at dawn the army started once more and after marching the whole day stopped in the evening at Velletri There the king who had been on horseback since the morning with Cardinal Valentine and D jem left the former at his lodging and taking D jem with him went on to his own Then Caesar Borgia who among the army baggage had twenty very heavy waggons of his own had one of these opened took out a splendid cabinet with the silver necessary for his table and gave orders for his supper to be prepared as he had done the night before Meanwhile night had come on and he shut himself up in a private chamber where stripping off his cardinal s costume he put on a groom s dress Thanks to this disguise he issued from the house that had been assigned for his accommodation without being recognised traversed the streets passed through the gates and gained the open country Nearly half a league outside the town a servant awaited him with two swift horses Caesar who was an excellent rider sprang to the saddle and he and his companion at full gallop retraced the road to Rome where they arrived at break of day Caesar got down at the house of one Flores auditor of the rota where he procured a fresh horse and suitable clothes then he flew at once to his mother who gave a cry of joy when she saw him for so silent and mysterious was the cardinal for all the world beside and even for her that he had not said a word of his early return to Rome The cry of joy uttered by Rosa Vanozza when she beheld her son was far more a cry of vengeance than of love One evening while everybody was at the rejoicings in the Vatican when Charles VIII and Alexander VI were swearing a friendship which neither of them felt and exchanging oaths that were broken beforehand a messenger from Rosa Vanozza had arrived with a letter to Caesar in which she begged him to come at once to her house in the Via delta Longara Caesar questioned the messenger but he only replied that he could tell him nothing that he would learn all he cared to know from his mother s own lips So as soon as he was at liberty Caesar in layman s dress and wrapped in a large cloak quitted the Vatican and made his way towards the church of Regina Coeli in the neighbourhood of which it will be remembered was the house where the pope s mistress lived As he approached his mother s house Caesar began to observe the signs of strange devastation The street was scattered with the wreck of furniture and strips of precious stuffs As he arrived at the foot of the little flight of steps that led to the entrance gate he saw that the windows were broken and the remains of torn curtains were fluttering in front of them Not understanding what this disorder could mean he rushed into the house and through several deserted and wrecked apartments At last seeing light in one of the rooms he went in and there found his mother sitting on the remains of a chest made of ebony all inlaid with ivory and silver When she saw Caesar she rose pale and dishevelled and pointing to the desolation around her exclaimed Look Caesar behold the work of your new friends But what does it mean mother asked the cardinal Whence comes all this disorder From the serpent replied Rosa Vanozza gnashing her teeth from the serpent you have warmed in your bosom He has bitten me fearing no doubt that his teeth would be broken on you Who has done this cried Caesar Tell me and by Heaven mother he shall pay and pay indeed Who replied Rosa King Charles VIII has done it by the hands of his faithful allies the Swiss It was well known that Melchior was away and that I was living alone with a few wretched servants so they came and broke in the doors as though they were taking Rome by storm and while Cardinal Valentino was making holiday with their master they pillaged his mother s house loading her with insults and outrages which no Turks or Saracens could possibly have improved upon Very good very good mother said Caesar be calm blood shall wash out disgrace Consider a moment what we have lost is nothing compared with what we might lose and my father and I you may be quite sure will give you back more than they have stolen from you I ask for no promises cried Rosa I ask for revenge My mother said the cardinal you shall be avenged or I will lose the name of son Having by these words reassured his mother he took her to Lucrezia s palace which in consequence of her marriage with Pesaro was unoccupied and himself returned to the Vatican giving orders that his mother s house should be refurnished more magnificently than before the disaster These orders were punctually executed and it was among her new luxurious surroundings but with the same hatred in her heart that Caesar on this occasion found his mother This feeling prompted her cry of joy when she saw him once more The mother and son exchanged a very few words then Caesar mounting on horseback went to the Vatican whence as a hostage he had departed two days before Alexander who knew of the flight beforehand and not only approved but as sovereign pontiff had previously absolved his son of the perjury he was about to commit received him joyfully but all the same advised him to lie concealed as Charles in all probability would not be slow to reclaim his hostage Indeed the next day when the king got up the absence of Cardinal Valentino was observed and as Charles was uneasy at not seeing him he sent to inquire what had prevented his appearance When the messenger arrived at the house that Caesar had left the evening before he learned that he had gone out at nine o clock in the evening and not returned since He went back with this news to the king who at once suspected that he had fled and in the first flush of his anger let the whole army know of his perjury The soldiers then remembered the twenty waggons so heavily laden from one of which the cardinal in the sight of all had produced such magnificent gold and silver plate and never doubting that the cargo of the others was equally precious they fetched them down and broke them to pieces but inside they found nothing but stones and sand which proved to the king that the flight had been planned a long time back and incensed him doubly against the pope So without loss of time he despatched to Rome Philippe de Bresse afterwards Duke of Savoy with orders to intimate to the Holy Father his displeasure at this conduct But the pope replied that he knew nothing whatever about his son s flight and expressed the sincerest regret to His Majesty declaring that he knew nothing of his whereabouts but was certain that he was not in Rome As a fact the pope was speaking the truth this time for Caesar had gone with Cardinal Orsino to one of his estates and was temporarily in hiding there This reply was conveyed to Charles by two messengers from the pope the Bishops of Nepi and of Sutri and the people also sent an ambassador in their own behalf He was Monsignore Porcari dean of the rota who was charged to communicate to the king the displeasure of the Romans when they learned of the cardinal s breach of faith Little as Charles was disposed to content himself with empty words he had to turn his attention to more serious affairs so he continued his march to Naples without stopping arriving there on Sunday the twenty second of February fourteen ninety five Four days later the unlucky D jem who had fallen sick at Capua died at Castel Nuovo When he was leaving at the farewell banquet Alexander had tried on his guest the poison he intended to use so often later on upon his cardinals and whose effects he was destined to feel himself such is poetical justice In this way the pope had secured a double haul for in his twofold speculation in this wretched young man he had sold him alive to Charles for one hundred twenty thousand livres and sold him dead to Bajazet for thirty thousand ducats But there was a certain delay about the second payment for the Turkish emperor as we remember was not bound to pay the price of fratricide till he received the corpse and by Charles s order the corpse had been buried at Gaeta When Caesar Borgia learned the news he rightly supposed that the king would be so busy settling himself in his new capital that he would have too much to think of to be worrying about him so he went to Rome again and anxious to keep his promise to his mother he signalised his return by a terrible vengeance Cardinal Valentino had in his service a certain Spaniard whom he had made the chief of his bravoes he was a man of five and thirty or forty whose whole life had been one long rebellion against society s laws he recoiled from no action provided only he could get his price This Don Michele Correglia who earned his celebrity for bloody deeds under the name of Michelotto was just the man Caesar wanted and whereas Michelotto felt an unbounded admiration for Caesar Caesar had unlimited confidence in Michelotto It was to him the cardinal entrusted the execution of one part of his vengeance the other he kept for himself Don Michele received orders to scour the Campagna and cut every French throat he could find He began his work at once and very few days elapsed before he had obtained most satisfactory results more than a hundred persons were robbed or assassinated and among the last the son of Cardinal de saint Malo who was en his way back to France and on whom Michelotto found a sum of three thousand crowns For himself Caesar reserved the Swiss for it was the Swiss in particular who had despoiled his mother s house The pope had in his service about a hundred and fifty soldiers belonging to their nation who had settled their families in Rome and had grown rich partly by their pay and partly in the exercise of various industries The cardinal had every one of them dismissed with orders to quit Rome within twenty four hours and the Roman territories within three days The poor wretches had all collected together to obey the order with their wives and children and baggage on the Piazza of saint Peter when suddenly by Cardinal Valentino s orders they were hemmed in on all sides by two thousand Spaniards who began to fire on them with their guns and charge them with their sabres while Caesar and his mother looked down upon the carnage from a window In this way they killed fifty or perhaps sixty but the rest coming up made a charge at the assassins and then without suffering any loss managed to beat a retreat to a house where they stood a siege and made so valiant a defense that they gave the pope time he knew nothing of the author of this butchery to send the captain of his guard to the rescue who with a strong detachment succeeded in getting nearly forty of them safely out of the town the rest had been massacred on the piazza or killed in the house But this was no real and adequate revenge for it did not touch Charles himself the sole author of all the troubles that the pope and his family had experienced during the last year So Caesar soon abandoned vulgar schemes of this kind and busied himself with loftier concerns bending all the force of his genius to restore the league of Italian princes that had been broken by the defection of Sforza the exile of Piero dei Medici and the defeat of Alfonso The enterprise was more easily accomplished than the pope could have anticipated The Venetians were very uneasy when Charles passed so near and they trembled lest when he was once master of Naples he might conceive the idea of conquering the rest of Italy Ludovico Sforza on his side was beginning to tremble seeing the rapidity with which the King of France had dethroned the house of Aragon lest he might not make much difference between his allies and his enemies Maximilian for his part was only seeking an occasion to break the temporary peace which he had granted for the sake of the concession made to him Lastly Ferdinand and Isabella were allies of the dethroned house And so it came about that all of them for different reasons felt a common fear and were soon in agreement as to the necessity of driving out Charles VIII not only from Naples but from Italy and pledged themselves to work together to this end by every means in their power by negotiations by trickery or by actual force The Florentines alone refused to take part in this general levy of arms and remained faithful to their promises According to the articles of the treaty agreed upon by the confederates the alliance was to last for five and twenty years and had for ostensible object the upholding of the majority of the pope and the interests of Christendom and these preparations might well have been taken for such as would precede a crusade against the Turks if Bajazet s ambassador had not always been present at the deliberations although the Christian princes could not have dared for very shame to admit the sultan by name into their league Now the confederates had to set on foot an army of thirty thousand horse and twenty thousand infantry and each of them was taxed for a contingent thus the pope was to furnish four thousand horse Maximilian six thousand the King of Spain the Duke of Milan and the republic of Venice eight thousand each Every confederate was in addition to this to levy and equip four thousand infantry in the six weeks following the signature of the treaty The fleets were to be equipped by the Maritime States but any expenses they should incur later on were to be defrayed by all in equal shares The formation of this league was made public on the twelfth of April fourteen ninety five Palm Sunday and in all the Italian States especially at Rome was made the occasion of fetes and immense rejoicings Almost as soon as the publicly known articles were announced the secret ones were put into execution These obliged Ferdinand and Isabella to send a fleet of sixty galleys to Ischia where Alfonso s son had retired with six hundred horsemen on board and five thousand infantry to help him to ascend the throne once more Those troops were to be put under the command of Gonzalvo of Cordova who had gained the reputation of the greatest general in Europe after the taking of Granada The Venetians with a fleet of forty galleys under the command of Antonio Grimani were to attack all the French stations on the coast of Calabria and Naples The Duke of Milan promised for his part to check all reinforcements as they should arrive from France and to drive the Duke of Orleans out of Asti Lastly there was Maximilian who had promised to make invasions on the frontiers and Bajazet who was to help with money ships and soldiers either the Venetians or the Spaniards according as he might be appealed to by Barberigo or by Ferdinand the Catholic This league was all the more disconcerting for Charles because of the speedy abatement of the enthusiasm that had hailed his first appearance What had happened to him was what generally happens to a conqueror who has more good luck than talent instead of making himself a party among the great Neapolitan and Calabrian vassals whose roots would be embedded in the very soil by confirming their privileges and augmenting their power he had wounded their feelings by bestowing all the titles offices and fiefs on those alone who had followed him from France so that all the important positions in the kingdom were filled by strangers The result was that just when the league was made known Tropea and Amantea which had been presented by Charles to the Seigneur de Precy rose in revolt and hoisted the banner of Aragon and the Spanish fleet had only to present itself at Reggio in Calabria for the town to throw open its gates being more discontented with the new rule than the old and Don Federiga Alfonso s brother and Ferdinand s uncle who had hitherto never quitted Brindisi had only to appear at Tarentum to be received there as a liberator CHAPTER VI CHARLES learned all this news at Naples and tired of his late conquests which necessitated a labour in organisation for which he was quite unfitted turned his eyes towards France where victorious fetes and rejoicings were awaiting the victor s return So he yielded at the first breath of his advisers and retraced his road to his kingdom threatened as was said by the Germans on the north and the Spaniards on the south Consequently he appointed Gilbert de Montpensier of the house of Bourbon viceroy d Aubigny of the Scotch Stuart family lieutenant in Calabria Etienne de Vese commander at Gaeta and Don Juliano Gabriel de Montfaucon Guillaume de Villeneuve George de Lilly the bailiff of Vitry and Graziano Guerra respectively governors of Sant Angelo Manfredonia Trani Catanzaro Aquila and Sulmone then leaving behind in evidence of his claims the half of his Swiss a party of his Gascons eight hundred French lances and about five hundred Italian men at arms the last under the command of the prefect of Rome Prospero and Fabrizio Colonna and Antonio Savelli he left Naples on the twentieth of May at two o clock in the afternoon to traverse the whole of the Italian peninsula with the rest of his army consisting of eight hundred French lances two hundred gentlemen of his guard one hundred Italian men at arms three thousand Swiss infantry one thousand French and one thousand Gascon He also expected to be joined by Camillo Vitelli and his brothers in Tuscany who were to contribute two hundred and fifty men at arms A week before he left Naples Charles had sent to Rome Monseigneur de Saint Paul brother of Cardinal de Luxembourg and just as he was starting he despatched thither the new Archbishop of Lyons They both were commissioned to assure Alexander that the King of France had the most sincere desire and the very best intention of remaining his friend In truth Charles wished for nothing so much as to separate the pope from the league so as to secure him as a spiritual and temporal support but a young king full of fire ambition and courage was not the neighbour to suit Alexander so the latter would listen to nothing and as the troops he had demanded from the doge and Ludavico Sforza had not been sent in sufficient number for the defense of Rome he was content with provisioning the castle of S Angelo putting in a formidable garrison and leaving Cardinal Sant Anastasio to receive Charles while he himself withdrew with Caesar to Orvieto Charles only stayed in Rome three days utterly depressed because the pope had refused to receive him in spite of his entreaties And in these three days instead of listening to Giuliano delta Rovere who was advising him once more to call a council and depose the pope he rather hoped to bring the pope round to his side by the virtuous act of restoring the citadels of Terracina and Civita Vecchia to the authorities of the Romagna only keeping for himself Ostia which he had promised Giuliano to give back to him At last when the three days had elapsed he left Rome and resumed his march in three columns towards Tuscany crossed the States of the Church and on the thirteenth reached Siena where he was joined by Philippe de Commines who had gone as ambassador extraordinary to the Venetian Republic and now announced that the enemy had forty thousand men under arms and were preparing for battle This news produced no other effect on the king and the gentlemen of his army than to excite their amusement beyond measure for they had conceived such a contempt for their enemy by their easy conquest that they could not believe that any army however numerous would venture to oppose their passage Charles however was forced to give way in the face of facts when he heard at San Teranza that his vanguard commanded by Marechal de Gie and composed of six hundred lances and fifteen hundred Swiss when it arrived at Fornova had come face to face with the confederates who had encamped at Guiarole The marechal had ordered an instant halt and he too had pitched his tents utilising for his defence the natural advantages of the hilly ground When these first measures had been taken he sent out first a herald to the enemy s camp to ask from Francesco di Gonzaga Marquis of Mantua generalissimo of the confederate troops a passage for his king s army and provisions at a reasonable price and secondly he despatched a courier to Charles VIII pressing him to hurry on his march with the artillery and rearguard The confederates had given an evasive answer for they were pondering whether they ought to jeopardise the whole Italian force in a single combat and putting all to the hazard attempt to annihilate the King of France and his army together so overwhelming the conqueror in the ruins of his ambition The messenger found Charles busy superintending the passage of the last of his cannon over the mountain of Pontremoli This was no easy matter seeing that there was no sort of track and the guns had to be lifted up and lowered by main force and each piece needed the arms of as many as two hundred men At last when all the artillery had arrived without accident on the other side of the Apennines Charles started in hot haste for Fornovd where he arrived with all his following on the morning of the next day From the top of the mountain where the Marechai de Gie had pitched his tents the king beheld both his own camp and the enemy s Both were on the right bank of the Taro and were at either end of a semicircular chain of hills resembling an amphitheatre and the space between the two camps a vast basin filled during the winter floods by the torrent which now only marked its boundary was nothing but a plain covered with gravel where all manoeuvres must be equally difficult for horse and infantry Besides on the western slope of the hills there was a little wood which extended from the enemy s army to the French and was in the possession of the Stradiotes who by help of its cover had already engaged in several skirmishes with the French troops during the two days of halt while they were waiting for the king The situation was not reassuring From the top of the mountain which overlooked Fornovo one could get a view as we said before of the two camps and could easily calculate the numerical difference between them The French army weakened by the establishment of garrisons in the various towns and fortresses they had won in Italy were scarcely eight thousand strong while the combined forces of Milan and Venice exceeded a total of thirty five thousand So Charles decided to try once more the methods of conciliation and sent Commines who as we know had joined him in Tuscany to the Venetian proveditori whose acquaintance he had made when on his embassy he having made a great impression on these men thanks to a general high opinion of his merits He was commissioned to tell the enemy s generals in the name of the King of France that his master only desired to continue his road without doing or receiving any harm that therefore he asked to be allowed a free passage across the fair plains of Lombardy which he could see from the heights where he now stood stretching as far as the eye could reach away to the foot of the Alps Commines found the confederate army deep in discussion the wish of the Milanese and Venetian party being to let the king go by and not attack him they said they were only too happy that he should leave Italy in this way without causing any further harm but the ambassadors of Spain and Germany took quite another view As their masters had no troops in the army and as all the money they had promised was already paid they must be the gainer in either case from a battle whichever way it went if they won the day they would gather the fruits of victory and if they lost they would experience nothing of the evils of defeat This want of unanimity was the reason why the answer to Commines was deferred until the following day and why it was settled that on the next day he should hold another conference with a plenipotentiary to be appointed in the course of that night The place of this conference was to be between the two armies The king passed the night in great uneasiness All day the weather had threatened to turn to rain and we have already said how rapidly the Taro could swell the river fordable to day might from tomorrow onwards prove an insurmountable obstacle and possibly the delay had only been asked for with a view to putting the French army in a worse position As a fact the night had scarcely come when a terrible storm arose and so long as darkness lasted great rumblings were heard in the Apennines and the sky was brilliant with lightning At break of day however it seemed to be getting a little calmer though the Taro only a streamlet the day before had become a torrent by this time and was rapidly rising So at six in the morning the king ready armed and on horseback summoned Commines and bade him make his way to the rendezvous that the Venetian proveditori had assigned But scarcely had he contrived to give the order when loud cries were heard coming from the extreme right of the French army The Stradiotes under cover of the wood stretching between the two camps had surprised an outpost and first cutting the soldiers throats were carrying off their heads in their usual way at the saddle bow A detachment of cavalry was sent in pursuit but like wild animals they had retreated to their lair in the woods and there disappeared This unexpected engagement in all probability arranged beforehand by the Spanish and German envoys produced on the whole army the effect of a spark applied to a train of gunpowder Commines and the Venetian proveditori each tried in vain to arrest the combat on either side Light troops eager for a skirmish and in the usual fashion of those days prompted only by that personal courage which led them on to danger had already come to blows rushing down into the plain as though it were an amphitheatre where they might make a fine display of arms For a moment the young king drawn on by example was on the point of forgetting the responsibility of a general in his zeal as a soldier but this first impulse was checked by Marechal de Gie Messire Claude de la Chatre de Guise and M de la Trimauille who persuaded Charles to adopt the wiser plan and to cross the Taro without seeking a battle at the same time without trying to avoid it should the enemy cross the river from their camp and attempt to block his passage The king accordingly following the advice of his wisest and bravest captains thus arranged his divisions The first comprised the van and a body of troops whose duty it was to support them The van consisted of three hundred and fifty men at arms the best and bravest of the army under the command of Marechal de Gie and Jacques Trivulce the corps following them consisted of three thousand Swiss under the command of Engelbert der Cleves and de Larnay the queen s grand equerry next came three hundred archers of the guard whom the king had sent to help the cavalry by fighting in the spaces between them The second division commanded by the king in person and forming the middle of the army was composed of the artillery under Jean de Lagrange a hundred gentlemen of the guard with Gilles Carrone for standard bearer pensioners of the king s household under Aymar de Prie some Scots and two hundred cross bowmen on horseback with French archers besides led by M de Crussol Lastly the third division i e the rear preceded by six thousand beasts of burden bearing the baggage was composed of only three hundred men at arms commanded by de Guise and by de la Trimouille this was the weakest part of the army When this arrangement was settled Charles ordered the van to cross the river just at the little town of Fornovo This was done at once the riders getting wet up to their knees and the footmen holding to the horses tails As soon as he saw the last soldiers of his first division on the opposite bank he started himself to follow the same road and cross at the same ford giving orders to de Guise and de la Trimouille to regulate the march of the rear guard by that of the centre just as he had regulated their march by that of the van His orders were punctually carried out and about ten o clock in the morning the whole French army was on the left bank of the Taro at the same time when it seemed certain from the enemy s arrangements that battle was imminent the baggage led by the captain Odet de Reberac was separated from the rear guard and retired to the extreme left Now Francisco de Gonzaga general in chief of the confederate troops had modelled his plans on those of the King of France by his orders Count de Cajazzo with four hundred men at arms and two thousand infantry had crossed the Taro where the Venetian camp lay and was to attack the French van while Gonzaga himself following the right bank as far as Fornovo would go over the river by the same ford that Charles had used with a view to attacking his rear Lastly he had placed the Stradiotes between these two fords with orders to cross the river in their turn so soon as they saw the French army attacked both in van and in the rear and to fall upon its flank Not content with offensive measures Gonzaga had also made provision for retreat by leaving three reserve corps on the right bank one to guard the camp under the instruction of the Venetian provveditori and the other two arranged in echelon to support each other the first commanded by Antonio di Montefeltro the second by Annibale Bentivoglio Charles had observed all these arrangements and had recognised the cunning Italian strategy which made his opponents the finest generals in the world but as there was no means of avoiding the danger he had decided to take a sideway course and had given orders to continue the match but in a minute the French army was caught between Count di Cajazzo barring the way with his four hundred men at arms and his two thousand infantry and Gonzaga in pursuit of the rear as we said before leading six hundred men at arms the flower of his army a squadron of Stradiotes and more than five thousand infantry this division alone was stronger than the whole of the French army When however M de Guise and M de la Trimouille found themselves pressed in this way they ordered their two hundred men at arms to turn right about face while at the opposite end that is at the head of the army Marechal de Gie and Trivulce ordered a halt and lances in rest Meanwhile according to custom the king who as we said was in the centre was conferring knighthood on those gentlemen who had earned the favour either by virtue of their personal powers or the king s special friendship Suddenly there was heard a terrible clash behind It was the French rearguard coming to blows with the Marquis of Mantua In this encounter where each man had singled out his own foe as though it were a tournament very many lances were broken especially those of the Italian knights for their lances were hollowed so as to be less heavy and in consequence had less solidity Those who were thus disarmed at once seized their swords As they were far more numerous than the French the king saw them suddenly outflanking his right wing and apparently prepared to surround it at the same moment loud cries were heard from a direction facing the centre this meant that the Stradiotes were crossing the river to make their attack The king at once ordered his division into two detachments and giving one to Bourbon the bastard to make head against the Stradiotes he hurried with the second to the rescue of the van flinging himself into the very midst of the melee striking out like a king and doing as steady work as the lowest in rank of his captains Aided by the reinforcement the rearguard made a good stand though the enemy were five against one and the combat in this part continued to rage with wonderful fury Obeying his orders Bourbon had thrown himself upon the Stradiotes but unfortunately carried off by his horse he had penetrated so far into the enemy s ranks that he was lost to sight the disappearance of their chief the strange dress of their new antagonists and the peculiar method of their fighting produced a considerable effect on those who were to attack them and for the moment disorder was the consequence in the centre and the horse men scattered instead of serrying their ranks and fighting in a body This false move would have done them serious harm had not most of the Stradiotes seeing the baggage alone and undefended rushed after that in hope of booty instead of following up their advantage A great part of the troop nevertheless stayed behind to fight pressing on the French cavalry and smashing their lances with their fearful scimitars Happily the king who had just repulsed the Marquis of Mantua s attack perceived what was going on behind him and riding back at all possible speed to the succour of the centre together with the gentlemen of his household fell upon the Stradiotes no longer armed with a lance for that he had just broken but brandishing his long sword which blazed about him like lightning and either because he was whirled away like Bourbon by his own horse or because he had allowed his courage to take him too far he suddenly found himself in the thickest ranks of the Stradiotes accompanied only by eight of the knights he had just now created one equerry called Antoine des Ambus and his standard bearer France France he cried aloud to rally round him all the others who had scattered they seeing at last that the danger was less than they had supposed began to take their revenge and to pay back with interest the blows they had received from the Stradiotes Things were going still better for the van which the Marquis de Cajazzo was to attack for although he had at first appeared to be animated with a terrible purpose he stopped short about ten or twelve feet from the French line and turned right about face without breaking a single lance The French wanted to pursue but the Marechal de Gie fearing that this flight might be only a trick to draw off the vanguard from the centre ordered every man to stay in his place But the Swiss who were German and did not understand the order or thought it was not meant for them followed upon their heels and although on foot caught them up and killed a hundred of them This was quite enough to throw them into disorder so that some were scattered about the plain and others made a rush for the water so as to cross the river and rejoin their camp When the Marechal de Gie saw this he detached a hundred of his own men to go to the aid of the king who was continuing to fight with unheard of courage and running the greatest risks constantly separated as he was from his gentlemen who could not follow him for wherever there was danger thither he rushed with his cry of France little troubling himself as to whether he was followed or not And it was no longer with his sword that he fought that he had long ago broken like his lance but with a heavy battle axe whose every blow was mortal whether cut or pierced Thus the Stradiotes already hard pressed by the king s household and his pensioners soon changed attack for defence and defence for flight It was at this moment that the king was really in the greatest danger for he had let himself be carried away in pursuit of the fugitives and presently found himself all alone surrounded by these men who had they not been struck with a mighty terror would have had nothing to do but unite and crush him and his horse together but as Commines remarks He whom God guards is well guarded and God was guarding the King of France All the same at this moment the French were sorely pressed in the rear and although de Guise and de la Trimouille held out as firmly as it was possible to hold they would probably have been compelled to yield to superior numbers had not a double aid arrived in time first the indefatigable Charles who having nothing more to do among the fugitives once again dashed into the midst of the fight next the servants of the army who now that they were set free from the Stradiotes and saw their enemies put to flight ran up armed with the axes they habitually used to cut down wood for building their huts they burst into the middle of the fray slashing at the horses legs and dealing heavy blows that smashed in the visors of the dismounted horsemen The Italians could not hold out against this double attack the furia francese rendered all their strategy and all their calculations useless especially as for more than a century they had abandoned their fights of blood and fury for a kind of tournament they chose to regard as warfare so in spite of all Gonzaga s efforts they turned their backs upon the French rear and took to flight in the greatest haste and with much difficulty they recrossed the torrent which was swollen even more now by the rain that had been falling during the whole time of the battle Some thought fit to pursue the vanquished for there was now such disorder in their ranks that they were fleeing in all directions from the battlefield where the French had gained so glorious a victory blocking up the roads to Parma and Bercetto But Marechal de Gie and de Guise and de la Trimouille who had done quite enough to save them from the suspicion of quailing before imaginary dangers put a stop to this enthusiasm by pointing out that it would only be risking the loss of their present advantage if they tried to push it farther with men and horses so worn out This view was adopted in spite of the opinion of Trivulce Camillo Vitelli and Francesco Secco who were all eager to follow up the victory The king retired to a little village on the left bank of the Taro and took shelter in a poor house There he disarmed being perhaps among all the captains and all the soldiers the man who had fought best During the night the torrent swelled so high that the Italian army could not have pursued even if they had laid aside their fears The king did not propose to give the appearance of flight after a victory and therefore kept his army drawn up all day and at night went on to sleep at Medesano a little village only a mile lower down than the hamlet where he rested after the fight But in the course of the night he reflected that he had done enough for the honour of his arms in fighting an army four times as great as his own and killing three thousand men and then waiting a day and a half to give them time to take their revenge so two hours before daybreak he had the fires lighted that the enemy might suppose he was remaining in camp and every man mounting noiselessly the whole French army almost out of danger by this time proceeded on their march to Borgo San Donnino While this was going on the pope returned to Rome where news highly favourable to his schemes was not slow to reach his ears He learned that Ferdinand had crossed from Sicily into Calabria with six thousand volunteers and a considerable number of Spanish horse and foot led at the command of Ferdinand and Isabella by the famous Gonzalva de Cordova who arrived in Italy with a great reputation destined to suffer somewhat from the defeat at Seminara At almost the same time the French fleet had been beaten by the Aragonese moreover the battle of the Taro though a complete defeat for the confederates was another victory for the pope because its result was to open a return to France for that man whom he regarded as his deadliest foe So feeling that he had nothing more to fear from Charles he sent him a brief at Turin where he had stopped for a short time to give aid to Novara therein commanding him by virtue of his pontifical authority to depart out of Italy with his army and to recall within ten days those of his troops that still remained in the kingdom of Naples on pain of excommunication and a summons to appear before him in person Charles VIII replied one That he did not understand how the pope the chief of the league ordered him to leave Italy whereas the confederates had not only refused him a passage but had even attempted though unsuccessfully as perhaps His Holiness knew to cut off his return into France two That as to recalling his troops from Naples he was not so irreligious as to do that since they had not entered the kingdom without the consent and blessing of His Holiness three That he was exceedingly surprised that the pope should require his presence in person at the capital of the Christian world just at the present time when six weeks previously at the time of his return from Naples although he ardently desired an interview with His Holiness that he might offer proofs of his respect and obedience His Holiness instead of according this favour had quitted Rome so hastily on his approach that he had not been able to come up with him by any efforts whatsoever On this point however he promised to give His Holiness the satisfaction he desired if he would engage this time to wait for him he would therefore return to Rome so soon as the affairs that brought him back to his own kingdom had been satisfactorily settled Although in this reply there was a touch of mockery and defiance Charles was none the less compelled by the circumstances of the case to obey the pope s strange brief His presence was so much needed in France that in spite of the arrival of a Swiss reinforcement he was compelled to conclude a peace with Ludovico Sforza whereby he yielded Novara to him while Gilbert de Montpensier and d Aubigny after defending inch by inch Calabria the Basilicate and Naples were obliged to sign the capitulation of Atella after a siege of thirty two days on the twentieth of July fourteen ninety six This involved giving back to Ferdinand II King of Naples all the palaces and fortresses of his kingdom which indeed he did but enjoy for three months dying of exhaustion on the seventh of September following at the Castello della Somma at the foot of Vesuvius all the attentions lavished upon him by his young wife could not repair the evil that her beauty had wrought His uncle Frederic succeeded and so in the three years of his papacy Alexander VI had seen five kings upon the throne of Naples while he was establishing himself more firmly upon his own pontifical seat Ferdinand I Alfonso I Charles VIII Ferdinand II and Frederic All this agitation about his throne this rapid succession of sovereigns was the best thing possible for Alexander for each new monarch became actually king only on condition of his receiving the pontifical investiture The consequence was that Alexander was the only gainer in power and credit by these changes for the Duke of Milan and the republics of Florence and Venice had successively recognised him as supreme head of the Church in spite of his simony moreover the five kings of Naples had in turn paid him homage So he thought the time had now come for founding a mighty family and for this he relied upon the Duke of Gandia who was to hold all the highest temporal dignities and upon Caesar Borgia who was to be appointed to all the great ecclesiastical offices The pope made sure of the success of these new projects by electing four Spanish cardinals who brought up the number of his compatriots in the Sacred College to twenty two thus assuring him a constant and certain majority The first requirement of the pope s policy was to clear away from the neighbourhood of Rome all those petty lords whom most people call vicars of the Church but whom Alexander called the shackles of the papacy We saw that he had already begun this work by rousing the Orsini against the Colonna family when Charles VIII s enterprise compelled him to concentrate all his mental resources and also the forces of his States so as to secure his own personal safety It had come about through their own imprudent action that the Orsini the pope s old friends were now in the pay of the French and had entered the kingdom of Naples with them where one of them Virginio a very important member of their powerful house had been taken prisoner during the war and was Ferdinand II s captive Alexander could not let this opportunity escape him so first ordering the King of Naples not to release a man who ever since the first of June fourteen ninety six had been a declared rebel he pronounced a sentence of confiscation against Virginio Orsini and his whole family in a secret consistory which sat on the twenty sixth of October following that is to say in the early days of the reign of Frederic whom he knew to be entirely at his command owing to the King s great desire of getting the investiture from him then as it was not enough to declare the goods confiscated without also dispossessing the owners he made overtures to the Colonna family saying he would commission them in proof of their new bond of friendship to execute the order given against their old enemies under the direction of his son Francesco Duke of Gandia In this fashion he contrived to weaken his neighbours each by means of the other till such time as he could safely attack and put an end to conquered and conqueror alike The Colonna family accepted this proposition and the Duke of Gandia was named General of the Church his father in his pontifical robes bestowed on him the insignia of this office in the church of saint Peter s at Rome CHAPTER VII Matters went forward as Alexander had wished and before the end of the year the pontifical army had seized a great number of castles and fortresses that belonged to the Orsini who thought themselves already lost when Charles VIII came to the rescue They had addressed themselves to him without much hope that he could be of real use to there with his want of armed troops and his preoccupation with his own affairs He however sent Carlo Orsini son of Virginio the prisoner and Vitellozzo Vitelli brother of Camillo Vitelli one of the three valiant Italian condottieri who had joined him and fought for him at the crossing of the Taro These two captains whose courage and skill were well known brought with them a considerable sum of money from the liberal coffers of Charles VIII Now scarcely had they arrived at Citta di Castello the centre of their little sovereignty and expressed their intention of raising a band of soldiers when men presented themselves from all sides to fight under their banner so they very soon assembled a small army and as they had been able during their stay among the French to study those matters of military organisation in which France excelled they now applied the result of their learning to their own troops the improvements were mainly certain changes in the artillery which made their manoeuvres easier and the substitution for their ordinary weapons of pikes similar in form to the Swiss pikes but two feet longer These changes effected Vitellozzo Vitelli spent three or four months in exercising his men in the management of their new weapons then when he thought them fit to make good use of these and when he had collected more or less help from the towns of Perugia Todi and Narni where the inhabitants trembled lest their turn should come after the Orsini s as the Orsini s had followed on the Colonnas he marched towards Braccianno which was being besieged by the Duke of Urbino who had been lent to the pope by the Venetians in virtue of the treaty quoted above The Venetian general when he heard of Vitelli s approach thought he might as well spare him half his journey and marched out to confront him the two armies met in the Soriano road and the battle straightway began The pontifical army had a body of eight hundred Germans on which the Dukes of Urbino and Gandia chiefly relied as well they might for they were the best troops in the world but Vitelli attacked these picked men with his infantry who armed with their formidable pikes ran them through while they with arms four feet shorter had no chance even of returning the blows they received at the same time Vitelli s light troops wheeled upon the flank following their most rapid movements and silencing the enemy s artillery by the swiftness and accuracy of their attack The pontifical troops were put to flight though after a longer resistance than might have been expected when they had to sustain the attack of an army so much better equipped than their own with them they bore to Ronciglione the Duke of Gandia wounded in the face by a pike thrust Fabrizia Calonna and the envoy the Duke of Urbino who was fighting in the rear to aid the retreat was taken prisoner with all his artillery and the baggage of the conquered army But this success great as it was did not so swell the pride of Vitellozza Vitelli as to make him oblivious of his position He knew that he and the Orsini together were too weak to sustain a war of such magnitude that the little store of money to which he owed the existence of his army would very soon be expended and his army would disappear with it So he hastened to get pardoned for the victory by making propositions which he would very likely have refused had he been the vanquished party and the pope accepted his conditions without demur during the interval having heard that Trivulce had just recrossed the Alps and re entered Italy with three thousand Swiss and fearing lest the Italian general might only be the advance guard of the King of France So it was settled that the Orsini should pay seventy thousand florins for the expenses of the war and that all the prisoners on both sides should be exchanged without ransom with the single exception of the Duke of Urbino As a pledge for the future payment of the seventy thousand florins the Orsini handed over to the Cardinals Sforza and San Severino the fortresses of Anguillara and Cervetri then when the day came and they had not the necessary money they gave up their prisoner the Duke of Urbino estimating his worth at forty thousand ducats nearly all the sum required and handed him over to Alexander on account he a rigid observer of engagements made his own general taken prisoner in his service pay to himself the ransom he owed to the enemy Then the pope had the corpse of Virginio sent to Carlo Orsini and Vitellozzo Vitelli as he could not send him alive By a strange fatality the prisoner had died eight days before the treaty was signed of the same malady at least if we may judge by analogy that had carried off Bajazet s brother As soon as the peace was signed Prospero Calonna and Gonzalvo de Cordova whom the Pope had demanded from Frederic arrived at Rome with an army of Spanish and Neapolitan troops Alexander as he could not utilise these against the Orsini set them the work of recapturing Ostia not desiring to incur the reproach of bringing them to Rome for nothing Gonzalvo was rewarded for this feat by receiving the Rose of Gold from the pope s hand that being the highest honour His Holiness can grant He shared this distinction with the Emperor Maximilian the King of France the Doge of Venice and the Marquis of Mantua In the midst of all this occurred the solemn festival of the Assumption in which Gonzalvo was invited to take part He accordingly left his palace proceeded in great pomp in the front of the pontifical cavalry and took his place on the Duke of Gandia s left hand The duke attracted all eyes by his personal beauty set off as it was by all the luxury he thought fit to display at this festival He had a retinue of pages and servants clad in sumptuous liveries incomparable for richness with anything heretofore seen in Rome that city of religious pomp All these pages and servants rode magnificent horses caparisoned in velvet trimmed with silver fringe and bells of silver hanging down every here and there He himself was in a robe of gold brocade and wore at his neck a string of Eastern pearls perhaps the finest and largest that ever belonged to a Christian prince while on his cap was a gold chain studded with diamonds of which the smallest was worth more than twenty thousand ducats This magnificence was all the more conspicuous by the contrast it presented to Caesar s dress whose scarlet robe admitted of no ornaments The result was that Caesar doubly jealous of his brother felt a new hatred rise up within him when he heard all along the way the praises of his fine appearance and noble equipment From this moment Cardinal Valentino decided in his own mind the fate of this man this constant obstacle in the path of his pride his love and his ambition Very good reason says Tommaso the historian had the Duke of Gandia to leave behind him an impression on the public mind of his beauty and his grandeur at this fete for this last display was soon to be followed by the obsequies of the unhappy young man Lucrezia also had come to Rome on the pretext of taking part in the solemnity but really as we shall see later with the view of serving as a new instrument for her father s ambition As the pope was not satisfied with an empty triumph of vanity and display for his son and as his war with the Orsini had failed to produce the anticipated results he decided to increase the fortune of his firstborn by doing the very thing which he had accused Calixtus in his speech of doing for him viz alienating from the States of the Church the cities of Benevento Terracino and Pontecorvo to form a duchy as an appanage to his son s house Accordingly this proposition was put forward in a full consistory and as the college of cardinals was entirely Alexander s there was no difficulty about carrying his point This new favour to his elder brother exasperated Caesar although he was himself getting a share of the paternal gifts for he had just been named envoy a latere at Frederic s court and was appointed to crown him with his own hands as the papal representative But Lucrezia when she had spent a few days of pleasure with her father and brothers had gone into retreat at the convent of San Sisto No one knew the real motive of her seclusion and no entreaties of Caesar whose love for her was strange and unnatural had induced her to defer this departure from the world even until the day after he left for Naples His sister s obstinacy wounded him deeply for ever since the day when the Duke of Gandia had appeared in the procession so magnificently attired he fancied he had observed a coldness in the mistress of his illicit affection and so far did this increase his hatred of his rival that he resolved to be rid of him at all costs So he ordered the chief of his sbirri to come and see him the same night Michelotto was accustomed to these mysterious messages which almost always meant his help was wanted in some love affair or some act of revenge As in either case his reward was generally a large one he was careful to keep his engagement and at the appointed hour was brought into the presence of his patron Caesar received him leaning against a tall chimney piece no longer wearing his cardinal s robe and hat but a doublet of black velvet slashed with satin of the same colour One hand toyed mechanically with his gloves while the other rested on the handle of a poisoned dagger which never left his side This was the dress he kept for his nocturnal expeditions so Michelotto felt no surprise at that but his eyes burned with a flame more gloomy than their wont and his cheeks generally pale were now livid Michelotto had but to cast one look upon his master to see that Caesar and he were about to share some terrible enterprise He signed to him to shut the door Michelotto obeyed Then after a moment s silence during which the eyes of Borgia seemed to burn into the soul of the bravo who with a careless air stood bareheaded before ham he said in a voice whose slightly mocking tone gave the only sign of his emotion Michelotto how do you think this dress suits me Accustomed as he was to his master s tricks of circumlocution the bravo was so far from expecting this question that at first he stood mute and only after a few moments pause was able to say Admirably monsignore thanks to the dress your Excellency has the appearance as well as the true spirit of a captain I am glad you think so replied Caesar And now let me ask you do you know who is the cause that instead of wearing this dress which I can only put on at night I am forced to disguise myself in the daytime in a cardinal s robe and hat and pass my time trotting about from church to church from consistory to consistory when I ought properly to be leading a magnificent army in the battlefield where you would enjoy a captain s rank instead of being the chief of a few miserable sbirri Yes monsignore replied Michelotto who had divined Caesar s meaning at his first word the man who is the cause of this is Francesco Duke of Gandia and Benevento your elder brother Do you know Caesar resumed giving no sign of assent but a nod and a bitter smile do you know who has all the money and none of the genius who has the helmet and none of the brains who has the sword and no hand to wield it That too is the Duke of Gandia said Michelotto Do you know continued Caesar who is the man whom I find continually blocking the path of my ambition my fortune and my love It is the same the Duke of Gandia said Michelotto And what do you think of it asked Caesar I think he must die replied the man coldly That is my opinion also Michelotto said Caesar stepping towards him and grasping his hand and my only regret is that I did not think of it sooner for if I had carried a sword at my side instead of a crosier in my hand when the King of France was marching through Italy I should now have been master of a fine domain The pope is obviously anxious to aggrandise his family but he is mistaken in the means he adopts it is I who ought to have been made duke and my brother a cardinal There is no doubt at all that had he made me duke I should have contributed a daring and courage to his service that would have made his power far weightier than it is The man who would make his way to vast dominions and a kingdom ought to trample under foot all the obstacles in his path and boldly grasp the very sharpest thorns whatever reluctance his weak flesh may feel such a man if he would open out his path to fortune should seize his dagger or his sword and strike out with his eyes shut he should not shrink from bathing his hands in the blood of his kindred he should follow the example offered him by every founder of empire from Romulus to Bajazet both of whom climbed to the throne by the ladder of fratracide Yes Michelotto as you say such is my condition and I am resolved I will not shrink Now you know why I sent for you am I wrong in counting upon you As might have been expected Michelotto seeing his own fortune in this crime replied that he was entirely at Caesar s service and that he had nothing to do but to give his orders as to time place and manner of execution Caesar replied that the time must needs be very soon since he was on the point of leaving Rome for Naples as to the place and the mode of execution they would depend on circumstances and each of them must look out for an opportunity and seize the first that seemed favourable Two days after this resolution had been taken Caesar learned that the day of his departure was fixed for Thursday the fifteenth of June at the same time he received an invitation from his mother to come to supper with her on the fourteenth This was a farewell repast given in his honour Michelotto received orders to be in readiness at eleven o clock at night The table was set in the open air in a magnificent vineyard a property of Rosa Vanozza s in the neighbourhood of San Piero in Vinculis the guests were Caesar Borgia the hero of the occasion the Duke of Gandia Prince of Squillace Dona Sancha his wife the Cardinal of Monte Reale Francesco Borgia son of Calixtus III Don Roderigo Borgia captain of the apostolic palace Don Goffredo brother of the cardinal Gian Borgia at that time ambassador at Perugia and lastly Don Alfonso Borgia the pope s nephew the whole family therefore was present except Lucrezia who was still in retreat and would not come The repast was magnificent Caesar was quite as cheerful as usual and the Duke of Gandia seemed more joyous than he had ever been before In the middle of supper a man in a mask brought him a letter The duke unfastened it colouring up with pleasure and when he had read it answered in these words I will come then he quickly hid the letter in the pocket of his doublet but quick as he was to conceal it from every eye Caesar had had time to cast a glance that way and he fancied he recognised the handwriting of his sister Lucrezia Meanwhile the messenger had gone off with his answer no one but Caesar paying the slightest attention to him for at that period it was the custom for messages to be conveyed by men in domino or by women whose faces were concealed by a veil At ten o clock they rose from the table and as the air was sweet and mild they walked about a while under the magnificent pine trees that shaded the house of Rosa Vanozza while Caesar never for an instant let his brother out of his sight At eleven o clock the Duke of Gandia bade good night to his mother Caesar at once followed suit alleging his desire to go to the Vatican to bid farewell to the pope as he would not be able to fulfil this duty on the morrow his departure being fixed at daybreak This pretext was all the more plausible since the pope was in the habit of sitting up every night till two or three o clock in the morning The two brothers went out together mounted their horses which were waiting for them at the door and rode side by side as far as the Palazzo Borgia the present home of Cardinal Ascanio Sforza who had taken it as a gift from Alexander the night before his election to the papacy There the Duke of Gandia separated from his brother saying with a smile that he was not intending to go home as he had several hours to spend first with a fair lady who was expecting him Caesar replied that he was no doubt free to make any use he liked best of his opportunities and wished him a very good night The duke turned to the right and Caesar to the left but Caesar observed that the street the duke had taken led in the direction of the convent of San Sisto where as we said Lucrezia was in retreat his suspicions were confirmed by this observation and he directed his horse s steps to the Vatican found the pope took his leave of him and received his benediction From this moment all is wrapped in mystery and darkness like that in which the terrible deed was done that we are now to relate This however is what is believed The Duke of Gandia when he quitted Caesar sent away his servants and in the company of one confidential valet alone pursued his course towards the Piazza della Giudecca There he found the same man in a mask who had come to speak to him at supper and forbidding his valet to follow any farther he bade him wait on the piazza where they then stood promising to be on his way back in two hours time at latest and to take him up as he passed And at the appointed hour the duke reappeared took leave this time of the man in the mask and retraced his steps towards his palace But scarcely had he turned the corner of the Jewish Ghetto when four men on foot led by a fifth who was on horseback flung themselves upon him Thinking they were thieves or else that he was the victim of some mistake the Duke of Gandia mentioned his name but instead of the name checking the murderers daggers their strokes were redoubled and the duke very soon fell dead his valet dying beside him Then the man on horseback who had watched the assassination with no sign of emotion backed his horse towards the dead body the four murderers lifted the corpse across the crupper and walking by the side to support it then made their way down the lane that leads to the Church of Santa Maria in Monticelli The wretched valet they left for dead upon the pavement But he after the lapse of a few seconds regained some small strength and his groans were heard by the inhabitants of a poor little house hard by they came and picked him up and laid him upon a bed where he died almost at once unable to give any evidence as to the assassins or any details of the murder All night the duke was expected home and all the next morning then expectation was turned into fear and fear at last into deadly terror The pope was approached and told that the Duke of Gandia had never come back to his palace since he left his mother s house But Alexander tried to deceive himself all through the rest of the day hoping that his son might have been surprised by the coming of daylight in the midst of an amorous adventure and was waiting till the next night to get away in that darkness which had aided his coming thither But the night like the day passed and brought no news On the morrow the pope tormented by the gloomiest presentiments and by the raven s croak of the vox populi let himself fall into the depths of despair amid sighs and sobs of grief all he could say to any one who came to him was but these words repeated a thousand times Search search let us know how my unhappy son has died Then everybody joined in the search for as we have said the Duke of Gandia was beloved by all but nothing could be discovered from scouring the town except the body of the murdered man who was recognised as the duke s valet of his master there was no trace whatever it was then thought not without reason that he had probably been thrown into the Tiber and they began to follow along its banks beginning from the Via della Ripetta questioning every boatman and fisherman who might possibly have seen either from their houses or from their boats what had happened on the river banks during the two preceding nights At first all inquiries were in vain but when they had gone up as high as the Via del Fantanone they found a man at last who said he had seen something happen on the night of the fourteenth which might very possibly have some bearing on the subject of inquiry He was a Slav named George who was taking up the river a boat laden with wood to Ripetta The following are his own words Gentlemen he said last Wednesday evening when I had set down my load of wood on the bank I remained in my boat resting in the cool night air and watching lest other men should come and take away what I had just unloaded when about two o clock in the morning I saw coming out of the lane on the left of San Girolamo s Church two men on foot who came forward into the middle of the street and looked so carefully all around that they seemed to have come to find out if anybody was going along the street When they felt sure that it was deserted they went back along the same lane whence issued presently two other men who used similar precautions to make sure that there was nothing fresh they when they found all as they wished gave a sign to their companions to come and join them next appeared one man on a dapple grey horse which was carrying on the crupper the body of a dead man his head and arms hanging over on one side and his feet on the other The two fellows I had first seen exploring were holding him up by the arms and legs The other three at once went up to the river while the first two kept a watch on the street and advancing to the part of the bank where the sewers of the town are discharged into the Tiber the horseman turned his horse backing on the river then the two who were at either side taking the corpse one by the hands the other by the feet swung it three times and the third time threw it out into the river with all their strength then at the noise made when the body splashed into the water the horseman asked Is it done and the others answered Yes sir and he at once turned right about face but seeing the dead man s cloak floating he asked what was that black thing swimming about Sir said one of the men it is his cloak and then another man picked up some stones and running to the place where it was still floating threw them so as to make it sink under as soon as it had quite disappeared they went off and after walking a little way along the main road they went into the lane that leads to San Giacomo That was all I saw gentlemen and so it is all I can answer to the questions you have asked me At these words which robbed of all hope any who might yet entertain it one of the pope s servants asked the Slav why when he was witness of such a deed he had not gone to denounce it to the governor But the Slav replied that since he had exercised his present trade on the riverside he had seen dead men thrown into the Tiber in the same way a hundred times and had never heard that anybody had been troubled about them so he supposed it would be the same with this corpse as the others and had never imagined it was his duty to speak of it not thinking it would be any more important than it had been before Acting on this intelligence the servants of His Holiness summoned at once all the boatmen and fishermen who were accustomed to go up and down the river and as a large reward was promised to anyone who should find the duke s body there were soon more than a hundred ready for the job so that before the evening of the same day which was Friday two men were drawn out of the water of whom one was instantly recognised as the hapless duke At the very first glance at the body there could be no doubt as to the cause of death It was pierced with nine wounds the chief one in the throat whose artery was cut The clothing had not been touched his doublet and cloak were there his gloves in his waistband gold in his purse the duke then must have been assassinated not for gain but for revenge The ship which carried the corpse went up the Tiber to the Castello Sant Angelo where it was set down At once the magnificent dress was fetched from the duke s palace which he had worn on the day of the procession and he was clothed in it once more beside him were placed the insignia of the generalship of the Church Thus he lay in state all day but his father in his despair had not the courage to came and look at him At last when night had fallen his most trusty and honoured servants carried the body to the church of the Madonna del Papala with all the pomp and ceremony that Church and State combined could devise for the funeral of the son of the pope Meantime the bloodstained hands of Caesar Borgia were placing a royal crown upon the head of Frederic of Aragon This blow had pierced Alexander s heart very deeply As at first he did not know on whom his suspicions should fall he gave the strictest orders for the pursuit of the murderers but little by little the infamous truth was forced upon him He saw that the blow which struck at his house came from that very house itself and then his despair was changed to madness he ran through the rooms of the Vatican like a maniac and entering the consistory with torn garments and ashes on his head he sobbingly avowed all the errors of his past life owning that the disaster that struck his offspring through his offspring was a just chastisement from God then he retired to a secret dark chamber of the palace and there shut himself up declaring his resolve to die of starvation And indeed for more than sixty hours he took no nourishment by day nor rest by night making no answer to those who knocked at his door to bring him food except with the wailings of a woman or a roar as of a wounded lion even the beautiful Giulia Farnese his new mistress could not move him at all and was obliged to go and seek Lucrezia that daughter doubly loved to conquer his deadly resolve Lucrezia came out from the retreat where she was weeping for the Duke of Gandia that she might console her father At her voice the door did really open and it was only then that the Duke of Segovia who had been kneeling almost a whole day at the threshold begging His Holiness to take heart could enter with servants bearing wine and food The pope remained alone with Lucrezia for three days and nights then he reappeared in public outwardly calm if not resigned for Guicciardini assures us that his daughter had made him understand how dangerous it would be to himself to show too openly before the assassin who was coming home the immoderate love he felt for his victim CHAPTER VIII Caesar remained at Naples partly to give time to the paternal grief to cool down and partly to get on with another business he had lately been charged with nothing else than a proposition of marriage between Lucrezia and Don Alfonso of Aragon Duke of Bicelli and Prince of Salerno natural son of Alfonso II and brother of Dona Sancha It was true that Lucrezia was already married to the lord of Pesaro but she was the daughter of a father who had received from heaven the right of uniting and disuniting There was no need to trouble about so trifling a matter when the two were ready to marry the divorce would be effected Alexander was too good a tactician to leave his daughter married to a son in law who was becoming useless to him Towards the end of August it was announced that the ambassador was coming back to Rome having accomplished his mission to the new king to his great satisfaction And thither he returned on the fifth of September that is nearly three months after the Duke of Gandia s death and on the next day the sixth from the church of Santa Maria Novella where according to custom the cardinals and the Spanish and Venetian ambassadors were awaiting him on horseback at the door he proceeded to the Vatican where His Holiness was sitting there he entered the consistory was admitted by the pope and in accordance with the usual ceremonial received his benediction and kiss then accompanied once more in the same fashion by the ambassadors and cardinals he was escorted to his own apartments Thence he proceeded to the pope s as soon as he was left alone for at the consistory they had had no speech with one another and the father and son had a hundred things to talk about but of these the Duke of Gandia was not one as might have been expected His name was not once spoken and neither on that day nor afterwards was there ever again any mention of the unhappy young man it was as though he had never existed It was the fact that Caesar brought good news King Frederic gave his consent to the proposed union so the marriage of Sforza and Lucrezia was dissolved on a pretext of nullity Then Frederic authorised the exhumation of D jem s body which it will be remembered was worth three hundred thousand ducats After this all came about as Caesar had desired he became the man who was all powerful after the pope but when he was second in command it was soon evident to the Roman people that their city was making a new stride in the direction of ruin There was nothing but balls fetes masquerades there were magnificent hunting parties when Caesar who had begun to cast off his cardinal s robe weary perhaps of the colour appeared in a French dress followed like a king by cardinals envoys and bodyguard The whole pontifical town given up like a courtesan to orgies and debauchery had never been more the home of sedition luxury and carnage according to the Cardinal of Viterba not even in the days of Nero and Heliogabalus Never had she fallen upon days more evil never had more traitors done her dishonour or sbirri stained her streets with blood The number of thieves was so great and their audacity such that no one could with safety pass the gates of the town soon it was not even safe within them No house no castle availed for defence Right and justice no longer existed Money farce pleasure ruled supreme Still the gold was melting as in a furnace at these Fetes and by Heaven s just punishment Alexander and Caesar were beginning to covet the fortunes of those very men who had risen through their simony to their present elevation The first attempt at a new method of coining money was tried upon the Cardinal Cosenza The occasion was as follows A certain dispensation had been granted some time before to a nun who had taken the vows she was the only surviving heir to the throne of Portugal and by means of the dispensation she had been wedded to the natural son of the last king This marriage was more prejudicial than can easily be imagined to the interests of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain so they sent ambassadors to Alexander to lodge a complaint against a proceeding of this nature especially as it happened at the very moment when an alliance was to be formed between the house of Aragon and the Holy See Alexander understood the complaint and resolved that all should be set right So he denied all knowledge of the papal brief though he had as a fact received sixty thousand ducats for signing it and accused the Archbishop of Cosenza secretary for apostolic briefs of having granted a false dispensation By reason of this accusation the archbishop was taken to the castle of Sant Angelo and a suit was begun But as it was no easy task to prove an accusation of this nature especially if the archbishop should persist in maintaining that the dispensation was really granted by the pope it was resolved to employ a trick with him which could not fail to succeed One evening the Archbishop of Cosenza saw Cardinal Valentino come into his prison with that frank air of affability which he knew well how to assume when it could serve his purpose he explained to the prisoner the embarrassing situation in which the pope was placed from which the archbishop alone whom His Holiness looked upon as his best friend could save him The archbishop replied that he was entirely at the service of His Holiness Caesar on his entrance found the captive seated leaning his elbows on a table and he took a seat opposite him and explained the pope s position it was an embarrassing one At the very time of contracting so important an alliance with the house of Aragon as that of Lucrezia and Alfonso His Holiness could not avow to Ferdinand and Isabella that for the sake of a few miserable ducats he had signed a dispensation which would unite in the husband and wife together all the legitimate claims to a throne to which Ferdinand and Isabella had no right at all but that of conquest This avowal would necessarily put an end to all negotiations and the pontifical house would fall by the overthrow of that very pedestal which was to have heightened its grandeur Accordingly the archbishop would understand what the pope expected of his devotion and friendship it was a simple and straight avowal that he had supposed he might take it upon himself to accord the dispensation Then as the sentence to be passed on such an error would be the business of Alexander the accused could easily imagine beforehand how truly paternal such a sentence would be Besides the reward was in the same hands and if the sentence was that of a father the recompense would be that of a king In fact this recompense would be no less than the honour of assisting as envoy with the title of cardinal at the marriage of Lucrezia and Alfonso a favour which would be very appropriate since it would be thanks to his devotion that the marriage could take place The Archbishop of Cosenza knew the men he was dealing with he knew that to save their own ends they would hesitate at nothing he knew they had a poison like sugar to the taste and to the smell impossible to discover in food a poison that would kill slowly or quickly as the poisoner willed and would leave no trace behind he knew the secret of the poisoned key that lay always on the pope s mantelpiece so that when His Holiness wished to destroy some one of his intimates he bade him open a certain cupboard on the handle of the key there was a little spike and as the lock of the cupboard turned stiffly the hand would naturally press the lock would yield and nothing would have come of it but a trifling scratch the scratch was mortal He knew too that Caesar wore a ring made like two lions heads and that he would turn the stone on the inside when he was shaking hands with a friend Then the lions teeth became the teeth of a viper and the friend died cursing Borgia So he yielded partly through fear partly blinded by the thought of the reward and Caesar returned to the Vatican armed with a precious paper in which the Archbishop of Cosenza admitted that he was the only person responsible for the dispensation granted to the royal nun Two days later by means of the proofs kindly furnished by the archbishop the pope in the presence of the governor of Rome the auditor of the apostolic chamber the advocate and the fiscal attorney pronounced sentence condemning the archbishop to the loss of all his benefices and ecclesiastical offices degradation from his orders and confiscation of his goods his person was to be handed over to the civil arm Two days later the civil magistrate entered the prison to fulfil his office as received from the pope and appeared before the archbishop accompanied by a clerk two servants and four guards The clerk unrolled the paper he carried and read out the sentence the two servants untied a packet and stripping the prisoner of his ecclesiastical garments they reclothed him in a dress of coarse white cloth which only reached down to his knees breeches of the same and a pair of clumsy shoes Lastly the guards took him and led him into one of the deepest dungeons of the castle of Sant Angelo where for furniture he found nothing but a wooden crucifix a table a chair and a bed for occupation a Bible and a breviary with a lamp to read by for nourishment two pounds of bread and a little cask of water which were to be renewed every three days together with a bottle of oil for burning in his lamp At the end of a year the poor archbishop died of despair not before he had gnawed his own arms in his agony The very same day that he was taken into the dungeon Caesar Borgia who had managed the affair so ably was presented by the pope with all the belongings of the condemned prisoner But the hunting parties balls and masquerades were not the only pleasures enjoyed by the pope and his family from time to time strange spectacles were exhibited We will only describe two one of them a case of punishment the other no more nor less than a matter of the stud farm But as both of these give details with which we would not have our readers credit our imagination we will first say that they are literally translated from Burchard s Latin journal About the same time that is about the beginning of fourteen ninety nine a certain courtesan named La Corsetta was in prison and had a lover who came to visit her in woman s clothes a Spanish Moor called from his disguise the Spanish lady from Barbary As a punishment both of them were led through the town the woman without petticoat or skirt but wearing only the Moor s dress unbuttoned in front the man wore his woman s garb his hands were tied behind his back and the skirt fastened up to his middle with a view to complete exposure before the eyes of all When in this attire they had made the circuit of the town the Corsetta was sent back to the prison with the Moor But on the seventh of April following the Moor was again taken out and escorted in the company of two thieves towards the Campo dei Fiori The three condemned men were preceded by a constable who rode backwards on an ass and held in his hand a long pole on the end of which were hung still bleeding the amputated limbs of a poor Jew who had suffered torture and death for some trifling crime When the procession reached the place of execution the thieves were hanged and the unfortunate Moor was tied to a stake piled round with wood where he was to have been burnt to death had not rain fallen in such torrents that the fire would not burn in spite of all the efforts of the executioner This unlooked for accident taken as a miracle by the people robbed Lucrezia of the most exciting part of the execution but her father was holding in reserve another kind of spectacle to console her with later We inform the reader once more that a few lines we are about to set before him are a translation from the journal of the worthy German Burchard who saw nothing in the bloodiest or most wanton performances but facts for his journal which he duly registered with the impassibility of a scribe appending no remark or moral reflection On the eleventh of November a certain peasant was entering Rome with two stallions laden with wood when the servants of His Holiness just as he passed the Piazza of saint Peter s cut their girths so that their loads fell on the ground with the pack saddles and led off the horses to a court between the palace and the gate then the stable doors were opened and four stallions quite free and unbridled rushed out and in an instant all six animals began kicking biting and fighting each other until several were killed Roderigo and Madame Lucrezia who sat at the window just over the palace gate took the greatest delight in the struggle and called their courtiers to witness the gallant battle that was being fought below them Now Caesar s trick in the matter of the Archbishop of Cosenza had had the desired result and Isabella and Ferdinand could no longer impute to Alexander the signature of the brief they had complained of so nothing was now in the way of the marriage of Lucrezia and Alfonso this certainty gave the pope great joy for he attached all the more importance to this marriage because he was already cogitating a second between Caesar and Dona Carlota Frederic s daughter Caesar had shown in all his actions since his brother s death his want of vocation for the ecclesiastical life so no one was astonished when a consistory having been summoned one morning by Alexander Caesar entered and addressing the pope began by saying that from his earliest years he had been drawn towards secular pursuits both by natural inclination and ability and it had only been in obedience to the absolute commands of His Holiness that he entered the Church accepted the cardinal s scarlet other dignities and finally the sacred order of the diaconate but feeling that in his situation it was improper to follow his passions and at his age impossible to resist them he humbly entreated His Holiness graciously to yield to the desire he had failed to overcome and to permit him to lay aside the dress and dignities of the Church and enter once more into the world thereto contract a lawful marriage also he entreated the lord cardinals to intercede for him with His Holiness to whom he would freely resign all his churches abbeys and benefices as well as every other ecclesiastical dignity and preferment that had been accorded him The cardinals deferring to Caesar s wishes gave a unanimous vote and the pope as we may suppose like a good father not wishing to force his son s inclinations accepted his resignation and yielded to the petition thus Caesar put off the scarlet robe which was suited to him says his historian Tommaso Tommasi in one particular only that it was the colour of blood In truth the resignation was a pressing necessity and there was no time to lose Charles VIII one day after he had came home late and tired from the hunting field had bathed his head in cold water and going straight to table had been struck down by an apoplectic seizure directly after his supper and was dead leaving the throne to the good Louis XII a man of two conspicuous weaknesses one as deplorable as the other the first was the wish to make conquests the second was the desire to have children Alexander who was on the watch for all political changes had seen in a moment what he could get from Louis XII s accession to the throne and was prepared to profit by the fact that the new king of France needed his help for the accomplishment of his twofold desire Louis needed first his temporal aid in an expedition against the duchy of Milan on which as we explained before he had inherited claims from Valentina Visconti his grandmother and secondly his spiritual aid to dissolve his marriage with Jeanne the daughter of Louis XI a childless and hideously deformed woman whom he had only married by reason of the great fear he entertained for her father Now Alexander was willing to do all this for Louis XII and to give in addition a cardinal s hat to his friend George d Amboise provided only that the King of France would use his influence in persuading the young Dona Carlota who was at his court to marry his son Caesar So as this business was already far advanced on the day when Caesar doffed his scarlet and donned a secular garb thus fulfilling the ambition so long cherished when the lord of Villeneuve sent by Louis and commissioned to bring Caesar to France presented himself before the ex cardinal on his arrival at Rome the latter with his usual extravagance of luxury and the kindness he knew well how to bestow on those he needed entertained his guest for a month and did all the honours of Rome After that they departed preceded by one of the pope s couriers who gave orders that every town they passed through was to receive them with marks of honour and respect The same order had been sent throughout the whole of France where the illustrious visitors received so numerous a guard and were welcomed by a populace so eager to behold them that after they passed through Paris Caesar s gentlemen in waiting wrote to Rome that they had not seen any trees in France or houses or walls but only men women and sunshine The king on the pretext of going out hunting went to meet his guest two leagues outside the town As he knew Caesar was very fond of the name of Valentine which he had used as cardinal and still continued to employ with the title of Count although he had resigned the archbishopric which gave him the name he there and then bestowed an him the investiture of Valence in Dauphine with the title of Duke and a pension of twenty thousand francs then when he had made this magnificent gift and talked with him for nearly a couple of hours he took his leave to enable him to prepare the splendid entry he was proposing to make It was Wednesday the eighteenth of December fourteen ninety eight when Caesar Borgia entered the town of Chinon with pomp worthy of the son of a pope who is about to marry the daughter of a king The procession began with four and twenty mules caparisoned in red adorned with escutcheons bearing the duke s arms laden with carved trunks and chests inlaid with ivory and silver after them came four and twenty more also caparisoned this time in the livery of the King of France yellow and red next after these came ten other mules covered in yellow satin with red crossbars and lastly another ten covered with striped cloth of gold the stripes alternately raised and flat gold Behind the seventy mules which led the procession there pranced sixteen handsome battle horses led by equerries who marched alongside these were followed by eighteen hunters ridden by eighteen pages who were about fourteen or fifteen years of age sixteen of them were dressed in crimson velvet and two in raised gold cloth so elegantly dressed were these two children who were also the best looking of the little band that the sight of them gave rise to strange suspicions as to the reason for this preference if one may believe what Brantome says Finally behind these eighteen horses came six beautiful mules all harnessed with red velvet and led by six valets also in velvet to match The third group consisted of first two mules quite covered with cloth of gold each carrying two chests in which it was said that the duke s treasure was stored the precious stones he was bringing to his fiancee and the relics and papal bulls that his father had charged him to convey for him to Louis XII These were followed by twenty gentlemen dressed in cloth of gold and silver among whom rode Paul Giordano Orsino and several barons and knights among the chiefs of the state ecclesiastic Next came two drums one rebeck and four soldiers blowing trumpets and silver clarions then in the midst of a party of four and twenty lacqueys dressed half in crimson velvet and half in yellow silk rode Messire George d Amboise and Monseigneur the Duke of Valentinois Caesar was mounted on a handsome tall courser very richly harnessed in a robe half red satin and half cloth of gold embroidered all over with pearls and precious stones in his cap were two rows of rubies the size of beans which reflected so brilliant a light that one might have fancied they were the famous carbuncles of the Arabian Nights he also wore on his neck a collar worth at least two hundred thousand livres indeed there was no part of him even down to his boots that was not laced with gold and edged with pearls His horse was covered with a cuirass in a pattern of golden foliage of wonderful workmanship among which there appeared to grow like flowers nosegays of pearls and clusters of rubies Lastly bringing up the rear of the magnificent cortege behind the duke came twenty four mules with red caparisons bearing his arms carrying his silver plate tents and baggage What gave to all the cavalcade an air of most wonderful luxury and extravagance was that the horses and mules were shod with golden shoes and these were so badly nailed on that more than three quarters of their number were lost on the road For this extravagance Caesar was greatly blamed for it was thought an audacious thing to put on his horses feet a metal of which king s crowns are made But all this pomp had no effect on the lady for whose sake it had been displayed for when Dona Carlota was told that Caesar Bargia had come to France in the hope of becoming her husband she replied simply that she would never take a priest for her husband and moreover the son of a priest a man who was not only an assassin but a fratricide not only a man of infamous birth but still more infamous in his morals and his actions But in default of the haughty lady of Aragon Caesar soon found another princess of noble blood who consented to be his wife this was Mademoiselle d Albret daughter of the King of Navarre The marriage arranged on condition that the pope should pay two hundred thousand ducats dowry to the bride and should make her brother cardinal was celebrated on the tenth of May and on the Whitsunday following the Duke of Valentois received the order of saint Michael an order founded by Louis XI and esteemed at this period as the highest in the gift of the kings of France The news of this marriage which made an alliance with Louis XII certain was received with great joy by the pope who at once gave orders for bonfires and illuminations all over the town Louis XII was not only grateful to the pope for dissolving his marriage with Jeanne of France and authorizing his union with Anne of Brittany but he considered it indispensable to his designs in Italy to have the pope as his ally So he promised the Duke of Valentinois to put three hundred lances at his disposal as soon as he had made an entry into Milan to be used to further his own private interests and against whomsoever he pleased except only the allies of France The conquest of Milan should be undertaken so soon as Louis felt assured of the support of the Venetians or at least of their neutrality and he had sent them ambassadors authorised to promise in his name the restoration of Cremona and Ghiera d Adda when he had completed the conquest of Lombardy CHAPTER IX Everything from without was favouring Alexander s encroaching policy when he was compelled to turn his eyes from France towards the centre of Italy in Florence dwelt a man neither duke nor king nor soldier a man whose power was in his genius whose armour was his purity who owned no offensive weapon but his tongue and who yet began to grow more dangerous for him than all the kings dukes princes in the whole world could ever be this man was the poor Dominican monk Girolamo Savonarola the same who had refused absolution to Lorenzo dei Medici because he would not restore the liberty of Florence Girolamo Savonarola had prophesied the invasion of a force from beyond the Alps and Charles VIII had conquered Naples Girolamo Savonarola had prophesied to Charles VIII that because he had failed to fulfil the mission of liberator entrusted to him by God he was threatened with a great misfortune as a punishment and Charles was dead lastly Savonarola had prophesied his own fall like the man who paced around the holy city for eight days crying Woe to Jerusalem and on the ninth day Woe be on my own head None the less the Florentine reformer who could not recoil from any danger was determined to attack the colossal abomination that was seated on saint Peter s holy throne each debauch each fresh crime that lifted up its brazen face to the light of day or tried to hide its shameful head beneath the veil of night he had never failed to point out to the people denouncing it as the off spring of the pope s luxurious living and lust of power Thus had he stigmatised Alexander s new amour with the beautiful Giulia Farnese who in the preceding April had added another son to the pope s family thus had he cursed the Duke of Gandia s murderer the lustful jealous fratricide lastly he had pointed out to the Florentines who were excluded from the league then forming what sort of future was in store for them when the Borgias should have made themselves masters of the small principalities and should come to attack the duchies and republics It was clear that in Savonarola the pope had an enemy at once temporal and spiritual whose importunate and threatening voice must be silenced at any cost But mighty as the pope s power was to accomplish a design like this was no easy matter Savonarola preaching the stern principles of liberty had united to his cause even in the midst of rich pleasure loving Florence a party of some size known as the Piagnoni or the Penitents this band was composed of citizens who were anxious for reform in Church and State who accused the Medici of enslaving the fatherland and the Borgias of upsetting the faith who demanded two things that the republic should return to her democratic principles and religion to a primitive simplicity Towards the first of these projects considerable progress had been made since they had successively obtained first an amnesty for all crimes and delinquencies committed under other governments secondly the abolition of the balia which was an aristocratic magistracy thirdly the establishment of a sovereign council composed of eighteen hundred citizens and lastly the substitution of popular elections for drawing by lot and for oligarchical nominations these changes had been effected in spite of two other factions the Arrabiati or Madmen who consisting of the richest and noblest youths of the Florentine patrician families desired to have an oligarchical government and the Bigi or Greys so called because they always held their meetings in the shade who desired the return of the Medici The first measure Alexander used against the growing power of Savonarola was to declare him heretic and as such banished from the pulpit but Savonarola had eluded this prohibition by making his pupil and friend Domenico Bonvicini di Pescia preach in his stead The result was that the master s teachings were issued from other lips and that was all the seed though scattered by another hand fell none the less on fertile soil where it would soon burst into flower Moreover Savonarola now set an example that was followed to good purpose by Luther when twenty two years later he burned Leo X s bull of excommunication at Wittenberg he was weary of silence so he declared on the authority of Pope Pelagius that an unjust excommunication had no efficacy and that the person excommunicated unjustly did not even need to get absolution So on Christmas Day fourteen ninety seven he declared that by the inspiration of God he renounced his obedience to a corrupt master and he began to preach once more in the cathedral with a success that was all the greater for the interruption and an influence far more formidable than before because it was strengthened by that sympathy of the masses which an unjust persecution always inspires Then Alexander made overtures to Leonardo dei Medici vicar of the archbishopric of Florence to obtain the punishment of the rebel Leonardo in obedience to the orders he received from Rome issued a mandate forbidding the faithful to attend at Savonarola s sermons After this mandate any who should hear the discourses of the excommunicated monk would be refused communion and confession and as when they died they would be contaminated with heresy in consequence of their spiritual intercourse with a heretic their dead bodies would be dragged on a hurdle and deprived of the rights of sepulture Savonarola appealed from the mandate of his superior both to the people and to the Signoria and the two together gave orders to the episcopal vicar to leave Florence within two hours this happened at the beginning of the year fourteen ninety eight The expulsion of Leonard s dei Medici was a new triumph for Savonarola so wishing to turn to good moral account his growing influence he resolved to convert the last day of the carnival hitherto given up to worldly pleasures into a day of religious sacrifice So actually on Shrove Tuesday a considerable number of boys were collected in front of the cathedral and there divided into bands which traversed the whole town making a house to house visitation claiming all profane books licentious paintings lutes harps cards and dice cosmetics and perfumes in a word all the hundreds of products of a corrupt society and civilisation by the aid of which Satan at times makes victorious war on God The inhabitants of Florence obeyed and came forth to the Piazza of the Duoma bringing these works of perdition which were soon piled up in a huge stack which the youthful reformers set on fire singing religious psalms and hymns the while On this pile were burned many copies of Boccaccio and of Margante Maggiore and pictures by Fro Bartalommeo who from that day forward renounced the art of this world to consecrate his brush utterly and entirely to the reproduction of religious scenes A reform such as this was terrifying to Alexander so he resolved on fighting Savonarola with his own weapons that is by the force of eloquence He chose as the Dominican s opponent a preacher of recognised talent called Fra Francesco di Paglia and he sent him to Florence where he began to preach in Santa Croce accusing Savonarola of heresy and impiety At the same time the pope in a new brief announced to the Signaria that unless they forbade the arch heretic to preach all the goods of Florentine merchants who lived on the papal territory would be confiscated and the republic laid under an interdict and declared the spiritual and temporal enemy of the Church The Signoria abandoned by France and aware that the material power of Rome was increasing in a frightful manner was forced this time to yield and to issue to Savonarola an order to leave off preaching He obeyed and bade farewell to his congregation in a sermon full of strength and eloquence But the withdrawal of Savonarola so far from calming the ferment had increased it there was talk about his prophecies being fulfilled and some zealots more ardent than their master added miracle to inspiration and loudly proclaimed that Savonarola had offered to go down into the vaults of the cathedral with his antagonist and there bring a dead man to life again to prove that his doctrine was true promising to declare himself vanquished if the miracle were performed by his adversary These rumours reached the ears of Fra Francesco and as he was a man of warm blood who counted his own life as nothing if it might be spent to help his cause he declared in all humility that he felt he was too great a sinner for God to work a miracle in his behalf but he proposed another challenge he would try with Savonarola the ordeal of fire He knew he said that he must perish but at least he should perish avenging the cause of religion since he was certain to involve in his destruction the tempter who plunged so many souls beside his own into eternal damnation The proposition made by Fra Francesco was taken to Savanarola but as he had never proposed the earlier challenge he hesitated to accept the second hereupon his disciple Fra Domenico Bonvicini more confident than his master in his own power declared himself ready to accept the trial by fire in his stead so certain was he that God would perform a miracle by the intercession of Savonarola His prophet Instantly the report spread through Florence that the mortal challenge was accepted Savonarola s partisans all men of the strongest convictions felt no doubt as to the success of their cause His enemies were enchanted at the thought of the heretic giving himself to the flames and the indifferent saw in the ordeal a spectacle of real and terrible interest But the devotion of Fra Bonvicini of Pescia was not what Fra Francesco was reckoning with He was willing no doubt to die a terrible death but on condition that Savanarola died with him What mattered to him the death of an obscure disciple like Fra Bonvicini It was the master he would strike the great teacher who must be involved in his own ruin So he refused to enter the fire except with Savonarola himself and playing this terrible game in his own person would not allow his adversary to play it by proxy Then a thing happened which certainly no one could have anticipated In the place of Fra Francesco who would not tilt with any but the master two Franciscan monks appeared to tilt with the disciple These were Fra Nicholas de Pilly and Fra Andrea Rondinelli Immediately the partisans of Savonarola seeing this arrival of reinforcements for their antagonist came forward in a crowd to try the ordeal The Franciscans were unwilling to be behindhand and everybody took sides with equal ardour for one or other party All Florence was like a den of madmen everyone wanted the ordeal everyone wanted to go into the fire not only did men challenge one another but women and even children were clamouring to be allowed to try At last the Signoria reserving this privilege for the first applicants ordered that the strange duel should take place only between Fra Domenico Bonvicini and Fra Andrea Rondinelli ten of the citizens were to arrange all details the day was fixed for the seventh of April fourteen ninety eight and the place the Piazza del Palazzo The judges of the field made their arrangements conscientiously By their orders scaffolding was erected at the appointed place five feet in height ten in width and eighty feet long This scaffolding was covered with faggots and heath supported by cross bars of the very driest wood that could be found Two narrow paths were made two feet wide at most their entrance giving on the Loggia dei Lanzi their exit exactly opposite The loggia was itself divided into two by a partition so that each champion had a kind of room to make his preparations in just as in the theatre every actor has his dressing room but in this instance the tragedy that was about to be played was not a fictitious one The Franciscans arrived on the piazza and entered the compartment reserved for them without making any religious demonstration while Savonarola on the contrary advanced to his own place in the procession wearing the sacerdotal robes in which he had just celebrated the Holy Eucharist and holding in his hand the sacred host for all the world to see as it was enclosed in a crystal tabernacle Fra Domenico di Pescia the hero of the occasion followed bearing a crucifix and all the Dominican monks their red crosses in their hands marched behind singing a psalm while behind them again followed the most considerable of the citizens of their party bearing torches for sure as they were of the triumph of their cause they wished to fire the faggots themselves The piazza was so crowded that the people overflowed into all the streets around In every door and window there was nothing to be seen but heads ranged one above the other the terraces were covered with people and curious spectators were observed on the roof of the Duomo and on the top of the Campanile But brought face to face with the ordeal the Franciscans raised such difficulties that it was very plain the heart of their champion was failing him The first fear they expressed was that Fra Bonvicini was an enchanter and so carried about him some talisman or charm which would save him from the fire So they insisted that he should be stripped of all his clothes and put on others to be inspected by witnesses Fra Bonvicini made no objection though the suspicion was humiliating he changed shirt dress and cowl Then when the Franciscans observed that Savanarola was placing the tabernacle in his hands they protested that it was profanation to expose the sacred host to the risk of burning that this was not in the bond and if Bonvicini would not give up this supernatural aid they for their part would give up the trial altogether Savonarola replied that it was not astonishing that the champion of religion who put his faith in God should bear in his hands that very God to whom he entrusted his salvation But this reply did not satisfy the Franciscans who were unwilling to let go their contention Savonarola remained inflexible supporting his own right and thus nearly four hours passed in the discussion of points which neither party would give up and affairs remained in statu quo Meanwhile the people jammed together in the streets on the terraces on the roofs since break of day were suffering from hunger and thirst and beginning to get impatient their impatience soon developed into loud murmurs which reached even the champions ears so that the partisans of Savonarola who felt such faith in him that they were confident of a miracle entreated him to yield to all the conditions suggested To this Savonarola replied that if it were himself making the trial he would be less inexorable but since another man was incurring the danger he could not take too many precautions Two more hours passed while his partisans tried in vain to combat his refusals At last as night was coming on and the people grew ever more and more impatient and their murmurs began to assume a threatening tone Bonvicini declared that he was ready to walk through the fire holding nothing in his hand but a crucifix No one could refuse him this so Fra Rondinelli was compelled to accept his proposition The announcement was made to the populace that the champions had come to terms and the trial was about to take place At this news the people calmed down in the hope of being compensated at last for their long wait but at that very moment a storm which had long been threatening brake over Florence with such fury that the faggots which had just been lighted were extinguished by the rain leaving no possibility of their rekindling From the moment when the people suspected that they had been fooled their enthusiasm was changed into derision They were ignorant from which side the difficulties had arisen that had hindered the trial so they laid the responsibility on both champions without distinction The Signoria foreseeing the disorder that was now imminent ordered the assembly to retire but the assembly thought otherwise and stayed on the piazza waiting for the departure of the two champions in spite of the fearful rain that still fell in torrents Rondinelli was taken back amid shouts and hootings and pursued with showers of stones Savonarola thanks to his sacred garments and the host which he still carried passed calmly enough through the midst of the mob a miracle quite as remarkable as if he had passed through the fire unscathed But it was only the sacred majesty of the host that had protected this man who was indeed from this moment regarded as a false prophet the crowd allowed Savonarola to return to his convent but they regretted the necessity so excited were they by the Arrabbiati party who had always denounced him as a liar and a hypocrite So when the next morning Palm Sunday he stood up in the pulpit to explain his conduct he could not obtain a moment s silence for insults hooting and loud laughter Then the outcry at first derisive became menacing Savonarola whose voice was too weak to subdue the tumult descended from his pulpit retired into the sacristy and thence to his convent where he shut himself up in his cell At that moment a cry was heard and was repeated by everybody present To San Marco to San Marco The rioters few at first were recruited by all the populace as they swept along the streets and at last reached the convent dashing like an angry sea against the wall The doors closed on Savonarola s entrance soon crashed before the vehement onset of the powerful multitude which struck down on the instant every obstacle it met the whole convent was quickly flooded with people and Savonarola with his two confederates Domenico Bonvicini and Silvestro Maruffi was arrested in his cell and conducted to prison amid the insults of the crowd who always in extremes whether of enthusiasm or hatred would have liked to tear them to pieces and would not be quieted till they had exacted a promise that the prisoners should be forcibly compelled to make the trial of fire which they had refused to make of their own free will Alexander VI as we may suppose had not been without influence in bringing about this sudden and astonishing reaction although he was not present in person and had scarcely learned the news of Savonarola s fall and arrest when he claimed him as subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction But in spite of the grant of indulgences wherewith this demand was accompanied the Signoria insisted that Savonarola s trial should take place at Florence adding a request so as not to appear to withdraw the accused completely from the pontifical authority that the pope would send two ecclesiastical judges to sit in the Florentine tribunal Alexander seeing that he would get nothing better from the magnificent republic sent as deputies Gioacchino Turriano of Venice General of the Dominicans and Francesco Ramolini doctor in law they practically brought the sentence with them declaring Savonarola and his accomplices heretics schismatics persecutors of the Church and seducers of the people The firmness shown by the Florentines in claiming their rights of jurisdiction were nothing but an empty show to save appearances the tribunal as a fact was composed of eight members all known to be fervent haters of Savonarola whose trial began with the torture The result was that feeble in body constitutionally nervous and irritable he had not been able to endure the rack and overcome by agony just at the moment when the executioner had lifted him up by the wrists and then dropped him a distance of two feet to the ground he had confessed in order to get some respite that his prophecies were nothing more than conjectures If is true that so soon as he went back to prison he protested against the confession saying that it was the weakness of his bodily organs and his want of firmness that had wrested the lie from him but that the truth really was that the Lord had several times appeared to him in his ecstasies and revealed the things that he had spoken This protestation led to a new application of the torture during which Savonarola succumbed once more to the dreadful pain and once more retracted But scarcely was he unbound and was still lying on the bed of torture when he declared that his confessions were the fault of his torturers and the vengeance would recoil upon their heads and he protested yet once more against all he had confessed and might confess again A third time the torture produced the same avowals and the relief that followed it the same retractions The judges therefore when they condemned him and his two disciples to the flames decided that his confession should not be read aloud at the stake according to custom feeling certain that on this occasion also he would give it the lie and that publicly which as anyone must see who knew the versatile spirit of the public would be a most dangerous proceeding On the twenty third of May the fire which had been promised to the people before was a second time prepared on the Piazza del Palazzo and this time the crowd assembled quite certain that they would not be disappointed of a spectacle so long anticipated And towards eleven o clock in the morning Girolamo Savonarola Domenico Bonvicini and Silvestro Maruffi were led to the place of execution degraded of their orders by the ecclesiastical judges and bound all three to the same stake in the centre of an immense pile of wood Then the bishop Pagnanoli told the condemned men that he cut them off from the Church Ay from the Church militant said Savonarola who from that very hour thanks to his martyrdom was entering into the Church triumphant No other words were spoken by the condemned men for at this moment one of the Arrabbiati a personal enemy of Savonarola breaking through the hedge of guards around the scaffold snatched the torch from the executioner s hand and himself set fire to the four corners of the pile Savonarola and his disciples from the moment when they saw the smoke arise began to sing a psalm and the flames enwrapped them on all sides with a glowing veil while their religious song was yet heard mounting upward to the gates of heaven Pope Alexander VI was thus set free from perhaps the most formidable enemy who had ever risen against him and the pontifical vengeance pursued the victims even after their death the Signoria yielding to his wishes gave orders that the ashes of the prophet and his disciples should be thrown into the Arno But certain half burned fragments were picked up by the very soldiers whose business it was to keep the people back from approaching the fire and the holy relics are even now shown blackened by the flames to the faithful who if they no longer regard Savonarola as a prophet revere him none the less as a martyr CHAPTER X The French army was now preparing to cross the Alps a second time under the command of Trivulce Louis XII had come as far as Lyons in the company of Caesar Borgia and Giuliano della Rovere on whom he had forced a reconciliation and towards the beginning of the month of May had sent his vanguard before him soon to be followed by the main body of the army The forces he was employing in this second campaign of conquest were sixteen hundred lances five thousand Swiss nine thousand Gascons and three thousand five hundred infantry raised from all parts of France On the thirteenth of August this whole body amounting to nearly fifteen thousand men who were to combine their forces with the Venetians arrived beneath the walls of Arezzo and immediately laid siege to the town Ludovico Sforza s position was a terrible one he was now suffering from his imprudence in calling the French into Italy all the allies he had thought he might count upon were abandoning him at the same moment either because they were busy about their own affairs or because they were afraid of the powerful enemy that the Duke of Milan had made for himself Maximilian who had promised him a contribution of four hundred lances to make up for not renewing the hostilities with Louis XII that had been interrupted had just made a league with the circle of Swabia to war against the Swiss whom he had declared rebels against the Empire The Florentines who had engaged to furnish him with three hundred men at arms and two thousand infantry if he would help them to retake Pisa had just retracted their promise because of Louis XII s threats and had undertaken to remain neutral Frederic who was holding back his troops for the defence of his own States because he supposed not without reason that Milan once conquered he would again have to defend Naples sent him no help no men no money in spite of his promises Ludovico Sforza was therefore reduced to his own proper forces But as he was a man powerful in arms and clever in artifice he did not allow himself to succumb at the first blow and in all haste fortified Annona Novarro and Alessandria sent off Cajazzo with troops to that part of the Milanese territory which borders on the states of Venice and collected on the Po as many troops as he could But these precautions availed him nothing against the impetuous onslaught of the French who in a few days had taken Annona Arezzo Novarro Voghiera Castelnuovo Ponte Corona Tartone and Alessandria while Trivulce was on the march to Milan Seeing the rapidity of this conquest and their numerous victories Ludovico Sforza despairing of holding out in his capital resolved to retire to Germany with his children his brother Cardinal Ascanio Sforza and his treasure which had been reduced in the course of eight years from one million five hundred thousand to two hundred thousand ducats But before he went he left Bernardino da Carte in charge of the castle of Milan In vain did his friends warn him to distrust this man in vain did his brother Ascanio offer to hold the fortress himself and offer to hold it to the very last Ludovico refused to make any change in his arrangements and started on the second of September leaving in the citadel three thousand foot and enough provisions ammunition and money to sustain a siege of several months Two days after Ludovico s departure the French entered Milan Ten days later Bernardino da Come gave up the castle before a single gun had been fired Twenty one days had sufficed for the French to get possession of the various towns the capital and all the territories of their enemy Louis XII received the news of this success while he was at Lyons and he at once started for Milan where he was received with demonstrations of joy that were really sincere Citizens of every rank had come out three miles distance from the gates to receive him and forty boys dressed in cloth of gold and silk marched before him singing hymns of victory composed by poets of the period in which the king was styled their liberator and the envoy of freedom The great joy of the Milanese people was due to the fact that friends of Louis had been spreading reports beforehand that the King of France was rich enough to abolish all taxes And so soon as the second day from his arrival at Milan the conqueror made some slight reduction granted important favours to certain Milanese gentlemen and bestowed the town of Vigavano on Trivulce as a reward for his swift and glorious campaign But Caesar Borgia who had followed Louis XII with a view to playing his part in the great hunting ground of Italy scarcely waited for him to attain his end when he claimed the fulfilment of his promise which the king with his accustomed loyalty hastened to perform He instantly put at the disposal of Caesar three hundred lances under the command of Yves d Alegre and four thousand Swiss under the command of the bailiff of Dijon as a help in his work of reducing the Vicars of the Church We must now explain to our readers who these new personages were whom we introduce upon the scene by the above name During the eternal wars of Guelphs and Ghibelines and the long exile of the popes at Avignon most of the towns and fortresses of the Romagna had been usurped by petty tyrants who for the most part had received from the Empire the investiture of their new possessions but ever since German influence had retired beyond the Alps and the popes had again made Rome the centre of the Christian world all the small princes robbed of their original protector had rallied round the papal see and received at the hands of the pope a new investiture and now they paid annual dues for which they received the particular title of duke count or lord and the general name of Vicar of the Church It had been no difficult matter for Alexander scrupulously examining the actions and behaviour of these gentlemen during the seven years that had elapsed since he was exalted to saint Peter s throne to find in the conduct of each one of them something that could be called an infraction of the treaty made between vassals and suzerain accordingly he brought forward his complaints at a tribunal established for the purpose and obtained sentence from the judges to the effect that the vicars of the Church having failed to fulfil the conditions of their investiture were despoiled of their domains which would again become the property of the Holy See As the pope was now dealing with men against whom it was easier to pass a sentence than to get it carried out he had nominated as captain general the new Duke of Valentinois who was commissioned to recover the territories for his own benefit The lords in question were the Malatesti of Rimini the Sforza of Pesaro the Manfredi of Faenza the Riarii of Imola and Farli the Variani of Camerina the Montefeltri of Urbino and the Caetani of Sermoneta But the Duke of Valentinois eager to keep as warm as possible his great friendship with his ally and relative Louis XII was as we know staying with him at Milan so long as he remained there where after a month s occupation the king retraced his steps to his own capital the Duke of Valentinois ordered his men at arms and his Swiss to await him between Parma and Modena and departed posthaste for Rome to explain his plans to his father viva voce and to receive his final instructions When he arrived he found that the fortune of his sister Lucrezia had been greatly augmented in his absence not from the side of her husband Alfonso whose future was very uncertain now in consequence of Louis s successes which had caused some coolness between Alfonso and the pope but from her father s side upon whom at this time she exercised an influence more astonishing than ever The pope had declared Lucrezia Borgia of Aragon life governor of Spoleto and its duchy with all emoluments rights and revenues accruing thereunto This had so greatly increased her power and improved her position that in these days she never showed herself in public without a company of two hundred horses ridden by the most illustrious ladies and noblest knights of Rome Moreover as the twofold affection of her father was a secret to nobody the first prelates in the Church the frequenters of the Vatican the friends of His Holiness were all her most humble servants cardinals gave her their hands when she stepped from her litter or her horse archbishops disputed the honour of celebrating mass in her private apartments But Lucrezia had been obliged to quit Rome in order to take possession of her new estates and as her father could not spend much time away from his beloved daughter he resolved to take into his hands the town of Nepi which on a former occasion as the reader will doubtless remember he had bestowed on Ascanio Sforza in exchange for his suffrage Ascanio had naturally lost this town when he attached himself to the fortunes of the Duke of Milan his brother and when the pope was about to take it again he invited his daughter Lucrezia to join him there and be present at the rejoicings held in honour of his resuming its possession Lucrezia s readiness in giving way to her father s wishes brought her a new gift from him this was the town and territory of Sermoneta which belonged to the Caetani Of course the gift was as yet a secret because the two owners of the seigneury had first to be disposed of one being Monsignore Giacomo Caetano apostolic protonotary the other Prospero Caetano a young cavalier of great promise but as both lived at Rome and entertained no suspicion but indeed supposed themselves to be in high favour with His Holiness the one by virtue of his position the other of his courage the matter seemed to present no great difficulty So directly after the return of Alexander to Rome Giacomo Caetano was arrested on what pretext we know not was taken to the castle of Sant Angelo and there died shortly after of poison Prospero Caetano was strangled in his own house After these two deaths which both occurred so suddenly as to give no time for either to make a will the pope declared that Sermoneta and all of her property appertaining to the Caetani devolved upon the apostolic chamber and they were sold to Lucrezia for the sum of eighty thousand crowns which her father refunded to her the day after Though Caesar hurried to Rome he found when he arrived that his father had been beforehand with him and had made a beginning of his conquests Another fortune also had been making prodigious strides during Caesar s stay in France viz the fortune of Gian Borgia the pope s nephew who had been one of the most devoted friends of the Duke of Gandia up to the time of his death It was said in Rome and not in a whisper that the young cardinal owed the favours heaped upon him by His Holiness less to the memory of the brother than to the protection of the sister Both these reasons made Gian Borgia a special object of suspicion to Caesar and it was with an inward vow that he should not enjoy his new dignities very long that the Duke of Valentinois heard that his cousin Gian had just been nominated cardinal a latere of all the Christian world and had quitted Rome to make a circuit through all the pontifical states with a suite of archbishops bishops prelates and gentlemen such as would have done honour to the pope himself Caesar had only come to Rome to get news so he only stayed three days and then with all the troops His Holiness could supply rejoined his forces on the borders of the Euza and marched at once to Imola This town abandoned by its chiefs who had retired to Forli was forced to capitulate Imola taken Caesar marched straight upon Forli There he met with a serious check a check moreover which came from a woman Caterina Sforza widow of Girolamo and mother of Ottaviano Riario had retired to this town and stirred up the courage of the garrison by putting herself her goods and her person under their protection Caesar saw that it was no longer a question of a sudden capture but of a regular siege so he began to make all his arrangements with a view to it and placing a battery of cannon in front of the place where the walls seemed to him weakest he ordered an uninterrupted fire to be continued until the breach was practicable When he returned to the camp after giving this order he found there Gian Borgia who had gone to Rome from Ferrara and was unwilling to be so near Caesar without paying him a visit he was received with effusion and apparently the greatest joy and stayed three days on the fourth day all the officers and members of the court were invited to a grand farewell supper and Caesar bade farewell to his cousin charging him with despatches for the pope and lavishing upon him all the tokens of affection he had shown on his arrival Cardinal Gian Bargia posted off as soon as he left the supper table but on arriving at Urbino he was seized with such a sudden and strange indisposition that he was forced to stop but after a few minutes feeling rather better he went an scarcely however had he entered Rocca Cantrada when he again felt so extremely ill that he resolved to go no farther and stayed a couple of days in the town Then as he thought he was a little better again and as he had heard the news of the taking of Forli and also that Caterina Sforza had been taken prisoner while she was making an attempt to retire into the castle he resolved to go back to Caesar and congratulate him on his victory but at Fassambrane he was forced to stop a third time although he had given up his carriage for a litter This was his last halt the same day he sought his bed never to rise from it again three days later he was dead His body was taken to Rome and buried without any ceremony in the church of Santa Maria del Populo where lay awaiting him the corpse of his friend the Duke of Gandia and there was now no more talk of the young cardinal high as his rank had been than if he had never existed Thus in gloom and silence passed away all those who were swept to destruction by the ambition of that terrible trio Alexander Lucrezia and Caesar Almost at the same time Rome was terrified by another murder Don Giovanni Cerviglione a gentleman by birth and a brave soldier captain of the pope s men at arms was attacked one evening by the sbirri as he was on his way home from supping with Dan Elisio Pignatelli One of the men asked his name and as he pronounced it seeing that there was no mistake plunged a dagger into his breast while a second man with a back stroke of his sword cut off his head which lay actually at his feet before his body had time to fall The governor of Rome lodged a complaint against this assassination with the pope but quickly perceiving by the way his intimation was received that he would have done better to say nothing he stopped the inquiries he had started so that neither of the murderers was ever arrested But the rumour was circulated that Caesar in the short stay he had made at Rome had had a rendezvous with Cerviglione s wife who was a Borgia by birth and that her husband when he heard of this infringement of conjugal duty had been angry enough to threaten her and her lover too the threat had reached Caesar s ears who making a long arm of Michelotto had himself at Forli struck down Cerviglione in the streets of Rome Another unexpected death followed so quickly on that of Don Giovanni Cerviglione that it could not but be attributed to the same originator if not to the same cause Monsignore Agnelli of Mantua archbishop of Cosenza clerk of the chamber and vice legate of Viterbo having fallen into disgrace with His Holiness how it is not known was poisoned at his own table at which he had passed a good part of the night in cheerful conversation with three or four guests the poison gliding meanwhile through his veins then going to bed in perfect health he was found dead in the morning His possessions were at once divided into three portions the land and houses were given to the Duke of Valentinois the bishopric went to Francesco Borgia son of Calixtus III and the office of clerk of the chamber was sold for five thousand ducats to Ventura Bonnassai a merchant of Siena who produced this sum for Alexander and settled down the very same day in the Vatican This last death served the purpose of determining a point of law hitherto uncertain as Monsignore Agnelli s natural heirs had made some difficulty about being disinherited Alexander issued a brief whereby he took from every cardinal and every priest the right of making a will and declared that all their property should henceforth devolve upon him But Caesar was stopped short in the midst of his victories Thanks to the two hundred thousand ducats that yet remained in his treasury Ludovico Sforza had levied five hundred men at arms from Burgundy and eight thousand Swiss infantry with whom he had entered Lombardy So Trivulce to face this enemy had been compelled to call back Yves d Alegre and the troops that Louis XII had lent to Caesar consequently Caesar leaving behind a body of pontifical soldiery as garrison at Forli and Imola betook himself with the rest of his force to Rome It was Alexander s wish that his entry should be a triumph so when he learned that the quartermasters of the army were only a few leagues from the town he sent out runners to invite the royal ambassadors the cardinals the prelates the Roman barons and municipal dignitaries to make procession with all their suite to meet the Duke of Valentinois and as it always happens that the pride of those who command is surpassed by the baseness of those who obey the orders were not only fulfilled to the letter but beyond it The entry of Caesar took place on the twenty sixth of February fifteen hundred Although this was the great Jubilee year the festivals of the carnival began none the less for that and were conducted in a manner even more extravagant and licentious than usual and the conqueror after the first day prepared a new display of ostentation which he concealed under the veil of a masquerade As he was pleased to identify himself with the glory genius and fortune of the great man whose name he bore he resolved on a representation of the triumph of Julius Caesar to be given on the Piazzi di Navona the ordinary place for holding the carnival fetes The next day therefore he and his retinue started from that square and traversed all the streets of Rome wearing classical costumes and riding in antique cars on one of which Caesar stood clad in the robe of an emperor of old his brow crowned with a golden laurel wreath surrounded by lictors soldiers and ensign bearers who carried banners whereon was inscribed the motto Aut Caesar aut nihil Finally on the fourth Sunday in Lent the pope conferred upon Caesar the dignity he had so long coveted and appointed him general and gonfaloniere of the Holy Church In the meanwhile Sforza had crossed the Alps and passed the Lake of Como amid acclamations of joy from his former subjects who had quickly lost the enthusiasm that the French army and Louis s promises had inspired These demonstrations were so noisy at Milan that Trivulce judging that there was no safety for a French garrison in remaining there made his way to Navarra Experience proved that he was not deceived for scarcely had the Milanese observed his preparations for departure when a suppressed excitement began to spread through the town and soon the streets were filled with armed men This murmuring crowd had to be passed through sword in hand and lance in rest and scarcely had the French got outside the gates when the mob rushed out after the army into the country pursuing them with shouts and hooting as far as the banks of the Tesino Trivulce left four hundred lances at Navarra as well as the three thousand Swiss that Yves d Alegre had brought from the Romagna and directed his course with the rest of the army towards Mortara where he stopped at last to await the help he had demanded from the King of France Behind him Cardinal Ascanio and Ludovico entered Milan amid the acclamations of the whole town Neither of them lost any time and wishing to profit by this enthusiasm Ascanio undertook to besiege the castle of Milan while Ludovico should cross the Tesino and attack Navarra There besiegers and besieged were sons of the same nation for Yves d Alegre had scarcely as many as three hundred French with him and Ludovico five hundred Italians In fact for the last sixteen years the Swiss had been practically the only infantry in Europe and all the Powers came purse in hand to draw from the mighty reservoir of their mountains The consequence was that these rude children of William Tell put up to auction by the nations and carried away from the humble hardy life of a mountain people into cities of wealth and pleasure had lost not their ancient courage but that rigidity of principle for which they had been distinguished before their intercourse with other nations From being models of honour and good faith they had become a kind of marketable ware always ready for sale to the highest bidder The French were the first to experience this venality which later on proved so fatal to Ludovico Sforza Now the Swiss in the garrison at Navarra had been in communication with their compatriots in the vanguard of the ducal army and when they found that they who as a fact were unaware that Ludavico s treasure was nearly exhausted were better fed as well as better paid than themselves they offered to give up the town and go over to the Milanese if they could be certain of the same pay Ludovico as we may well suppose closed with this bargain The whole of Navarra was given up to him except the citadel which was defended by Frenchmen thus the enemy s army was recruited by three thousand men Then Ludovico made the mistake of stopping to besiege the castle instead of marching on to Mortara with the new reinforcement The result of this was that Louis XII to whom runners had been sent by Trivulce understanding his perilous position hastened the departure of the French gendarmerie who were already collected to cross into Italy sent off the bailiff of Dijon to levy new Swiss forces and ordered Cardinal Amboise his prime minister to cross the Alps and take up a position at Asti to hurry on the work of collecting the troops There the cardinal found a nest egg of three thousand men La Trimouille added fifteen hundred lances and six thousand French infantry finally the bailiff of Dijon arrived with ten thousand Swiss so that counting the troops which Trivulce had at Mortara Louis XII found himself master on the other side of the Alps of the first army any French king had ever led out to battle Soon by good marching and before Ludovico knew the strength or even the existence of this army it took up a position between Navarra and Milan cutting off all communication between the duke and his capital He was therefore compelled in spite of his inferior numbers to prepare for a pitched battle But it so happened that just when the preparations for a decisive engagement were being made on both sides the Swiss Diet learning that the sons of Helvetia were on the point of cutting one another s throats sent orders to all the Swiss serving in either army to break their engagements and return to the fatherland But during the two months that had passed between the surrender of Navarra and the arrival of the French army before the town there had been a very great change in the face of things because Ludovico Sforza s treasure was now exhausted New confabulations had gone on between the outposts and this time thanks to the money sent by Louis XII it was the Swiss in the service of France who were found to be the better fed and better paid The worthy Helvetians since they no longer fought for their own liberty knew the value of their blood too well to allow a single drop of it to be spilled for less than its weight in gold the result was that as they had betrayed Yves d Alegre they resolved to betray Ludovico Sforza too and while the recruits brought in by the bailiff of Dijon were standing firmly by the French flag careless of the order of the Diet Ludovico s auxiliaries declared that in fighting against their Swiss brethren they would be acting in disobedience to the Diet and would risk capital punishment in the end a danger that nothing would induce them to incur unless they immediately received the arrears of their pay The duke who had spent the last ducat he had with him and was entirely cut off from his capital knew that he could not get money till he had fought his way through to it and therefore invited the Swiss to make one last effort promising them not only the pay that was in arrears but a double hire But unluckily the fulfilment of this promise was dependent on the doubtful issue of a battle and the Swiss replied that they had far too much respect for their country to disobey its decree and that they loved their brothers far too well to consent to shed their blood without reward and therefore Sforza would do well not to count upon them since indeed the very next day they proposed to return to their homes The duke then saw that all was lost but he made a last appeal to their honour adjuring them at least to ensure his personal safety by making it a condition of capitulation But they replied that even if a condition of such a kind would not make capitulation impossible it would certainly deprive them of advantages which they had a right to expect and on which they counted as indemnification for the arrears of their pay They pretended however at last that they were touched by the prayers of the man whose orders they had obeyed so long and offered to conceal him dressed in their clothes among their ranks This proposition was barely plausible for Sforza was short and by this time an old man and he could not possibly escape recognition in the midst of an army where the oldest was not past thirty and the shortest not less than five foot six Still this was his last chance and he did not reject it at once but tried to modify it so that it might help him in his straits His plan was to disguise himself as a Franciscan monk so that mounted on a shabby horse he might pass for their chaplain the others Galeazzo di San Severing who commanded under him and his two brothers were all tall men so adopting the dress of common soldiers they hoped they might escape detection in the Swiss ranks Scarcely were these plans settled when the duke heard that the capitulation was signed between Trivulce and the Swiss who had made no stipulation in favour of him and his generals They were to go over the next day with arms and baggage right into the French army so the last hope of the wretched Ludovico and his generals must needs be in their disguise And so it was San Severino and his brothers took their place in the ranks of the infantry and Sforza took his among the baggage clad in a monk s frock with the hood pulled over his eyes The army marched off but the Swiss who had first trafficked in their blood now trafficked in their honour The French were warned of the disguise of Sforza and his generals and thus they were all four recognised and Sforza was arrested by Trimouille himself It is said that the price paid for this treason was the town of Bellinzona for it then belonged to the French and when the Swiss returned to their mountains and took possession of it Louis XII took no steps to get it back again When Ascanio Sforza who as we know had stayed at Milan learned the news of this cowardly desertion he supposed that his cause was lost and that it would be the best plan for him to fly before he found himself a prisoner in the hands of his brother s old subjects such a change of face on the people s part would be very natural and they might propose perhaps to purchase their own pardon at the price of his liberty so he fled by night with the chief nobles of the Ghibelline party taking the road to Piacenza an his way to the kingdom of Naples But when he arrived at Rivolta he remembered that there was living in that town an old friend of his childhood by name Conrad Lando whom he had helped to much wealth in his days of power and as Ascanio and his companions were extremely tired he resolved to beg his hospitality for a single night Conrad received them with every sign of joy putting all his house and servants at their disposal But scarcely had they retired to bed when he sent a runner to Piacenza to inform Carlo Orsini at that time commanding the Venetian garrison that he was prepared to deliver up Cardinal Ascanio and the chief men of the Milanese army Carlo Orsini did not care to resign to another so important an expedition and mounting hurriedly with twenty five men he first surrounded Conrad s house and then entered sword in hand the chamber wherein Ascanio and his companions lay and being surprised in the middle of their sleep they yielded without resistance The prisoners were taken to Venice but Louis XII claimed them and they were given up Thus the King of France found himself master of Ludovico Sforza and of Ascania of a legitimate nephew of the great Francesco Sforza named Hermes of two bastards named Alessandro and Cortino and of Francesco son of the unhappy Gian Galeazza who had been poisoned by his uncle Louis XII wishing to make an end of the whole family at a blow forced Francesco to enter a cloister shut up Cardinal Ascanio in the tower of Baurges threw into prison Alessandro Cartino and Hermes and finally after transferring the wretched Ludovico from the fortress of Pierre Eucise to Lys Saint George he relegated him for good and all to the castle of Loches where he lived for ten years in solitude and utter destitution and there died cursing the day when the idea first came into his head of enticing the French into Italy The news of the catastrophe of Ludovica and his family caused the greatest joy at Rome for while the French were consolidating their power in Milanese territory the Holy See was gaining ground in the Romagna where no further opposition was offered to Caesar s conquest So the runners who brought the news were rewarded with valuable presents and it was published throughout the whole town of Rome to the sound of the trumpet and drum The war cry of Louis France France and that of the Orsini Orso Orso rang through all the streets which in the evening were illuminated as though Constantinople or Jerusalem had been taken And the pope gave the people fetes and fireworks without troubling his head the least in the world either about its being Holy Week or because the Jubilee had attracted more than two hundred thousand people to Rome the temporal interests of his family seeming to him far more important than the spiritual interests of his subjects CHAPTER XI One thing alone was wanting to assure the success of the vast projects that the pope and his son were founding upon the friendship of Louis and an alliance with him that is money But Alexander was not the man to be troubled about a paltry worry of that kind true the sale of benefices was by now exhausted the ordinary and extraordinary taxes had already been collected for the whole year and the prospect of inheritance from cardinals and priests was a poor thing now that the richest of them had been poisoned but Alexander had other means at his disposal which were none the less efficacious because they were less often used The first he employed was to spread a report that the Turks were threatening an invasion of Christendom and that he knew for a positive fact that before the end of the summer Bajazet would land two considerable armies one in Romagna the other in Calabria he therefore published two bulls one to levy tithes of all ecclesiastical revenues in Europe of whatever nature they might be the other to force the Jews into paying an equivalent sum both bulls contained the severest sentences of excommunication against those who refused to submit or attempted opposition The second plan was the selling of indulgences a thing which had never been done before these indulgences affected the people who had been prevented by reasons of health or business from coming to Rome for the Jubilee the journey by this expedient was rendered unnecessary and sins were pardoned for a third of what it would have cost and just as completely as if the faithful had fulfilled every condition of the pilgrimage For gathering in this tax a veritable army of collectors was instituted a certain Ludovico delta Torre at their head The sum that Alexander brought into the pontifical treasury is incalculable and some idea of it may be gathered from the fact that seven hundred ninety nine thousand livres in gold was paid in from the territory of Venice alone But as the Turks did as a fact make some sort of demonstration from the Hungarian side and the Venetians began to fear that they might be coming in their direction they asked for help from the pope who gave orders that at twelve o clock in the day in all his States an Ave Maria should be said to pray God to avert the danger which was threatening the most serene republic This was the only help the Venetians got from His Holiness in exchange for the seven hundred ninety nine thousand livres in gold that he had got from them But it seemed as though God wished to show His strange vicar on earth that He was angered by the mockery of sacred things and on the Eve of saint Peter s Day just as the pope was passing the Capanile on his way to the tribune of benedictions an enormous piece of iron broke off and fell at his feet and then as though one warning had not been enough on the next day saint Peter s when the pope happened to be in one of the rooms of his ordinary dwelling with Cardinal Capuano and Monsignare Poto his private chamberlain he saw through the open windows that a very black cloud was coming up Foreseeing a thunderstorm he ordered the cardinal and the chamberlain to shut the windows He had not been mistaken for even as they were obeying his command there came up such a furious gust of wind that the highest chimney of the Vatican was overturned just as a tree is rooted up and was dashed upon the roof breaking it in smashing the upper flooring it fell into the very room where they were Terrified by the noise of this catastrophe which made the whole palace tremble the cardinal and Monsignore Poto turned round and seeing the room full of dust and debris sprang out upon the parapet and shouted to the guards at the gate The pope is dead the pope is dead At this cry the guards ran up and discovered three persons lying in the rubbish on the floor one dead and the other two dying The dead man was a gentleman of Siena called Lorenzo Chigi and the dying were two resident officials of the Vatican They had been walking across the floor above and had been flung down with the debris But Alexander was not to be found and as he gave no answer though they kept on calling to him the belief that he had perished was confirmed and very soon spread about the town But he had only fainted and at the end of a certain time he began to come to himself and moaned whereupon he was discovered dazed with the blow and injured though not seriously in several parts of his body He had been saved by little short of a miracle a beam had broken in half and had left each of its two ends in the side walls and one of these had formed a sort of roof over the pontifical throne the pope who was sitting there at the time was protected by this overarching beam and had received only a few contusions The two contradictory reports of the sudden death and the miraculous preservation of the pope spread rapidly through Rome and the Duke of Valentinois terrified at the thought of what a change might be wrought in his own fortunes by any slight accident to the Holy Father hurried to the Vatican unable to assure himself by anything less than the evidence of his own eyes Alexander desired to render public thanks to Heaven for the protection that had been granted him and on the very same day was carried to the church of Santa Maria del Popalo escorted by a numerous procession of prelates and men at arms his pontifical seat borne by two valets two equerries and two grooms In this church were buried the Duke of Gandia and Gian Borgia and perhaps Alexander was drawn thither by some relics of devotion or may be by the recollection of his love for his former mistress Rosa Vanazza whose image in the guise of the Madonna was exposed for the veneration of the faithful in a chapel on the left of the high altar Stopping before this altar the pope offered to the church the gift of a magnificent chalice in which were three hundred gold crowns which the Cardinal of Siena poured out into a silver paten before the eyes of all much to the gratification of the pontifical vanity But before he left Rome to complete the conquest of the Romagna the Duke of Valentinois had been reflecting that the marriage once so ardently desired between Lucrezia and Alfonso had been quite useless to himself and his father There was more than this to be considered Louis XII s rest in Lombardy was only a halt and Milan was evidently but the stage before Naples It was very possible that Louis was annoyed about the marriage which converted his enemy s nephew into the son in law of his ally Whereas if Alfonso were dead Lucrezia would be in the position to marry some powerful lord of Ferrara or Brescia who would be able to help his brother in law in the conquest of Romagna Alfonso was now not only useless but dangerous which to anyone with the character of the Borgias perhaps seemed worse the death of Alfonso was resolved upon But Lucrezia s husband who had understood for a long time past what danger he incurred by living near his terrible father in law had retired to Naples Since however neither Alexander nor Caesar had changed in their perpetual dissimulation towards him he was beginning to lose his fear when he received an invitation from the pope and his son to take part in a bull fight which was to be held in the Spanish fashion in honour of the duke before his departure In the present precarious position of Naples it would not have been good policy for Alfonso to afford Alexander any sort of pretext for a rupture so he could not refuse without a motive and betook himself to Rome It was thought of no use to consult Lucrezia in this affair for she had two or three times displayed an absurd attachment for her husband and they left her undisturbed in her government of Spoleto Alfonso was received by the pope and the duke with every demonstration of sincere friendship and rooms in the Vatican were assigned to him that he had inhabited before with Lucrezia in that part of the building which is known as the Torre Nuova Great lists were prepared on the Piazza of saint Peter s the streets about it were barricaded and the windows of the surrounding houses served as boxes for the spectators The pope and his court took their places on the balconies of the Vatican The fete was started by professional toreadors after they had exhibited their strength and skill Alfonso and Caesar in their turn descended to the arena and to offer a proof of their mutual kindness settled that the bull which pursued Caesar should be killed by Alfonso and the bull that pursued Alfonso by Caesar Then Caesar remained alone an horseback within the lists Alfonso going out by an improvised door which was kept ajar in order that he might go back on the instant if he judged that his presence was necessary At the same time from the opposite side of the lists the bull was introduced and was at the same moment pierced all over with darts and arrows some of them containing explosives which took fire and irritated the bull to such a point that he rolled about with pain and then got up in a fury and perceiving a man on horseback rushed instantly upon him It was now in this narrow arena pursued by his swift enemy that Caesar displayed all that skill which made him one of the finest horsemen of the period Still clever as he was he could not have remained safe long in that restricted area from an adversary against whom he had no other resource than flight had not Alfonso appeared suddenly just when the bull was beginning to gain upon him waving a red cloak in his left hand and holding in his right a long delicate Aragon sword It was high time the bull was only a few paces distant from Caesar and the risk he was running appeared so imminent that a woman s scream was heard from one of the windows But at the sight of a man on foot the bull stopped short and judging that he would do better business with the new enemy than the old one he turned upon him instead For a moment he stood motionless roaring kicking up the dust with his hind feet and lashing his sides with his tail Then he rushed upon Alfonso his eyes all bloodshot his horns tearing up the ground Alfonso awaited him with a tranquil air then when he was only three paces away he made a bound to one sides and presented instead of his body his sword which disappeared at once to the hilt the bull checked in the middle of his onslaught stopped one instant motionless and trembling then fell upon his knees uttered one dull roar and lying down on the very spot where his course had been checked breathed his last without moving a single step forward Applause resounded an all sides so rapid and clever had been the blow Caesar had remained on horseback seeking to discover the fair spectator who had given so lively a proof of her interest in him without troubling himself about what was going on his search had not been unrewarded for he had recognized one of the maids of honour to Elizabeth Duchess of Urbino who was betrothed to Gian Battista Carraciualo captain general of the republic of Venice It was now Alfonso s turn to run from the bull Caesar s to fight him the young men changed parts and when four mules had reluctantly dragged the dead bull from the arena and the valets and other servants of His Holiness had scattered sand over the places that were stained with blood Alfonso mounted a magnificent Andalusian steed of Arab origin light as the wind of Sahara that had wedded with his mother while Caesar dismounting retired in his turn to reappear at the moment when Alfonso should be meeting the same danger from which he had just now rescued him Then a second bull was introduced upon the scene excited in the same manner with steeled darts and flaming arrows Like his predecessor when he perceived a man on horseback he rushed upon him and then began a marvellous race in which it was impossible to see so quickly did they fly over the ground whether the horse was pursuing the bull or the bull the horse But after five or six rounds the bull began to gain upon the son of Araby for all his speed and it was plain to see who fled and who pursued in another moment there was only the length of two lances between them and then suddenly Caesar appeared armed with one of those long two handed swords which the French are accustomed to use and just when the bull almost close upon Don Alfonso came in front of Caesar he brandished the sword which flashed like lightning and cut off his head while his body impelled by the speed of the run fell to the ground ten paces farther on This blow was so unexpected and had been performed with such dexterity that it was received not with mere clapping but with wild enthusiasm and frantic outcry Caesar apparently remembering nothing else in his hour of triumph but the scream that had been caused by his former danger picked up the bull s head and giving it to one of his equerries ordered him to lay it as an act of homage at the feet of the fair Venetian who had bestowed upon him so lively a sign of interest This fete besides affording a triumph to each of the young men had another end as well it was meant to prove to the populace that perfect goodwill existed between the two since each had saved the life of the other The result was that if any accident should happen to Caesar nobody would dream of accusing Alfanso and also if any accident should happen to Alfonso nobody would dream of accusing Caesar There was a supper at the Vatican Alfonso made an elegant toilet and about ten o clock at night prepared to go from the quarters he inhabited into those where the pope lived but the door which separated the two courts of the building was shut and knock as he would no one came to open it Alfonso then thought that it was a simple matter for him to go round by the Piazza of saint Peter s so he went out unaccompanied through one of the garden gates of the Vatican and made his way across the gloomy streets which led to the stairway which gave on the piazza But scarcely had he set his foot on the first step when he was attacked by a band of armed men Alfonso would have drawn his sword but before it was out of the scabbard he had received two blows from a halberd one on his head the other on his shoulder he was stabbed in the side and wounded both in the leg and in the temple Struck down by these five blows he lost his footing and fell to the ground unconscious his assassins supposing he was dead at once remounted the stairway and found on the piazza forty horsemen waiting for them by them they were calmly escorted from the city by the Porta Portesa Alfonso was found at the point of death but not actually dead by some passers by some of whom recognised him and instantly conveyed the news of his assassination to the Vatican while the others lifting the wounded man in their arms carried him to his quarters in the Torre Nuova The pope and Caesar who learned this news just as they were sitting down to table showed great distress and leaving their companions at once went to see Alfonso to be quite certain whether his wounds were fatal or not and on the next morning to divert any suspicion that might be turned towards themselves they arrested Alfonso s maternal uncle Francesco Gazella who had come to Rome in his nephew s company Gazella was found guilty on the evidence of false witnesses and was consequently beheaded But they had only accomplished half of what they wanted By some means fair or foul suspicion had been sufficiently diverted from the true assassins but Alfonso was not dead and thanks to the strength of his constitution and the skill of his doctors who had taken the lamentations of the pope and Caesar quite seriously and thought to please them by curing Alexander s son in law the wounded man was making progress towards convalescence news arrived at the same time that Lucrezia had heard of her husband s accident and was starting to come and nurse him herself There was no time to lose and Caesar summoned Michelotto The same night says Burcardus Don Alfonso who would not die of his wounds was found strangled in his bed The funeral took place the next day with a ceremony not unbecoming in itself though unsuited to his high rank Dan Francesca Bargia Archbishop of Cosenza acted as chief mourner at saint Peter s where the body was buried in the chapel of Santa Maria delle Febbre Lucrezia arrived the same evening she knew her father and brother too well to be put on the wrong scent and although immediately after Alfonso s death the Duke of Valentinois had arrested the doctors the surgeons and a poor deformed wretch who had been acting as valet she knew perfectly well from what quarter the blow had proceeded In fear therefore that the manifestation of a grief she felt this time too well might alienate the confidence of her father and brother she retired to Nepi with her whole household her whole court and more than six hundred cavaliers there to spend the period of her mourning This important family business was now settled and Lucrezia was again a widow and in consequence ready to be utilized in the pope s new political machinations Caesar only stayed at Rome to receive the ambassadors from France and Venice but as their arrival was somewhat delayed and considerable inroads had been made upon the pope s treasury by the recent festivities the creation of twelve new cardinals was arranged this scheme was to have two effects viz to bring six hundred thousand ducats into the pontifical chest each hat having been priced at fifty thousand ducats and to assure the pope of a constant majority in the sacred council The ambassadors at last arrived the first was M de Villeneuve the same who had come before to see the Duke of Valentinois in the name of France Just as he entered Rome he met on the road a masked man who without removing his domino expressed the joy he felt at his arrival This man was Caesar himself who did not wish to be recognised and who took his departure after a short conference without uncovering his face M de Villeneuve then entered the city after him and at the Porta del Populo found the ambassadors of the various Powers and among them those of Spain and Naples whose sovereigns were not yet it is true in declared hostility to France though there was already some coolness The last named fearing to compromise themselves merely said to their colleague of France by way of complimentary address Sir you are welcome whereupon the master of the ceremonies surprised at the brevity of the greeting asked if they had nothing else to say When they replied that they had not M de Villeneuve turned his back upon them remarking that those who had nothing to say required no answer he then took his place between the Archbishop of Reggia governor of Rome and the Archbishop of Ragusa and made his way to the palace of the Holy Apostles which had been got ready for his reception Some days later Maria Giorgi ambassador extraordinary of Venice made his arrival He was commissioned not only to arrange the business on hand with the pope but also to convey to Alexander and Caesar the title of Venetian nobles and to inform them that their names were inscribed in the Golden Book a favour that both of them had long coveted less for the empty honour s sake than for the new influence that this title might confer Then the pope went on to bestow the twelve cardinals hats that had been sold The new princes of the Church were Don Diego de Mendoza archbishop of Seville Jacques archbishop of Oristagny the Pope s vicar general Thomas archbishop of Strigania Piero archbishop of Reggio governor of Rome Francesco Bargia archbishop of Cosenza treasurer general Gian archbishop of Salerno vice chamberlain Luigi Bargia archbishop of Valencia secretary to His Holiness and brother of the Gian Borgia whom Caesar had poisoned Antonio bishop of Coma Gian Battista Ferraro bishop of Modem Amedee d Albret son of the King of Navarre brother in law of the Duke of Valentinois and Marco Cornaro a Venetian noble in whose person His Holiness rendered back to the most serene republic the favour he had just received Then as there was nothing further to detain the Duke of Valentinois at Rome he only waited to effect a loan from a rich banker named Agostino Chigi brother of the Lorenzo Chigi who had perished on the day when the pope had been nearly killed by the fall of a chimney and departed for the Romagna accompanied by Vitellozzo Vitelli Gian Paolo Baglione and Jacopo di Santa Croce at that time his friends but later on his victims His first enterprise was against Pesaro this was the polite attention of a brother in law and Gian Sforza very well knew what would be its consequences for instead of attempting to defend his possessions by taking up arms or to venture on negotiations unwilling moreover to expose the fair lands he had ruled so long to the vengeance of an irritated foe he begged his subjects to preserve their former affection towards himself in the hope of better days to come and he fled into Dalmatia Malatesta lord of Rimini followed his example thus the Duke of Valentinois entered both these towns without striking a single blow Caesar left a sufficient garrison behind him and marched on to Faenza But there the face of things was changed Faenza at that time was under the rule of Astor Manfredi a brave and handsome young man of eighteen who relying on the love of his subjects towards his family had resolved on defending himself to the uttermost although he had been forsaken by the Bentivagli his near relatives and by his allies the Venetian and Florentines who had not dared to send him any aid because of the affection felt towards Caesar by the King of France Accordingly when he perceived that the Duke of Valentinois was marching against him he assembled in hot haste all those of his vassals who were capable of bearing arms together with the few foreign soldiers who were willing to come into his pay and collecting victual and ammunition he took up his position with them inside the town By these defensive preparations Caesar was not greatly disconcerted he commanded a magnificent army composed of the finest troops of France and Italy led by such men as Paolo and Giulio Orsini Vitellozzo Vitelli and Paolo Baglione not to speak of himself that is to say by the first captains of the period So after he had reconnoitred he at once began the siege pitching his camp between the two rivers Amana and Marziano placing his artillery on the side which faces on Forli at which point the besieged party had erected a powerful bastion At the end of a few days busy with entrenchments the breach became practicable and the Duke of Valentinois ordered an assault and gave the example to his soldiers by being the first to march against the enemy But in spite of his courage and that of his captains beside him Astor Manfredi made so good a defence that the besiegers were repulsed with great loss of men while one of their bravest leaders Honario Savella was left behind in the trenches But Faenza in spite of the courage and devotion of her defenders could not have held out long against so formidable an army had not winter come to her aid Surprised by the rigour of the season with no houses for protection and no trees for fuel as the peasants had destroyed both beforehand the Duke of Valentinois was forced to raise the siege and take up his winter quarters in the neighbouring towns in order to be quite ready for a return next spring for Caesar could not forgive the insult of being held in check by a little town which had enjoyed a long time of peace was governed by a mere boy and deprived of all outside aid and had sworn to take his revenge He therefore broke up his army into three sections sent one third to Imola the second to Forli and himself took the third to Cesena a third rate town which was thus suddenly transformed into a city of pleasure and luxury Indeed for Caesar s active spirit there must needs be no cessation of warfare or festivities So when war was interrupted fetes began as magnificent and as exciting as he knew how to make them the days were passed in games and displays of horsemanship the nights in dancing and gallantry for the loveliest women of the Romagna and that is to say of the whole world had come hither to make a seraglio for the victor which might have been envied by the Sultan of Egypt or the Emperor of Constantinople While the Duke of Valentinois was making one of his excursions in the neighbourhood of the town with his retinue of flattering nobles and titled courtesans who were always about him he noticed a cortege on the Rimini road so numerous that it must surely indicate the approach of someone of importance Caesar soon perceiving that the principal person was a woman approached and recognised the very same lady in waiting to the Duchess of Urbino who on the day of the bull fight had screamed when Caesar was all but touched by the infuriated beast At this time she was betrothed as we mentioned to Gian Carracciuola general of the Venetians Elizabeth of Gonzaga her protectress and godmother was now sending her with a suitable retinue to Venice where the marriage was to take place Caesar had already been struck by the beauty of this young girl when at Rome but when he saw her again she appeared more lovely than on the first occasion so he resolved on the instant that he would keep this fair flower of love for himself having often before reproached himself for his indifference in passing her by Therefore he saluted her as an old acquaintance inquired whether she were staying any time at Cesena and ascertained that she was only passing through travelling by long stages as she was awaited with much impatience and that she would spend the coming night at Forli This was all that Caesar cared to know he summoned Michelotto and in a low voice said a few words to him which were heard by no one else The cortege only made a halt at the neighbouring town as the fair bride had said and started at once for Forli although the day was already far advanced but scarcely had a league been covered when a troop of horsemen from Cesena overtook and surrounded them Although the soldiers in the escort were far from being in sufficient force they were eager to defend their general s bride but soon some fell dead and others terrified took to flight and when the lady came down from her litter to try to escape the chief seized her in his arms and set her in front of him on his horse then ordering his men to return to Cesena without him he put his horse to the gallop in a cross direction and as the shades of evening were now beginning to fall he soon disappeared into the darkness Carracciuolo learned the news through one of the fugitives who declared that he had recognised among the ravishers the Duke of Valentinois soldiers At first he thought his ears had deceived him so hard was it to believe this terrible intelligence but it was repeated and he stood for one instant motionless and as it were thunderstruck then suddenly with a cry of vengeance he threw off his stupor and dashed away to the ducal palace where sat the Doge Barberigo and the Council of Ten unannounced he rushed into their midst the very moment after they had heard of Caesar s outrage Most serene lords he cried I am come to bid you farewell for I am resolved to sacrifice my life to my private vengeance though indeed I had hoped to devote it to the service of the republic I have been wounded in the soul s noblest part in my honour The dearest thing I possessed my wife has been stolen from me and the thief is the most treacherous the most impious the most infamous of men it is Valentinois My lords I beg you will not be offended if I speak thus of a man whose boast it is to be a member of your noble ranks and to enjoy your protection it is not so he lies and his loose and criminal life has made him unworthy of such honours even as he is unworthy of the life whereof my sword shall deprive him In truth his very birth was a sacrilege he is a fratricide an usurper of the goods of other men an oppressor of the innocent and a highway assassin he is a man who will violate every law even the law of hospitality respected by the veriest barbarian a man who will do violence to a virgin who is passing through his own country where she had every right to expect from him not only the consideration due to her sex and condition but also that which is due to the most serene republic whose condottiere I am and which is insulted in my person and in the dishonouring of my bride this man I say merits indeed to die by another hand than mine Yet since he who ought to punish him is not for him a prince and judge but only a father quite as guilty as the son I myself will seek him out and I will sacrifice my own life not only in avenging my own injury and the blood of so many innocent beings but also in promoting the welfare of the most serene republic on which it is his ambition to trample when he has accomplished the ruin of the other princes of Italy The doge and the senators who as we said were already apprised of the event that had brought Carracciuolo before them listened with great interest and profound indignation for they as he told them were themselves insulted in the person of their general they all swore on their honour that if he would put the matter in their hands and not yield to his rage which could only work his own undoing either his bride should be rendered up to him without a smirch upon her bridal veil or else a punishment should be dealt out proportioned to the affront And without delay as a proof of the energy wherewith the noble tribunal would take action in the affair Luigi Manenti secretary to the Ten was sent to Imola where the duke was reported to be that he might explain to him the great displeasure with which the most serene republic viewed the outrage perpetrated upon their candottiere At the same time the Council of Ten and the doge sought out the French ambassador entreating him to join with them and repair in person with Manenti to the Duke of Valentinois and summon him in the name of King Louis XII immediately to send back to Venice the lady he had carried off The two messengers arrived at Imola where they found Caesar who listened to their complaint with every mark of utter astonishment denying that he had been in any way connected with the crime nay authorising Manenti and the French ambassador to pursue the culprits and promising that he would himself have the most active search carried on The duke appeared to act in such complete good faith that the envoys were for the moment hoodwinked and themselves undertook a search of the most careful nature They accordingly repaired to the exact spot and began to procure information On the highroad there had been found dead and wounded A man had been seen going by at a gallop carrying a woman in distress on his saddle he had soon left the beaten track and plunged across country A peasant coming home from working in the fields had seen him appear and vanish again like a shadow taking the direction of a lonely house An old woman declared that she had seen him go into this house But the next night the house was gone as though by enchantment and the ploughshare had passed over where it stood so that none could say what had become of her whom they sought for those who had dwelt in the house and even the house itself were there no longer Manenti and the French ambassador returned to Venice and related what the duke had said what they had done and how all search had been in vain No one doubted that Caesar was the culprit but no one could prove it So the most serene republic which could not considering their war with the Turks be embroiled with the pope forbade Caracciualo to take any sort of private vengeance and so the talk grew gradually less and at last the occurrence was no more mentioned But the pleasures of the winter had not diverted Caesar s mind from his plans about Faenza Scarcely did the spring season allow him to go into the country than he marched anew upon the town camped opposite the castle and making a new breach ordered a general assault himself going up first of all but in spite of the courage he personally displayed and the able seconding of his soldiers they were repulsed by Astor who at the head of his men defended the breach while even the women at the top of the rampart rolled down stones and trunks of trees upon the besiegers After an hour s struggle man to man Caesar was forced to retire leaving two thousand men in the trenches about the town and among the two thousand one of his bravest condottieri Valentino Farnese Then seeing that neither excommunications nor assaults could help him Caesar converted the siege into a blockade all the roads leading to Faenza were cut off all communications stopped and further as various signs of revolt had been remarked at Cesena a governor was installed there whose powerful will was well known to Caesar Ramiro d Orco with powers of life and death over the inhabitants he then waited quietly before Faenza till hunger should drive out the citizens from those walls they defended with such vehement enthusiasm At the end of a month during which the people of Faenza had suffered all the horrors of famine delegates came out to parley with Caesar with a view to capitulation Caesar who still had plenty to do in the Romagna was less hard to satisfy than might have been expected and the town yielded on condition that he should not touch either the persons or the belongings of the inhabitants that Astor Manfredi the youthful ruler should have the privilege of retiring whenever he pleased and should enjoy the revenue of his patrimony wherever he might be The conditions were faithfully kept so far as the inhabitants were concerned but Caesar when he had seen Astor whom he did not know before was seized by a strange passion for this beautiful youth who was like a woman he kept him by his side in his own army showing him honours befitting a young prince and evincing before the eyes of all the strongest affection for him one day Astor disappeared just as Caracciuolo s bride had disappeared and no one knew what had become of him Caesar himself appeared very uneasy saying that he had no doubt made his escape somewhere and in order to give credence to this story he sent out couriers to seek him in all directions A year after this double disappearance there was picked up in the Tiber a little below the Castle Sant Angelo the body of a beautiful young woman her hands bound together behind her back and also the corpse of a handsome youth with the bowstring he had been strangled with tied round his neck The girl was Caracciuolo s bride the young man was Astor During the last year both had been the slaves of Caesar s pleasures now tired of them he had had them thrown into the Tiber The capture of Faenza had brought Caesar the title of Duke of Romagna which was first bestowed on him by the pope in full consistory and afterwards ratified by the King of Hungary the republic of Venice and the Kings of Castile and Portugal The news of the ratification arrived at Rome on the eve of the day on which the people are accustomed to keep the anniversary of the foundation of the Eternal City this fete which went back to the days of Pomponius Laetus acquired a new splendour in their eyes from the joyful events that had just happened to their sovereign as a sign of joy cannon were fired all day long in the evening there were illuminations and bonfires and during part of the night the Prince of Squillace with the chief lords of the Roman nobility marched about the streets bearing torches and exclaiming Long live Alexander Long live Caesar Long live the Borgias Long live the Orsini Long live the Duke of Romagna CHAPTER XII Caesar s ambition was only fed by victories scarcely was he master of Faenza before excited by the Mariscotti old enemies of the Bentivoglio family he cast his eyes upon Bologna but Gian di Bentivoglio whose ancestors had possessed this town from time immemorial had not only made all preparations necessary for a long resistance but he had also put himself under the protection of France so scarcely had he learned that Caesar was crossing the frontier of the Bolognese territory with his army than he sent a courier to Louis XII to claim the fulfilment of his promise Louis kept it with his accustomed good faith and when Caesar arrived before Bologna he received an intimation from the King of France that he was not to enter on any undertaking against his ally Bentivoglio Caesar not being the man to have his plans upset for nothing made conditions for his retreat to which Bentivoglio consented only too happy to be quit of him at this price the conditions were the cession of Castello Bolognese a fortress between Imola and Faenza the payment of a tribute of nine thousand ducats and the keeping for his service of a hundred men at arms and two thousand infantry In exchange for these favours Caesar confided to Bentivoglio that his visit had been due to the counsels of the Mariscotti then reinforced by his new ally s contingent he took the road for Tuscany But he was scarcely out of sight when Bentivoglio shut the gates of Bologna and commanded his son Hermes to assassinate with his own hand Agamemnon Mariscotti the head of the family and ordered the massacre of four and thirty of his near relatives brothers sons daughters and nephews and two hundred other of his kindred and friends The butchery was carried out by the noblest youths of Bologna whom Bentivoglio forced to bathe their hands in this blood so that he might attach them to himself through their fear of reprisals Caesar s plans with regard to Florence were now no longer a mystery since the month of January he had sent to Pisa ten or twelve hundred men under the Command of Regniero della Sassetta and Piero di Gamba Corti and as soon as the conquest of the Romagna was complete he had further despatched Oliverotto di Fermo with new detachments His own army he had reinforced as we have seen by a hundred men at arms and two thousand infantry he had just been joined by Vitellozzo Vitelli lord of Citta di Castello and by the Orsini who had brought him another two or three thousand men so without counting the troops sent to Pisa he had under his control seven hundred men at arms and five thousand infantry Still in spite of this formidable company he entered Tuscany declaring that his intentions were only pacific protesting that he only desired to pass through the territories of the republic on his way to Rome and offering to pay in ready money for any victual his army might require But when he had passed the defiles of the mountains and arrived at Barberino feeling that the town was in his power and nothing could now hinder his approach he began to put a price on the friendship he had at first offered freely and to impose his own conditions instead of accepting those of others These were that Piero dei Medici kinsman and ally of the Orsini should be reinstated in his ancient power that six Florentine citizens to be chosen by Vitellozzo should be put into his hands that they might by their death expiate that of Paolo Vitelli unjustly executed by the Florentines that the Signoria should engage to give no aid to the lord of Piombino whom Caesar intended to dispossess of his estates without delay and further that he himself should be taken into the service of the republic for a pay proportionate to his deserts But just as Caesar had reached this point in his negotiations with Florence he received orders from Louis XII to get ready so soon as he conveniently could to follow him with his army and help in the conquest of Naples which he was at last in a position to undertake Caesar dared not break his word to so powerful an ally he therefore replied that he was at the king s orders and as the Florentines were not aware that he was quitting them on compulsion he sold his retreat for the sum of thirty six thousand ducats per annum in exchange for which sum he was to hold three hundred men at arms always in readiness to go to the aid of the republic at her earliest call and in any circumstances of need But hurried as he was Caesar still hoped that he might find time to conquer the territory of Piombino as he went by and take the capital by a single vigorous stroke so he made his entry into the lands of Jacopo IV of Appiano The latter he found however had been beforehand with him and to rob him of all resource had laid waste his own country burned his fodder felled his trees torn down his vines and destroyed a few fountains that produced salubrious waters 
4013_11734_000008_000002	train-clean-360	This did not hinder Caesar from seizing in the space of a few days Severeto Scarlino the isle of Elba and La Pianosa but he was obliged to stop short at the castle which opposed a serious resistance 
4013_11734_000008_000003	train-clean-360	As Louis XII s army was continuing its way towards Rome and he received a fresh order to join it he took his departure the next day leaving behind him Vitellozzo and Gian Paolo Bagliani to prosecute the siege in his absence 
4013_11734_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Louis XII was this time advancing upon Naples not with the incautious ardour of Charles VIII but on the contrary with that prudence and circumspection which characterised him 
none	none	Besides his alliance with Florence and Rome he had also signed a secret treaty with Ferdinand the Catholic who had similar pretensions through the house of Duras to the throne of Naples to those Louis himself had through the house of Anjou By this treaty the two kings were sharing their conquests beforehand Louis would be master of Naples of the town of Lavore and the Abruzzi and would bear the title of King of Naples and Jerusalem Ferdinand reserved for his own share Apulia and Calabria with the title of Duke of these provinces both were to receive the investiture from the pope and to hold them of him 
4013_11734_000009_000003	train-clean-360	This partition was all the more likely to be made in fact because Frederic supposing all the time that Ferdinand was his good and faithful friend would open the gates of his towns only to receive into his fortresses conquerors and masters instead of allies 
4013_11734_000009_000004	train-clean-360	All this perhaps was not very loyal conduct on the part of a king who had so long desired and had just now received the surname of Catholic but it mattered little to Louis who profited by treasonable acts he did not have to share 
none	none	The French army which the Duke of Valentinois had just joined consisted of one thousand lances four thousand Swiss and six thousand Gascons and adventurers further Philip of Rabenstein was bringing by sea six Breton and Provencal vessels and three Genoese caracks carrying six thousand five hundred invaders Against this mighty host the King of Naples had only seven hundred men at arms six hundred light horse and six thousand infantry under the command of the Colonna whom he had taken into his pay after they were exiled by the pope from the States of the Church but he was counting on Gonsalvo of Cordova who was to join him at Gaeta and to whom he had confidingly opened all his fortresses in Calabria 
4013_11734_000012_000000	train-clean-360	But the feeling of safety inspired by Frederic s faithless ally was not destined to endure long on their arrival at Rome the French and Spanish ambassadors presented to the pope the treaty signed at Grenada on the eleventh of November fifteen hundred between Louis XII and Ferdinand the Catholic a treaty which up to that time had been secret 
none	none	Alexander foreseeing the probable future had by the death of Alfonso loosened all the bonds that attached him to the house of Aragon and then began by making some difficulty about it 
4013_11734_000012_000002	train-clean-360	It was demonstrated that the arrangement had only been undertaken to provide the Christian princes with another weapon for attacking the Ottoman Empire and before this consideration one may readily suppose all the pope s scruples vanished on the twenty fifth of June therefore it was decided to call a consistory which was to declare Frederic deposed from the throne of Naples 
none	none	When Frederic heard all at once that the French army had arrived at Rome that his ally Ferdinand had deceived him and that Alexander had pronounced the sentence of his downfall he understood that all was lost but he did not wish it to be said that he had abandoned his kingdom without even attempting to save it So he charged his two new condottieri Fabrizio Calonna and Ranuzia di Marciano to check the French before Capua with three hundred men at arms some light horse and three thousand infantry in person he occupied Aversa with another division of his army while Prospero Colonna was sent to defend Naples with the rest and make a stand against the Spaniards on the side of Calabria 
4013_11734_000013_000000	train-clean-360	These dispositions were scarcely made when d Aubigny having passed the Volturno approached to lay siege to Capua and invested the town on both sides of the river 
none	none	Scarcely were the French encamped before the ramparts than they began to set up their batteries which were soon in play much to the terror of the besieged who poor creatures were almost all strangers to the town and had fled thither from every side expecting to find protection beneath the walls So although bravely repulsed by Fabrizio Colonna the French from the moment of their first assault inspired so great and blind a terror that everyone began to talk of opening the gates and it was only with great difficulty that Calonna made this multitude understood that at least they ought to reap some benefit from the check the besiegers had received and obtain good terms of capitulation When he had brought them round to his view he sent out to demand a parley with d Aubigny and a conference was fixed for the next day but one in which they were to treat of the surrender of the town But this was not Caesar Borgia s idea at all he had stayed behind to confer with the pope and had joined the French army with some of his troops on the very day on which the conference had been arranged for two days later and a capitulation of any nature would rob him of his share of the booty and the promise of such pleasure as would come from the capture of a city so rich and populous as Capua So he opened up negotiations on his own account with a captain who was on guard at one of the gates 
4013_11734_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Such negotiations made with cunning supported by bribery proved as usual more prompt and efficacious than any others 
4013_11734_000014_000003	train-clean-360	At the very moment when Fabrizio Colonna in a fortified outpost was discussing the conditions of capitulation with the French captains suddenly great cries of distress were heard 
none	none	These were caused by Borgia who without a word to anyone had entered the town with his faithful army from Romagna and was beginning to cut the throats of the garrison which had naturally somewhat relaxed their vigilance in the belief that the capitulation was all but signed 
4013_11734_000014_000005	train-clean-360	The French when they saw that the town was half taken rushed on the gates with such impetuosity that the besieged did not even attempt to defend themselves any longer and forced their way into Capua by three separate sides nothing more could be done then to stop the issue

none	none	During this interval Alexander had been visiting the scenes of his son s conquests and traversing all the Romagna with Lucrezia who was now consoled for her husband s death and had never before enjoyed quite so much favour with His Holiness so when she returned to Rome she no longer had separate rooms from him The result of this recrudescence of affection was the appearance of two pontifical bulls converting the towns of Nepi and Sermoneta into duchies one was bestowed on Gian Bargia an illegitimate child of the pope who was not the son of either of his mistresses Rosa Vanozza or Giulia Farnese the other on Don Roderigo of Aragon son of Lucrezia and Alfonso the lands of the Colonna were in appanage to the two duchies But Alexander was dreaming of yet another addition to his fortune this was to came from a marriage between Lucrezia and Don Alfonso d Este son of Duke Hercules of Ferrara in favour of which alliance Louis XII had negotiated 
4013_11734_000021_000000	train-clean-360	His Holiness was now having a run of good fortune and he learned on the same day that Piombino was taken and that Duke Hercules had given the King of France his assent to the marriage 
none	none	Both of these pieces of news were good for Alexander but the one could not compare in importance with the other and the intimation that Lucrezia was to marry the heir presumptive to the duchy of Ferrara was received with a joy so great that it smacked of the humble beginnings of the Borgian house The Duke of Valentinois was invited to return to Rome to take his share in the family rejoicing and on the day when the news was made public the governor of saint Angelo received orders that cannon should be fired every quarter of an hour from noon to midnight At two o clock Lucrezia attired as a fiancee and accompanied by her two brothers the Dukes of Valentinois and Squillace issued from the Vatican followed by all the nobility of Rome and proceeded to the church of the Madonna del Papalo where the Duke of Gandia and Cardinal Gian Borgia were buried to render thanks for this new favour accorded to her house by God and in the evening accompanied by the same cavalcade which shone the more brightly under the torchlight and brilliant illuminations she made procession through the whole town greeted by cries of Long live Pope Alexander VI Long live the Duchess of Ferrara which were shouted aloud by heralds clad in cloth of gold The next day an announcement was made in the town that a racecourse for women was opened between the castle of Sant Angelo and the Piazza of saint Peter s that on every third day there would be a bull fight in the Spanish fashion and that from the end of the present month which was October until the first day of Lent masquerades would be permitted in the streets of Rome Such was the nature of the fetes outside the programme of those going on within the Vatican was not presented to the people for by the account of Bucciardo an eye witness this is what happened On the last Sunday of the month of October fifty courtesans supped in the apostolic palace in the Duke of Valentinois rooms and after supper danced with the equerries and servants first wearing their usual garments afterwards in dazzling draperies when supper was over the table was removed candlesticks were set on the floor in a symmetrical pattern and a great quantity of chestnuts was scattered on the ground these the fifty women skilfully picked up running about gracefully in and out between the burning lights the pope the Duke of Valentinois and his sister Lucrezia who were looking on at this spectacle from a gallery encouraged the most agile and industrious with their applause and they received prizes of embroidered garters velvet boots golden caps and laces then new diversions took the place of these

none	none	Some days after this strange night which calls to mind the Roman evenings in the days of Tiberius Nero and Heliogabalus Lucrezia clad in a robe of golden brocade her train carried by young girls dressed in white and crowned with roses issued from her palace to the sound of trumpets and clarions and made her way over carpets that were laid down in the streets through which she had to pass Accompanied by the noblest cavaliers and the loveliest women in Rome she betook herself to the Vatican where in the Pauline hall the pope awaited her with the Duke of Valentinois Don Ferdinand acting as proxy for Duke Alfonso and his cousin Cardinal d Este The pope sat on one side of the table while the envoys from Ferrara stood on the other into their midst came Lucrezia and Don Ferdinand placed on her finger the nuptial ring this ceremony over Cardinal d Este approached and presented to the bride four magnificent rings set with precious stones then a casket was placed on the table richly inlaid with ivory whence the cardinal drew forth a great many trinkets chains necklaces of pearls and diamonds of workmanship as costly as their material these he also begged Lucrezia to accept before she received those the bridegroom was hoping to offer himself which would be more worthy of her 
4013_11734_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Lucrezia showed the utmost delight in accepting these gifts then she retired into the next room leaning on the pope s arm and followed by the ladies of her suite leaving the Duke of Valentinois to do the honours of the Vatican to the men 
4013_11734_000026_000004	train-clean-360	That evening the guests met again and spent half the night in dancing while a magnificent display of fireworks lighted up the Piazza of San Paolo 
none	none	The ceremony of betrothal over the pope and the Duke busied themselves with making preparations for the departure The pope who wished the journey to be made with a great degree of splendour sent in his daughter s company in addition to the two brothers in law and the gentlemen in their suite the Senate of Rome and all the lords who by virtue of their wealth could display most magnificence in their costumes and liveries Among this brilliant throng might be seen Olivero and Ramiro Mattel sons of Piero Mattel chancellor of the town and a daughter of the pope whose mother was not Rosa Vanozza besides these the pope nominated in consistory Francesco Borgia Cardinal of Sosenza legate a latere to accompany his daughter to the frontiers of the Ecclesiastical States Also the Duke of Valentinois sent out messengers into all the cities of Romagna to order that Lucrezia should be received as sovereign lady and mistress grand preparations were at once set on foot for the fulfilment of his orders But the messengers reported that they greatly feared that there would be some grumbling at Cesena where it will be remembered that Caesar had left Ramiro d Orco as governor with plenary powers to calm the agitation of the town Now Ramiro d Orco had accomplished his task so well that there was nothing more to fear in the way of rebellion for one sixth of the inhabitants had perished on the scaffold and the result of this situation was that it was improbable that the same demonstrations of joy could be expected from a town plunged in mourning that were looked for from Imala Faenza and Pesaro The Duke of Valentinais averted this inconvenience in the prompt and efficacious fashion characteristic of him alone One morning the inhabitants of Cesena awoke to find a scaffold set up in the square and upon it the four quarters of a man his head severed from the trunk stuck up on the end of a pike 
4013_11734_000029_000000	train-clean-360	This man was Ramiro d Orco 
none	none	No one ever knew by whose hands the scaffold had been raised by night nor by what executioners the terrible deed had been carried out but when the Florentine Republic sent to ask Macchiavelli their ambassador at Cesena what he thought of it he replied MAGNIFICENT LORDS I can tell you nothing concerning the execution of Ramiro d Orco except that Caesar Borgia is the prince who best knows how to make and unmake men according to their deserts NICCOLO MACCHIAVELLI The Duke of Valentinois was not disappointed and the future Duchess of Ferrara was admirably received in every town along her route and particularly at Cesena While Lucrezia was on her way to Ferrara to meet her fourth husband Alexander and the Duke of Valentinois resolved to make a progress in the region of their last conquest the duchy of Piombino 
4013_11734_000033_000001	train-clean-360	The apparent object of this journey was that the new subjects might take their oath to Caesar and the real object was to form an arsenal in Jacopo d Appiano s capital within reach of Tuscany a plan which neither the pope nor his son had ever seriously abandoned 
none	none	The two accordingly started from the port of Corneto with six ships accompanied by a great number of cardinals and prelates and arrived the same evening at Piombina 
4013_11734_000033_000003	train-clean-360	The pontifical court made a stay there of several days partly with a view of making the duke known to the inhabitants and also in order to be present at certain ecclesiastical functions of which the most important was a service held on the third Sunday in Lent in which the Cardinal of Cosenza sang a mass and the pope officiated in state with the duke and the cardinals 
4013_11734_000033_000004	train-clean-360	After these solemn functions the customary pleasures followed and the pope summoned the prettiest girls of the country and ordered them to dance their national dances before him 
4013_11734_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Following on these dances came feasts of unheard of magnificence during which the pope in the sight of all men completely ignored Lent and did not fast 
4013_11734_000034_000001	train-clean-360	The object of all these fetes was to scatter abroad a great deal of money and so to make the Duke of Valentinois popular while poor Jacopo d Appiano was forgotten 
none	none	When they left Piombino the pope and his son visited the island of Elba where they only stayed long enough to visit the old fortifications and issue orders for the building of new ones Then the illustrious travellers embarked on their return journey to Rome but scarcely had they put out to sea when the weather became adverse and the pope not wishing to put in at Porto Ferrajo they remained five days on board though they had only two days provisions During the last three days the pope lived on fried fish that were caught under great difficulties because of the heavy weather 
4013_11734_000036_000001	train-clean-360	At last they arrived in sight of Corneto and there the duke who was not on the same vessel as the pope seeing that his ship could not get in had a boat put out and so was taken ashore 
none	none	The pope was obliged to continue on his way towards Pontercole where at last he arrived after encountering so violent a tempest that all who were with him were utterly subdued either by sickness or by the terror of death The pope alone did not show one instant s fear but remained on the bridge during the storm sitting on his arm chair invoking the name of Jesus and making the sign of the cross At last his ship entered the roads of Pontercole where he landed and after sending to Corneto to fetch horses he rejoined the duke who was there awaiting him They then returned by slow stages by way of Civita Vecchia and Palo and reached Rome after an absence of a month 
4013_11734_000036_000006	train-clean-360	Almost at the same time d Albret arrived in quest of his cardinal s hat 
none	none	He was accompanied by two princes of the house of Navarre who were received with not only those honours which beseemed their rank but also as brothers in law to whom the duke was eager to show in what spirit he was contracting this alliance CHAPTER XIII The time had now come for the Duke of Valentinois to continue the pursuit of his conquests So since on the first of May in the preceding year the pope had pronounced sentence of forfeiture in full consistory against Julius Caesar of Varano as punishment for the murder of his brother Rudolph and for the harbouring of the pope s enemies and he had accordingly been mulcted of his fief of Camerino which was to be handed over to the apostolic chamber Caesar left Rome to put the sentence in execution Consequently when he arrived on the frontiers of Perugia which belonged to his lieutenant Gian Paolo Baglioni he sent Oliverotta da Fermo and Orsini of Gravina to lay waste the March of Camerino at the same time petitioning Guido d Ubaldo di Montefeltro Duke of Urbino to lend his soldiers and artillery to help him in this enterprise This the unlucky Duke of Urbino who enjoyed the best possible relations with the pope and who had no reason for distrusting Caesar did not dare refuse But on the very same day that the Duke of Urbina s troops started for Camerino Caesar s troops entered the duchy of Urbino and took possession of Cagli one of the four towns of the little State The Duke of Urbino knew what awaited him if he tried to resist and fled incontinently disguised as a peasant thus in less than eight days Caesar was master of his whole duchy except the fortresses of Maiolo and San Leone The Duke of Valentinois forthwith returned to Camerino where the inhabitants still held out encouraged by the presence of Julius Caesar di Varano their lord and his two sons Venantio and Hannibal the eldest son Gian Maria had been sent by his father to Venice The presence of Caesar was the occasion of parleying between the besiegers and besieged A capitulation was arranged whereby Varano engaged to give up the town on condition that he and his sons were allowed to retire safe and sound taking with them their furniture treasure and carriages But this was by no means Caesar s intention so profiting by the relaxation in vigilance that had naturally come about in the garrison when the news of the capitulation had been announced he surprised the town in the night preceding the surrender and seized Caesar di Varano and his two sons who were strangled a short time after the father at La Pergola and the sons at Pesaro by Don Michele Correglio who though he had left the position of sbirro for that of a captain every now and then returned to his first business Meanwhile Vitellozzo Vitelli who had assumed the title of General of the Church and had under him eight hundred men at arms and three thousand infantry was following the secret instructions that he had received from Caesar by word of mouth and was carrying forward that system of invasion which was to encircle Florence in a network of iron and in the end make her defence an impossibility A worthy pupil of his master in whose school he had learned to use in turn the cunning of a fox and the strength of a lion he had established an understanding between himself and certain young gentlemen of Arezzo to get that town delivered into his hands But the plot had been discovered by Guglielma dei Pazzi commissary of the Florentine Republic and he had arrested two of the conspirators whereupon the others who were much more numerous than was supposed had instantly dispersed about the town summoning the citizens to arms All the republican faction who saw in any sort of revolution the means of subjugating Florence joined their party set the captives at liberty and seized Guglielmo then proclaiming the establishment of the ancient constitution they besieged the citadel whither Cosimo dei Pazzi Bishop of Arezzo the son of Guglielmo had fled for refuge he finding himself invested on every side sent a messenger in hot haste to Florence to ask for help Unfortunately for the cardinal Vitellozzo s troops were nearer to the besiegers than were the soldiers of the most serene republic to the besieged and instead of help the whole army of the enemy came down upon him This army was under the command of Vitellozzo of Gian Paolo Baglioni and of Fabio Orsino and with them were the two Medici ever ready to go wherever there was a league against Florence and ever ready at the command of Borgia on any conditions whatever to re enter the town whence they had been banished The next day more help in the form of money and artillery arrived sent by Pandolfo Petrucci and on the eighteenth of June the citadel of Arezzo which had received no news from Florence was obliged to surrender Vitellozzo left the men of Arezzo to look after their town themselves leaving also Fabio Orsina to garrison the citadel with a thousand men Then profiting by the terror that had been spread throughout all this part of Italy by the successive captures of the duchy of Urbino of Camerino and of Arezzo he marched upon Monte San Severino Castiglione Aretino Cortone and the other towns of the valley of Chiana which submitted one after the other almost without a struggle When he was only ten or twelve leagues from Florence and dared not on his own account attempt anything against her he made known the state of affairs to the Duke of Valentinois He fancying the hour had came at last for striking the blow so long delayed started off at once to deliver his answer in person to his faithful lieutenants But the Florentines though they had sent no help to Guglielmo dei Pazzi had demanded aid from Chaumont Dumbest governor of the Milanese on behalf of Louis XII not only explaining the danger they themselves were in but also Caesar s ambitious projects namely that after first overcoming the small principalities and then the states of the second order he had now it seemed reached such a height of pride that he would attack the King of France himself The news from Naples was disquieting serious differences had already occurred between the Count of Armagnac and Gonzalva di Cordova and Louis might any day need Florence whom he had always found loyal and faithful He therefore resolved to check Caesar s progress and not only sent him orders to advance no further step forwards but also sent off to give effect to his injunction the captain Imbaut with four hundred lances The Duke of Valentinois on the frontier of Tuscany received a copy of the treaty signed between the republic and the King of France a treaty in which the king engaged to help his ally against any enemy whatsoever and at the same moment the formal prohibition from Louis to advance any further Caesar also learned that beside the four hundred lances with the captain Imbaut which were on the road to Florence Louis XII had as soon as he reached Asti sent off to Parma Louis de la Trimouille and two hundred men at arms three thousand Swiss and a considerable train of artillery In these two movements combined he saw hostile intentions towards himself and turning right about face with his usual agility he profited by the fact that he had given nothing but verbal instructions to all his lieutenants and wrote a furious letter to Vitellozzo reproaching him for compromising his master with a view to his own private interest and ordering the instant surrender to the Florentines of the towns and fortresses he had taken threatening to march down with his own troops and take them if he hesitated for a moment As soon as this letter was written Caesar departed for Milan where Louis XII had just arrived bringing with him proof positive that he had been calumniated in the evacuation of the conquered towns He also was entrusted with the pope s mission to renew for another eighteen months the title of legate a latere in France to Cardinal dumbest the friend rather than the minister of Louis XII Thus thanks to the public proof of his innocence and the private use of his influence Caesar soon made his peace with the King of France But this was not all It was in the nature of Caesar s genius to divert an impending calamity that threatened his destruction so as to come out of it better than before and he suddenly saw the advantage he might take from the pretended disobedience of his lieutenants Already he had been disturbed now and again by their growing power and coveted their towns now he thought the hour had perhaps come for suppressing them also and in the usurpation of their private possessions striking a blow at Florence who always escaped him at the very moment when he thought to take her It was indeed an annoying thing to have these fortresses and towns displaying another banner than his own in the midst of the beautiful Romagna which he desired for his own kingdom For Vitellozzo possessed Citta di Castello Bentivoglio Bologna Gian Paolo Baglioni was in command of Perugia Oliverotto had just taken Fermo and Pandolfo Petrucci was lord of Siena it was high time that all these returned into his own hands The lieutenants of the Duke of Valentinois like Alexander s were becoming too powerful and Borgia must inherit from them unless he were willing to let them become his own heirs He obtained from Louis XII three hundred lances wherewith to march against them As soon as Vitellozzo Vitelli received Caesar s letter he perceived that he was being sacrificed to the fear that the King of France inspired but he was not one of those victims who suffer their throats to be cut in the expiation of a mistake he was a buffalo of Romagna who opposed his horns to the knife of the butcher besides he had the example of Varano and the Manfredi before him and death for death he preferred to perish in arms So Vitellozzo convoked at Maggione all whose lives or lands were threatened by this new reversal of Caesar s policy These were Paolo Orsino Gian Paolo Baglioni Hermes Bentivoglio representing his father Gian Antonio di Venafro the envoy of Pandolfo Petrucci Olivertoxo da Fermo and the Duke of Urbino the first six had everything to lose and the last had already lost everything A treaty of alliance was signed between the confederates they engaged to resist whether he attacked them severally or all together Caesar learned the existence of this league by its first effects the Duke of Urbino who was adored by his subjects had come with a handful of soldiers to the fortress of San Leone and it had yielded at once In less than a week towns and fortresses followed this example and all the duchy was once more in the hands of the Duke of Urbino At the same time each member of the confederacy openly proclaimed his revolt against the common enemy and took up a hostile attitude Caesar was at Imola awaiting the French troops but with scarcely any men so that Bentivoglio who held part of the country and the Duke of Urbino who had just reconquered the rest of it could probably have either taken him or forced him to fly and quit the Romagna had they marched against him all the more since the two men on whom he counted viz Don Ugo di Cardona who had entered his service after Capua was taken and Michelotto had mistaken his intention and were all at once separated from him He had really ordered them to fall back upon Rimini and bring two hundred light horse and five hundred infantry of which they had the command but unaware of the urgency of his situation at the very moment when they were attempting to surprise La Pergola and Fossombrone they were surrounded by Orsino of Gravina and Vitellozzo Ugo di Cardona and Michelotto defended themselves like lions but in spite of their utmost efforts their little band was cut to pieces and Ugo di Cardona taken prisoner while Michelotto only escaped the same fate by lying down among the dead when night came on he escaped to Fano But even alone as he was almost without troops at Imola the confederates dared attempt nothing against Caesar whether because of the personal fear he inspired or because in him they respected the ally of the King of France they contented themselves with taking the towns and fortresses in the neighbourhood Vitellozzo had retaken the fortresses of Fossombrone Urbino Cagli and Aggobbio Orsino of Gravina had reconquered Fano and the whole province while Gian Maria de Varano the same who by his absence had escaped being massacred with the rest of his family had re entered Camerino borne in triumph by his people Not even all this could destroy Caesar s confidence in his own good fortune and while he was on the one hand urging on the arrival of the French troops and calling into his pay all those gentlemen known as broken lances because they went about the country in parties of five or six only and attached themselves to anyone who wanted them he had opened up negotiations with his enemies certain that from that very day when he should persuade them to a conference they were undone Indeed Caesar had the power of persuasion as a gift from heaven and though they perfectly well knew his duplicity they had no power of resisting not so much his actual eloquence as that air of frank good nature which Macchiavelli so greatly admired and which indeed more than once deceived even him wily politician as he was In order to get Paolo Orsino to treat with him at Imola Caesar sent Cardinal Borgia to the confederates as a hostage and on this Paolo Orsino hesitated no longer and on the twenty fifth of October fifteen oh two arrived at Imola Caesar received him as an old friend from whom one might have been estranged a few days because of some slight passing differences he frankly avowed that all the fault was no doubt on his side since he had contrived to alienate men who were such loyal lords and also such brave captains but with men of their nature he added an honest honourable explanation such as he would give must put everything once more in statu quo To prove that it was goodwill not fear that brought him back to them he showed Orsino the letters from Cardinal Amboise which announced the speedy arrival of French troops he showed him those he had collected about him in the wish he declared that they might be thoroughly convinced that what he chiefly regretted in the whole matter was not so much the loss of the distinguished captains who were the very soul of his vast enterprise as that he had led the world to believe in a way so fatal to his own interest that he could for a single instant fail to recognise their merit adding that he consequently relied upon him Paolo Orsino whom he had always cared for most to bring back the confederates by a peace which would be as much for the profit of all as a war was hurtful to all and that he was ready to sign a treaty in consonance with their wishes so long as it should not prejudice his own honour Orsino was the man Caesar wanted full of pride and confidence in himself he was convinced of the truth of the old proverb that says A pope cannot reign eight days if he has both the Colonnas and the Orsini against him He believed therefore if not in Caesar s good faith at any rate in the necessity he must feel for making peace accordingly he signed with him the following conventions which only needed ratification on the eighteenth of October fifteen oh two which we reproduce here as Macchiavelli sent them to the magnificent republic of Florence Agreement between the Duke of Valentinois and the Confederates Let it be known to the parties mentioned below and to all who shall see these presents that His Excellency the Duke of Romagna of the one part and the Orsini of the other part together with their confederates desiring to put an end to differences enmities misunderstandings and suspicions which have arisen between them have resolved as follows There shall be between them peace and alliance true and perpetual with a complete obliteration of wrongs and injuries which may have taken place up to this day both parties engaging to preserve no resentment of the same and in conformity with the aforesaid peace and union His Excellency the Duke of Romagna shall receive into perpetual confederation league and alliance all the lords aforesaid and each of them shall promise to defend the estates of all in general and of each in particular against any power that may annoy or attack them for any cause whatsoever excepting always nevertheless the Pope Alexander VI and his Very Christian Majesty Louis XII King of France the lords above named promising on the other part to unite in the defence of the person and estates of His Excellency as also those of the most illustrious lords Don Gaffredo Bargia Prince of Squillace Don Roderigo Bargia Duke of Sermaneta and Biselli and Don Gian Borgia Duke of Camerino and Negi all brothers or nephews of the Duke of Romagna Moreover since the rebellion and usurpation of Urbino have occurred during the above mentioned misunderstandings all the confederates aforesaid and each of them shall bind themselves to unite all their forces for the recovery of the estates aforesaid and of such other places as have revolted and been usurped His Excellency the Duke of Romagna shall undertake to continue to the Orsini and Vitelli their ancient engagements in the way of military service and on the same conditions His Excellency promises further not to insist on the service in person of more than one of them as they may choose the service that the others may render shall be voluntary He also promises that the second treaty shall be ratified by the sovereign pontiff who shall not compel Cardinal Orsino to reside in Rome longer than shall seem convenient to this prelate Furthermore since there are certain differences between the Pope and the lord Gian Bentivoglio the confederates aforesaid agree that they shall be put to the arbitration of Cardinal Orsino of His Excellency the Duke of Romagna and of the lord Pandolfo Petrucci without appeal Thus the confederates engage each and all so soon as they may be required by the Duke of Romagna to put into his hands as a hostage one of the legitimate sons of each of them in that place and at that time which he may be pleased to indicate The same confederates promising moreover all and each that if any project directed against any one of them come to their knowledge to give warning thereof and all to prevent such project reciprocally It is agreed over and above between the Duke of Romagna and the confederates aforesaid to regard as a common enemy any who shall fail to keep the present stipulations and to unite in the destruction of any States not conforming thereto Signed CAESAR PAOLO ORSINO AGAPIT Secretary At the same time while Orsino was carrying to the confederates the treaty drawn up between him and the duke Bentivoglio not willing to submit to the arbitration indicated made an offer to Caesar of settling their differences by a private treaty and sent his son to arrange the conditions after some parleying they were settled as follows Bentivaglio should separate his fortunes from the Vitelli and Orsini He should furnish the Duke of Valentinois with a hundred men at arms and a hundred mounted archers for eight years He should pay twelve thousand ducats per annum to Caesar for the support of a hundred lances In return for this his son Hannibal was to marry the sister of the Archbishop of Enna who was Caesar s niece and the pope was to recognise his sovereignty in Bologna The King of France the Duke of Ferrara and the republic of Florence were to be the guarantors of this treaty But the convention brought to the confederates by Orsino was the cause of great difficulties on their part Vitellozza Vitelli in particular who knew Caesar the best never ceased to tell the other condottieri that so prompt and easy a peace must needs be the cover to some trap but since Caesar had meanwhile collected a considerable army at Imala and the four hundred lances lent him by Louis XII had arrived at last Vitellozzo and Oliverotto decided to sign the treaty that Orsino brought and to let the Duke of Urbino and the lord of Camerino know of it they seeing plainly that it was henceforth impossible to make a defence unaided had retired the one to Citta di Castello and the other into the kingdom of Naples But Caesar saying nothing of his intentions started on the tenth of December and made his way to Cesena with a powerful army once more under his command Fear began to spread on all sides not only in Romagna but in the whole of Northern Italy Florence seeing him move away from her only thought it a blind to conceal his intentions while Venice seeing him approach her frontiers despatched all her troops to the banks of the Po Caesar perceived their fear and lest harm should be done to himself by the mistrust it might inspire he sent away all French troops in his service as soon as he reached Cesena except a hundred men with M de Candale his brother in law it was then seen that he only had two thousand cavalry and two thousand infantry with him Several days were spent in parleying for at Cesena Caesar found the envoys of the Vitelli and Orsini who themselves were with their army in the duchy of Urbino but after the preliminary discussions as to the right course to follow in carrying on the plan of conquest there arose such difficulties between the general in chief and these agents that they could not but see the impossibility of getting anything settled by intermediaries and the urgent necessity of a conference between Caesar and one of the chiefs So Oliverotto ran the risk of joining the duke in order to make proposals to him either to march on Tuscany or to take Sinigaglia which was the only place in the duchy of Urbino that had not again fallen into Caesar s power Caesar s reply was that he did not desire to war upon Tuscany because the Tuscans were his friends but that he approved of the lieutenants plan with regard to Sinigaglia and therefore was marching towards Fano But the daughter of Frederic the former Duke of Urbino who held the town of Sinigaglia and who was called the lady prefect because she had married Gian delta Rovere whom his uncle Sixtus IV had made prefect of Rome judging that it would be impossible to defend herself against the forces the Duke of Valentinois was bringing left the citadel in the hands of a captain recommending him to get the best terms he could for the town and took boat for Venice Caesar learned this news at Rimini through a messenger from Vitelli and the Orsini who said that the governor of the citadel though refusing to yield to them was quite ready to make terms with him and consequently they would engage to go to the town and finish the business there Caesar s reply was that in consequence of this information he was sending some of his troops to Cesena and Imola for they would be useless to him as he should now have theirs which together with the escort he retained would be sufficient since his only object was the complete pacification of the duchy of Urbino He added that this pacification would not be possible if his old friends continued to distrust him and to discuss through intermediaries alone plans in which their own fortunes were interested as well as his The messenger returned with this answer and the confederates though feeling it is true the justice of Caesar s remarks none the less hesitated to comply with his demand Vitellozzo Vitelli in particular showed a want of confidence in him which nothing seemed able to subdue but pressed by Oliverotto Gravina and Orsino he consented at last to await the duke s coming making concession rather because he could not bear to appear more timid than his companions than because of any confidence he felt in the return of friendship that Borgia was displaying The duke learned the news of this decision so much desired when he arrived at Fano on the twentieth of December fifteen oh two At once he summoned eight of his most faithful friends among whom were d Enna his nephew Michelotto and Ugo di Cardona and ordered them as soon as they arrived at Sinigaglia and had seen Vitellozzo Gravina Oliveratta and Orsino come out to meet them on a pretext of doing them honour to place themselves on the right and left hand of the four generals two beside each so that at a given signal they might either stab or arrest them next he assigned to each of them his particular man bidding them not quit his side until he had reentered Sinigaglia and arrived at the quarters prepared for him then he sent orders to such of the soldiers as were in cantonments in the neighbourhood to assemble to the number of eight thousand on the banks of the Metaurus a little river of Umbria which runs into the Adriatic and has been made famous by the defeat of Hannibal The duke arrived at the rendezvous given to his army on the thirty first of December and instantly sent out in front two hundred horse and immediately behind them his infantry following close in the midst of his men at arms following the coast of the Adriatic with the mountains on his right and the sea on his left which in part of the way left only space for the army to march ten abreast After four hours march the duke at a turn of the path perceived Sinigaglia nearly a mile distant from the sea and a bowshot from the mountains between the army and the town ran a little river whose banks he had to follow for some distance At last he found a bridge opposite a suburb of the town and here Caesar ordered his cavalry to stop it was drawn up in two lines one between the road and the river the other on the side of the country leaving the whole width of the road to the infantry which latter defiled crossed the bridge and entering the town drew themselves up in battle array in the great square On their side Vitellazzo Gravina Orsino and Oliverotto to make room for the duke s army had quartered their soldiers in little towns or villages in the neighbourhood of Sinigaglia Oliverotto alone had kept nearly one thousand infantry and one hundred fifty horse who were in barracks in the suburb through which the duke entered Caesar had made only a few steps towards the town when he perceived Vitellozzo at the gate with the Duke of Gravina and Orsina who all came out to meet him the last two quite gay and confident but the first so gloomy and dejected that you would have thought he foresaw the fate that was in store for him and doubtless he had not been without same presentiments for when he left his army to came to Sinigaglia he had bidden them farewell as though never to meet again had commended the care of his family to the captains and embraced his children with tears a weakness which appeared strange to all who knew him as a brave condottiere The duke marched up to them holding out his hand as a sign that all was over and forgotten and did it with an air at once so loyal and so smiling that Gravina and Orsina could no longer doubt the genuine return of his friendship and it was only Vitellozzo still appeared sad At the same moment exactly as they had been commanded the duke s accomplices took their posts on the right and left of those they were to watch who were all there except Oliverotto whom the duke could not see and began to seek with uneasy looks but as he crossed the suburb he perceived him exercising his troops on the square Caesar at once despatched Michelotto and d Enna with a message that it was a rash thing to have his troops out when they might easily start some quarrel with the duke s men and bring about an affray it would be much better to settle them in barracks and then come to join his companions who were with Caesar Oliverotto drawn by the same fate as his friends made no objection ordered his soldiers indoors and put his horse to the gallop to join the duke escorted on either side by d Enna and Michelotto Caesar on seeing him called him took him by the hand and continued his march to the palace that had been prepared for him his four victims following after Arrived on the threshold Caesar dismounted and signing to the leader of the men at arms to await his orders he went in first followed by Oliverotto Gravina Vitellozzo Vitelli and Orsino each accompanied by his two satellites but scarcely had they gone upstairs and into the first room when the door was shut behind them and Caesar turned round saying The hour has come This was the signal agreed upon Instantly the former confederates were seized thrown down and forced to surrender with a dagger at their throat Then while they were being carried to a dungeon Caesar opened the window went out on the balcony and cried out to the leader of his men at arms Go forward The man was in the secret he rushed on with his band towards the barracks where Oliverotto s soldiers had just been consigned and they suddenly surprised and off their guard were at once made prisoners then the duke s troops began to pillage the town and he summoned Macchiavelli Caesar and the Florentine envoy were nearly two hours shut up together and since Macchiavelli himself recounts the history of this interview we will give his own words He summoned me says the Florentine ambassador and in the calmest manner showed me his joy at the success of this enterprise which he assured me he had spoken of to me the evening before I remember that he did but I did not at that time understand what he meant next he explained in terms of much feeling and lively affection for our city the different motives which had made him desire your alliance a desire to which he hopes you will respond He ended with charging me to lay three proposals before your lordships first that you rejoice with him in the destruction at a single blow of the mortal enemies of the king himself and you and the consequent disappearance of all seeds of trouble and dissension likely to waste Italy this service of his together with his refusal to allow the prisoners to march against you ought he thinks to excite your gratitude towards him secondly he begs that you will at this juncture give him a striking proof of your friendliness by urging your cavalry s advance towards Borgo and there assembling some infantry also in order that they may march with him should need arise on Castello or on Perugia Lastly he desires and this is his third condition that you arrest the Duke of Urbino if he should flee from Castello into your territories when he learns that Vitellozzo is a prisoner When I objected that to give him up would not beseem the dignity of the republic and that you would never consent he approved of my words and said that it would be enough for you to keep the duke and not give him his liberty without His Excellency s permission I have promised to give you all this information to which he awaits your reply The same night eight masked men descended to the dungeon where the prisoners lay they believed at that moment that the fatal hour had arrived for all But this time the executioners had to do with Vitellozzo and Oliverotto alone When these two captains heard that they were condemned Oliverotto burst forth into reproaches against Vitellozzo saying that it was all his fault that they had taken up arms against the duke not a word Vitellozzo answered except a prayer that the pope might grant him plenary indulgence for all his sins Then the masked men took them away leaving Orsino and Gravina to await a similar fate and led away the two chosen out to die to a secluded spot outside the ramparts of the town where they were strangled and buried at once in two trenches that had been dug beforehand The two others were kept alive until it should be known if the pope had arrested Cardinal Orsino archbishop of Florence and lord of Santa Croce and when the answer was received in the affirmative from His Holiness Gravina and Orsina who had been transferred to a castle were likewise strangled The duke leaving instructions with Michelotto set off for Sinigaglia as soon as the first execution was over assuring Macchiavelli that he had never had any other thought than that of giving tranquillity to the Romagna and to Tuscany and also that he thought he had succeeded by taking and putting to death the men who had been the cause of all the trouble also that any other revolt that might take place in the future would be nothing but sparks that a drop of water could extinguish The pope had barely learned that Caesar had his enemies in his power when eager to play the same winning game himself he announced to Cardinal Orsino though it was then midnight that his son had taken Sinigaglia and gave him an invitation to come the next morning and talk over the good news The cardinal delighted at this increase of favour did not miss his appointment So in the morning he started on horseback for the Vatican but at a turn of the first street he met the governor of Rome with a detachment of cavalry who congratulated himself on the happy chance that they were taking the same road and accompanied him to the threshold of the Vatican There the cardinal dismounted and began to ascend the stairs scarcely however had he reached the first landing before his mules and carriages were seized and shut in the palace stables When he entered the hall of the Perropont he found that he and all his suite were surrounded by armed men who led him into another apartment called the Vicar s Hall where he found the Abbate Alviano the protonotary Orsino Jacopo Santa Croce and Rinaldo Orsino who were all prisoners like himself at the same time the governor received orders to seize the castle of Monte Giardino which belonged to the Orsini and take away all the jewels all the hangings all the furniture and all the silver that he might find The governor carried out his orders conscientiously and brought to the Vatican everything he seized down to the cardinal s account book On consulting this book the pope found out two things first that a sum of two thousand ducats was due to the cardinal no debtor s name being mentioned secondly that the cardinal had bought three months before for fifteen hundred Roman crowns a magnificent pearl which could not be found among the objects belonging to him on which Alexander ordered that from that very moment until the negligence in the cardinal s accounts was repaired the men who were in the habit of bringing him food twice a day on behalf of his mother should not be admitted into the Castle Sant Angelo The same day the cardinal s mother sent the pope the two thousand ducats and the next day his mistress in man s attire came in person to bring the missing pearl His Holiness however was so struck with her beauty in this costume that we are told he let her keep the pearl for the same price she had paid for it Then the pope allowed the cardinal to have his food brought as before and he died of poison on the twenty second of February that is two days after his accounts had been set right That same night the Prince of Squillace set off to take possession in the pope s name of the lands of the deceased CHAPTER XIV The Duke of Valentinois had continued his road towards Citta di Castello and Perugia and had seized these two towns without striking a blow for the Vitelli had fled from the former and the latter had been abandoned by Gian Paolo Baglione with no attempt whatever at resistance There still remained Siena where Pandolfo Petrucci was shut up the only man remaining of all who had joined the league against Caesar But Siena was under the protection of the French Besides Siena was not one of the States of the Church and Caesar had no rights there Therefore he was content with insisting upon Pandolfo Petrucci s leaving the town and retiring to Lucca which he accordingly did Then all on this side being peaceful and the whole of Romagna in subjection Caesar resolved to return to Rome and help the pope to destroy all that was left of the Orsini This was all the easier because Louis XII having suffered reverses in the kingdom of Naples had since then been much concerned with his own affairs to disturb himself about his allies So Caesar doing for the neighbourhood of the Holy See the same thing that he had done for the Romagna seized in succession Vicovaro Cera Palombera Lanzano and Cervetti when these conquests were achieved having nothing else to do now that he had brought the pontifical States into subjection from the frontiers of Naples to those of Venice he returned to Rome to concert with his father as to the means of converting his duchy into a kingdom Caesar arrived at the right moment to share with Alexander the property of Cardinal Gian Michele who had just died having received a poisoned cup from the hands of the pope The future King of Italy found his father preoccupied with a grand project he had resolved for the Feast of saint Peter s to create nine cardinals What he had to gain from these nominations is as follows First the cardinals elected would leave all their offices vacant these offices would fall into the hands of the pope and he would sell them Secondly each of them would buy his election more or less dear according to his fortune the price left to be settled at the pope s fancy would vary from ten thousand to forty thousand ducats Lastly since as cardinals they would by law lose the right of making a will the pope in order to inherit from them had only to poison them this put him in the position of a butcher who if he needs money has only to cut the throat of the fattest sheep in the flock The nomination came to pass the new cardinals were Giovanni Castellaro Valentine archbishop of Trani Francesco Remolini ambassador from the King of Aragon Francesco Soderini bishop of Volterra Melchiore Copis bishop of Brissina Nicolas Fiesque bishop of Frejus Francesco di Sprate bishop of Leome Adriano Castellense clerk of the chamber treasurer general and secretary of the briefs Francesco Boris bishop of Elva patriarch of Constantinople and secretary to the pope and Giacomo Casanova protonotary and private chamberlain to His Holiness The price of their simony paid and their vacated offices sold the pope made his choice of those he was to poison the number was fixed at three one old and two new the old one was Cardinal Casanova and the new ones Melchiore Copis and Adriano Castellense who had taken the name of Adrian of Carneta from that town where he had been born and where in the capacity of clerk of the chamber treasurer general and secretary of briefs he had amassed an immense fortune So when all was settled between Caesar and the pope they invited their chosen guests to supper in a vineyard situated near the Vatican belonging to the Cardinal of Corneto In the morning of this day the second of August they sent their servants and the steward to make all preparations and Caesar himself gave the pope s butler two bottles of wine prepared with the white powder resembling sugar whose mortal properties he had so often proved and gave orders that he was to serve this wine only when he was told and only to persons specially indicated the butler accordingly put the wine an a sideboard apart bidding the waiters on no account to touch it as it was reserved for the pope s drinking The poison of the Borgias say contemporary writers was of two kinds powder and liquid The poison in the form of powder was a sort of white flour almost impalpable with the taste of sugar and called Contarella Its composition is unknown The liquid poison was prepared we are told in so strange a fashion that we cannot pass it by in silence We repeat here what we read and vouch for nothing ourselves lest science should give us the lie A strong dose of arsenic was administered to a boar as soon as the poison began to take effect he was hung up by his heels convulsions supervened and a froth deadly and abundant ran out from his jaws it was this froth collected into a silver vessel and transferred into a bottle hermetically sealed that made the liquid poison Towards evening Alexander VI walked from the Vatican leaning on Caesar s arm and turned his steps towards the vineyard accompanied by Cardinal Caraffa but as the heat was great and the climb rather steep the pope when he reached the top stopped to take breath then putting his hand on his breast he found that he had left in his bedroom a chain that he always wore round his neck which suspended a gold medallion that enclosed the sacred host He owed this habit to a prophecy that an astrologer had made that so long as he carried about a consecrated wafer neither steel nor poison could take hold upon him Now finding himself without his talisman he ordered Monsignor Caraffa to hurry back at once to the Vatican and told him in which part of his room he had left it so that he might get it and bring it him without delay Then as the walk had made him thirsty he turned to a valet giving signs with his hand as he did so that his messenger should make haste and asked for something to drink Caesar who was also thirsty ordered the man to bring two glasses By a curious coincidence the butler had just gone back to the Vatican to fetch some magnificent peaches that had been sent that very day to the pope but which had been forgotten when he came here so the valet went to the under butler saying that His Holiness and Monsignors the Duke of Romagna were thirsty and asking for a drink The under butler seeing two bottles of wine set apart and having heard that this wine was reserved for the pope took one and telling the valet to bring two glasses on a tray poured out this wine which both drank little thinking that it was what they had themselves prepared to poison their guests Meanwhile Caraffa hurried to the Vatican and as he knew the palace well went up to the pope s bedroom a light in his hand and attended by no servant As he turned round a corridor a puff of wind blew out his lamp still as he knew the way he went on thinking there was no need of seeing to find the object he was in search of but as he entered the room he recoiled a step with a cry of terror he beheld a ghastly apparition it seemed that there before his eyes in the middle of the room between the door and the cabinet which held the medallion Alexander VI motionless and livid was lying on a bier at whose four corners there burned four torches The cardinal stood still for a moment his eyes fixed and his hair standing on end without strength to move either backward or forward then thinking it was all a trick of fancy or an apparition of the devil s making he made the sign of the cross invoking God s holy name all instantly vanished torches bier and corpse and the seeming mortuary chamber was once more in darkness Then Cardinal Caraffa who has himself recorded this strange event and who was afterwards Pope Paul IV entered boldly and though an icy sweat ran down his brow he went straight to the cabinet and in the drawer indicated found the gold chain and the medallion took them and hastily went out to give them to the pope He found supper served the guests arrived and His Holiness ready to take his place at table as soon as the cardinal was in sight His Holiness who was very pale made one step towards him Caraffa doubled his pace and handed the medallion to him but as the pope stretched forth his arm to take it he fell back with a cry instantly followed by violent convulsions an instant later as he advanced to render his father assistance Caesar was similarly seized the effect of the poison had been more rapid than usual for Caesar had doubled the dose and there is little doubt that their heated condition increased its activity The two stricken men were carried side by side to the Vatican where each was taken to his own rooms from that moment they never met again As soon as he reached his bed the pope was seized with a violent fever which did not give way to emetics or to bleeding almost immediately it became necessary to administer the last sacraments of the Church but his admirable bodily constitution which seemed to have defied old age was strong enough to fight eight days with death at last after a week of mortal agony he died without once uttering the name of Caesar or Lucrezia who were the two poles around which had turned all his affections and all his crimes His age was seventy two and he had reigned eleven years Caesar perhaps because he had taken less of the fatal beverage perhaps because the strength of his youth overcame the strength of the poison or maybe as some say because when he reached his own rooms he had swallowed an antidote known only to himself was not so prostrated as to lose sight for a moment of the terrible position he was in he summoned his faithful Michelotto with those he could best count on among his men and disposed this band in the various rooms that led to his own ordering the chief never to leave the foot of his bed but to sleep lying on a rug his hand upon the handle of his sword The treatment had been the same for Caesar as for the pope but in addition to bleeding and emetics strange baths were added which Caesar had himself asked for having heard that in a similar case they had once cured Ladislaus King of Naples Four posts strongly welded to the floor and ceiling were set up in his room like the machines at which farriers shoe horses every day a bull was brought in turned over on his back and tied by his four legs to the four posts then when he was thus fixed a cut was made in his belly a foot and a half long through which the intestines were drawn out then Caesar slipped into this living bath of blood when the bull was dead Caesar was taken out and rolled up in burning hot blankets where after copious perspirations he almost always felt some sort of relief Every two hours Caesar sent to ask news of his father he hardly waited to hear that he was dead before though still at death s door himself he summoned up all the force of character and presence of mind that naturally belonged to him He ordered Michelotto to shut the doors of the Vatican before the report of Alexander s decease could spread about the town and forbade anyone whatsoever to enter the pope s apartments until the money and papers had been removed Michelotto obeyed at once went to find Cardinal Casanova held a dagger at his throat and made him deliver up the keys of the pope s rooms and cabinets then under his guidance took away two chests full of gold which perhaps contained one hundred thousand Roman crowns in specie several boxes full of jewels much silver and many precious vases all these were carried to Caesar s chamber the guards of the room were doubled then the doors of the Vatican were once more thrown open and the death of the pope was proclaimed Although the news was expected it produced none the less a terrible effect in Rome for although Caesar was still alive his condition left everyone in suspense had the mighty Duke of Romagna the powerful condottiere who had taken thirty towns and fifteen fortresses in five years been seated sword in hand upon his charger nothing would have been uncertain of fluctuating even for a moment for as Caesar afterwards told Macchiavelli his ambitious soul had provided for all things that could occur on the day of the pope s death except the one that he should be dying himself but being nailed down to his bed sweating off the effects the poison had wrought so though he had kept his power of thinking he could no longer act but must needs wait and suffer the course of events instead of marching on in front and controlling them Thus he was forced to regulate his actions no longer by his own plans but according to circumstances His most bitter enemies who could press him hardest were the Orsini and the Colonnas from the one family he had taken their blood from the other their goods So he addressed himself to those to whom he could return what he had taken and opened negotiations with the Colonnas Meanwhile the obsequies of the pope were going forward the vice chancellor had sent out orders to the highest among the clergy the superiors of convents and the secular orders not to fail to appear according to regular custom on pain of being despoiled of their office and dignities each bringing his own company to the Vatican to be present at the pope s funeral each therefore appeared on the day and at the hour appointed at the pontifical palace whence the body was to be conveyed to the church of saint Peter s and there buried The corpse was found to be abandoned and alone in the mortuary chamber for everyone of the name of Borgia except Caesar lay hidden not knowing what might come to pass This was indeed well justified for Fabio Orsino meeting one member of the family stabbed him and as a sign of the hatred they had sworn to one another bathed his mouth and hands in the blood The agitation in Rome was so great that when the corpse of Alexander VI was about to enter the church there occurred a kind of panic such as will suddenly arise in times of popular agitation instantly causing so great a disturbance in the funeral cortege that the guards drew up in battle array the clergy fled into the sacristy and the bearers dropped the bier The people tearing off the pall which covered it disclosed the corpse and everyone could see with impunity and close at hand the man who fifteen days before had made princes kings and emperors tremble from one end of the world to the other But in accordance with that religious feeling towards death which all men instinctively feel and which alone survives every other even in the heart of the atheist the bier was taken up again and carried to the foot of the great altar in saint Peter s where set on trestles it was exposed to public view but the body had become so black so deformed and swollen that it was horrible to behold from its nose a bloody matter escaped the mouth gaped hideously and the tongue was so monstrously enlarged that it filled the whole cavity to this frightful appearance was added a decomposition so great that although at the pope s funeral it is customary to kiss the hand which bore the Fisherman s ring not one approached to offer this mark of respect and religious reverence to the representative of God on earth Towards seven o clock in the evening when the declining day adds so deep a melancholy to the silence of a church four porters and two working carpenters carried the corpse into the chapel where it was to be interred and lifting it off the catafalque where it lay in state put it in the coffin which was to be its last abode but it was found that the coffin was too short and the body could not be got in till the legs were bent and thrust in with violent blows then the carpenters put on the lid and while one of them sat on the top to force the knees to bend the others hammered in the nails amid those Shakespearian pleasantries that sound as the last orison in the ear of the mighty then says Tommaso Tommasi he was placed on the right of the great altar of saint Peter s beneath a very ugly tomb The next morning this epitaph was found inscribed upon the tomb VENDIT ALEXANDER CLAVES ALTARIA CHRISTUM EMERAT ILLE PRIUS VENDERE JUKE POTEST that is Pope Alexander sold the Christ the altars and the keys But anyone who buys a thing may sell it if he please CHAPTER XV From the effect produced at Rome by Alexander s death one may imagine what happened not only in the whole of Italy but also in the rest of the world for a moment Europe swayed for the column which supported the vault of the political edifice had given way and the star with eyes of flame and rays of blood round which all things had revolved for the last eleven years was now extinguished and for a moment the world on a sudden struck motionless remained in silence and darkness After the first moment of stupefaction all who had an injury to avenge arose and hurried to the chase Sforza retook Pesaro Bagloine Perugia Guido and Ubaldo Urbino and La Rovere Sinigaglia the Vitelli entered Citta di Castello the Appiani Piombino the Orsini Monte Giordano and their other territories Romagna alone remained impassive and loyal for the people who have no concern with the quarrels of the great provided they do not affect themselves had never been so happy as under the government of Caesar The Colonnas were pledged to maintain a neutrality and had been consequently restored to the possession of their castles and the cities of Chiuzano Capo d Anno Frascati Rocca di Papa and Nettuno which they found in a better condition than when they had left them as the pope had had them embellished and fortified Caesar was still in the Vatican with his troops who loyal to him in his misfortune kept watch about the palace where he was writhing on his bed of pain and roaring like a wounded lion The cardinals who had in their first terror fled each his own way instead of attending the pope s obsequies began to assemble once more some at the Minerva others around Cardinal Caraffa Frightened by the troops that Caesar still had especially since the command was entrusted to Michelotto they collected all the money they could to levy an army of two thousand soldiers with Charles Taneo at their head with the title of Captain of the Sacred College It was then hoped that peace was re established when it was heard that Prospero Colonna was coming with three thousand men from the side of Naples and Fabio Orsino from the side of Viterbo with two hundred horse and more than one thousand infantry Indeed they entered Rome at only one day s interval one from another by so similar an ardour were they inspired Thus there were five armies in Rome Caesar s army holding the Vatican and the Borgo the army of the Bishop of Nicastro who had received from Alexander the guardianship of the Castle Sant Angelo and had shut himself up there refusing to yield the army of the Sacred College which was stationed round about the Minerva the army of Prospero Colonna which was encamped at the Capitol and the army of Fabio Orsino in barracks at the Ripetta On their side the Spaniards had advanced to Terracino and the French to Nepi The cardinals saw that Rome now stood upon a mine which the least spark might cause to explode they summoned the ambassadors of the Emperor of Germany the Kings of France and Spain and the republic of Venice to raise their voice in the name of their masters The ambassadors impressed with the urgency of the situation began by declaring the Sacred College inviolable they then ordered the Orsini the Colonnas and the Duke of Valentinois to leave Rome and go each his own way The Orsini were the first to submit the next morning their example was followed by the Colonnas No one was left but Caesar who said he was willing to go but desired to make his conditions beforehand the Vatican was undermined he declared and if his demands were refused he and those who came to take him should be blown up together It was known that his were never empty threats so they came to terms with him Caesar promised to remain ten miles away from Rome the whole time the Conclave lasted and not to take any action against the town or any other of the Ecclesiastical States Fabio Orsino and Prospero Colonna had made the same promises It was agreed that Caesar should quit Rome with his army artillery and baggage and to ensure his not being attacked or molested in the streets the Sacred College should add to his numbers four hundred infantry who in case of attack or insult would fight for him The Venetian ambassador answered for the Orsini the Spanish ambassador for the Colonnas the ambassador of France for Caesar At the day and hour appointed Caesar sent out his artillery which consisted of eighteen pieces of cannon and four hundred infantry of the Sacred College on each of whom he bestowed a ducat behind the artillery came a hundred chariots escorted by his advance guard The duke was carried out of the gate of the Vatican he lay on a bed covered with a scarlet canopy supported by twelve halberdiers leaning forward on his cushions so that no one might see his face with its purple lips and bloodshot eyes beside him was his naked sword to show that feeble as he was he could use it at need his finest charger caparisoned in black velvet embroidered with his arms walked beside the bed led by a page so that Caesar could mount in case of surprise or attack before him and behind both right and left marched his army their arms in rest but without beating of drums or blowing of trumpets this gave a sombre funereal air to the whole procession which at the gate of the city met Prospero Colonna awaiting it with a considerable band of men Caesar thought at first that breaking his word as he had so often done himself Prospero Colonna was going to attack him He ordered a halt and prepared to mount his horse but Prospera Colonna seeing the state he was in advanced to his bedside alone he came against expectation to offer him an escort fearing an ambuscade on the part of Fabio Orsino who had loudly sworn that he would lose his honour or avenge the death of Paolo Orsina his father Caesar thanked Colanna and replied that from the moment that Orsini stood alone he ceased to fear him Then Colonna saluted the duke and rejoined his men directing them towards Albano while Caesar took the road to Citta Castellana which had remained loyal When there Caesar found himself not only master of his own fate but of others as well of the twenty two votes he owned in the Sacred College twelve had remained faithful and as the Conclave was composed in all of thirty seven cardinals he with his twelve votes could make the majority incline to whichever side he chose Accordingly he was courted both by the Spanish and the French party each desiring the election of a pope of their own nation Caesar listened promising nothing and refusing nothing he gave his twelve votes to Francesco Piccolomini Cardinal of Siena one of his father s creatures who had remained his friend and the latter was elected on the eighth of October and took the name of Pius III Caesar s hopes did not deceive him Pius III was hardly elected before he sent him a safe conduct to Rome the duke came back with two hundred fifty men at arms two hundred fifty light horse and eight hundred infantry and lodged in his palace the soldiers camping round about Meanwhile the Orsini pursuing their projects of vengeance against Caesar had been levying many troops at Perugia and the neighbourhood to bring against him to Rome and as they fancied that France in whose service they were engaged was humouring the duke for the sake of the twelve votes which were wanted to secure the election of Cardinal Amboise at the next Conclave they went over to the service of Spain Meanwhile Caesar was signing a new treaty with Louis XII by which he engaged to support him with all his forces and even with his person so soon as he could ride in maintaining his conquest of Naples Louis on his side guaranteed that he should retain possession of the States he still held and promised his help in recovering those he had lost The day when this treaty was made known Gonzalvo di Cordovo proclaimed to the sound of a trumpet in all the streets of Rome that every Spanish subject serving in a foreign army was at once to break his engagement on pain of being found guilty of high treason This measure robbed Caesar of ten or twelve of his best officers and of nearly three hundred men Then the Orsini seeing his army thus reduced entered Rome supported by the Spanish ambassador and summoned Caesar to appear before the pope and the Sacred College and give an account of his crimes Faithful to his engagements Pius III replied that in his quality of sovereign prince the duke in his temporal administration was quite independent and was answerable for his actions to God alone But as the pope felt he could not much longer support Caesar against his enemies for all his goodwill he advised him to try to join the French army which was still advancing on Naples in the midst of which he would alone find safety Caesar resolved to retire to Bracciano where Gian Giordano Orsino who had once gone with him to France and who was the only member of the family who had not declared against him offered him an asylum in the name of Cardinal dumbest so one morning he ordered his troops to march for this town and taking his place in their midst he left Rome But though Caesar had kept his intentions quiet the Orsini had been forewarned and taking out all the troops they had by the gate of San Pancracio they had made a long detour and blocked Caesar s way so when the latter arrived at Storta he found the Orsini s army drawn up awaiting him in numbers exceeding his own by at least one half Caesar saw that to come to blows in his then feeble state was to rush on certain destruction so he ordered his troops to retire and being a first rate strategist echelonned his retreat so skilfully that his enemies though they followed dared not attack him and he re entered the pontifical town without the loss of a single man This time Caesar went straight to the Vatican to put himself more directly under the pope s protection he distributed his soldiers about the palace so as to guard all its exits Now the Orsini resolved to make an end of Caesar had determined to attack him wheresoever he might be with no regard to the sanctity of the place this they attempted but without success as Caesar s men kept a good guard on every side and offered a strong defence Then the Orsini not being able to force the guard of the Castle Sant Angelo hoped to succeed better with the duke by leaving Rome and then returning by the Torione gate but Caesar anticipated this move and they found the gate guarded and barricaded None the less they pursued their design seeking by open violence the vengeance that they had hoped to obtain by craft and having surprised the approaches to the gate set fire to it a passage gained they made their way into the gardens of the castle where they found Caesar awaiting them at the head of his cavalry Face to face with danger the duke had found his old strength and he was the first to rush upon his enemies loudly challenging Orsino in the hope of killing him should they meet but either Orsino did not hear him or dared not fight and after an exciting contest Caesar who was numerically two thirds weaker than his enemy saw his cavalry cut to pieces and after performing miracles of personal strength and courage was obliged to return to the Vatican There he found the pope in mortal agony the Orsini tired of contending against the old man s word of honour pledged to the duke had by the interposition of Pandolfo Petrucci gained the ear of the pope s surgeon who placed a poisoned plaster upon a wound in his leg The pope then was actually dying when Caesar covered with dust and blood entered his room pursued by his enemies who knew no check till they reached the palace walls behind which the remnant of his army still held their ground Pius III who knew he was about to die sat up in his bed gave Caesar the key of the corridor which led to the Castle of Sant Angelo and an order addressed to the governor to admit him and his family to defend him to the last extremity and to let him go wherever he thought fit and then fell fainting on his bed Caesar took his two daughters by the hand and followed by the little dukes of Sermaneta and Nepi took refuge in the last asylum open to him The same night the pope died he had reigned only twenty six days After his death Caesar who had cast himself fully dressed upon his bed heard his door open at two o clock in the morning not knowing what anyone might want of him at such an hour he raised himself on one elbow and felt for the handle of his sword with his other hand but at the first glance he recognised in his nocturnal visitor Giuliano della Rovere Utterly exhausted by the poison abandoned by his troops fallen as he was from the height of his power Caesar who could now do nothing for himself could yet make a pope Giuliano delta Rovere had come to buy the votes of his twelve cardinals Caesar imposed his conditions which were accepted If elected Giuliano della Rovere was to help Caesar to recover his territories in Romagna Caesar was to remain general of the Church and Francesco Maria delta Rovere prefect of Rome was to marry one of Caesar s daughters On these conditions Caesar sold his twelve cardinals to Giuliano The next day at Giuliano s request the Sacred College ordered the Orsini to leave Rome for the whole time occupied by the Conclave On the thirty first of October fifteen oh three at the first scrutiny Giuliano delta Rovere was elected pope and took the name of Julius II He was scarcely installed in the Vatican when he made it his first care to summon Caesar and give him his former rooms there then since the duke was fully restored to health he began to busy himself with the re establishment of his affairs which had suffered sadly of late The defeat of his army and his own escape to Sant Angelo where he was supposed to be a prisoner had brought about great changes in Romagna Sesena was once more in the power of the Church as formerly it had been Gian Sforza had again entered Pesaro Ordelafi had seized Forli Malatesta was laying claim to Rimini the inhabitants of Imola had assassinated their governor and the town was divided between two opinions one that it should be put into the hands of the Riani the other into the hands of the Church Faenza had remained loyal longer than any other place but at last losing hope of seeing Caesar recover his power it had summoned Francesco a natural son of Galeotto Manfredi the last surviving heir of this unhappy family all whose legitimate descendants had been massacred by Borgia It is true that the fortresses of these different places had taken no part in these revolutions and had remained immutably faithful to the Duke of Valentinois So it was not precisely the defection of these towns which thanks to their fortresses might be reconquered that was the cause of uneasiness to Caesar and Julius II it was the difficult situation that Venice had thrust upon them Venice in the spring of the same year had signed a treaty of peace with the Turks thus set free from her eternal enemy she had just led her forces to the Romagna which she had always coveted these troops had been led towards Ravenna the farthermost limit of the Papal estates and put under the command of Giacopo Venieri who had failed to capture Cesena and had only failed through the courage of its inhabitants but this check had been amply compensated by the surrender of the fortresses of Val di Lamane and Faenza by the capture of Farlimpopoli and the surrender of Rimini which Pandolfo Malatesta its lord exchanged for the seigniory of Cittadella in the State of Padua and for the rank of gentleman of Venice Then Caesar made a proposition to Julius II this was to make a momentary cession to the Church of his own estates in Romagna so that the respect felt by the Venetians for the Church might save these towns from their aggressors but says Guicciardini Julius II whose ambition so natural in sovereign rulers had not yet extinguished the remains of rectitude refused to accept the places afraid of exposing himself to the temptation of keeping them later on against his promises But as the case was urgent he proposed to Caesar that he should leave Rome embark at Ostia and cross over to Spezia where Michelotto was to meet him at the head of one hundred men at arms and one hundred light horse the only remnant of his magnificent army thence by land to Ferrara and from Ferrara to Imala where once arrived he could utter his war cry so loud that it would be heard through the length and breadth of Romagna This advice being after Caesar s own heart he accepted it at once The resolution submitted to the Sacred College was approved and Caesar left for Ostia accompanied by Bartolommeo della Rovere nephew of His Holiness Caesar at last felt he was free and fancied himself already on his good charger a second time carrying war into all the places where he had formerly fought When he reached Ostia he was met by the cardinals of Sorrento and Volterra who came in the name of Julius II to ask him to give up the very same citadels which he had refused three days before the fact was that the pope had learned in the interim that the Venetians had made fresh aggressions and recognised that the method proposed by Caesar was the only one that would check them But this time it was Caesar s turn to refuse for he was weary of these tergiversations and feared a trap so he said that the surrender asked for would be useless since by God s help he should be in Romagna before eight days were past So the cardinals of Sorrento and Volterra returned to Rome with a refusal The next morning just as Caesar was setting foot on his vessel he was arrested in the name of Julius II He thought at first that this was the end he was used to this mode of action and knew how short was the space between a prison and a tomb the matter was all the easier in his case because the pope if he chose would have plenty of pretext for making a case against him But the heart of Julius was of another kind from his swift to anger but open to clemency so when the duke came back to Rome guarded the momentary irritation his refusal had caused was already calmed and the pope received him in his usual fashion at his palace and with his ordinary courtesy although from the beginning it was easy for the duke to see that he was being watched In return for this kind reception Caesar consented to yield the fortress of Cesena to the pope as being a town which had once belonged to the Church and now should return giving the deed signed by Caesar to one of his captains called Pietro d Oviedo he ordered him to take possession of the fortress in the name of the Holy See Pietro obeyed and starting at once for Cesena presented himself armed with his warrant before Don Diego Chinon a noble condottiere of Spain who was holding the fortress in Caesar s name But when he had read over the paper that Pietro d Oviedo brought Don Diego replied that as he knew his lord and master was a prisoner it would be disgraceful in him to obey an order that had probably been wrested from him by violence and that the bearer deserved to die for undertaking such a cowardly office He therefore bade his soldiers seize d Oviedo and fling him down from the top of the walls this sentence was promptly executed This mark of fidelity might have proved fatal to Caesar when the pope heard how his messenger had been treated he flew into such a rage that the prisoner thought a second time that his hour was come and in order to receive his liberty he made the first of those new propositions to Julius II which were drawn up in the form of a treaty and sanctioned by a bull By these arrangements the Duke of Valentinois was bound to hand over to His Holiness within the space of forty days the fortresses of Cesena and Bertinoro and authorise the surrender of Forli This arrangement was guaranteed by two bankers in Rome who were to be responsible for fifteen thousand ducats the sum total of the expenses which the governor pretended he had incurred in the place on the duke s account The pope on his part engaged to send Caesar to Ostia under the sole guard of the Cardinal of Santa Croce and two officers who were to give him his full liberty on the very day when his engagements were fulfilled should this not happen Caesar was to be taken to Rome and imprisoned in the Castle of Sant Angelo In fulfilment of this treaty Caesar went down the Tiber as far as Ostia accompanied by the pope s treasurer and many of his servants The Cardinal of Santa Croce followed and the next day joined him there But as Caesar feared that Julius II might keep him a prisoner in spite of his pledged word after he had yielded up the fortresses he asked through the mediation of Cardinals Borgia and Remolina who not feeling safe at Rome had retired to Naples for a safe conduct to Gonzalva of Cordova and for two ships to take him there with the return of the courier the safe conduct arrived announcing that the ships would shortly follow In the midst of all this the Cardinal of Santa Croce learning that by the duke s orders the governors of Cesena and Bertinoro had surrendered their fortresses to the captains of His Holiness relaxed his rigour and knowing that his prisoner would some day or other be free began to let him go out without a guard Then Caesar feeling some fear lest when he started with Gonzalvo s ships the same thing might happen as on the occasion of his embarking on the pope s vessel that is that he might be arrested a second time concealed himself in a house outside the town and when night came on mounting a wretched horse that belonged to a peasant rode as far as Nettuno and there hired a little boat in which he embarked for Monte Dragone and thence gained Naples Gonzalvo received him with such joy that Caesar was deceived as to his intention and this time believed that he was really saved His confidence was redoubled when opening his designs to Gonzalvo and telling him that he counted upon gaining Pisa and thence going on into Romagna Ganzalvo allowed him to recruit as many soldiers at Naples as he pleased promising him two ships to embark with Caesar deceived by these appearances stopped nearly six weeks at Naples every day seeing the Spanish governor and discussing his plans But Gonzalvo was only waiting to gain time to tell the King of Spain that his enemy was in his hands and Caesar actually went to the castle to bid Gonzalvo good bye thinking he was just about to start after he had embarked his men on the two ships The Spanish governor received him with his accustomed courtesy wished him every kind of prosperity and embraced him as he left but at the door of the castle Caesar found one of Gonzalvo s captains Nuno Campeja by name who arrested him as a prisoner of Ferdinand the Catholic Caesar at these words heaved a deep sigh cursing the ill luck that had made him trust the word of an enemy when he had so often broken his own He was at once taken to the castle where the prison gate closed behind him and he felt no hope that anyone would come to his aid for the only being who was devoted to him in this world was Michelotto and he had heard that Michelotto had been arrested near Pisa by order of Julius II While Caesar was being taken to prison an officer came to him to deprive him of the safe conduct given him by Gonzalvo The day after his arrest which occurred on the twenty seventh of May fifteen oh four Caesar was taken on board a ship which at once weighed anchor and set sail for Spain during the whole voyage he had but one page to serve him and as soon as he disembarked he was taken to the castle of Medina del Campo Ten years later Gonzalvo who at that time was himself proscribed owned to Loxa on his dying bed that now when he was to appear in the presence of God two things weighed cruelly on his conscience one was his treason to Ferdinand the other his breach of faith towards Caesar CHAPTER XVI Caesar was in prison for two years always hoping that Louis XII would reclaim him as peer of the kingdom of France but Louis much disturbed by the loss of the battle of Garigliano which robbed him of the kingdom of Naples had enough to do with his own affairs without busying himself with his cousin s So the prisoner was beginning to despair when one day as he broke his bread at breakfast he found a file and a little bottle containing a narcotic with a letter from Michelotto saying that he was out of prison and had left Italy for Spain and now lay in hiding with the Count of Benevento in the neighbouring village he added that from the next day forward he and the count would wait every night on the road between the fortress and the village with three excellent horses it was now Caesar s part to do the best he could with his bottle and file When the whole world had abandoned the Duke of Romagna he had been remembered by a sbirro The prison where he had been shut up for two years was so hateful to Caesar that he lost not a single moment the same day he attacked one of the bars of a window that looked out upon an inner court and soon contrived so to manipulate it that it would need only a final push to come out But not only was the window nearly seventy feet from the ground but one could only get out of the court by using an exit reserved for the governor of which he alone had the key also this key never left him by day it hung at his waist by night it was under his pillow this then was the chief difficulty But prisoner though he was Caesar had always been treated with the respect due to his name and rank every day at the dinner hour he was conducted from the room that served as his prison to the governor who did the honours of the table in a grand and courteous fashion The fact was that Dan Manuel had served with honour under King Ferdinand and therefore while he guarded Caesar rigorously according to orders he had a great respect for so brave a general and took pleasure in listening to the accounts of his battles So he had often insisted that Caesar should not only dine but also breakfast with him happily the prisoner yielding perhaps to some presentiment had till now refused this favour This was of great advantage to him since thanks to his solitude he had been able to receive the instruments of escape sent by Michelotto The same day he received them Caesar on going back to his room made a false step and sprained his foot at the dinner hour he tried to go down but he pretended to be suffering so cruelly that he gave it up The governor came to see him in his room and found him stretched upon the bed The day after he was no better the governor had his dinner sent in and came to see him as on the night before he found his prisoner so dejected and gloomy in his solitude that he offered to come and sup with him Caesar gratefully accepted This time it was the prisoner who did the honours Caesar was charmingly courteous the governor thought he would profit by this lack of restraint to put to him certain questions as to the manner of his arrest and asked him as an Old Castilian for whom honour is still of some account what the truth really was as to Gonzalvo s and Ferdinand s breach of faith with him Caesar appeared extremely inclined to give him his entire confidence but showed by a sign that the attendants were in the way This precaution appeared quite natural and the governor took no offense but hastened to send them all away so as to be sooner alone with his companion When the door was shut Caesar filled his glass and the governor s proposing the king s health the governor honoured the toast Caesar at once began his tale but he had scarcely uttered a third part of it when interesting as it was the eyes of his host shut as though by magic and he slid under the table in a profound sleep After half a hour had passed the servants hearing no noise entered and found the two one on the table the other under it this event was not so extraordinary that they paid any great attention to it all they did was to carry Don Manuel to his room and lift Caesar on the bed then they put away the remnant of the meal for the next day s supper shut the door very carefully and left their prisoner alone Caesar stayed for a minute motionless and apparently plunged in the deepest sleep but when he had heard the steps retreating he quietly raised his head opened his eyes slipped off the bed walked to the door slowly indeed but not to all appearance feeling the accident of the night before and applied his ear for some minutes to the keyhole then lifting his head with an expression of indescribable pride he wiped his brow with his hand and for the first time since his guards went out breathed freely with full drawn breaths There was no time to lose his first care was to shut the door as securely on the inside as it was already shut on the outside to blow out the lamp to open the window and to finish sawing through the bar When this was done he undid the bandages on his leg took down the window and bed curtains tore them into strips joined the sheets table napkins and cloth and with all these things tied together end to end formed a rope fifty or sixty feet long with knots every here and there This rope he fixed securely to the bar next to the one he had just cut through then he climbed up to the window and began what was really the hardest part of his perilous enterprise clinging with hands and feet to this fragile support Luckily he was both strong and skilful and he went down the whole length of the rope without accident but when he reached the end and was hanging on the last knot he sought in vain to touch the ground with his feet his rope was too short The situation was a terrible one the darkness of the night prevented the fugitive from seeing how far off he was from the ground and his fatigue prevented him from even attempting to climb up again Caesar put up a brief prayer whether to Gad or Satan he alone could say then letting go the rope he dropped from a height of twelve or fifteen feet The danger was too great for the fugitive to trouble about a few trifling contusions he at once rose and guiding himself by the direction of his window he went straight to the little door of exit he then put his hand into the pocket of his doublet and a cold sweat damped his brow either he had forgotten and left it in his room or had lost it in his fall anyhow he had not the key But summoning his recollections he quite gave up the first idea for the second which was the only likely one again he crossed the court looking for the place where the key might have fallen by the aid of the wall round a tank on which he had laid his hand when he got up but the object of search was so small and the night so dark that there was little chance of getting any result still Caesar sought for it for in this key was his last hope suddenly a door was opened and a night watch appeared preceded by two torches Caesar for the moment thought he was lost but remembering the tank behind him he dropped into it and with nothing but his head above water anxiously watched the movements of the soldiers as they advanced beside him passed only a few feet away crossed the court and then disappeared by an opposite door But short as their luminous apparition had been it had lighted up the ground and Caesar by the glare of the torches had caught the glitter of the long sought key and as soon as the door was shut behind the men was again master of his liberty Half way between the castle and the village two cavaliers and a led horse were waiting for him the two men were Michelotto and the Count of Benevento Caesar sprang upon the riderless horse pressed with fervour the hand of the count and the sbirro then all three galloped to the frontier of Navarre where they arrived three days later and were honourably received by the king Jean d Albret the brother of Caesar s wife From Navarre he thought to pass into France and from France to make an attempt upon Italy with the aid of Louis XII but during Caesar s detention in the castle of Medina del Campo Louis had made peace with the King of Spain and when he heard of Caesar s flight instead of helping him as there was some reason to expect he would since he was a relative by marriage he took away the duchy of Valentinois and also his pension Still Caesar had nearly two hundred thousand ducats in the charge of bankers at Genoa he wrote asking for this sum with which he hoped to levy troops in Spain and in Navarre and make an attempt upon Pisa five hundred men two hundred thousand ducats his name and his word were more than enough to save him from despair The bankers denied the deposit Caesar was at the mercy of his brother in law One of the vassals of the King of Navarre named Prince Alarino had just then revolted Caesar then took command of the army which Jean d Albret was sending out against him followed by Michelotto who was as faithful in adversity as ever before Thanks to Caesar s courage and skilful tactics Prince Alarino was beaten in a first encounter but the day after his defeat he rallied his army and offered battle about three o clock in the afternoon Caesar accepted it For nearly four hours they fought obstinately on both sides but at length as the day was going down Caesar proposed to decide the issue by making a charge himself at the head of a hundred men at arms upon a body of cavalry which made his adversary s chief force To his great astonishment this cavalry at the first shock gave way and took flight in the direction of a little wood where they seemed to be seeking refuge Caesar followed close on their heels up to the edge of the forest then suddenly the pursued turned right about face three or four hundred archers came out of the wood to help them and Caesar s men seeing that they had fallen into an ambush took to their heels like cowards and abandoned their leader Left alone Caesar would not budge one step possibly he had had enough of life and his heroism was rather the result of satiety than courage however that may be he defended himself like a lion but riddled with arrows and bolts his horse at last fell with Caesar s leg under him His adversaries rushed upon him and one of them thrusting a sharp and slender iron pike through a weak place in his armour pierced his breast Caesar cursed God and died But the rest of the enemy s army was defeated thanks to the courage of Michelotto who fought like a valiant condottiere but learned on returning to the camp in the evening from those who had fled that they had abandoned Caesar and that he had never reappeared Then only too certain from his master s well known courage that disaster had occurred he desired to give one last proof of his devotion by not leaving his body to the wolves and birds of prey Torches were lighted for it was dark and with ten or twelve of those who had gone with Caesar as far as the little wood he went to seek his master On reaching the spot they pointed out he beheld five men stretched side by side four of them were dressed but the fifth had been stripped of his clothing and lay completely naked Michelotto dismounted lifted the head upon his knees and by the light of the torches recognised Caesar Thus fell on the tenth of March fifteen oh seven on an unknown field near an obscure village called Viane in a wretched skirmish with the vassal of a petty king the man whom Macchiavelli presents to all princes as the model of ability diplomacy and courage As to Lucrezia the fair Duchess of Ferrara she died full of years and honours adored as a queen by her subjects and sung as a goddess by Ariosto and by Bembo EPILOGUE There was once in Paris says Boccaccio a brave and good merchant named Jean de Civigny who did a great trade in drapery and was connected in business with a neighbour and fellow merchant a very rich man called Abraham who though a Jew enjoyed a good reputation Jean de Civigny appreciating the qualities of the worthy Israelite feared lest good man as he was his false religion would bring his soul straight to eternal perdition so he began to urge him gently as a friend to renounce his errors and open his eyes to the Christian faith which he could see for himself was prospering and spreading day by day being the only true and good religion whereas his own creed it was very plain was so quickly diminishing that it would soon disappear from the face of the earth The Jew replied that except in his own religion there was no salvation that he was born in it proposed to live and die in it and that he knew nothing in the world that could change his opinion Still in his proselytising fervour Jean would not think himself beaten and never a day passed but he demonstrated with those fair words the merchant uses to seduce a customer the superiority of the Christian religion above the Jewish and although Abraham was a great master of Mosaic law he began to enjoy his friend s preaching either because of the friendship he felt for him or because the Holy Ghost descended upon the tongue of the new apostle still obstinate in his own belief he would not change The more he persisted in his error the more excited was Jean about converting him so that at last by God s help being somewhat shaken by his friend s urgency Abraham one day said Listen Jean since you have it so much at heart that I should be converted behold me disposed to satisfy you but before I go to Rome to see him whom you call God s vicar on earth I must study his manner of life and his morals as also those of his brethren the cardinals and if as I doubt not they are in harmony with what you preach I will admit that as you have taken such pains to show me your faith is better than mine and I will do as you desire but if it should prove otherwise I shall remain a Jew as I was before for it is not worth while at my age to change my belief for a worse one Jean was very sad when he heard these words and he said mournfully to himself Now I have lost my time and pains which I thought I had spent so well when I was hoping to convert this unhappy Abraham for if he unfortunately goes as he says he will to the court of Rome and there sees the shameful life led by the servants of the Church instead of becoming a Christian the Jew will be more of a Jew than ever Then turning to Abraham he said Ah friend why do you wish to incur such fatigue and expense by going to Rome besides the fact that travelling by sea or by land must be very dangerous for so rich a man as you are Do you suppose there is no one here to baptize you If you have any doubts concerning the faith I have expounded where better than here will you find theologians capable of contending with them and allaying them So you see this voyage seems to me quite unnecessary just imagine that the priests there are such as you see here and all the better in that they are nearer to the supreme pastor If you are guided by my advice you will postpone this toil till you have committed some grave sin and need absolution then you and I will go together But the Jew replied I believe dear Jean that everything is as you tell me but you know how obstinate I am I will go to Rome or I will never be a Christian Then Jean seeing his great wish resolved that it was no use trying to thwart him and wished him good luck but in his heart he gave up all hope for it was certain that his friend would come back from his pilgrimage more of a Jew than ever if the court of Rome was still as he had seen it But Abraham mounted his horse and at his best speed took the road to Rome where on his arrival he was wonderfully well received by his coreligionists and after staying there a good long time he began to study the behaviour of the pope the cardinals and other prelates and of the whole court But much to his surprise he found out partly by what passed under his eyes and partly by what he was told that all from the pope downward to the lowest sacristan of saint Peter s were committing the sins of luxurious living in a most disgraceful and unbridled manner with no remorse and no shame so that pretty women and handsome youths could obtain any favours they pleased In addition to this sensuality which they exhibited in public he saw that they were gluttons and drunkards so much so that they were more the slaves of the belly than are the greediest of animals When he looked a little further he found them so avaricious and fond of money that they sold for hard cash both human bodies and divine offices and with less conscience than a man in Paris would sell cloth or any other merchandise Seeing this and much more that it would not be proper to set down here it seemed to Abraham himself a chaste sober and upright man that he had seen enough So he resolved to return to Paris and carried out the resolution with his usual promptitude Jean de Civigny held a great fete in honour of his return although he had lost hope of his coming back converted But he left time for him to settle down before he spoke of anything thinking there would be plenty of time to hear the bad news he expected But after a few days of rest Abraham himself came to see his friend and Jean ventured to ask what he thought of the Holy Father the cardinals and the other persons at the pontifical court At these words the Jew exclaimed God damn them all I never once succeeded in finding among them any holiness any devotion any good works but on the contrary luxurious living avarice greed fraud envy pride and even worse if there is worse all the machine seemed to be set in motion by an impulse less divine than diabolical After what I saw it is my firm conviction that your pope and of course the others as well are using all their talents art endeavours to banish the Christian religion from the face of the earth though they ought to be its foundation and support and since in spite of all the care and trouble they expend to arrive at this end I see that your religion is spreading every day and becoming more brilliant and more pure it is borne in upon me that the Holy Spirit Himself protects it as the only true and the most holy religion this is why deaf as you found me to your counsel and rebellious to your wish I am now ever since I returned from this Sodom firmly resolved on becoming a Christian So let us go at once to the church for I am quite ready to be baptized There is no need to say if Jean de Civigny who expected a refusal was pleased at this consent Without delay he went with his godson to Notre Dame de Paris where he prayed the first priest he met to administer baptism to his friend and this was speedily done and the new convert changed his Jewish name of Abraham into the Christian name of Jean and as the neophyte thanks to his journey to Rome had gained a profound belief his natural good qualities increased so greatly in the practice of our holy religion that after leading an exemplary life he died in the full odour of sanctity This tale of Boccaccio s gives so admirable an answer to the charge of irreligion which some might make against us if they mistook our intentions that as we shall not offer any other reply we have not hesitated to present it entire as it stands to the eyes of our readers And let us never forget that if the papacy has had an Innocent VIII and an Alexander VI who are its shame it has also had a Pius VII and a Gregory XVI who are its honour and glory END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK

of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected editions of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed Versions based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg org This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our
