moment when she came upon the bridge Frontispiece She made a long job of her bunch of holly I wasn t thinking of myself in particular Who s got it now Cynthy Fleda coloured and looked at her grandfather Fleda was sitting her face bowed in her hands She stood back and watched Then he seated himself beside her The children were always together He is not a pug They will expect me at home Well sir you know the road by Deacon Patterson s O uncle Rolf don t have anything to do with him Look at these roses and don t ask me for papers She knelt down before him How lovely it is Hugh Philetus was left to shuck and bring home a load of the fruit And there goes mister Carleton said Constance Fleda saw with a start that it was mister Carleton I am sure mister Thorn will excuse me My dear child he said holding her face in both his hands missus Rossitur sat there alone Barby s energies and fainting remedies were again put in use Then he stood and watched her Well take your place said Thorn I told him O you were not gone yet How are they all at home Is this the gentleman that s to be your husband Slowly and lingeringly they moved away The roses could not be sweeter to any one Queechy Chapter I A single cloud on a sunny day When all the rest of heaven is clear A frown upon the atmosphere That hath no business to appear When skies are blue and earth is gay Byron Come dear grandpa the old mare and the wagon are at the gate all ready Well dear responded a cheerful hearty voice they must wait a bit I haven t got my hat yet O I ll get that And the little speaker a girl of some ten or eleven years old dashed past the old gentleman and running along the narrow passage which led to his room soon returned with the hat in her hand Yes dear but that ain t all I must put on my great coat and I must look and see if I can find any money O yes for the post office It s a beautiful day grandpa Cynthy won t you come and help grandpa on with his great coat And I ll go out and keep watch of the old mare till you re ready A needless caution For the old mare though spirited enough for her years had seen some fourteen or fifteen of them and was in no sort of danger of running away She stood in what was called the back meadow just without the little paling fence that enclosed a small courtyard round the house Around this courtyard rich pasture fields lay on every side the high road cutting through them not more than a hundred or two feet from the house The little girl planted herself on the outside of the paling and setting her back to it eyed the old mare with great contentment for besides other grounds for security as to her quiet behaviour one of the men employed about the farm who had harnessed the equipage was at the moment busied in putting some clean straw in the bottom of the vehicle Watkins said the child presently to this person here is a strap that is just ready to come unbuckled What do you know about straps and buckles said the man rather grumly But he came round however to see what she meant and while he drew the one and fastened the other took special good care not to let Fleda know that her watchful eyes had probably saved the whole riding party from ruin as the loosing of the strap would of necessity have brought on a trial of the old mare s nerves which not all her philosophy could have been expected to meet Fleda was satisfied to see the buckle made fast and that Watkins roused by her hint or by the cause of it afterwards took a somewhat careful look over the whole establishment In high glee then she climbed to her seat in the little wagon and her grandfather coming out coated and hatted with some difficulty mounted to his place beside her I think Watkins might have taken the trouble to wash the wagon without hurting himself said Fleda it is all specked with mud since last time Ha n t he washed it said the old gentleman in a tone of displeasure Watkins Well Why didn t you wash the wagon as I told you I did It s all over slosh That s mister Didenhover s work he had it out day fore yesterday and if you want it cleaned mister Ringgan you must speak to him about it mister Didenhover may file his own doings it s more than I m a going to The old gentleman made no answer except to acquaint the mare with the fact of his being in readiness to set out A shade of annoyance and displeasure for a moment was upon his face but the gate opening from the meadow upon the high road had hardly swung back upon its hinges after letting them out when he recovered the calm sweetness of demeanour that was habitual with him and seemed as well as his little granddaughter to have given care the go by for the time Fleda had before this found out another fault in the harness or rather in mister Didenhover which like a wise little child she kept to herself A broken place which her grandfather had ordered to be properly mended was still tied up with the piece of rope which had offended her eyes the last time they had driven out But she said not a word of it because it would only worry grandpa for nothing and forgetting it almost immediately she moved on with him in a state of joyous happiness that no mud stained wagon nor untidy rope bound harness could stir for an instant Her spirit was like a clear still running stream which quietly and surely deposits every defiling and obscuring admixture it may receive from its contact with the grosser elements around the stream might for a moment be clouded but a little while and it would run as clear as ever Neither Fleda nor her grandfather cared a jot for the want of elegancies which one despised and the other if she had ever known had well nigh forgotten What mattered it to her that the little old green wagon was rusty and worn or that years and service had robbed the old mare of all the jauntiness she had ever possessed so long as the sun shone and the birds sang And mister Ringgan in any imaginary comparison might be pardoned for thinking that he was the proud man and that his poor little equipage carried such a treasure as many a coach and four went without Where are we going first grandpa to the post office Just there How pleasant it is to go there always isn t it grandpa You have the paper to get and I I don t very often get a letter but I have always the hope of getting one and that s something Maybe I ll have one to day grandpa We ll see It s time those cousins of yours wrote to you O they don t write to me it s only Aunt Lucy I never had a letter from a single one of them except once from little Hugh don t you remember grandpa I should think he must be a very nice little boy shouldn t you Little boy why I guess he is about as big as you are Fleda he is eleven years old ain t he Yes but I am past eleven you know grandpa and I am a little girl This reasoning being unanswerable mister Ringgan only bade the old mare trot on It was a pleasant day in autumn Fleda thought it particularly pleasant for riding for the sun was veiled with thin hazy clouds The air was mild and still and the woods like brave men putting the best face upon falling fortunes Some trees were already dropping their leaves the greater part standing in all the varied splendour which the late frosts had given them The road an excellent one sloped gently up and down across a wide arable country in a state of high cultivation and now shewing all the rich variety of autumn The redish buckwheat patches and fine wood tints of the fields where other grain had been the bright green of young rye or winter wheat then soberer coloured pasture or meadow lands and ever and anon a tuft of gay woods crowning a rising ground or a knot of the everlasting pines looking sedately and steadfastly upon the fleeting glories of the world around them these were mingled and interchanged and succeeded each other in ever varying fresh combinations With its high picturesque beauty the whole scene had a look of thrift and plenty and promise which made it eminently cheerful So mister Ringgan and his little granddaughter both felt it to be For some distance the grounds on either hand the road were part of the old gentleman s farm and many a remark was exchanged between him and Fleda as to the excellence or hopefulness of this or that crop or piece of soil Fleda entering into all his enthusiasm and reasoning of clover leys and cockle and the proper harvesting of Indian corn and other like matters with no lack of interest or intelligence O grandpa she exclaimed suddenly won t you stop a minute and let me get out I want to get some of that beautiful bittersweet What do you want that for said he You can t get out very well O yes I can please grandpa I want some of it very much just one minute He stopped and Fleda got out and went to the roadside where a bittersweet vine had climbed into a young pine tree and hung it as it were with red coral But her one minute was at least four before she had succeeded in breaking off as much as she could carry of the splendid creeper for not until then could Fleda persuade herself to leave it She came back and worked her way up into the wagon with one hand full as it could hold of her brilliant trophies Now what good ll that do you inquired mister Ringgan good humouredly as he lent Fleda what help he could to her seat Why grandpa I want it to put with cedar and pine in a jar at home it will keep for ever so long and look beautiful Isn t that handsome only it was a pity to break it Why yes it s handsome enough said mister Ringgan but you ve got something just by the front door there at home that would do just as well what do you call it that naming thing there What my burning bush O grandpa I wouldn t cut that for any thing in the world It s the only pretty thing about the house and besides said Fleda looking up with a softened mien you said that it was planted by my mother O grandpa I wouldn t cut that for any thing mister Ringgan laughed a pleased laugh Well dear said he it shall grow till it s as big as the house if it will It won t do that said Fleda But I am very glad I have got this bittersweet this is just what I wanted Now if I can only find some holly We ll come across some I guess by and by said mister Ringgan and Fleda settled herself again to enjoy the trees the fields the roads and all the small handiwork of nature for which her eyes had a curious intelligence But this was not fated to be a ride of unbroken pleasure Why what are those bars down for she said as they came up with a field of winter grain Somebody s been in here with a wagon O grandpa mister Didenhover has let the Shakers have my butternuts the butternuts that you told him they mustn t have The old gentleman drew up his horse So he has said he Their eyes were upon the far end of the deep lot where at the edge of one of the pieces of woodland spoken of a picturesque group of men and boys in frocks and broad brimmed white hats were busied in filling their wagon under a clump of the now thin and yellow leaved butternut trees The scoundrel said mister Ringgan under his breath Would it be any use grandpa for me to jump down and run and tell them you don t want them to take the butternuts I shall have so few No dear no said her grandfather they have got em about all by this time the mischief s done Didenhover meant to let em have em unknown to me and pocket the pay himself Get up Fleda drew a long breath and gave a hard look at the distant wagon where her butternuts were going in by handfuls She said no more It was but a few fields further on that the old gentleman came to a sudden stop again Ain t there some of my sheep over yonder there Fleda along with Squire Thornton s I don t know grandpa said Fleda I can t see yes I do see yes they are grandpa I see the mark I thought so said mister Ringgan bitterly I told Didenhover only three days ago that if he didn t make up that fence the sheep would be out or Squire Thornton s would be in only three days ago Ah well said he shaking the reins to make the mare move on again it s all of a piece Every thing goes I can t help it Why do you keep him grandpa if he don t behave right Fleda ventured to ask gently Cause I can t get rid of him dear mister Ringgan answered rather shortly And till they got to the post office he seemed in a disagreeable kind of muse which Fleda did not choose to break in upon So the mile and a half was driven in sober silence Shall I get out and go in grandpa said Fleda when he drew up before the house No deary said he in his usual kind tone you sit still Holloa there Good day mister Sampion have you got any thing for me The man disappeared and came out again There s your paper grandpa said Fleda Ay and something else said mister Ringgan I declare Miss Fleda Ringgan care of E Ringgan esquire There dear there it is Paris exclaimed Fleda as she clasped the letter and both her hands together The butternuts and mister Didenhover were forgotten at last The letter could not be read in the jolting of the wagon but as Fleda said it was all the pleasanter for she had the expectation of it the whole way home Where are we going now grandpa To Queechy Run That will give us a nice long ride I am very glad This has been a good day With my letter and my bittersweet I have got enough haven t I grandpa Queechy Run was a little village a very little village about half a mile from mister Ringgan s house It boasted however a decent brick church of some size a school house a lawyer s office a grocery store a dozen or two of dwelling houses and a post office though for some reason or other mister Ringgan always chose to have his letters come through the Sattlersville post office a mile and a half further off At the door of the lawyer s office mister Ringgan again stopped and again shouted Holloa Good day sir Is mister Jolly within He is sir Will you ask him to be so good as to step here a moment I cannot very well get out mister Jolly was a comfortable looking little man smooth and sleek pleasant and plausible reasonably honest too as the world goes a nice man to have to do with the world went so easy with his affairs that you were sure he would make no unnecessary rubs in your own He came now fresh and brisk to the side of the wagon with that uncommon hilarity which people sometimes assume when they have a disagreeable matter on hand that must be spoken of Good morning sir Fine day mister Jolly Beautiful day sir Splendid season How do you do mister Ringgan Why sir I never was better in my life barring this lameness that disables me very much I can t go about and see to things any more as I used to However we must expect evils at my time of life I don t complain I have a great deal to be thankful for Yes sir we have a great deal to be thankful for said mister Jolly rather abstractedly and patting the old mare with kind attention Have you seen that fellow McGowan said mister Ringgan abruptly and in a lower tone I have seen him said mister Jolly coming back from the old mare to business He s a hard customer I guess ain t he He s as ugly a cur as ever was whelped What does he say Says he must have it Did you tell him what I told you I told him sir that you had not got the returns from your farm that you expected this year owing to one thing and nother and that you couldn t make up the cash for him all at once and that he would have to wait a spell but that he d be sure to get it in the long run Nobody ever suffered by mister Ringgan yet as I told him Well Well sir he was altogether refractible he s as pig headed a fellow as I ever see What did he say He gave me names and swore he wouldn t wait a day longer said he d waited already six months He has so I couldn t meet the last payment There s a year s rent due now I can t help it There needn t have been an hour if I could go about and attend to things myself I have been altogether disappointed in that Didenhover I expect you have What do you suppose he ll do mister Jolly McGowan I mean I expect he ll do what the law ll let him mister Ringgan I don t know what ll hinder him It s a worse turn than I thought my infirmities would ever play me said the old gentleman after a short pause first to lose the property altogether and then not to be permitted to wear out what is left of life in the old place there won t be much So I told him mister Ringgan I put it to him Says I mister McGowan it s a cruel hard business there ain t a man in town that wouldn t leave mister Ringgan the shelter of his own roof as long as he wants any and think it a pleasure if the rent was anyhow Well well said the old gentleman with a mixture of dignity and bitterness it doesn t much matter My head will find a shelter somehow above ground or under it The Lord will provide Whey stand still can t ye what ails the fool The creature s seen years enough to be steady he added with a miserable attempt at his usual cheerful laugh Fleda had turned away her head and tried not to hear when the lowered tones of the speakers seemed to say that she was one too many in the company But she could not help catching a few bits of the conversation and a few bits were generally enough for Fleda s wit to work upon she had a singular knack at putting loose ends of talk together If more had been wanting the tones of her grandfather s voice would have filled up every gap in the meaning of the scattered words that came to her ear Her heart sank fast as the dialogue went on and she needed no commentary or explanation to interpret the bitter little laugh with which it closed It was a chill upon all the rosy joys and hopes of a most joyful and hopeful little nature The old mare was in motion again but Fleda no longer cared or had the curiosity to ask where they were going The bittersweet lay listlessly in her lap her letter clasped to her breast was not thought of and tears were quietly running one after the other down her cheeks and falling on her sleeve she dared not lift her handkerchief nor turn her face towards her grandfather lest they should catch his eye Her grandfather could it be possible that he must be turned out of his old home in his old age could it be possible mister Jolly seemed to think it might be and her grandfather seemed to think it must Leave the old house But where would he go Son or daughter he had none left resources be could have none or this need not happen Work he could not be dependent upon the charity of any kin or friend she knew he would never she remembered hearing him once say he could better bear to go to the almshouse than do any such thing And then if they went he would have his pleasant room no more where the sun shone in so cheerfully and they must leave the dear old kitchen where they had been so happy and the meadows and hills would belong to somebody else and she would gather her stores of buttercups and chestnuts under the loved old trees never again But these things were nothing though the image of them made the tears come hot and fast these were nothing in her mind to the knowledge or the dread of the effect the change would have upon mister Ringgan Fleda knew him and knew it would not be slight Whiter his head could not be more bowed it well might and her own bowed in anticipation as her childish fears and imaginings ran on into the possible future Of McGowan s tender mercies she had no hope She had seen him once and being unconsciously even more of a physiognomist than most children are that one sight of him was enough to verify all mister Jolly had said The remembrance of his hard sinister face sealed her fears Nothing but evil could come of having to do with such a man It was however still not so much any foreboding of the future that moved Fleda s tears as the sense of her grandfather s present pain the quick answer of her gentle nature to every sorrow that touched him His griefs were doubly hers Both from his openness of character and her penetration they could rarely be felt unshared and she shared them always in more than due measure In beautiful harmony while the child had forgotten herself in keen sympathy with her grandfather s sorrows he on the other hand had half lost sight of them in caring for her Again and this time not before any house but in a wild piece of woodland the little wagon came to a stop Ain t there some holly berries that I see yonder said mister Ringgan there through those white birch stems That s what you were wanting Fleda ain t it Give your bittersweet to me while you go get some and here take this knife dear you can t break it Don t cut yourself Fleda s eyes were too dim to see white birch or holly and she had no longer the least desire to have the latter but with that infallible tact which assuredly is the gift of nature and no other she answered in a voice that she forced to be clear O yes thank you grandpa and stealthily dashing away the tears clambered down from the rickety little wagon and plunged with a cheerful step at least through trees and underbrush to the clump of holly But if anybody had seen Fleda s face while she seemed to be busied in cutting as large a quantity as possible of the rich shining leaves and bright berries Her grandfather s kindness and her effort to meet it had wrung her heart she hardly knew what she was doing as she cut off sprig after sprig and threw them down at her feet she was crying sadly with even audible sobs She made a long job of her bunch of holly But when at last it must come to an end she choked back her tears smoothed her face and came back to mister Ringgan smiling and springing over the stones and shrubs in her way and exclaiming at the beauty of her vegetable stores If her cheeks were red he thought it was the flush of pleasure and exercise and she did not let him get a good look at her eyes Why you ve got enough to dress up the front room chimney said he That ll be the best thing you can do with em won t it The front room chimney No indeed I won t grandpa I don t want em where nobody can see them and you know we are never in there now it is cold weather Well dear anyhow you like to have it But you ha n t a jar in the house big enough for them have you O I ll manage I ve got an old broken pitcher without a handle grandpa that ll do very well A broken pitcher that isn t a very elegant vase said he O you wouldn t know it is a pitcher when I have fixed it I ll cover up all the broken part with green you know Are we going home now grandpa No I want to stop a minute at uncle Joshua s Uncle Joshua was a brother in law of mister Ringgan a substantial farmer and very well to do in the world He was found not in the house but abroad in the field with his men loading an enormous basket wagon with corn stalks At mister Ringgan s shout he got over the fence and came to the wagon side His face showed sense and shrewdness but nothing of the open nobility of mien which nature had stamped upon that of his brother Illustration She made a long job of her bunch of holly Fine morning eh said he I m getting in my corn stalks So I see said mister Ringgan How do you find the new way of curing them answer Fine as ever you see Sweet as a nut The cattle are mad after them How are you going to be off for fodder this winter It s more than I can tell you said mister Ringgan There ought to be more than plenty but Didenhover contrives to bring everything out at the wrong end I wish I was rid of him He ll never get a berth with me I can tell you said uncle Joshua laughing Brother said mister Ringgan lowering his tone again have you any loose cash you could let me have for six months or so Uncle Joshua took a meditative look down the road turned a quid of tobacco in his cheek and finally brought his eyes again to mister Ringgan and answered Well I don t see as I can said he You see Josh is just a going to set up for himself at Kenton and he ll want some help of me and I expect that ll be about as much as I can manage to lay my hands on Do you know who has any that he would be likely to lend said mister Ringgan No I don t Money is rather scarce For your rent eh Yes for my rent The farm brings me in nothing but my living That Didenhover is ruining me brother Joshua He s feathering his own nest I reckon You may swear to that There wa n t as many bushels of grain by one fourth when they were threshed out last year as I had calculated there would be in the field I don t know what on earth he could have done with it I suppose it ll be the same thing over this year Maybe he has served you as Deacon Travis was served by one of his help last season the rascal bored holes in the granary floor and let out the corn so and Travis couldn t contrive how his grain went till the floor was empty next spring and then he see how it was Ha did he catch the fellow Not he he had made tracks before that A word in your ear I wouldn t let Didenhover see much of his salary till you know how he will come out at the end He has got it already said mister Ringgan with a nervous twitch at the old mare s head he wheedled me out of several little sums on one pretence and another he had a brother in New York that he wanted to send some to and goods that he wanted to get out of pawn and so on and I let him have it and then there was one of those fatting steers that he proposed to me to let him have on account and I thought it was as good a way of paying him as any and that made up pretty near the half of what was due to him I warrant you his n was the fattest of the whole lot Well keep a tight hold of the other half brother Elzevir that s my advice to you The other half he was to make upon shares Whew I well I wish you well rid of him and don t make such another bargain again Good day to ye It was with a keen pang that little Fleda saw the down hearted look of her grandfather as again he pave the old mare notice to move on A few minutes passed in deep thought on both sides Grandpa said Fleda wouldn t mister Jolly perhaps know of somebody that might have some money to lend I declare said the old gentleman after a moment that s not a bad thought I wonder I didn t have it myself They turned about and without any more words measured back their way to Queechy Run mister Jolly came out again brisk and alert as ever but after seeming to rack his brains in search of any actual or possible money lender was obliged to confess that it was in vain he could not think of one But I ll tell you what mister Ringgan he concluded I ll turn it over in my mind to night and see if I can think of any thing that ll do and if I can I ll let you know If we hadn t such a nether millstone to deal with it would be easy enough to work it somehow So they set forth homewards again Cheer up dear said the old gentleman heartily laying one hand on his little granddaughter s lap it will be arranged somehow Don t you worry your little head with business God will take care of us Yes grandpa said the little girl looking up with an instant sense of relief at these words and then looking down again immediately to burst into tears Chapter II Have you seen but a bright lily grow Before rude hands have touch d it Ha you mark d but the fall o the snow Before the soil hath smutch d it Ben Jonson Where a ray of light can enter the future a child s hope can find a way a way that nothing less airy and spiritual can travel By the time they reached their own door Fleda s spirits were at par again I am very glad we have got home aren t you grandpa she said as she jumped down I m so hungry I guess we are both of us ready for supper don t you think so She hurried up stairs to take off her wrappings and then came down to the kitchen where standing on the broad hearth and warming herself at the blaze with all the old associations of comfort settling upon her heart it occurred to her that foundations so established could not be shaken The blazing fire seemed to welcome her home and bid her dismiss fear the kettle singing on its accustomed hook looked as if quietly ridiculing the idea that they could be parted company her grandfather was in his cushioned chair at the corner of the hearth reading the newspaper as she had seen him a thousand times just in the same position with that collected air of grave enjoyment one leg crossed over the other settled back in his chair but upright and scanning the columns with an intent but most un careful face A face it was that always had a rare union of fineness and placidness The table stood spread in the usual place warmth and comfort filled every corner of the room and Pleda began to feel as if she had been in an uncomfortable dream which was very absurd but from which she was very glad she had awoke What have you got in this pitcher Cynthy said she Muffins O let me bake them will you I ll bake them Now Fleda said Cynthy just you be quiet There ain t no place where you can bake em I m just going to clap em in the reflector that s the shortest way I can take to do em You keep yourself out o muss They won t be muffins if you bake em in the reflector Cynthy they aren t half so good Ah do let me I I won t make a bit of muss Where ll you do em In grandpa s room if you ll just clean off the top of the stove for me now do Cynthy I ll do em beautifully and you won t have a bit of trouble Come It ll make an awful smoke Flidda you ll fill your grandpa s room with the smoke and he won t like that I guess O he won t mind it said Fleda Will you grandpa What dear said mister Ringgan looking up at her from his paper with a relaxing face which indeed promised to take nothing amiss that she might do Will you mind if I fill your room with smoke No dear said he the strong heartiness of his acquiescence almost reaching a laugh No dear fill it with anything you like There was nothing more to be said and while Fleda in triumph put on an apron and made her preparations Cynthy on her part and with a very good grace went to get ready the stove which being a wood stove made of sheet iron with a smooth even top afforded in Fleda s opinion the very best possible field for muffins to come to their perfection Now Fleda cared little in comparison for the eating part of the business her delight was by the help of her own skill and the stove top to bring the muffins to this state of perfection her greatest pleasure in them was over when they were baked A little while had passed mister Ringgan was still busy with his newspaper Miss Cynthia Gall going in and out on various errands Fleda shut up in the distant room with the muffins and the smoke when there came a knock at the door and mister Ringgan s Come in was followed by the entrance of two strangers young well dressed and comely They wore the usual badges of seekers after game but their guns were left outside The old gentleman s look of grave expectancy told his want of enlightening I fear you do not remember me mister Ringgan said the foremost of the two coming up to him my name is Rossitur Charlton Rossitur a cousin of your little grand daughter I have only O I know you now said mister Ringgan rising and grasping his hand heartily you are very welcome sir How do you do I recollect you perfectly but you took me by surprise How do you do sir Sit down sit down And the old gentleman had extended his frank welcome to the second of his visitors almost before the first had time to utter My friend mister Carleton I couldn t imagine what was coming upon me said mister Ringgan cheerfully for you weren t anywhere very near my thoughts and I don t often see much of the gay world that is passing by me You have grown since I saw you last mister Rossitur You are studying at West Point I believe No sir I was studying there but I had the pleasure of bringing that to an end last June Ah Well what are you now Not a cadet any longer I suppose No sir we hatch out of that shell lieutenants Hum And do you intend to remain in the army Certainly sir that is my purpose and hope Your mother would not like that I should judge I do not understand how she ever made up her mind to let you become that thing which hatches out into a lieutenant Gentle creatures she and her sister both were How was it mister Rossitur were you a wild young gentleman that wanted training I have had it sir whether I wanted it or no Hum How is he mister Carleton sober enough to command men I have not seen him tried sir said this gentleman smiling but from tho inconsistency of the orders he issues to his dogs I doubt it exceedingly Why Carleton would have no orders issued to them at all I believe said young Rossitur he has been saying hush to me all day The old gentleman laughed in a way that indicated intelligence with one of the speakers which appeared not So you ve been following the dogs to day said he Been successful Not a bit of it said Rossitur Whether we got on the wrong grounds or didn t get on the right ones or the dogs didn t mind their business or there was nothing to fire at I don t know but we lost our patience and got nothing in exchange Speak for yourself said the other I assure you I was sensible of no ground of impatience while going over such a superb country as this It is a fine country said mister Ringgan all this tract and I ought to know it for I have hunted every mile of it for many a mile around There used to be more game than partridges in these hills when I was a young man bears and wolves and deer and now and then a panther to say nothing of rattlesnakes That last mentioned is an irregular sort of game is it not said mister Carleton smiling Well game is what you choose to make it said the old gentleman I have seen worse days sport than I saw once when we were out after rattlesnakes and nothing else There was a cave sir down under a mountain a few miles to the south of this right at the foot of a bluff some four or five hundred feet sheer down it was known to be a resort of those creatures and a party of us went out it s many years ago now to see if we couldn t destroy the nest exterminate the whole horde We had one dog with us a little dog a kind of spaniel a little white and yellow fellow and he did the work Well sir how many of those vermin do you guess that little creature made a finish of that day of large and small sir there were two hundred and twelve He must have been a gallant little fellow You never saw a creature sir take to a sport better he just dashed in among them from one to another he would catch a snake by the neck and give it a shake and throw it down and rush at another poor fellow it was his last day s sport he died almost as soon as it was over he must have received a great many bites The place is known as the rattlesnakes den to this day though there are none there now I believe My little cousin is well I hope said mister Rossitur She yes bless her I she is always well Where is she Fairy where are you Cynthy just call Elfieda here She s just in the thick of the muffins mister Ringgan Let the muffins burn Call her Miss Cynthia accordingly opened a little way the door of the passage from which a blue stifling smoke immediately made its way into the room and called out to Fleda whose little voice was heard faintly responding from the distance It s a wonder she can hear through all that smoke remarked Cynthia She said mister Ringgan laughing she s playing cook or housekeeper in yonder getting something ready for tea She s a busy little spirit if ever there was one Ah there she is Come here Fleda here s your cousin Rossitur from West Point and mister Carleton Fleda made her appearance flushed with the heat of the stove and the excitement of turning the muffins and the little iron spatula she used for that purpose still in her hand and a fresh and larger puff of the unsavoury blue smoke accompanied her entrance She came forward however gravely and without the slightest embarrassment to receive her cousin s somewhat unceremonious How do Fleda and keeping the spatula still in one hand shook hands with him with the other But at the very different manner in which mister Carleton rose and greeted her the flush on Fleda s cheek deepened and she cast down her eyes and stepped back to her grandfather s side with the demureness of a young lady just undergoing the ceremony of presentation You come upon us out of a cloud Fleda said her cousin Is that the way you have acquired a right to the name of Fairy I am sure no said mister Carleton Fleda did not lift up her eyes but her mounting colour shewed that she understood both speeches Because if you are in general such a misty personage mister Rossitur went on half laughing I would humbly recommend a choice of incense O I forgot to open the windows exclaimed Fleda ingenuously Cynthy won t you please go and do it And take this with you said she holding out the spatula She is as good a fairy as I want to see said her grandfather passing his arm fondly round her She carries a ray of sunshine in her right hand and that s as magic working a wand as any fairy ever wielded hey mister Carleton mister Carleton bowed But whether the sunshine of affection in Fleda s glance and smile at her grandfather made him feel that she was above a compliment or whether it put the words out of his head certain it is that he uttered none So you ve had bad success to day continued mister Ringgan Where have you been and what after partridges No sir said mister Carleton my friend Rossitur promised me a rare bag of woodcock which I understand to be the best of American feathered game and in pursuance of his promise led me over a large extent of meadow and swamp land this morning with which in the course of several hours I became extremely familiar without flushing a single bird Meadow and swamp land said the old gentleman Whereabouts A mile or more beyond the little village over here where we left our horses said Rossitur We beat the ground well but there were no signs of them even We had not the right kind of dog said mister Carleton We had the kind that is always used here said Rossitur nobody knows anything about a Cocker in America Ah it was too wet said mister Ringgan I could have told you that There has been too much rain You wouldn t find a woodcock in that swamp after such a day as we had a few days ago But speaking of game mister Rossitur I don t know anything in America equal to the grouse It is far before woodcock I remember many years back going a grouse shooting I and a friend down in Pennsylvania we went two or three days running and the birds we got were worth a whole season of woodcock But gentlemen if you are not discouraged with your day s experience and want to try again I ll put you in a way to get as many woodcock as will satisfy you if you ll come here to morrow morning I ll go out with you far enough to shew you the way to the best ground I know for shooting that game in all this country you ll have a good chance for partridges too in the course of the day and that ain t bad eating when you can t get better is it Fairy he said with a sudden smiling appeal to the little girl at his side Her answer again was only an intelligent glance The young sportsmen both thanked him and promised to take advantage of his kind offer Fleda seized the opportunity to steal another look at the strangers but meeting mister Carleton s eyes fixed on her with a remarkably soft and gentle expression she withdrew her own again as fast as possible and came to the conclusion that the only safe place for them was the floor I wish I was a little younger and I d take my gun and go along with you myself said the old gentleman pleasantly but he added sighing there is a time for everything and my time for sporting is past You have no right to complain sir said mister Carleton with a meaning glance and smile which the old gentleman took in excellent good part Well said he looking half proudly half tenderly upon the little demure figure at his side I don t say that I have I hope I thank God for his mercies and am happy But in this world mister Carleton there is hardly a blessing but what draws a care after it Well well these things will all be arranged for us It was plain however even to a stranger that there was some subject of care not vague nor undefined pressing upon mister Ringgan s mind as he said this Have you heard from my mother lately Fleda said her cousin Why yes said mister Ringgan she had a letter from her only to day You ha n t read it yet have you Fleda No grandpa said the little girl you know I ve been busy Ay said the old gentleman why couldn t you let Cynthia bake the cakes and not roast yourself over the stove till you re as red as a turkey cock This morning I was like a chicken said Fleda laughing and now like a turkey cock Shall I tell mamma Fleda said young Rossitur that you put off reading her letter to bake muffins Fleda answered without looking up Yes if he pleased What do you suppose she will think I don t know She will think that you love muffins better than her No said Fleda quietly but firmly she will not think that because it isn t true The gentlemen laughed but mister Carleton declared that Fleda s reasoning was unanswerable Well I will see you to morrow said mister Rossitur after you have read the letter for I suppose you will read it sometime You should have had it before it came enclosed to me but I forgot unaccountably to mail it to you till a few days ago It will be just as good now sir said mister Ringgan There is a matter in it though said Rossitur about which my mother has given me a charge We will see you to morrow It was for that partly we turned out of our way this evening I am very glad you did said mister Ringgan I hope your way will bring you here often Won t you stay and try some of these same muffins before you go But this was declined and the gentlemen departed Fleda it must be confessed seeing nothing in the whole leave taking but mister Carleton s look and smile The muffins were a very tame affair after it When supper was over she sat down fairly to her letter and read it twice through before she folded it up By this time the room was clear both of the tea equipage and of Cynthia s presence and Fleda and her grandfather were alone in the darkening twilight with the blazing wood fire he in his usual place at the side and she on the hearth directly before it both silent both thinking for some time At length mister Ringgan spoke breaking as it were the silence and his seriousness with the same effort Well dear said he cheerfully what does she say O she says a great many things grandpa shall I read yon the letter No dear I don t care to hear it only tell me what she says She says they are going to stay in Paris yet a good while longer Hum said mister Ringgan Well that ain t the wisest thing I should like to hear of her doing Oh but it s because uncle Rossitur likes to stay there I suppose isn t it grandpa I don t know dear Maybe your aunt s caught the French fever She used to be a good sensible woman but when people will go into a whirligig I think some of their wits get blown away before they come out Well what else I am sure she is very kind said Fleda She wants to have me go out there and live with her very much She says I shall have everything I like and do just as I please and she will make a pet of me and give me all sorts of pleasant things She says she will take as good care of me as ever I took of the kittens And there s a long piece to you about it that I ll give you to read as soon as we have a light It is very good of her isn t it grandpa I love aunt Lucy very much Well said mister Ringgan after a pause how does she propose to get you there Why said Fleda isn t it curious she says there is a missus Carleton here who is a friend of hers and she is going to Paris in a little while and aunt Lucy asked her if she wouldn t bring me if you would let me go and she said she would with great pleasure and aunt Lucy wants me to come out with her Carleton Hum said mister Ringgan that must be this young man s mother Yes aunt Lucy says she is here with her son at least she says they were coming A very gentlemanly young man indeed said mister Ringgan There was a grave silence The old gentleman sat looking on the floor Fleda sat looking into the fire with all her might Well said mister Ringgan after a little how would you like it Fleda What grandpa To go out to Paris to your aunt with this missus Carleton I shouldn t like it at all said Fleda smiling and letting her eyes go back to the fire But looking after the pause of a minute or two again to her grandfather s face she was struck with its expression of stern anxiety She rose instantly and coming to him and laying one hand gently on his knee said in tones that fell as light on the ear as the touch of a moonbeam on the water You do not want me to go do you grandpa No dear said the old gentleman letting his hand fall upon hers no dear that is the last thing I want But Fleda s keen ear discerned not only the deep affection but something of regret in the voice which troubled her She stood anxious and fearing while her grandfather lifting his hand again and again let it fall gently upon hers and amid all the fondness of the action Fleda somehow seemed to feel in it the same regret You ll not let aunt Lucy nor anybody else take me away from you will you grandpa said she after a little leaning both arms affectionately on his knee and looking up into his face No indeed dear said he with an attempt at his usual heartiness not as long as I have a place to keep you While I have a roof to put my head under it shall cover yours To Fleda s hope that would have said enough but her grandfather s face was so moved from its wonted expression of calm dignity that it was plain his hope was tasting bitter things Fleda watched in silent grief and amazement the watering eye and unnerved lip till her grandfather indignantly dashing away a tear or two drew her close to his breast and kissed her But she well guessed that the reason why he did not for a minute or two say anything was because he could not Neither could she She was fighting with her woman s nature to keep it down learning the lesson early Ah well said mister Ringgan at length in a kind of tone that might indicate the giving up a struggle which he had no means of carrying on or the endeavour to conceal it from the too keen wrought feelings of his little granddaughter there will be a way opened for us somehow We must let our Heavenly Father take care of us And he will grandpa whispered Fleda Yes dear We are selfish creatures Your father s and your mother s child will not be forgotten Nor you either dear grandpa said the little girl laying her soft cheek alongside of his and speaking by dint of a great effort No said he clasping her more tenderly no it would he wicked in me to doubt it He has blessed me all my life long with a great many more blessings than I deserved and if he chooses to take away the sunshine of my last days I will bow my head to his will and believe that he does all things well though I cannot see it Don t dear grandpa said Fleda stealing her other arm round his neck and hiding her face there please don t He very much regretted that he had said too much He did not however know exactly how to mend it He kissed her and stroked her soft hair but that and the manner of it only made it more difficult for Fleda to recover herself which she was struggling to do and when he tried to speak in accents of cheering his voice trembled Fleda s heart was breaking but she felt that she was making matters worse and she had already concluded on a mature review of circumstances that it was her duty to be cheerful So after a few very heartfelt tears which she could not help she raised her head and smiled even while she wiped the traces of them away After all grandpa said she perhaps mister Jolly will come here in the morning with some good news and then we should be troubling ourselves just for nothing Perhaps he will said mister Ringgan in a way that sounded much more like Perhaps he won t But Fleda was determined now not to seem discouraged again She thought the best way was to change the conversation It is very kind in aunt Lucy isn t it grandpa what she has written to me Why no said mister Ringgan decidedly I can t say I think it is any very extraordinary manifestation of kindness in anybody to want you Fleda smiled her thanks for this compliment It might be a kindness in me to give you to her It wouldn t be a kindness to me grandpa I don t know about that said he gravely They were getting back to the old subject Fleda made another great effort at a diversion Grandpa was my father like my uncle Rossitur in any thing The diversion was effected Not he dear said mister Ringgan Your father had ten times the man in him that ever your uncle was Why what kind of a man is uncle Rossitur grandpa Ho dear I can t tell I ha n t seen much of him I wouldn t judge a man without knowing more of him than I do of mister Rossitur He seemed an amiable kind of man But no one would ever have thought of looking at him no more than at a shadow when your father was by The diversion took effect on Fleda herself now She looked up pleased You remember your father Fleda Yes grandpa but not very well always I remember a great many things about him but I can t remember exactly how he looked except once or twice Ay and he wa n t well the last time you remember him But he was a noble looking man in form and face too and his looks were the worst part of him He seemed made of different stuff from all the people around said mister Ringgan sighing and they felt it too I used to notice without knowing it When his cousins were Sam and Johnny and Bill he was always that is after he grew up Mr Walter I believe they were a little afeard of him And with all his bravery and fire he could be as gentle as a woman I know that said Fleda whose eyes were dropping soft tears and glittering at the same time with gratified feeling What made him be a soldier grandpa Oh I don t know dear he was too good to make a farmer of or his high spirit wanted to rise in the world he couldn t rest without trying to be something more than other folks I don t know whether people are any happier for it Did he go to West Point grandpa No dear he started without having so much of a push as that but he was one of those that don t need any pushing he would have worked his way up put him anywhere you would and he did over the heads of West Pointers and all and would have gone to the top I verily believe if he had lived long enough He was as fine a fellow as there was in all the army I don t believe there s the like of him left in it He had been a major a good while hadn t he grandpa Yes It was just after he was made captain that he went to Albany and there he saw your mother She and her sister your aunt Lucy were wards of the patroon I was in Albany in the legislature that winter and I knew them both very well but your aunt Lucy had been married some years before She was staying there that winter without her husband he was abroad somewhere Fleda was no stranger to these details and had learned long ago what was meant by wards and the patroon Your father was made a major some years afterwards mister Ringgan went on for his fine behaviour out here at the West what s the name of the place I forget it just now fighting the Indians There never was anything finer done He was brave wasn t he grandpa Brave he had a heart of iron sometimes for as soft as it was at others And he had an eye when he was roused that I never saw anything that would stand against But your father had a better sort of courage than the common sort he had enough of that but this is a rarer thing he never was afraid to do what in his conscience he thought was right Moral courage I call it and it is one of the very noblest qualities a man can have That s a kind of courage a woman may have said Fleda Yes you may have that and I guess it s the only kind of courage you ll ever be troubled with said her grandfather looking laughingly at her However any man may walk up to the cannon s mouth but it is only one here and there that will walk out against men s opinions because he thinks it is right That was one of the things I admired most in your father Didn t my mother have it too said Fleda I don t know she had about everything that was good A gweet pretty creature she was as I ever saw Was she like aunt Lucy No not much She was a deal handsomer than your aunt is or ever could have been She was the handsomest woman I think that ever I set eyes upon and a sweet gentle lovely creature You ll never match her said mister Ringgan with a curious twist of his head and sly laughing twist of his eyes at Fleda you may be as good as she was but you ll never be as good looking Fleda laughed nowise displeased You ve got her hazel eyes though remarked mister Ringgan after a minute or two viewing his little granddaughter with a sufficiently satisfied expression of countenance Grandpa said she don t you think mister Carleton has handsome eyes mister Carleton hum I don t know I didn t look at his eyes A very well looking young man though very gentlemanly too Fleda had heard all this and much more about her parents some dozens of times before but she and her grandfather were never tired of going it over If the conversation that recalled his lost treasures had of necessity a character of sadness and tenderness it yet bespoke not more regret that he had lost them than exulting pride and delight in what they had been perhaps not so much And Fleda delighted to go back and feed her imagination with stories of the mother whom she could not remember and of the father whose fair bright image stood in her memory as the embodiment of all that is high and noble and pure A kind of guardian angel that image was to little Fleda These ideal likenesses of her father and mother the one drawn from history and recollection the other from history only had been her preservative from all the untoward influences and unfortunate examples which had surrounded her since her father s death some three or four years before had left her almost alone in her grandfather s house They had created in her mind a standard of the true and beautiful in character which nothing she saw around her after of course her grandfather and one other exception seemed at all to meet and partly from her own innate fineness of nature and partly from this pure ideal always present with her she had shrunk almost instinctively from the few varieties of human nature the country side presented to her and was in fact a very isolated little being living in a world of her own and clinging with all her strong outgoings of affection to her grandfather only granting to but one other person any considerable share in her regard or esteem Little Fleda was not in the least misanthropical she gave her kindly sympathies to all who came in her way on whom they could possibly be bestowed but these people were nothing to her her spirit fell off from them even in their presence there was no affinity She was in truth what her grandfather had affirmed of her father made of different stuff from the rest of the world There was no tincture of pride in all this there was no conscious feeling of superiority she could merely have told you that she did not care to hear these people talk that she did not love to be with them though she would have said so to no earthly creature but her grandfather if even to him Illustration I wasn t thinking of myself in particular It must be pleasant said Fleda after looking for some minutes thoughtfully into the fire it must be a pleasant thing to have a father and mother Yes dear said her grandfather sighing you have lost a great deal But there is your aunt Lucy you are not dependent altogether on me Oh grandpa said the little girl laying one hand again pleadingly on his knee I didn t mean I mean I was speaking in general I wasn t thinking of myself in particular I know dear said he as before taking the little hand in his own and moving it softly up and down on his knee But the action was sad and there was the same look of sorrowful stern anxiety Fleda got up and put her arm over his shoulder speaking from a heart filled too full I don t want aunt Lucy I don t care about aunt Lucy I don t want anything but you grandpa I wish you wouldn t talk so Ah well dear said he without looking at her he couldn t bear to look at her it s well it is so I sha n t last a great while it isn t likely and I am glad to know there is some one you can fall back upon when I am gone Pleda s next words were scarcely audible but they contained a reproach to him for speaking so We may as well look at it dear said he gravely it must come to that sooner or later but you mustn t distress yourself about it beforehand Don t cry don t dear said he tenderly kissing her I didn t mean to trouble you so There there look up dear let s take the good we have and be thankful for it God will arrange the rest in his own good way Fleda I wouldn t have said a word if I had thought it would have worried you so He would not indeed But he had spoken as men so often speak out of the depths of their own passion or bitterness forgetting that they are wringing the cords of a delicate harp and not knowing what mischief they have done till they find the instrument all out of tune more often not knowing it ever It is pity for how frequently a discord is left that jars all life long and how much more frequently still the harp though retaining its sweetness and truth of tone to the end is gradually unstrung Poor Fleda could hardly hold up her head for a long time and recalling bitterly her unlucky innocent remark which had led to all this trouble she almost made up her mind with a certain heroine of Miss Edgeworth s that it is best never to mention things mister Ringgan now thoroughly alive to the wounds he had been inflicting held his little pet in his arms pillowed her head on his breast and by every tender and soothing action and word endeavoured to undo what he had done And after a while the agony was over the wet eyelashes were lifted up and the meek sorrowful little face lay quietly upon mister Ringgan s breast gazing out into the fire as gravely as if the Panorama of life were there She little heeded at first her grandfather s cheering talk she knew it was for a purpose Ain t it most time for you to go to bed whispered mister Ringgan when he thought the purpose was effected Shall I tell Cynthy to get you your milk grandpa said the little girl rousing herself Yes dear Stop what if you and me was to have some roast apples wouldn t you like it Well yes I should grandpa said Fleda understanding perfectly why he wished it and wishing it herself for that same reason and no other Cynthy let s have some of those roast apples said mister Ringgan and a couple of bowls of milk here No I ll get the apples myself Cynthy said Fleda And you needn t take any of the cream off Cynthy added mister Ringgan One corner of the kitchen table was hauled up to the fire to be comfortable Fleda said and she and her grandfather sat down on the opposite sides of it to do honour to the apples and milk each with the simple intent of keeping up appearances and cheating the other into cheerfulness There is however deny it who can an exhilarating effect in good wholesome food taken when one is in some need of it and Fleda at least found the supper relish exceeding well Every one furthermore knows the relief of a hearty flow of tears when a secret weight has been pressing on the mind She was just ready for anything reviving After the third mouthful she began to talk and before the bottom of the bowls was reached she had smiled more than once So her grandfather thought no harm was done and went to bed quite comforted and Fleda climbed the steep stairs that led from his door to her little chamber just over his head It was small and mean immediately under the roof with only one window There were plenty of better rooms in the house but Fleda liked this because it kept her near her grandfather and indeed she had always had it ever since her father s death and never thought of taking any other She had a fashion this child in whom the simplicity of practical life and the poetry of imaginative life were curiously blended she had a fashion of going to her window every night when the moon or stars were shining to look out for a minute or two before she went to bed and sometimes the minutes were more than any good grandmother or aunt would have considered wholesome for little Fleda in the fresh night air But there was no one to watch or reprimand and whatever it was that Fleda read in earth or sky the charm which held her one bright night was sure to bring her to her window the next This evening a faint young moon lighted up but dimly the meadow and what was called the east hill over against which the window in question looked The air was calm and mild there was no frost to night the stillness was entire and the stars shone in a cloudless sky Fleda set open the window and looked out with a face that again bore tokens of the experiences of that day She wanted the soothing speech of nature s voice and child as she was she could hear it She did not know in her simplicity what it was that comforted and soothed her but she stood at her window enjoying It was so perfectly still her fancy presently went to all those people who had hushed their various work and were now resting or soon would be in the unconsciousness and the helplessness of sleep The helplessness and then that Eye that never sleeps that Hand that keeps them all that is never idle that is the safety and the strength alike of all the earth and of them that wake or sleep upon it And if he takes care of them all will he not take care of poor little me thought Fleda Oh how glad I am I know there is a God How glad I am I know he is such a God and that I can trust in him and he will make everything go right How I forget this sometimes But Jesus does not forget his children Oh I am a happy little girl Grandpa s saying what he did don t make it so perhaps I shall die the first but I hope not for what would become of him But this and everything will all be arranged right and I have nothing to do with it but to obey God and please him and he will take care of the rest He has forbidden us to be careful about it too With grateful tears of relief Fleda shut the window and began to undress herself her heart so lightened of its burden that her thoughts presently took leave to go out again upon pleasure excursions in various directions and one of the last things in Fleda s mind before sleep surprised her was what a nice thing it was for any one to bow and smile so as mister Carleton did Chapter III I know each lane and every alley green Dingle or bushy dell of this wild wood And every bosky bourn from side to side My daily walks and ancient neighbourhood Milton Fleda and her grandfather had but just risen from a tolerably early breakfast the next morning when the two young sportsmen entered the room Ha said mister Ringgan I declare you re stirring betimes Come five or six miles this morning a ready Well that s the stuff to make sportsmen of Off for the woodcock hey And I was to go with you and shew you the ground I declare I don t know how in the world I can do it this morning I m so very stiff ten times as bad as I was yesterday I had a window open in my room last night I expect that must have been the cause I don t see how I could have overlooked it but I never gave it a thought till this morning I found myself so lame I could hardly get out of bed I am very sorry upon my word I am very sorry we must lose your company sir said the young Englishman and for such a cause but as to the rest I dare say your directions will guide us sufficiently I don t know about that said the old gentleman It is pretty hard to steer by a chart that is only laid down in the imagination I set out once to go in New York from one side of the city over into the other and the first thing I knew I found myself travelling along half a mile out of town I had to get in a stage and ride back and take a fresh start Out at the West they say when you are in the woods you can tell which is north by the moss growing on that side of the trees but if you re lost you ll be pretty apt to find the moss grows on all sides of the trees I couldn t make out any waymarks at all in such a labyrinth of brick corners Well let us see if I tell you now it is so easy to mistake one hill for another Fleda child you put on your sun bonnet and take these gentlemen back to the twenty acre lot and from there you can tell em how to go so I guess they won t mistake it By no means said mister Carleton we cannot give her so much trouble it would be buying our pleasure at much too dear a rate Tut tut said the old gentleman she thinks nothing of trouble and the walk ll do her good She d like to be out all day I believe if she had any one to go along with but I m rather a stupid companion for such a spry little pair of feet Fleda look here when they get to the lot they can find their own way after that You know where the place is where your cousin Seth shot so many woodcock last year over in mister Hurlbut s land when you get to the big lot you must tell these gentlemen to go straight over the hill not Squire Thornton s hill but mine at the back of the lot they must go straight over it till they come to cleared land on the other side then they must keep along by the edge of the wood to the right till they come to the brook they must cross the brook and follow up the opposite bank and they ll know the ground when they come to it or they don t deserve to Do you understand now run and get your hat for they ought to be off Fleda went but neither her step nor her look shewed any great willingness to the business I am sure mister Ringgan said mister Carleton your little granddaughter has some reason for not wishing to take such a long walk this morning Pray allow us to go without her Pho pho said the old gentleman she wants to go I guess she s skeered o the guns said Cynthy happy to get a chance to edge in a word before such company it s that ails her Well well she must get used to it said mister Ringgan Here she is Fleda had it in her mind to whisper to him a word of hope about mister Jolly but she recollected that it was at best an uncertain hope and that if her grandfather s thoughts were off the subject it was better to leave them so She only kissed him for good by and went out with the two gentlemen As they took up their guns mister Carleton caught the timid shunning glance her eye gave at them Do you dislike the company of these noisy friends of ours Miss Fleda said he Fleda hesitated and finally said she didn t much like to be very near them when they were fired Put that fear away then said he for they shall keep a respectful silence so long as they have the honour to be in your company If the woodcock come about us as tame as quails our guns shall not be provoked to say anything till your departure gives them leave Fleda smiled her thanks and set forward privately much confirmed in her opinion that mister Carleton had handsome eyes At a little distance from the house Fleda left the meadow for an old apple orchard at the left lying on a steep side hill Up this hill side they toiled and then found themselves on a ridge of table land stretching back for some distance along the edge of a little valley or bottom of perfectly flat smooth pasture ground The valley was very narrow only divided into fields by fences running from side to side The table land might be a hundred feet or more above the level of the bottom with a steep face towards it A little way back from the edge the woods began between them and the brow of the hill the ground was smooth and green planted as if by art with flourishing young silver pines and once in a while a hemlock some standing in all their luxuriance alone and some in groups With now and then a smooth grey rock or large boulder stone which had somehow inexplicably stopped on the brow of the hill instead of rolling down into what at some former time no doubt was a bed of water all this open strip of the table land might have stood with very little coaxing for a piece of a gentleman s pleasure ground On the opposite side of the little valley was a low rocky height covered with wood now in the splendour of varied red and green and purple and brown and gold between at their feet lay the soft quiet green meadow and off to the left beyond the far end of the valley was the glory of the autumn woods again softened in the distance A true October sky seemed to pervade all mildly blue transparently pure with that clearness of atmosphere that no other month gives us a sky that would have conferred a patent of nobility on any landscape The scene was certainly contracted and nowise remarkable in any of its features but Nature had shaken out all her colours over the land and drawn a veil from the sky and breathed through the woods and over the hill side the very breath of health enjoyment and vigour When they were about over against the middle of the valley mister Carleton suddenly made a pause and stood for some minutes silently looking His two companions came to a halt on either side of him one not a little pleased the other a little impatient Beautiful mister Carleton said at length Yes said Fleda gravely I think it s a pretty place I like it up here We sha n t catch many woodcock among these pines said young Rossitur I wonder said mister Carleton presently how any one should have called these melancholy days Who has said Rossitur A countryman of yours said his friend glancing at him If he had been a countryman of mine there would have been less marvel But here is none of the sadness of decay none of the withering if the tokens of old age are seen at all it is in the majestic honours that crown a glorious life the graces of a matured and ripened character This has nothing in common Rossitur with those dull moralists who are always dinning decay and death into one s ears this speaks of Life Instead of freezing all one s hopes and energies it quickens the pulse with the desire to do The saddest of the year Bryant was wrong Bryant oh said young Rossitur I didn t know who you were speaking of I believe now I think of it he was writing of a somewhat later time of the year I don t know how all this will look in November I think it is very pleasant in November said little Fleda sedately Don t you know Bryant s Death of the Flowers Rossitur said his friend smiling What have you been doing all your life Not studying the fine arts at West Point mister Carleton Then sit down here and let me mend that place in your education Sit down and I ll give you something better than woodcock You keep a game bag for thoughts don t you mister Rossitur wished mister Carleton didn t But he sat down however and listened with an unedified face while his friend more to please himself it must be confessed than for any other reason and perhaps with half a notion to try Fleda repeated the beautiful words He presently saw they were not lost upon one of his hearers she listened intently It is very pretty said Rossitur when he had done I believe I have seen it before somewhere There is no smoky light to day said Fleda No said mister Carleton smiling to himself Nothing but that could improve the beauty of all this Miss Fleda I like it better as it is said Fleda I am surprised at that said young Rossitur I thought you lived on smoke There was nothing in the words but the tone was not exactly polite Fleda granted him neither smile nor look I am glad you like it up here she went on gravely doing the honours of the place I came this way because we shouldn t have so many fences to climb You are the best little guide possible and I have no doubt would always lead one the right way said mister Carleton Again the same gentle kind appreciating look Fleda unconsciously drew a step nearer There was a certain undefined confidence established between them There s a little brook down there in spring said she pointing to a small grass grown water course in the meadow hardly discernible from the height but there s no water in it now It runs quite full for a while after the snow breaks up but it dries away by June or July What are those trees so beautifully tinged with red and orange down there by the fence in the meadow I am not woodsman enough to inform you replied Rossitur Those are maples said Fleda sugar maples The one all orange is a hickory How do you know said mister Carleton turning to her By your wit as a fairy I know by the colour said Fleda modestly and by the shape too Fairy said mister Rossitur if you have any of the stuff about you I wish you would knock this gentleman over the head with your wand and put the spirit of moving into him He is going to sit dreaming here all day Not at all said his friend springing up I am ready for you but I want other game than woodcock just now I confess They walked along in silence and had near reached the extremity of the table land which towards the end of the valley descended into ground of a lower level covered with woods when mister Carleton who was a little ahead was startled by Fleda s voice exclaiming in a tone of distress Oh not the robins and turning about perceived mister Rossitur standing still with levelled gun and just in the act to shoot Fleda had stopped her ears In the same instant mister Carleton had thrown up the gun demanding of Rossitur with a singular change of expression what he meant Mean said the young gentleman meeting with an astonished face the indignant fire of his companion s eyes why I mean not to meddle with other people s guns mister Carleton What do you mean Nothing but to protect myself Protect yourself said Rossitur heating as the other cooled from what in the name of wonder Only from having my word blown away by your fire said Carleton smiling Come Rossitur recollect yourself remember our compact Compact one isn t bound to keep compacts with unearthly personages said Rossitur half sulkily and half angrily and besides I made none mister Carleton turned from him very coolly and walked on They left the table land and the wood entered the valley again and passed through a large orchard the last of the succession of fields which stretched along it Beyond this orchard the ground rose suddenly and on the steep hill side there had been a large plantation of Indian corn The corn was harvested but the ground was still covered with numberless little stacks of the corn stalks Half way up the hill stood three ancient chestnut trees veritable patriarchs of the nut tribe they were and respected and esteemed as patriarchs should be There are no dropping nuts to day either said Fleda to whom the sight of her forest friends in the distance probably suggested the thought for she had not spoken for some time I suppose there hasn t been frost enough yet Why you have a good memory Fairy said mister Carleton Do you give the nuts leave to fall of themselves Oh sometimes grandpa and I go a nutting said the little girl getting lightly over the fence but we haven t been this year Then it is a pleasure to come yet No said Fleda quietly the trees near the house have been stripped and the only other nice place there is for us to go to mister Didenhover let the Shakers have the nuts I sha n t get any this year Live in the woods and not get any nuts that won t do Fairy Here are some fine chestnuts we are coming to what would hinder our reaping a good harvest from them I don t think there will be any on them said Fleda mister Didenhover has been here lately with the men getting in the coin I guess they have cleared the trees Who is mister Didenhover He is grandpa s man Why didn t you bid mister Didenhover let the nuts alone O he wouldn t mind if he was told said Fleda He does everything just as he has a mind to and nobody can hinder him Yes they ve cleared the trees I thought so Don t you know of any other trees that are out of this mister Didenhover s way Yes said Fleda I know a place where there used to be beautiful hickory trees and some chestnuts too I think but it is too far off for grandpa and I couldn t go there alone This is the twenty acre lot said she looking though she did not say it Here I leave you I am glad to hear it said her cousin Now give us our directions Fleda and thank you for your services Stop a minute said mister Carleton What if you and I should try to find those same hickory trees Miss Fleda Will you take me with you or is it too long a walk For me oh no said Fleda with a face of awakening hope but she added timidly you were going a shooting sir What on earth are you thinking of Carleton said young Rossitur Let the nuts and Fleda alone do By your leave mister Rossitur said Carleton My murderous intents have all left me Miss Fleda I suppose your wand has been playing about me and I should like nothing better than to go with you over the hills this morning I have been a nutting many a time in my own woods at home and I want to try it for once in the New World Will you take me O thank you sir said Fleda but we have passed the turning a long way we must go back ever so far the same way we came to get to the place where we turn off to go up the mountain I don t wish for a prettier way if it isn t so far as to tire you Fairy Oh it won t tire me said Fleda overjoyed Carleton exclaimed young Kossitur Can you be so absurd Lose this splendid day for the woodcock when we may not have another while we are here You are not a true sportsman mister Rossitur said the other coolly or you would know what it is to have some sympathy with the sports of others But you will have the day for the woodcock and bring us home a great many I hope Miss Fleda suppose we give this impatient young gentleman his orders and despatch him I thought you were more of a sportsman said the vexed West Pointer or your sympathy would be with me I tell you the sporting mania was never stronger on me said the other carelessly Something less than a rifle however will do to bring down the game I am after We will rendezvous at the little village over yonder unless I go home before you which I think is more probable Au revoir With careless gracefulness he saluted his disconcerted companion who moved off with ungraceful displeasure Fleda and mister Carleton then began to follow back the road they had come in the highest good humour both Her sparkling face told him with even greater emphasis than her words I am so much obliged to you sir How you go over fences said he like a sprite as you are O I have climbed a great many said Fleda accepting however again with that infallible instinct the help which she did not need I shall be so glad to get some nuts for I thought I wasn t going to have any this year and it is so pleasant to have them to crack in the long winter evenings You must find them long evenings indeed I should think O no we don t said Fleda I didn t mean they were long in that way Grandpa cracks the nuts and I pick them out and he tells me stories and then you know he likes to go to bed early The evenings never seem long But you are not always cracking nuts O no to be sure not but there are plenty of other pleasant things to do I dare say grandpa would have bought some nuts but I had a great deal rather have those we get ourselves and then the fun of getting them besides is the best part Fleda was tramping over the ground at a furious rate How many do you count upon securing to day said mister Carleton gravely I don t know said Fleda with a business face there are a good many trees and fine large ones and I don t believe anybody has found them out they are so far out of the way there ought to be a good parcel of nuts But said mister Carleton with perfect gravity if we should be lucky enough to find a supply for your winter s store it would be too much for you and me to bring home Miss Fleda unless you have a broomstick in the service of fairydom A broomstick said Fleda Yes did you never hear of the man who had a broomstick that would fetch pails of water at his bidding No said Fleda laughing What a convenient broomstick I wish we had one But I know what I can do mister Carleton if there should be too many nuts for us to bring home I can take Cynthy afterwards and get the rest of them Cynthy and I could go grandpa couldn t even if he was as well as usual for the trees are in a hollow away over on the other side of the mountain It s a beautiful place Well said mister Carleton smiling curiously to himself in that case I shall be even of more use than I had hoped But sha n t we want a basket Miss Fleda Yes indeed said Fleda a good large one I am going to run down to the house for it as soon as we get to the turning off place if you ll be so good as to sit down and wait for me sir I won t be long after it No said he I will walk with you and leave my gun in safe quarters You had better not travel so fast or I am afraid you will never reach the hickory trees Fleda smiled and said there was no danger but she slackened her pace and they proceeded at a more reasonable rate till they reached the house mister Carleton would not go in placing his gun in an outer shelter Fleda dashed into the kitchen and after a few minutes delay came out again with a huge basket which mister Carleton took from her without suffering his inward amusement to reach his face and a little tin pail which she kept under her own guardianship In vain mister Carleton offered to take it with the basket or even to put it in the basket where he shewed her it would go very well it must go nowhere but in Fleda s own hand Fleda was in restless haste till they had passed over the already twice trodden ground and entered upon the mountain road It was hardly a road in some places a beaten track was visible in others mister Carleton wondered how his little companion found her way where nothing but fresh fallen leaves and scattered rocks and stones could be seen covering the whole surface But her foot never faltered her eye read way marks where his saw none she went on he did not doubt unerringly over the leaf strewn and rock strewn way over ridge and hollow with a steady light swiftness that he could not help admiring Once they came to a little brawling stream of spring water hardly three inches deep anywhere but making quite a wide bed for itself in its bright way to the lowlands mister Carleton was considering how he should contrive to get his little guide over it in safety when quick over the little round stones which lifted their heads above the surface of the water on the tips of her toes Fleda tripped across before he had done thinking about it He told her he had no doubt now that she was a fairy and had powers of walking that did not belong to other people Fleda laughed and on her little demure figure went picking out the way always with that little tin pail hanging at her side like mister Carleton busied himself in finding out similes for her It wasn t very easy For a long distance their way was through a thick woodland clear of underbrush and very pleasant walking but permitting no look at the distant country They wound about now uphill and now down till at last they began to ascend in good earnest the road became better marked and mister Carleton came up with his guide again Both were obliged to walk more slowly He had overcome a good deal of Fleda s reserve and she talked to him now quite freely without however losing the grace of a most exquisite modesty in everything she said or did What do you suppose I have been amusing myself with all this while Miss Fleda said he after walking for some time alongside of her in silence I have been trying to fancy what you looked like as you travelled on before me with that mysterious tin pail Well what did I look like said Fleda laughing Little Red Riding Hood the first thing carrying her grandmother the pot of butter Ah but I haven t got any butter in this as it happens said Fleda and I hope you are not anything like the wolf mister Carleton I hope not said he laughing Well then I thought you might be one of those young ladies the fairy stories tell of who set out over the world to seek their fortune That might hold you know a little provision to last for a day or two till you found it No said Fleda I should never go to seek my fortune Why not pray I don t think I should find it any the sooner mister Carleton looked at her and could not make up his mind whether or not she spoke wittingly Well but after all are we not seeking our fortune said he We are doing something very like it Now up here on the mountain top perhaps we shall find only empty trees perhaps trees with a harvest of nuts on them Yes but that wouldn t be like finding a fortune said Fleda if we were to come to a great heap of nuts all picked out ready for us to carry away that would be a fortune but now if we find the trees full we have got to knock them down and gather them up and shuck them Make our own fortunes eh said mister Carleton smiling Well people do say those are the sweetest nuts I don t know how it may be Ha that is fine What an atmosphere They had reached a height of the mountain that cleared them a view and over the tops of the trees they looked abroad to a very wide extent of country undulating with hill and vale hill and valley alike far below at their feet Fair and rich the gently swelling hills one beyond another in the patchwork dress of their many coloured fields the gay hues of the woodland softened and melted into a rich autumn glow and far away beyond even where this glow was sobered and lost in the distance the faint blue line of the Catskill faint but clear and distinct through the transparent air Such a sky of such etherealized purity as if made for spirits to travel in and tempting them to rise and free themselves from the soil and the stillness like nature s hand laid upon the soul bidding it think In view of all that vastness and grandeur man s littleness does bespeak itself And yet for every one the voice of the scene is not more humbling to pride than rousing to all that is really noble and strong in character Not only What thou art but What thou mayest be What place thou oughtest to fill what work thou hast to do in this magnificent world A very extended landscape however genial is also sober in its effect on the mind One seems to emerge from the narrowness of individual existence and take a larger view of Life as well as of Creation Perhaps mister Carleton felt it so for after his first expression of pleasure he stood silently and gravely looking for a long time Little Fleda s eye loved it too but she looked her fill and then sat down on a stone to await her companion s pleasure glancing now and then up at his face which gave her no encouragement to interrupt him It was gravely and even gloomily thoughtful He stood so long without stirring that poor Fleda began to have sad thoughts of the possibility of gathering all the nuts from the hickory trees and she heaved a very gentle sigh once or twice but the dark blue eye which she with reason admired remained fixed on the broad scene below as if it were reading or trying to read there a difficult lesson And when at last he turned and began to go up the path again he kept the same face and went moodily swinging his arm up and down as if in disturbed thought Fleda was too happy to be moving to care for her companion s silence she would have compounded for no more conversation so they might but reach the nut trees But before they had got quite so far mister Carleton broke the silence speaking in precisely the same tone and manner he had used the last time Look here Fairy said he pointing to a small heap of chestnut burs piled at the foot of a tree here s a little fortune for you already That s a squirrel said Fleda looking at the place very attentively There has been nobody else here He has put them together ready to be carried off to his nest We ll save him that trouble said mister Carleton Little rascal he s a Didenhover in miniature Oh no said Fleda he had as good a right to the nuts I am sure as we have poor fellow mister Carleton mister Carleton was throwing the nuts into the basket At the anxious and undecided tone in which his name was pronounced he stopped and looked up at a very wistful face Mightn t we leave these nuts till we come back If we find the trees over here full we sha n t want them and if we don t these would be only a handful And the squirrel would be disappointed said mister Carleton smiling You would rather we should leave them to him Fleda said yes with a relieved face and mister Carleton still smiling emptied his basket of the few nuts he had put in and they walked on In a hollow rather a deep hollow behind the crest of the hill as Fleda had said they came at last to a noble group of large hickory trees with one or two chestnuts standing in attendance on the outskirts And also as Fleda had said or hoped the place was so far from convenient access that nobody had visited them they were thick hung with fruit If the spirit of the game had been wanting or failing in mister Carleton it must have roused again into full life at the joyous heartiness of Fleda s exclamations At any rate no boy could have taken to the business better He cut with her permission a stout long pole in the woods and swinging himself lightly into one of the trees shewed that he was a master in the art of whipping them Fleda was delighted but not surprised for from the first moment of mister Carleton s proposing to go with her she bad been privately sure that he would not prove an inactive or inefficient ally By whatever slight tokens she might read this in whatsoever fine characters of the eye or speech or manner she knew it and knew it just as well before they reached the hickory trees as she did afterwards When one of the trees was well stripped the young gentleman mounted into another while Fleda set herself to hull and gather up the nuts under the one first beaten She could make but little headway however compared with her companion the nuts fell a great deal faster than she could put them in her basket The trees were heavy laden and mister Carleton seemed determined to have the whole crop from the second tree he went to the third Fleda was bewildered with her happiness this was doing business in style She tried to calculate what the whole quantity would be but it went beyond her one basketful would not take it nor two not three it wouldn t begin to Fleda said to herself She went on hulling and gathering with all possible industry After the third tree was finished mister Carleton threw down his pole and resting himself upon the ground at the foot told Fleda he would wait a few moments before he began again Fleda thereupon left off her work too and going for her little tin pail presently offered it to him temptingly stocked with pieces of apple pie When he had smilingly taken one she next brought him a sheet of white paper with slices of young cheese No thank you said he Cheese is very good with apple pie said Fleda competently Is it said he laughing Well upon that I think you would teach me a good many things Miss Fleda if I were to stay here long enough I wish you would stay and try sir said Fleda who did not know exactly what to make of the shade of seriousness which crossed his face It was gone almost instantly I think anything is better eaten out in the woods than it is at home said Fleda Well I don t know said her friend I have no doubt that is the case with cheese and apple pie and especially under hickory trees which one has been contending with pretty sharply If a touch of your wand Fairy could transform one of these shells into a goblet of Lafitte or Amontillado we should have nothing to wish for Amontillado was Hebrew to Fleda but goblet was intelligible I am sorry she said I don t know where there is any spring up here but we shall come to one going down the mountain Do you know where all the springs are No not all I suppose said Fleda but I know a good many I have gone about through the woods so much and I always look for the springs And who roams about through the woods with you Oh nobody but grandpa said Fleda He used to be out with me a great deal but he can t go much now this year or two Don t you go to school O no said Fleda smiling Then your grandfather teaches you at home No said Fleda father used to teach me grandpa doesn t teach me much What do you do with yourself all day long O plenty of things said Fleda smiling again I read and talk to grandpa and go riding and do a great many things Has your home always been here Fairy said mister Carleton after a few minutes pause Fleda said No sir and there stopped and then seeming to think that politeness called upon her to say more she added I have lived with grandpa ever since father left me here when he was going away among the Indians I used to be always with him before And how long ago is that It is four years sir more I believe He was sick when he came back and we never went away from Queechy again mister Carleton looked again silently at the child who had given him these pieces of information with a singular grave propriety of manner and even as it were reluctantly And what do you read Fairy he said after a minute stories of fairy land No said Fleda I haven t any We haven t a great many books there are only a few up in the cupboard and the Encyclopaedia father had some books but they are locked up in a chest But there is a great deal in the Encyclopaedia The Encyclopaedia said mister Carleton what do you read in that what can you find to like there I like all about the insects and birds and animals and about flowers and lives of people and curious things There are a great many in it And what are the other books in the cupboard which you read There s Quentin Durward said Fleda and Rob Roy and Guy Mannering in two little bits of volumes and the Knickerbocker and the Christian s Magazine and an odd volume of Redgauntlet and the Beauties of Scotland And have you read all these Miss Fleda said her companion commanding his countenance with difficulty I haven t read quite all of the Christian s Magazine nor all of the Beauties of Scotland All the rest O yes said Fleda and two or three times over And there are three great red volumes besides Robertson s history of something I believe I haven t read that either And which of them all do you like the best I don t know said Fleda I don t know but I like to read the Encyclopaedia as well as any of them And then I have the newspapers to read too I think Miss Fleda said mister Carleton a minute after you had better let me take you with my mother over the sea when we go back again to Paris Why sir You know said he half smiling your aunt wants you and has engaged my mother to bring you with her if she can I know it said Fleda But I am not going It was spoken not rudely but in a tone of quiet determination Aren t you too tired sir said she gently when she saw mister Carleton preparing to launch into the remaining hickory trees Not I said he I am not tired till I have done Fairy And besides cheese is workingman s fare you know isn t it No said Fleda gravely I don t think it is What then said mister Carleton stopping as he was about to spring into the tree and looking at her with a face of comical amusement It isn t what our men live on said Fleda demurely eying the fallen nuts with a head full of business They set both to work again with renewed energy and rested not till the treasures of the trees had been all brought to the ground and as large a portion of them as could be coaxed and shaken into Fleda s basket had been cleared from the hulls and bestowed there But there remained a vast quantity These with a good deal of labour mister Carleton and Fleda gathered into a large heap in rather a sheltered place by the side of a rock and took what measures they might to conceal them This was entirely at Fleda s instance You and your maid Cynthia will have to make a good many journeys Miss Fleda to get all these home unless you can muster a larger basket O that s nothing said Fleda It will be all fun I don t care how many times we have to come You are very good mister Carleton Do you think so said he I wish I did I wish you would make your wand rest on me Fairy My wand said Fleda Yes you know your grandfather says you are a fairy and carry a wand What does he say that for Miss Fleda Fleda said she supposed it was because he loved her so much but the rosy smile with which she said it would have let her hearer if he had needed enlightening far more into the secret than she was herself And if the simplicity in her face had not been equal to the wit mister Carleton would never have ventured the look of admiration he bestowed on her He knew it was safe Approbation she saw and it made her smile the rosier but the admiration was a step beyond her Fleda could make nothing of it They descended the mountain now with a hasty step for the day was wearing well on At the spot where he had stood so long when they went up mister Carleton paused again for a minute In mountain scenery every hour makes a change The sun was lower now the lights and shadows more strongly contrasted the sky of a yet calmer blue cool and clear towards the horizon The scene said still the same that it had said a few hours before with a touch more of sadness it seemed to whisper All things have an end thy time may not be for ever do what thou wouldest do while ye have light believe in the light that ye may be children of the light Whether mister Carleton read it so or not he stood for a minute motionless and went down the mountain looking so grave that Fleda did not venture to speak to him till they reached the neighbourhood of the spring What are you searching for Miss Fleda said her friend She was making a busy quest here and there by the side of the little stream I was looking to see if I could find a mullein leaf said Fleda A mullein leaf what do you want it for I want it to make a drinking cup of said Fleda her intent bright eyes peering keenly about in every direction A mullein leaf that is too rough one of these golden leaves what are they will do better won t it That is hickory said Fleda No the mullein leaf is the best because it holds the water so nicely Here it is And folding up one of the largest leaves into a most artist like cup she presented it to mister Carleton For me was all that trouble said he I don t deserve it You wanted something sir said Fleda The water is very cold and nice He stooped to the bright little stream and filled his rural goblet several times I never knew what it was to have a fairy for my cup bearer before said he That was better than anything Bordeaux or Xeres ever sent forth He seemed to have swallowed his seriousness or thrown it away with the mullein leaf It was quite gone This is the best spring in all grandpa s ground said Fleda The water is as good as can be How came you to be such a wood and water spirit you must live out of doors Do the trees ever talk to you I sometimes think they do to me I don t know I think I talk to them said Fleda It s the same thing said her companion smiling Such beautiful woods Were you never in the country before in the fall sir Not here in my own country often enough but the woods in England do not put on such a gay face Miss Fleda when they are going to be stripped of their summer dress they look sober upon it the leaves wither and grow brown and the woods have a dull russet colour Your trees are true Yankees they never say die Why are the Americans more obstinate than the English said Fleda It is difficult to compare unknown quantities said mister Carleton laughing and shaking his head I see you have good ears for the key note of patriotism Fleda looked a little hard at him but he did not explain and indeed they were hurrying along too much for talking leaping from stone to stone and running down the smooth orchard slope When they reached the last fence but a little way from the house Fleda made a resolute pause mister Carleton said she mister Carleton put down his basket and looked in some surprise at the hesitating anxious little face that looked up at him Won t you please not say anything to grandpa about my going away Why not Fairy said he kindly Because I don t think I ought to go But may it not be possible said he that your grandfather can judge better in the matter than you can do No said Fleda I don t think he can He would do anything he thought would be most for my happiness but it wouldn t be for my happiness she said with an unsteady lip I don t know what he would do if I went You think he would have no sunshine if your wand didn t touch him said mister Carleton smiling No sir said Fleda gravely I don t think that but won t you please mister Carleton not to speak about it But are you sure he said sitting down on a stone hard by and taking one of her hands are you sure that you would not like to go with us I wish you would change your mind about it My mother will love you very much and I will take the especial charge of you till we give you to your aunt in Paris if the wind blows a little too rough I will always put myself between it and you he added smiling Fleda smiled faintly but immediately begged mister Carleton not to say anything to put it into her grandfather s head It must be there already I think Miss Fleda but at any rate you know my mother must perform her promise to your aunt missus Rossitur and she would not do that without letting your grandfather know how glad she would be to take you Fleda stood silent a moment and then with a touching look of waiting patience in her sweet face suffered mister Carleton to help her over the fence and they went home To Fleda s unspeakable surprise it was found to be past four o clock and Cynthy had supper ready mister Ringgan with great cordiality invited mister Carleton to stay with them but he could not his mother would expect him to dinner Where is your mother At Montepoole sir we have been to Niagara and came this way on our return partly that my mother might fulfil the promise she made missus Rossitur to let you know sir with how much pleasure she will take charge of your little granddaughter and convey her to her friends in Paris if you can think it best to let her go Hum she is very kind said mister Ringgan with a look of grave and not unmoved consideration which Fleda did not in the least like How long will you stay at Montepoole sir It might be several days mister Carleton said Hum You have given up this day to Fleda mister Carleton suppose you take to morrow for the game and come here and try our country fare when you have got through shooting you and young mister Rossitur and I ll think over this question and let you know about it Fleda was delighted to see that her friend accepted this invitation with apparent pleasure You will be kind enough to give my respects to your mother mister Ringgan went on and thanks for her kind offer I may perhaps I don t know avail myself of it If anything should bring missus Carleton this way we should like to see her I am glad to see my friends he said shaking the young gentleman s hand as long as I have a house to ask em to That will be for many years I trust said mister Carleton respectfully struck with something in the old gentleman s manner I don t know sir said mister Ringgan with again the dignified look of trouble it may not be I wish you good day sir Chapter IV A mind that in a calm angelic mood Of happy wisdom meditating good Beholds of all from her high powers required Much done and much designed and more desired Wordsworth I ve had such a delicious day dear grandpa said little Fleda as they sat at supper you can t think how kind mister Carleton has been Has he Well dear I m glad on t he seems a very nice young man He s a smart lookin feller said Cynthy who was pouring out the tea And we have got the greatest quantity of nuts Fleda went on enough for all winter Cynthy and I will have to make ever so many journeys to fetch em all and they are splendid big ones Don t you say anything to mister Didenhover Cynthy I don t desire to meddle with mister Didenhover unless I ve got to said Cynthy with an expression of considerable disgust You needn t give no charges to me But you ll go with me Cynthy I s pose I ll have to said Miss Gall dryly after a short interval of sipping tea and helping herself to sweetmeats This lady had a pervading acidity of face and temper but it was no more To take her name as standing for a fair setting forth of her character would be highly injurious to a really respectable composition which the world s neglect there was no other imaginable cause had soured a little Almost Fleda s first thought on coming home had been about mister Jolly But she knew very well without asking that he had not been there she would not touch the subject I haven t had such a fine day of nutting in a great while grandpa she said again and you never saw such a good hand as mister Carleton is at whipping the trees How came he to go with you I don t know I suppose it was to please me in the first place but I am sure he enjoyed it himself and he liked the pie and cheese too Cynthy Where did your cousin go O he went off after the woodcock I hope he didn t find any What do you think of those two young men Fairy In what way grandpa I mean which of them do you like the best mister Carleton But t other one s your cousin said mister Ringgan bending forward and examining his little granddaughter s face with a curious pleased look as he often did when expecting an answer from her Yes said Fleda but he isn t so much of a gentleman How do you know that I don t think he is said Fleda quietly But why Fairy He doesn t know how to keep his word as well grandpa Ay ay let s hear about that said mister Ringgan A little reluctantly for Cynthia was present Fleda told the story of the robins and how mister Carleton would not let the gun be fired Wa n t your cousin a little put out by that They were both put out said Fleda mister Carleton was very angry for a minute and then mister Rossitur was angry but I think he could have been angrier if he had chosen mister Ringgan laughed and then seemed in a sort of amused triumph about something Well dear he remarked after a while you ll never buy wooden nutmegs I expect Fleda laughed and hoped not and asked him why he said so But he didn t tell her mister Ringgan said Cynthy hadn t I better run up the hill after supper and ask Mis Plumfield to come down and help to morrow I suppose you ll want considerable of a set out and if both them young men comes you ll want some more help to entertain em than I can give you it s likely Do so do so said the old gentleman Tell her who I expect and ask her if she can come and help you and me too O and I ll go with you Cynthy said Fleda I ll get aunt Miriam to come I know I should think you d be run off your legs already Flidda said Miss Cynthia what ails you to want to be going again But this remonstrance availed nothing Supper was hurried through and leaving the table standing Cynthia and Fleda set off to run up the hill They were hardly a few steps from the gate when they heard the clatter of horses hoofs behind them and the two young gentlemen came riding hurriedly past having joined company and taken their horses at Queechy Run Rossitur did not seem to see his little cousin and her companion but the doffed cap and low inclination of the other rider as they flew by called up a smile and blush of pleasure to Fleda s face and the sound of their horses hoofs had died away in the distance before the light had faded from her cheeks or she was quite at home to Cynthia s observations She was possessed with the feeling what a delightful thing it was to have people do things in such a manner That was your cousin wa n t it said Cynthy when the spell was off No said Fleda the other one was my cousin Well I mean one of them fellers that went by He s a soldier ain t he An officer said Fleda Well it does give a man an elegant look to be in the militie don t it I should admire to have a cousin like that It s dreadful becoming to have that what is it they call it to let the beard grow over the mouth I s pose they can t do that without they be in the army can they I don t know said Fleda I hope not I think it is very ugly Do you Oh I admire it It makes a man look so spry A few hundred yards from mister Ringgan s gate the road began to wind up a very long heavy hill Just at the hill s foot it crossed by a rude bridge the bed of a noisy brook that came roaring down from the higher grounds turning sundry mill and factory wheels in its way About half way up the hill one of these was placed belonging to a mill for sawing boards The little building stood alone no other in sight with a dark background of wood rising behind it on the other side of the brook the stream itself running smoothly for a small space above the mill and leaping down madly below as if it disdained its bed and would clear at a bound every impediment in its way to the sea When the mill was not going the quantity of water that found its way down the hill was indeed very small enough only to keep up a pleasant chattering with the stones but as soon as the stream was allowed to gather all its force and run free its loquacity was such that it would prevent a traveller from suspecting his approach to the mill until very near the monotonous hum of its saw could be heard This was a place Fleda dearly loved The wild sound of the waters and the lonely keeping of the scene with the delicious smell of the new sawn boards and the fascination of seeing the great logs of wood walk up to the relentless tireless up and down going steel as the generations of men in turn present themselves to the course of those sharp events which are the teeth of Time s saw until all of a sudden the master spirit the man regulator of this machinery would perform some conjuration on lever and wheel and at once as at the touch of an enchanter the log would be still and the saw stay its work the business of life came to a stand and the romance of the little brook sprang up again Fleda never tired of it never She would watch the saw play and stop and go on again she would have her ears dinned with the hoarse clang of the machinery and then listen to the laugh of the mill stream she would see with untiring patience one board after another cut and cast aside and log succeed to log and never turned weary away from that mysterious image of Time s doings Fleda had besides without knowing it the eye of a painter In the lonely hillside the odd shaped little mill with its accompaniments of wood and water and the great logs of timber lying about the ground in all directions and varieties of position there was a picturesque charm for her where the country people saw nothing but business and a place fit for it Their hands grew hard where her mind was refining Where they made dollars and cents she was growing rich in stores of thought and associations of beauty How many purposes the same thing serves Illustration Who s got it now Cynthy That had ought to be your grandpa s mill this minute observed Cynthy I wish it was sighed Fleda Who s got it now Cynthy O it s that chap McGowan I expect he s got pretty much the hull of everything I told mister Ringgan I wouldn t let him have it if it was me at the time Your grandpa d be glad to get it back now I guess Fleda guessed so too but also guessed that Miss Gall was probably very far from being possessed of the whole rationale of the matter So she made her no answer After reaching the brow of the hill the road continued on a very gentle ascent towards a little settlement half a quarter of a mile off passing now and then a few scattered cottages or an occasional mill or turner s shop Several mills and factories with a store and a very few dwelling houses were all the settlement not enough to entitle it to the name of a village Beyond these and the mill ponds of which in the course of the road there were three or four and with a brief intervening space of cultivated fields a single farm house stood alone just upon the borders of a large and very fair sheet of water from which all the others had their supply So large and fair that nobody cavilled at its taking the style of a lake and giving its own pretty name of Deepwater both to the settlement and the farm that half embraced it This farm was Seth Plumfield s At the garden gate Fleda quitted Cynthy and rushed forward to meet her aunt whom she saw coming round the corner of the house with her gown pinned up behind her from attending to some domestic concern among the pigs the cows or the poultry O aunt Miriam said Fleda eagerly we are going to have company to tea to morrow won t you come and help us Aunt Miriam laid her hands upon Fleda s shoulders and looked at Cynthy I came up to see if you wouldn t come down to morrow Mis Plumfield said that personage with her usual dry business tone always a little on the wrong side of sweet your brother has taken a notion to ask two young fellers from the Pool to supper and they re grand folks I s pose and have got to have a fuss made for em I don t know what mister Ringgan was thinkin of or whether he thinks I have got anything to do or not but anyhow they re a comin I s pose and must have something to eat and I thought the best thing I could do would be to come and get you into the works if I could I should feel a little queer to have nobody but me to say nothin to them at the table Ah do come aunt Miriam said Fleda it will be twice as pleasant if you do and besides we want to have everything very nice you know Aunt Miriam smiled at Fleda and inquired of Miss Gall what she had in the house Why I don t know Mis Plumfield said the lady while Fleda threw her arms round her aunt and thanked her there ain t nothin particler pork and beef and the old story I ve got some first rate pickles I calculated to make some sort o cake in the morning Any of those small hams left Not a bone of em these six weeks I don t see how they ve gone for my part I d lay any wager there were two in the smoke house when I took the last one out If mister Didenhover was a little more like a weasel I should think he d been in Have you cooked that roaster I sent down No Mis Plumfield I ha n t it s such a plaguy sight of trouble said Cynthy with a little apologetic giggle I was keepin it for some day when I hadn t much to do I ll take the trouble of it I ll be down bright and early in the morning and we ll see what s best to do How s your last churning Cynthy Well I guess it s pretty middlin Mis Plumfield Tisn t anything very remarkable aunt Miriam said Fleda shaking her head Well well said missus Plumfield smiling run away down home now and I ll come to morrow and I guess we ll fix it But who is it that grandpa has asked Fleda and Cynthy both opened at once One of them is my cousin aunt Miriam that was at West Point and the other is the nicest English gentleman you ever saw you will like him very much he has been with me getting nuts all to day They re a smart enough couple of chaps said Cynthia they look as if they lived where money was plenty Well I ll come to morrow repeated missus Plumfield and we ll see about it Good night dear She took Fleda s head in both her hands and gave her a most affectionate kiss and the two petitioners set off homewards again Aunt Miriam was not at all like her brother in feature though the moral characteristics suited the relationship sufficiently well There was the expression of strong sense and great benevolence the unbending uprightness of mind and body at once and the dignity of an essentially noble character not the same as mister Ringgan s but such as well became his sister She had been brought up among the Quakers and though now and for many years a staunch Presbyterian she still retained a tincture of the calm efficient gentleness of mind and manner that belongs so inexplicably to them More womanly sweetness than was in mister Ringgan s blue eye a woman need not wish to have and perhaps his sister s had not so much There was no want of it in her heart nor in her manner but the many and singular excellencies of her character were a little overshadowed by super excellent housekeeping Not a taint of the littleness that sometimes grows therefrom not a trace of the narrowness of mind that over attention to such pursuits is too apt to bring on every important occasion aunt Miriam would come out free and unshackled from all the cobweb entanglements of housewifery she would have tossed housewifery to the winds if need were but it never was for in a new sense she always contrived to make both ends meet It was only in the unbroken everyday course of affairs that aunt Miriam s face shewed any tokens of that incessant train of small cares which had never left their impertinent footprints upon the broad high brow of her brother mister Ringgan had no affinity with small cares deep serious matters received his deep and serious consideration but he had as dignified a disdain of trifling annoyances or concernments as any great mastiff or Newfoundlander ever had for the yelping of a little cur Chapter V Ynne London citye was I borne Of parents of grete note My fadre dydd a nobile arms Emblazon onne hys cote Chatterton In the snuggest and best private room of the House at Montepoole a party of ladies and gentlemen were gathered awaiting the return of the sportsmen The room had been made as comfortable as any place could be in a house built for the season after the season was past A splendid fire of hickory logs was burning brilliantly and making amends for many deficiencies the closed wooden shutters gave the reality if not the look of warmth for though the days might be fine and mild the mornings and evenings were always very cool up there among the mountains and a table stood at the last point of readiness for having dinner served They only waited for the lingering woodcock hunters It was rather an elderly party with the exception of one young man whose age might match that of the absent two He was walking up and down the room with somewhat the air of having nothing to do with himself Another gentleman much older stood warming his back at the fire feeling about his jaws and chin with one hand and looking at the dinner table in a sort of expectant reverie The rest three ladies sat quietly chatting All these persons were extremely different from one another in individual characteristics and all had the unmistakable mark of the habit of good society as difficult to locate and as easy to recognize as the sense of freshness which some ladies have the secret of diffusing around themselves no definable sweetness nothing in particular but making a very agreeable impression One of these ladies the mother of the perambulating young officer he was a class mate of Rossitur s was extremely plain in feature even more than ordinary This plainness was not however devoid of sense and it was relieved by an uncommon amount of good nature and kindness of heart In her son the sense deepened into acuteness and the kindness of heart retreated it is to be hoped into some hidden recess of his nature for it very rarely shewed itself in open expression That is to an eye keen in reading the natural signs of emotion for it cannot be said that his manner had any want of amenity or politeness The second lady the wife of the gentleman on the hearth rug or rather on the spot where the hearth rug should have been was a strong contrast to this mother and son remarkably pretty delicate and even lovely with a black eye however that though in general soft could shew a mischievous sparkle upon occasion still young and one of those women who always were and always will be pretty and delicate at any age The third had been very handsome and was still a very elegant woman but her face had seen more of the world s wear and tear It had never known placidity of expression beyond what the habitual command of good breeding imposed She looked exactly what she was a perfect woman of the world A very good specimen for missus Carleton had sense and cultivation and even feeling enough to play the part very gracefully yet her mind was bound in the shackles of the world s tyrannical forging and had never been free and her heart bowed submissively to the same authority Here they are Welcome home exclaimed this lady as her son and his friend at length made their appearance Welcome home we are all famishing and I don t know why in the world we waited for you for I am sure you don t deserve it What success What success mister Rossitur Faith ma am there s little enough to boast of as far as I am concerned mister Carleton may speak for himself I am very sorry ma am you waited for me said that gentleman I am a delinquent I acknowledge The day came to an end before I was at all aware of it It would not do to flatter you so far as to tell you why we waited said missus Evelyn s soft voice And then perceiving that the gentleman at whom she was looking gave her no answer she turned to the other How many woodcock mister Rossitur Nothing to shew ma am he replied Didn t see a solitary one I heard some partridges but I didn t mean to have room in my bag for them Did you find the right ground Rossitur I had a confounded long tramp after it if I didn t said the discomfited sportsman who did not seem to have yet recovered his good humour Were you not together said missus Carleton Where were you Guy Following the sport another way ma am I had very good success too What s the total said mister Evelyn How much game did you bag Really sir I didn t count I can only answer for a bag full Ladies and gentlemen cried Rossitur bursting forth What will you say when I tell you that mister Carleton deserted me and the sport in a most unceremonious manner and that he the cynical philosopher the reserved English gentleman the gay man of the world you are all of em by turns aren t you Carleton he has gone and made a very cavaliero servante of himself to a piece of rusticity and spent all to day in helping a little girl pick up chestnuts mister Carleton would be a better man if he were to spend a good many more days in the same manner said that gentleman dryly enough But the entrance of dinner put a stop to both laughter and questioning for a time all of the party being well disposed to their meat When the pickerel from the lakes and the poultry and half kept joints had had their share of attention and a pair of fine wild ducks were set on the table the tongues of the party found something to do besides eating We have had a very satisfactory day among the Shakers Guy said missus Carleton and we have arranged to drive to Kenton to morrow I suppose you will go with us With pleasure mother but that I am engaged to dinner about five or six miles in the opposite direction Engaged to dinner what with this old gentleman where you went last night And you too mister Rossitur I have made no promise ma am but I take it I must go Vexatious Is the little girl going with us Guy I don t know yet I half apprehend yes there seems to be a doubt in her grandfather s mind not whether he can let her go but whether he can keep her and that looks like it Is it your little cousin who proved the successful rival of the woodcock to day Carleton said missus Evelyn What is she I don t know ma am upon my word I presume Carleton will tell you she is something uncommon and quite remarkable Is she mister Carleton What ma am Uncommon Very Come That is something from you said Rossitur s brother officer Lieut Thorn What s the uncommonness said missus Thorn addressing herself rather to mister Rossitur as she saw mister Carleton s averted eye Is she handsome mister Rossitur I can t tell you I am sure ma am I saw nothing but a nice child enough in a calico frock just such as one would see in any farm house She rushed into the room when she was first called to see us from somewhere in distant regions with an immense iron ladle a foot and a half long in her hand with which she had been performing unknown feats of housewifery and they had left her head still encircled with a halo of kitchen smoke If as they say coming events cast their shadows before she was the shadow of supper Oh Carleton Carleton said missus Evelyn but in a tone of very gentle and laughing reproof for shame What a picture and of your cousin Is she a pretty child Guy said missus Carleton who did not relish her son s grave face No ma am something more than that How old About ten or eleven That s an ugly age She will never be at an ugly age What style of beauty The highest that degree of mould and finish which belongs only to the finest material That is hardly the kind of beauty one would expect to see in such a place said missus Carleton From one side of her family to be sure she has a right to it I have seen very few examples of it anywhere said her son Who were her parents said missus Evelyn Her mother was missus Rossitur s sister her father Amy Carleton exclaimed missus Evelyn O I knew her Was Amy Carleton her mother O I didn t know whom you were talking of She was one of my dearest friends Her daughter may well be handsome she was one of the most lovely persons I ever knew in body and mind both O I loved Amy Carleton very much I must see this child I don t know who her father was missus Carleton went on O her father was Major Ringgan said missus Evelyn I never saw him but I have heard him spoken of in very high terms I always heard that Amy married very well Major Ringgan said missus Thorn his name is very well known he was very distinguished He was a self made man entirely said missus Evelyn in a tone that conveyed a good deal more than the simple fact Yes he was a self made man said missus Thorn but I should never think of that where a man distinguishes himself so much he was very distinguished Yes and for more than officer like qualities said missus Evelyn I have heard his personal accomplishments as a gentleman highly praised So that little Miss Ringgan s right to be a beauty may be considered clearly made out said mister Thorn It is one of those singular cases said mister Carleton where purity of blood proves itself and one has no need to go back to past generations to make any inquiry concerning it Hear him cried Rossitur and for the life of me I could see nothing of all this wonder Her face is not at all striking The wonder is not so much in what it is as in what it indicates said mister Carleton What does it indicate said his mother Suppose you were to ask me to count the shades of colour in a rainbow answered he Hear him cried Thorn again Well I hope she will go with us and we shall have a chance of seeing her said missus Carleton If she were only a few years older it is my belief you would see enough of her ma am said young Rossitur The haughty coldness of mister Carleton s look at this speech could not be surpassed But she has beauty of feature too has she not missus Carleton asked again of her son Yes in very high degree The contour of the eye and brow I never saw finer It is a little odd said missus Evelyn with the slightest touch of a piqued air she had some daughters at home that is a kind of beauty one is apt to associate with high breeding and certainly you very rarely see it anywhere else and Major Ringgan however distinguished and estimable as I have no doubt he was And this child must have been brought up with no advantages here in the country My dear madam said mister Carleton smiling a little this high breeding is a very fine thing but it can neither be given nor bequeathed and we cannot entail it But it can be taught can t it If it could be taught it is to be hoped it would be oftener learned said the young man dryly But what do we mean then when we talk of the high breeding of certain classes and families and why are we not disappointed when we look to find it in connection with certain names and positions in society I do not know said mister Carleton You don t mean to say I suppose mister Carleton said Thorn bridling a little that it is a thing independent of circumstances and that there is no value in blood Very nearly answering the question as you understand it May I ask how you understand it As you do sir Is there no high breeding then in the world asked good natured missus Thorn who could be touched on this point of family There is very little of it What is commonly current under the name is merely counterfeit notes which pass from hand to hand of those who are bankrupt in the article And to what serve then said missus Evelyn colouring the long lists of good old names which even you mister Carleton I know do not disdain To endorse the counterfeit notes said mister Carleton smiling Guy you are absurd said his mother I will not sit at the table and listen to you if you talk such stuff What do you mean I beg your pardon mother you have misunderstood me said he seriously Mind I have been talking not of ordinary conformity to what the world requires but of that fine perfection of mental and moral constitution which in its own natural necessary acting leaves nothing to be desired in every occasion or circumstance of life It is the pure gold and it knows no tarnish it is the true coin and it gives what it proffers to give it is the living plant ever blossoming and not the cut and art arranged flowers It is a thing of the mind altogether and where nature has not curiously prepared the soil it is in vain to try to make it grow This is not very often met with No indeed said missus Carleton but you are so fastidiously nice in all your notions at this rate nothing will ever satisfy you I don t think it is so very uncommon said missus Thorn It seems to me one sees as much of it as can be expected mister Carleton mister Carleton pared his apple with an engrossed air O no missus Thorn said missus Evelyn I don t agree with you I don t think you often see such a combination as mister Carleton has been speaking of very rarely but mister Carleton don t you think it is generally found in that class of society where the habits of life are constantly the most polished and refined Possibly answered he diving into the core of his apple No but tell me I want to know what you think Cultivation and refinement have taught people to recognize and analyze and imitate it the counterfeits are most current in that society but as to the reality I don t know it is nature s work and she is a little freaky about it But Guy said his mother impatiently this is not selling but giving away one s birthright Where is the advantage of birth if breeding is not supposed to go along with it Where the parents have had intelligence and refinement do we not constantly see them inherited by the children and in an increasing degree from generation to generation Very extraordinary said missus Thorn I do not undervalue the blessings of inheritance mother believe me nor deny the general doctrine though intelligence does not always descend and manners die out and that invaluable legacy a name may be thrown away But this delicate thing we are speaking of is not intelligence nor refinement but comes rather from a happy combination of qualities together with a peculiarly fine nervous constitution the essence of it may consist with an omission even with an awkwardness and with a sad ignorance of conventionalities But even if that be so do you think it can ever reach its full development but in the circumstances that are favourable to it said missus Evelyn Probably not often the diamond in some instances wants the graver but it is the diamond Nature seems now and then to have taken a princess s child and dropped it in some odd corner of the kingdom while she has left the clown in the palace From all which I understand said mister Thorn that this little chestnut girl is a princess in disguise Really Carleton Rossitur began missus Evelyn leaned back in her chair and quietly eating a piece of apple eyed mister Carleton with a look half amused and half discontented and behind all that keenly attentive Take for example those two miniatures you were looking at last night missus Evelyn the young man went on Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette what would you have more unrefined more heavy more animal than the face of that descendant of a line of kings missus Evelyn bowed her head acquiescingly and seemed to enjoy her apple He had a pretty bad lot of an inheritance sure enough take it all together said Rossitur Well said Thorn is this little stray princess as well looking as t other miniature Better in some respects said mister Carleton coolly Better cried missus Carleton Not in the brilliancy of her beauty but in some of its characteristics better in its promise Make yourself intelligible for the sake of my nerves Guy said his mother Better looking than Marie Antoinette My unhappy cousin is said to be a fairy ma am said mister Rossitur and I presume all this may be referred to enchantment That face of Marie Antoinette s said mister Carleton smiling is an undisciplined one uneducated Uneducated exclaimed missus Carleton Don t mistake me mother I do not mean that it shows any want of reading or writing but it does indicate an untrained character a mind unprepared for the exigencies of life She met those exigencies indifferent well too observed mister Thorn Ay but pride and the dignity of rank and undoubtedly some of the finer qualities of a woman s nature might suffice for that and yet leave her utterly unfitted to play wisely and gracefully a part in ordinary life Well she had no such part to play said missus Carleton Certainly mother but I am comparing faces Well the other face It has the same style of refined beauty of feature but to compare them in a word Marie Antoinette looks to me like a superb exotic that has come to its brilliant perfection of bloom in a hot house it would lose its beauty in the strong free air it would change and droop if it lacked careful waiting upon and constant artificial excitement the other said mister Carleton musingly is a flower of the woods raising its head above frost and snow and the rugged soil where fortune has placed it with an air of quiet patient endurance a storm wind may bring it to the ground easily but if its gentle nature be not broken it will look up again unchanged and bide its time in unrequited beauty and sweetness to the end The exotic for me cried Rossitur if I only had a place for her I don t like pale elegancies I d make a piece of poetry of that if I was you Carleton said mister Thorn mister Carleton has done that already said missus Evelyn smoothly I never heard you talk so before Guy said his mother looking at him His eyes had grown dark with intensity of expression while he was speaking gazing at visionary flowers or beauties through the dinner table mahogany He looked up and laughed as she addressed him and rising turned off lightly with his usual sir I congratulate you missus Carleton missus Evelyn whispered as they went from the table that this little beauty is not a few years older Why said missus Carleton If she is all that Guy says I would give anything in the world to see him married Time enough said missus Evelyn with a knowing smile I don t know said missus Carleton I think he would be happier He is a restless spirit nothing satisfies him nothing fixes him He cannot rest at home he abhors politics he flits way from country to country and doesn t remain long anywhere And you with him And I with him I should like to see if a wife could not persuade him to stay at home I guess you have petted him too much said missus Evelyn slyly I cannot have petted him too much for he has never disappointed me No of course not but it seems you find it difficult to lead him No one ever succeeded in doing that said missus Carleton with a smile that was anything but an ungratified one He never wanted driving and to lead him is impossible You may try it and while you think you are going to gain your end if he thinks it worth while you will suddenly find that he is leading you It is so with everybody in some inexplicable way missus Evelyn thought the mystery was very easily explicable as far as the mother was concerned and changed the conversation Chapter VI To them life was a simple art Of duties to be done A game where each man took his part A race where all must run A battle whose great scheme and scope They little cared to know Content as men at arms to cope Each with his fronting foe Milnes On so great and uncommon an occasion as mister Ringgan s giving a dinner party the disused front parlour was opened and set in order the women folks as he called them wanting the whole back part of the house for their operations So when the visitors arrived in good time they were ushered into a large square bare looking room a strong contrast even to their dining room at the Poolwhich gave them nothing of the welcome of the pleasant farmhouse kitchen and where nothing of the comfort of the kitchen found its way but a very strong smell of roast pig There was the cheerless air of a place where nobody lives or thinks of living The very chairs looked as if they had made up their minds to be forsaken for a term of months it was impossible to imagine that a cheerful supper had ever been laid upon the stiff cold looking table that stood with its leaves down so primly against the wall All that a blazing fire could do to make amends for deficiencies it did but the wintry wind that swept round the house shook the paper window shades in a remorseless way and the utmost efforts of said fire could not prevent it from coming in and giving disagreeable impertinent whispers at the ears of everybody mister Ringgan s welcome however was and would have been the same thing anywhere genial frank and dignified neither he nor it could be changed by circumstances mister Carleton admired anew as he came forward the fine presence and noble look of his old host a look that it was plain had never needed to seek the ground a brow that in large or small things had never been crossed by a shadow of shame And to a discerning eye the face was not a surer index of a lofty than of a peaceful and pure mind too peace loving and pure perhaps for the best good of his affairs in the conflict with a selfish and unscrupulous world At least now in the time of his old age and infirmity in former days his straightforward wisdom backed by an indomitable courage and strength had made mister Ringgan no safe subject for either braving or overreaching Fleda s keen sighted affection was heartily gratified by the manner in which her grandfather was greeted by at least one of his guests and that the one about whose opinion she cared the most mister Carleton seemed as little sensible of the cold room as mister Ringgan himself Fleda felt sure that her grandfather was appreciated and she would have sat delightedly listening to what the one and the other were presently saying if she had not taken notice that her cousin looked astray He was eying the fire with a profound air and she fancied he thought it poor amusement Little as Fleda in secret really cared about that with an instant sacrifice of her own pleasure she quietly changed her position for one from which she could more readily bring to bear upon mister Rossitur s distraction the very light artillery of her conversation and attacked him on the subject of the game he had brought home Her motive and her manner both must have been lost upon the young gentleman He forthwith set about amusing himself in a way his little entertainer had not counted upon namely with giving a chase to her wits partly to pass away the time and partly to gratify his curiosity as he said to see what Fleda was made of By a curious system of involved startling or absurd questions he endeavoured to puzzle or confound or entrap her Fleda however steadily presented a grave front to the enemy and would every now and then surprise him with an unexpected turn or clever doubling and sometimes when he thought he had her in a corner jump over the fence and laugh at him from the other side mister Rossitur s respect for his little adversary gradually increased and finding that she had rather the best of the game he at last gave it up just as mister Ringgan was asking mister Carleton if he was a judge of stock mister Carleton saying with a smile No but he hoped mister Ringgan would give him his first lesson the old gentleman immediately arose with that alacrity of manner he always wore when he had a visitor that pleased him and taking his hat and cane led the way out choosing with a man s true carelessness of housewifery etiquette the kitchen route of all others Not even admonished by the sight of the bright Dutch oven before the fire that he was introducing his visitors somewhat too early to the pig he led the whole party through Cynthia scuttling away in haste across the kitchen with something that must not be seen while aunt Miriam looked out at the company through the crack of the pantry door at which Fleda ventured a sly glance of intelligence It was a fine though a windy and cold afternoon the lights and shadows were driving across the broad upland and meadows This is a fine arable country remarked mister Carleton Capital sir capital for many miles round if we were not so far from a market I was one of the first that broke ground in this township one of the very first settlers I ve seen the rough and the smooth of it and I never had but one mind about it from the first All this as far as you can see I cleared myself most of it with my own hand That recollection must attach you strongly to the place I should think sir Hum perhaps I cared too much for it he replied for it is taken away from me Well it don t matter now Is it not yours No sir it was mine a great many years but I was obliged to part with it two years ago to a scoundrel of a fellow McGowan up here he got an advantage over me I can t take care of myself any more as I used to do and I don t find that other people deal by me just as I could wish He was silent for a moment and then went on Yes sir when I first set myself down here or a little further that way my first house was a pretty rough house too there wa n t two settlers beside within something like ten miles round I ve seen the whole of it cleared from the cutting of the first forest trees till this day You have seen the nation itself spring up within that time remarked his guest Not exactly that question of our nationality was settled a little before I came here I was born rather too late to see the whole of that play I saw the best of it though boys were men in those days My father was in the thick of it from beginning to end In the army was he Ho yes sir he and every child he had that wasn t a girl there wasn t a man of the name that wa n t on the right side I was in the army myself when I was fifteen I was nothing but a fifer but I tell you sir there wasn t a general officer in the country that played his part with a prouder heart than I did mine And was that the general spirit of the ranks Not altogether replied the old gentleman passing his hand several times abstractedly over his white hair a favourite gesture with him not exactly that there was a good deal of mixture of different materials especially in this state and where the feeling wasn t pretty strong it was no wonder if it got tired out but the real stuff the true Yankee blood was pretty firm Ay and some of the rest There was a good deal to try men in those days Sir I have seen many a time when I had nothing to dine upon but my fife and it was more than that could do to keep me from feeling very empty But was this a common case did this happen often said mister Carleton Pretty often pretty often sometimes answered the old gentleman Things were very much out of order you see and in some parts of the country it was almost impossible to get the supplies the men needed Nothing would have kept them together nothing under heaven but the love and confidence they had in one name Their love of right and independence wouldn t have been strong enough and besides a good many of them got disheartened A hungry stomach is a pretty stout arguer against abstract questions I have seen my father crying like a child for the wants and sufferings he was obliged to see and couldn t relieve And then you used to relieve yourselves grandpa said Fleda How was that Fairy Fleda looked at her grandfather who gave a little preparatory laugh and passed his hand over his head again Why yes said he we used to think the tories King George s men you know were fair game and when we happened to be in the neighbourhood of some of them that we knew were giving all the help they could to the enemy we used to let them cook our dinners for us once in a while How did you manage that sir Why they used to have little bake ovens to cook their meats and so on standing some way out from the house did you never gee one of them raised on four little heaps of stone the bottom of the oven is one large flat stone and the arch built over it they look like a great bee hive Well we used to watch till we saw the good woman of the house get her oven cleverly heated and put in her batch of bread or her meat pie or her pumpkin and apple pies whichever it was there didn t any of em come much amiss and when we guessed they were pretty nigh done three or four of us would creep in and whip off the whole oven and all to a safe place I tell you said he with a knowing nod of his head at the laughing Fleda those were first rate pies And then did you put the oven back again afterwards grandpa I guess not often dear replied the old gentleman What do you think of such lawless proceedings Miss Fleda said mister Carleton laughing at or with her O I like it said Fleda You liked those pies all the better didn t you grandpa because you had got them from the tories That we did If we hadn t got them maybe King George s men would in some shape But we weren t always so lucky as to get hold of an oven full I remember one time several of us had been out on a foraging expedition there sir what do you think of that for a two and a half year old They had come up with the chief favourite of his barn yard a fine deep coloured Devon bull I don t know what one might see in Devonshire he remarked presently but I know this country can t shew the like of him A discussion followed of the various beauties and excellencies of the animal a discussion in which mister Carleton certainly took little part while mister Ringgan descanted enthusiastically upon hide and brisket and bone and Rossitur stood in an abstraction it might be scornful it might be mazed Little Fleda quietly listening and looking at the beautiful creature which from being such a treasure to her grandfather was in a sort one to her more than half understood them all but mister Ringgan was too well satisfied with the attention of one of his guests to miss that of the other That fellow don t look as if he had ever known short commons was Rossitur s single remark as they turned away You did not give us the result of your foraging expedition sir said mister Carleton in a different manner Do grandpa said Fleda softly Ha Oh it is not worth telling said the old gentleman look ing gratified Fleda has heard my stories till she knows them by heart she could tell it as well herself What was it about the pig We had been out several of us one afternoon to try to get up a supper or a dinner for we had had none and we had caught a pig It happened that I was the only one of the party that had a cloak and so the pig was given to me to carry home because I could hide it the best Well sir we were coming home and had set our mouths for a prime supper when just as we were within a few rods of our shanty who should come along but our captain My heart sank as it never has done at the thought of a supper before or since I believe I held my cloak together as well as I could and kept myself back a little so that if the pig shewed a cloven foot behind me the captain might not see it But I almost gave up all for lost when I saw the captain going into the hut with us There was a kind of a rude bedstead standing there and I set myself down upon the side of it and gently worked and eased my pig off under my cloak till I got him to roll down behind the bed I knew said mister Ringgan laughing I knew by the captain s eye as well as I knew anything that he smelt a rat but he kept our counsel as well as his own and when he was gone we took the pig out into the woods behind the shanty and roasted him finely and we sent and asked captain Sears to supper and he came and helped us eat the pig with a great deal of appetite and never asked no questions how we came by him I wonder your stout heartedness did not fail in the course of so long a time said mister Carleton Never sir said the old gentleman I never doubted for a moment what the end would be My father never doubted for a moment We trusted in God and in Washington Did you see actual service yourself No sir I never did I wish I had I should like to have had the honour of striking one blow at the rascals However they were hit pretty well I ought to be contented My father saw enough of fighting he was colonel of a regiment he was at the affair of Burgoyne That gave us a lift in good time What rejoicing there was everywhere when that news came I could have fifed all day upon an empty stomach and felt satisfied People reckoned everywhere that the matter was settled when that great piece of good fortune was given us And so it was wa n t it dear said the old gentleman with one of those fond pleased sympathetic looks to Fleda with which he often brought up what he was saying General Gates commanded there said mister Carleton Yes sir Gates was a poor stick I never thought much of him That fellow Arnold distinguished himself in the actions before Burgoyne s surrender He fought like a brave man It seems strange that so mean a scamp should have had so much blood in him Why are great fighters generally good men grandpa said Fleda Not exactly dear replied her grandfather but such little minded rascality is not just the vice one would expect to find in a gallant soldier Those were times that made men said mister Carleton musingly Yes answered the old gentleman gravely they were times that called for men and God raised them up But Washington was the soul of the country sir Well the time made him said mister Carleton I beg your pardon said the old gentleman with a very decided little turn of his head I think he made the time I don t know what it would have been sir or what it would have come to but for him After all it is rather that the things which try people shew what is in them I hope there are men enough in the country yet though they haven t as good a chance to shew what they are Either way said his guest smiling it is a happiness mister Ringgan to have lived at a time when there was something worth living for Well I don t know said the old gentleman those times would make the prettiest figure in a story or a romance I suppose but I ve tried both and on the whole said he with another of his looks at Fleda I think I like these times the best Fleda smiled her acquiescence His guest could not help thinking to himself that however pacific might be mister Ringgan s temper no man in those days that tried men could have brought to the issue more stern inflexibility and gallant fortitude of bearing His frame bore evidence of great personal strength and his eye with all its mildness had an unflinching dignity that could never have quailed before danger or duty And now while he was recalling with great animation and pleasure the scenes of his more active life and his blue eye was shining with the fire of other days his manner had the self possession and quiet sedateness of triumph that bespeak a man always more ready to do than to say Perhaps the contemplation of the noble Roman like old figure before him did not tend to lessen the feeling even the sigh of regret with which the young man said There was something then for a man to do There is always that said the old gentleman quietly God has given every man his work to do and tain t difficult for him to find out what No man is put here to be idle But said his companion with a look in which not a little haughty reserve was mingled with a desire to speak out his thoughts half the world are busy about hum drum concerns and the other half doing nothing or worse I don t know about that said mister Ringgan that depends upon the way you take things Tain t always the men that make the most noise that are the most good in the world Hum drum affairs needn t be hum drum in the doing of em It is my maxim said the old gentleman looking at his companion with a singularly open pleasant smile that a man may be great about a most anything chopping wood if he happens to be in that line I used to go upon that plan sir Whatever I have set my hand to do I have done it as well as I knew how to and if you follow that rule out you ll not be idle nor hum drum neither Many s the time that I have mowed what would be a day s work for another man before breakfast Rossitur s smile was not meant to be seen But mister Carleton s to the credit of his politeness and his understanding both was frank as the old gentleman s own as he answered with a good humoured shake of his head I can readily believe it sir and honour both your maxim and your practice But I am not exactly in that line Why don t you try the army said mister Ringgan with a look of interest There is not a cause worth fighting for said the young man his brow changing again It is only to add weight to the oppressor s hand or throw away life in the vain endeavour to avert it I will do neither But all the world is open before such a young man as you said mister Ringgan A large world said mister Carleton with his former mixture of expression but there isn t much in it Politics said mister Ringgan It is to lose oneself in a seething pot where the scum is the most apparent thing But there is society said Rossitur Nothing better or more noble than the succession of motes that flit through a sunbeam into oblivion Well why not then sit down quietly on one s estates and enjoy them one who has enough And be a worm in the heart of an apple Well then said Rossitur laughing though not knowing exactly how far he might venture there is nothing left for you as I don t suppose you would take to any of the learned professions but to strike out some new path for yourself hit upon some grand invention for benefiting the human race and distinguishing your own name at once But while he spoke his companion s face had gone back to its usual look of imperturbable coolness the dark eye was even haughtily unmoved till it met Fleda s inquiring and somewhat anxious glance He smiled The nearest approach I ever made to that said he was when I went chestnuting the other day Can t you find some more work for me Fairy Taking Fleda s hand with his wonted graceful lightness of manner he walked on with her leaving the other two to follow together You would like to know perhaps observed mister Rossitur in rather a low tone that mister Carleton is an Englishman Ay ay said mister Ringgan An Englishman is he Well sir what is it that I would like to know That said Rossitur I would have told you before if I could I supposed you might not choose to speak quite so freely perhaps on American affairs before him I haven t two ways of speaking sir on anything said the old gentleman a little dryly Is your friend very tender on that chapter O not that I know of at all said Rossitur but you know there is a great deal of feeling still among the English about it they have never forgiven us heartily for whipping them and I know Carleton is related to the nobility and all that you know so I thought Ah well said the old gentleman we don t know much about nobility and such gimcracks in this country I m not much of a courtier I am pretty much accustomed to speak my mind as I think it He s wealthy I suppose He s more than that sir Enormous estates He s the finest fellow in the world one of the first young men in England You have been there yourself and know said mister Ringgan glancing at his companion If I have not sir others have told me that do Ah well said mister Ringgan placidly we sha n t quarrel I guess What did he come out here for eh Only to amuse himself They are going back again in a few weeks and I intend accompanying them to join my mother in Paris Will my little cousin be of the party They were sauntering along towards the house A loud calling of her name the minute before had summoned Fleda thither at the top of her speed and mister Carleton turned to repeat the same question The old gentleman stopped and striking his stick two or three times against the ground looked sorrowfully undetermined Well I don t know he said at last it s a pretty hard matter she d break her heart about it I suppose I dare urge nothing sir said mister Carleton I will only assure you that if you entrust your treasure to us she shall be cherished as you would wish till we place her in the hands of her aunt I know that sir I do not doubt it said mister Ringgan but I ll tell you by and by what I conclude upon he said with evident relief of manner as Fleda came bounding back to them mister Rossitur have you made your peace with Fleda I was not aware that I had any to make sir replied the young gentleman I will do it with pleasure if my little cousin will tell me how But she looks as if she needed enlightening as much as myself She has something against you I can tell you said the old gentleman looking amused and speaking as if Fleda were a curious little piece of human mechanism which could hear its performances talked of with all the insensibility of any other toy She gives it as her judgment that mister Carleton is the most of a gentleman because he keeps his promise Oh grandpa Poor Fleda s cheek was hot with a distressful blush Rossitur coloured with anger mister Carleton s smile had a very different expression If Fleda will have the goodness to recollect said Rossitur I cannot be charged with breaking a promise for I made none But mister Carleton did said Fleda She is right mister Rossitur she is right said that gentleman a fallacy might as well elude Ithuriel s spear as the sense of a pure spirit there is no need of written codes Make your apologies man and confess yourself in the wrong Pho pho said the old gentleman she don t take it very much to heart I guess I ought to be the one to make the apologies he added looking at Fleda s face But Fleda commanded herself with difficulty and announced that dinner was ready mister Rossitur tells me mister Carleton you are an Englishman said his host I have some notion of that s passing through my head before but somehow I had entirely lost sight of it when I was speaking so freely to you a little while ago about our national quarrel I know some of your countrymen owe us a grudge yet Not I I assure you said the young Englishman I am ashamed of them for it I congratulate you on being Washington s countryman and a sharer in his grand struggle for the right against the wrong mister Ringgan shook his guest s hand looking very much pleased and having by this time arrived at the house the young gentlemen were formally introduced at once to the kitchen their dinner and aunt Miriam It is not too much to say that the entertainment gave perfect satisfaction to everybody better fate than attends most entertainments Even mister Rossitur s ruffled spirit felt the soothing influence of good cheer to which he happened to be peculiarly sensible and came back to its average condition of amenity Doubtless that was a most informal table spread according to no rules that for many generations at least have been known in the refined world an anomaly in the eyes of certainly one of the company Yet the board had a character of its own very far removed from vulgarity and suiting remarkably well with the condition and demeanour of those who presided over it a comfortable well to do substantial look that could afford to dispense with minor graces a self respect that was not afraid of criticism Aunt Miriam s successful efforts deserve to be celebrated In the middle of the table the polished amber of the pig s arched back elevated itself a striking object but worthy of the place he filled as the honours paid him by everybody abundantly testified Aunt Miriam had sent down a basket of her own bread made out of the new flour brown and white both as sweet and fine as it is possible for bread to be the piled up slices were really beautiful The superb butter had come from aunt Miriam s dairy too for on such an occasion she would not trust to the very doubtful excellence of Miss Cynthia s doings Every spare place on the table was filled with dishes of potatoes and pickles and sweetmeats that left nothing to be desired in their respective kinds the cake was a delicious presentment of the finest of material and the pies pumpkin pies such as only aunt Miriam could make rich compounds of everything but pumpkin with enough of that to give them a name Fleda smiled to think how pleased aunt Miriam must secretly be to see the homage paid her through them And most happily missus Plumfield had discovered that the last tea mister Ringgan had brought from the little Queechy store was not very good and there was no time to send up on the hill for more so she made coffee Verily it was not Mocha but the thick yellow cream with which the cups were filled readily made up the difference The most curious palate found no want Everybody was in a high state of satisfaction even to Miss Cynthia Grail who having some lurking suspicion that missus Plumfield might design to cut her out of her post of tea making had slipped herself into her usual chair behind the tea tray before anybody else was ready to sit down No one at table bestowed a thought upon Miss Cynthia but as she thought of nothing else she may be said to have had her fair share of attention The most unqualified satisfaction however was no doubt little Fleda s Forgetting with a child s happy readiness the fears and doubts which had lately troubled her she was full of the present enjoying with a most unselfish enjoyment everything that pleased anybody else She was glad that the supper was a fine one and so approved because it was her grandfather s hospitality and her aunt Miriam s housekeeping little beside was her care for pies or coffee She saw with secret glee the expression of both her aunt s and mister Ringgan s face partly from pure sympathy and partly because as she knew the cause of it was mister Carleton whom privately Fleda liked very much And after all perhaps he had directly more to do with her enjoyment than all other causes together Certainly that was true of him with respect to the rest of the dinner table None at that dinner table had ever seen the like With all the graceful charm of manner with which he would have delighted a courtly circle he came out from his reserve and was brilliant gay sensible entertaining and witty to a degree that assuredly has very rarely been thrown away upon an old farmer in the country and his un polite sister They appreciated him though as well as any courtly circle could have done and he knew it In aunt Miriam s strong sensible face when not full of some hospitable care he could see the reflection of every play of his own the grave practical eye twinkled and brightened giving a ready answer to every turn of sense or humour in what he was saying mister Ringgan as much of a child for the moment as Fleda herself had lost everything disagreeable and was in the full genial enjoyment of talk rather listening than talking with his cheeks in a perpetual dimple of gratification and a low laugh of hearty amusement now and then rewarding the conversational and kind efforts of his guest with a complete triumph Even the subtle charm which they could not quite recognise wrought fascination Miss Cynthia declared afterwards half admiring and half vexed that he spoiled her supper for she forgot to think how it tasted Rossitur his good humour was entirely restored but whether even mister Carleton s power could have achieved that without the perfect seasoning of the pig and the smooth persuasion of the richly creamed coffee it may perhaps be doubted He stared mentally for he had never known his friend condescend to bring himself out in the same manner before and he wondered what he could see in the present occasion to make it worth while But mister Carleton did not think his efforts thrown away He understood and admired his fine old host and hostess and with all their ignorance of conventionalities and absence of what is called polish of manner he could enjoy the sterling sense the good feeling the true hearty hospitality and the dignified courtesy which both of them shewed No matter of the outside this was in the grain If mind had lacked much opportunity it had also made good use of a little his host mister Carleton found had been a great reader was well acquainted with history and a very intelligent reasoner upon it and both he and his sister shewed a strong and quick aptitude for intellectual subjects of conversation No doubt aunt Miriam s courtesy had not been taught by a dancing master and her brown satin gown had seen many a fashion come and go since it was made but a lady was in both and while Rossitur covertly smiled mister Carleton paid his sincere respect where he felt it was due Little Fleda s quick eye hardly saw but more than half felt the difference mister Carleton had no more eager listener now than she and perhaps none whose unaffected interest and sympathy gave him more pleasure Illustration Fleda coloured and looked at her grandfather When they rose from the table mister Ringgan would not be insinuated into the cold front room again No no said he what s the matter the table Push the table back and let it take care of itself come gentlemen sit down draw up your chairs round the fire and a fig for ceremony Comfort sister Miriam against politeness any day in the year don t you say so too Fairy Come here by me Miss Fleda said mister Carleton will you take a ride with me to Montepoole to morrow I should like to make you acquainted with my mother Fleda coloured and looked at her grandfather What do you say deary he inquired fondly will you go I believe sir your proposal will prove a very acceptable one You will go won t you Fleda Fleda would very much rather not But she was always exceedingly afraid of hurting people s feelings she could not bear that mister Carleton should think she disliked to go with him so she answered yes in her usual sober manner Just then the door opened and a man unceremoniously walked in his entrance immediately following a little sullen knock that had made a mockery of asking permission An ill looking man in the worst sense his face being a mixture of cunning meanness and insolence He shut the door and came with a slow leisurely step into the middle of the room without speaking a word mister Carleton saw the blank change in Fleda s face She knew him Do you wish to see me mister McGowan said mister Ringgan not without something of the same change I guess I ha n t come here for nothing was the gruff retort Wouldn t another time answer as well I don t mean to find you here another time said the man chuckling I have given you notice to quit and now I have come to tell you you ll clear out I ain t a going to be kept out of my property for ever If I can t get my money from you Elzevir Ringgan I ll see you don t get no more of it in your hands Very well sir said the old gentleman You have said all that is necessary You have got to hear a little more though returned the other I ve an idea that there s a satisfaction in speaking one s mind I ll have that much out of you mister Ringgan a man hadn t ought to make an agreement to pay what he doesn t mean to pay and what he has made an agreement to pay he ought to meet and be up to if he sold his soul for it You call yourself a Christian do you to stay in another man s house month after month when you know you ha n t got the means to give him the rent for it That s what I call stealing and it s what I d live in the County House before I d demean myself to do I and so ought you Well well neighbour said mister Ringgan with patient dignity it s no use calling names You know as well as I do how all this came about I hoped to be able to pay you but I haven t been able to make it out without having more time Time said the other Time to cheat me out of a little more houseroom If I was agoing to live on charity mister Ringgan I d come out and say so and not put my hand in a man s pocket this way You ll quit the house by the day after to morrow or if you don t I ll let you hear a little more of me that you won t like He stalked out shutting the door after him with a bang mister Carleton had quitted the room a moment before him Nobody moved or spoke at first when the man was gone except Miss Cynthia who as she was taking something from the table to the pantry remarked probably for mister Rossitur s benefit that mister Ringgan had to have that man punished for something he did a few years ago when he was justice of the peace and she guessed likely that was the reason he had a grudge agin him ever since Beyond this piece of dubious information nothing was said Little Fleda stood beside her grandfather with a face of quiet distress the tears silently running over her flushed cheeks and her eyes fixed upon mister Ringgan with a tender touching look of sympathy most pure from self recollection mister Carleton presently came in to take leave of the disturbed family The old gentleman rose and returned his shake of the hand with even a degree more than usual of his manly dignity or mister Carleton thought so Good day to you sir he said heartily We have had a great deal of pleasure in your society and I shall always be very happy to see you wherever I am And then following him to the door and wringing his hand with a force he was not at all aware of the old gentleman added in a lower tone I shall let her go with you mister Carleton read his whole story in the stern self command of brow and the slight convulsion of feature which all the self command could not prevent He returned warmly the grasp of the hand answering merely I will see you again Fleda wound her arms round her grandfather s neck when they were gone and did her best to comfort him assuring him that they would be just as happy somewhere else And aunt Miriam earnestly proffered her own home But Fleda knew that her grandfather was not comforted He stroked her head with the same look of stern gravity and troubled emotion which had grieved her so much the other day She could not win him to a smile and went to bed at last feeling desolate She had no heart to look out at the night The wind was sweeping by in wintry gusts and Fleda cried herself to sleep thinking how it would whistle round the dear old house when their ears would not be there to hear it Chapter VII He from his old hereditary nook Must part the summons came our final leave we took Wordsworth mister Carleton came the next day but not early to take Fleda to Montepoole She had told her grandfather that she did not think he would come because after last night he must know that she would not want to go About twelve o clock however he was there with a little wagon and Fleda was fain to get her sun bonnet and let him put her in Happily it was her maxim never to trust to uncertainties so she was quite ready when he came and they had not to wait a minute Though Fleda had a little dread of being introduced to a party of strangers and was a good deal disappointed at being obliged to keep her promise she very soon began to be glad She found her fear gradually falling away before mister Carleton s quiet kind reassuring manner he took such nice care of her and she presently made up her mind that he would manage the matter so that it would not be awkward They had so much pleasant talk too Fleda had found before that she could talk to mister Carleton nay she could not help talking to him and she forgot to think about it And besides it was a pleasant day and they drove fast and Fleda s particular delight was driving and though the horse was a little gay she had a kind of intuitive perception that mister Carleton knew how to manage him So she gave up every care and was very happy When mister Carleton asked after her grandfather Fleda answered with great animation O he s very well and such a happy thing You heard what that man said last night mister Carleton didn t you Yes Well it is all arranged this morning mister Jolly he s a friend of grandpa s that lives over at Queechy Run and knew about all this he s a lawyer he came this morning and told grandpa that he had found some one that could lend him the money he wanted and there was no trouble about it and we are so happy for we thought we should have to go away from where we live now and I know grandpa would have felt it dreadfully If it hadn t been for that I mean for mister Jolly s coming I couldn t have gone to Montepoole to day Then I am very glad mister Jolly made his appearance said mister Carleton So am I said Fleda but I think it was a little strange that mister Jolly wouldn t tell us who it was that he had got the money from Grandpa said he never saw mister Jolly so curious When they got to the Pool Fleda s nervousness returned a little but she went through the dreaded introduction with great demureness and perfect propriety And throughout the day mister Carleton had no reason to fear rebuke for the judgment which he had pronounced upon his little paragon All the flattering attention which was shewn her and it was a good deal could not draw Fleda a line beyond the dignified simplicity which seemed natural to her any more than the witty attempts at raillery and endeavours to amuse themselves at her expense in which some of the gentlemen shewed their wisdom could move her from her modest self possession Very quiet very modest as she invariably was awkwardness could not fasten upon her her colour might come and her timid eye fall it often did but Fleda s wits were always in their place and within call She would shrink from a stranger s eye and yet when spoken to her answers were as ready and acute as they were marked for simplicity and gentleness She was kept to dinner and though the arrangement and manner of the service must have been strange to little Fleda it was impossible to guess from word or look that it was the first time within her recollection that she had ever seen the like Her native instincts took it all as quietly as any old liberalized traveller looks upon the customs of a new country mister Carleton smiled as he now and then saw a glance of intelligence or admiration pass between one and another of the company and a little knowing nod from missus Evelyn and many a look from his mother confessed he had been quite right Those two missus Evelyn and missus Carleton were by far the most kind and eager in their attention to Fleda missus Thorn did little else but look at her The gentlemen amused themselves with her But mister Carleton true to the hopes Fleda had founded upon his good nature had stood her friend all the day coming to her help if she needed any and placing himself easily and quietly between her and anything that threatened to try or annoy her too much Fleda felt it with grateful admiration Yet she noticed too that he was a very different person at this dinner table from what he had been the other day at her grandfather s Easy and graceful always he filled his own place but did not seem to care to do more there was even something bordering on haughtiness in his air of grave reserve He was not the life of the company here he contented himself with being all that the company could possibly require of him On the whole Fleda was exceedingly well pleased with her day and thought all the people in general very kind It was quite late before she set out to go home again and then missus Evelyn and missus Carleton were extremely afraid lest she should take cold and mister Carleton without saying one word about it wrapped her up so very nicely after she got into the wagon in a warm cloak of his mother s The drive home through the gathering shades of twilight was to little Fleda thoroughly charming It was almost in perfect silence but she liked that and all the way home her mind was full of a shadowy beautiful world that seemed to lie before and around her It was a happy child that mister Carleton lifted from the wagon when they reached Queechy He read it in the utter lightheartedness of brow and voice and the spring to the ground which hardly needed the help of his hands Thank you mister Carleton she said when she had reached her own door he would not go in I have had a very nice time He smiled Good night said he Tell your grandfather I will come to morrow to see him about some business Fleda ran gayly into the kitchen Only Cynthia was there Where is grandpa Cynthy He went off into his room a half an hour ago I believe he s laying down He ain t right well I s pect What s made you so late O they kept me said Fleda Her gayety suddenly sobered she took off her bonnet and coat and throwing them down in the kitchen stole softly along the passage to her grandfather s room She stopped a minute at the door and held her breath to see if she could hear any movement which might tell her he was not asleep It was all still and pulling the iron latch with her gentlest hand Fleda went on tiptoe into the room He was lying on the bed but awake for she had made no noise and the blue eyes opened and looked upon her as she came near Are you not well dear grandpa said the little girl Nothing made of flesh and blood ever spoke words of more spirit like sweetness not the beauty of a fine organ but such as the sweetness of angel speech might be a whisper of love and tenderness that was hushed by its own intensity He did not answer or did not notice her first question she repeated it Don t you feel well Not exactly dear he replied There was the shadow of somewhat in his tone that fell upon his little granddaughter s heart and brow at once Her voice next time though not suffered to be anything but clear and cheerful still had in part the clearness of apprehension What is the matter Oh I don t know dear She felt the shadow again and he seemed to say that time would shew her the meaning of it She put her little hand in one of his which lay outside the coverlets and stood looking at him and presently said but in a very different key from the same speech to mister Carleton I have had a very nice time dear grandpa Her grandfather made her no answer He brought the dear little hand to his lips and kissed it twice so earnestly that it was almost passionately then laid it on the side of the bed again with his own upon it and patted it slowly and fondly and with an inexpressible kind of sadness in the manner Fleda s lip trembled and her heart was fluttering but she stood so that he could not see her face in the dusk and kept still till the rebel features were calm again and she had schooled the heart to be silent mister Ringgan had closed his eyes and perhaps was asleep and his little granddaughter sat quietly down on a chair by the bedside to watch by him in that gentle sorrowful patience which women often know but which hardly belongs to childhood Her eye and thoughts as she sat there in the dusky twilight fell upon the hand of her grandfather which still fondly held one of her own and fancy travelled fast and far from what it was to what it had been Rough discoloured stiff as it lay there now she thought how it had once had the hue and the freshness and the grace of youth when it had been the instrument of uncommon strength and wielded an authority that none could stand against Her fancy wandered over the scenes it had known when it had felled trees in the wild forest and those fingers then supple and slight had played the fife to the struggling men of the Revolution how its activity had outdone the activity of all other hands in clearing and cultivating those very fields where her feet loved to run how in its pride of strength it had handled the scythe and the sickle and the flail with a grace and efficiency that no other could attain and how in happy manhood that strong hand had fondled and sheltered and led the little children that now had grown up and were gone Strength and activity ay and the fruits of them were passed away his children were dead his race was run the shock of corn was in full season ready to be gathered Poor little Fleda her thought had travelled but a very little way before the sense of these things entirely overcame her her head bowed on her knees and she wept tears that all the fine springs of her nature were moving to feed many many but poured forth as quietly as bitterly she smothered every sound That beautiful shadowy world with which she had been so busy a little while ago alas she had left the fair outlines and the dreamy light and had been tracking one solitary path through the wilderness and she saw how the traveller foot sore and weather beaten comes to the end of his way And after all he comes to the end Yes and I must travel through life and come to the end too thought little Fleda life is but a passing through the world my hand must wither and grow old too if I live long enough and whether or no I must come to the end Oh there is only one thing that ought to be very much minded in this world That thought sober though it was brought sweet consolation Fleda s tears if they fell as fast grew brighter as she remembered with singular tender joy that her mother and her father had been ready to see the end of their journey and were not afraid of it that her grandfather and her aunt Miriam were happy in the same quiet confidence and she believed she herself was a lamb of the Good Shepherd s flock And he will let none of his lambs be lost she thought How happy I am How happy we all are Her grandfather still lay quiet as if asleep and gently drawing her hand from under his Fleda went and got a candle and sat down by him again to read carefully shading the light so that it might not awake him He presently spoke to her and more cheerfully Are you reading dear Yes grandpa said the little girl looking up brightly Does the candle disturb you No dear What have you got there I just took up this volume of Newton that has the hymns in it Read out Fleda read mister Newton s long beautiful hymn The Lord will provide but with her late thoughts fresh in her mind it was hard to get through the last verses No strength of our own Or goodness we claim But since we have known The Saviour s great name In this our strong tower For safety we hide The Lord is our power The Lord will provide When life sinks apace And death is in view This word of his grace Shall comfort us through No fearing nor doubting With Christ on our side We hope to die shouting The Lord will provide The little reader s voice changed almost broke but she struggled through and then was quietly crying behind her hand Read it again said the old gentleman after a pause There is no cannot in the vocabulary of affection Fleda waited a minute or two to rally her forces and then went through it again more steadily than the first time Yes said mister Ringgan calmly folding his hands that will do That trust won t fail for it is founded upon a rock He is a rock and he knoweth them that put their trust in him I have been a fool to doubt ever that he would make all things work well The Lord will provide Grandpa said Fleda but in an unsteady voice and shading her face with her hand still I can remember reading this hymn to my mother once when I was so little that suggestions was a hard word to me Ay ay I dare say said the old gentleman your mother knew that Rock and rested her hope upon it where mine stands now If ever there was a creature that might have trusted to her own doings I believe she was one for I never saw her do anything wrong as I know But she knew Christ was all Will you follow him as she did dear Fleda tried in vain to give an answer Do you know what her last prayer for you was Fleda No grandpa It was that you might be kept unspotted from the world I heard her make that prayer myself And stretching out his hand the old gentleman laid it tenderly upon Fleda s bowed head saying with strong earnestness and affection even his voice somewhat shaken God grant that prayer whatever else he do with her keep my child from the evil and bring her to join her father and mother in heaven and me He said no more but Fleda s sobs said a great deal And when the sobs were hushed she still sat shedding quiet tears sorrowed and disturbed by her grandfather s manner She had never known it so grave so solemn but there was that shadow of something else in it besides and she would have feared if she had known what to fear He told her at last that she had better go to bed and to say to Cynthy that he wanted to see her She was going and had near reached the door when he said Elfleda She hastened back to the bedside Kiss me He let her do so twice without moving and then holding her to his breast he pressed one long earnest passionate kiss upon her lips and released her Fleda told Cynthy that her grandfather wished her to come to him and then mounted the stairs to her little bedroom She went to the window and opening it looked out at the soft moonlit sky the weather was mild again and a little hazy and the landscape was beautiful But little Fleda was tasting realities and she could not go off upon dream journeys to seek the light food of fancy through the air She did not think to night about the people the moon was shining on she only thought of one little sad anxious heart and of another down stairs more sad and anxious still she feared what could it be about Now that mister Jolly had settled all that troublesome business with McGowan As she stood there at the window gazing out aimlessly into the still night it was very quiet she heard Cynthy at the back of the house calling out but as if she were afraid of making too much noise Watkins Watkins The sound had business if not anxiety in it Fleda instinctively held her breath to listen Presently she heard Watkins reply but they were round the corner she could not easily make out what they said It was only by straining her ears that she caught the words Watkins mister Ringgan wants you to go right up on the hill to Mis Plumfield s and tell her he wants her to come right down he thinks the voice of the speaker fell and Fleda could only make out the last words doctor James More was said but so thick and low that she could understand nothing She had heard enough She shut the window trembling and fastened again the parts of her dress she had loosened and softly and hastily went down the stairs into the kitchen Cynthy what is the matter with grandpa Why ain t you in bed Flidda said Cynthy with some sharpness That s what you had ought to be I am sure your grandpa wants you to be abed But tell me said Fleda anxiously I don t know as there s anything the matter with him said Cynthy Nothing much I suppose What makes you think anything is the matter Because I heard you telling Watkins to go for aunt Miriam Fleda could not say and the doctor Well your grandpa thought he d like to have her come down and he don t feet right well so I sent Watkins up but you d better go to bed Flidda you ll catch cold if you sit up o night Fleda was unsatisfied the more because Cynthy would not meet the keen searching look with which the little girl tried to read her face She was not to be sent to bed and all Cynthy s endeavours to make her change her mind were of no avail Fleda saw in them but fresh reason for staying and saw besides what Cynthy could not hide a somewhat of wandering and uneasiness in her manner which strengthened her resolution She sat down in the chimney corner resolved to wait till her aunt Miriam came there would be satisfaction in her for aunt Miriam always told the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth It was a miserable three quarters of an hour The kitchen seemed to wear a strange desolate look though seen in its wonted bright light of fire and candles and in itself nice and cheerful as usual Fleda looked at it also through that vague fear which casts its own lurid colour upon everything The very flickering of the candle blaze seemed of ill omen and her grandfather s empty chair stood a signal of pain to little Fleda whenever she looked at it She sat still in submissive patience her cheek pale with the working of a heart too big for that little body Cynthia was going in and out of her grandfather s room but Fleda would not ask her any more questions to be disappointed with word answers she waited but the minutes seemed very long and very sad The characteristic outward calm which Fleda had kept and which belonged to a nature uncommonly moulded to patience and fortitude had yet perhaps heightened the pressure of excited fear within When at last she saw the cloak and hood of aunt Miriam coming through the moonlight to the kitchen door she rushed to open it and quite overcome for the moment threw her arms around her and was speechless Aunt Miriam s tender and quiet voice comforted her You up yet Fleda Hadn t you better go to bed Tisn t good for you That s what I ve been a telling her said Cynthy but she wa n t a mind to listen to me But the two little arms embraced aunt Miriam s cloak and wrappers and the little face was hid there still and Fleda s answer was a half smothered ejaculation I am so glad you are come dear aunt Miriam Aunt Miriam kissed her again and again repeated her request O no I can t go to bed said Fleda crying I can t till I know I am sure something is the matter or Cynthy wouldn t look so Do tell me aunt Miriam I can t tell you anything dear except that grandpa is not well that is all I know I am going in to see him I will tell you in the morning how he is No said Fleda I will wait here till you come out I couldn t sleep missus Plumfield made no more efforts to persuade her but rid herself of cloak and hood and went into mister Ringgan s room Fleda placed herself again in her chimney corner Burying her face in her hands she sat waiting more quietly and Cynthy having finished all her business took a chair on the hearth opposite to her Both were silent and motionless except when Cynthy once in a while got up to readjust the sticks of wood on the fire They sat there waiting so long that Fleda s anxiety began to quicken again Don t you think the doctor is a long time coming Cynthy said she raising her head at last Her question breaking that forced silence sounded fearful It seems kind o long said Cynthy I guess Watkins ha n t found him to hum Watkins indeed presently came in and reported as much and that the wind was changing and it was coming off cold and then his heavy boots were heard going up the stairs to his room overhead but Fleda listened in vain for the sound of the latch of her grandfather s door or aunt Miriam s quiet foot fall in the passage listened and longed till the minutes seemed like the links of a heavy chain which she was obliged to pass over from hand to hand and the last link could not be found The noise of Watkins feet ceased overhead and nothing stirred or moved but the crackling flames and Cynthia s elbows which took turns each in resting upon the opposite arm and now and then a tell tale gust of wind in the trees If mister Ringgan was asleep why did not aunt Miriam come out and see them if he was better why not come and tell them so He had been asleep when she first went into his room and she had come back for a minute then to try again to get Fleda to bed why could she not come out for a minute once more Two hours of watching and trouble had quite changed little Fleda the dark ring of anxiety had come under each eye in her little pale face she looked herself almost ill Aunt Miriam s grave step was heard coming out of the room at last it did not sound cheerfully in Fleda s ears She came in and stopping to give some direction to Cynthy walked up to Fleda Her face encouraged no questions She took the child s head tenderly in both her hands and told her gently but it was in vain that she tried to make her voice quite as usual that she had better go to bed that she would be sick Fleda looked up anxiously in her face How is he But her next word was the wailing cry of sorrow Oh grandpa The old lady took the little child in her arms and they both sat there by the fire until the morning dawned Chapter VIII Patience and sorrow strove Who should express her goodliest King Lear When mister Carleton knocked at the front door the next day about two o clock it was opened to him by Cynthy He asked for his late host mister Ringgan is dead Dead exclaimed the young man much shocked when how Won t you come in sir said Cynthy maybe you ll see Mis Plumfield No certainly replied the visitor Only tell me about mister Ringgan He died last night What was the matter with him I don t know said Cynthy in a business like tone of voice I s pose the doctor knows but he didn t say nothing about it He died very sudden Was he alone No his sister was with him he had been complaining all the evening that he didn t feel right but I didn t think nothing of it and I didn t know as he did and towards evening he went and laid down and Flidda was with him a spell talking to him and at last he sent her to bed and called me in and said he felt mighty strange and he didn t know what it was going to be and that he had as lieve I should send up and ask Mis Plumfield to come down and perhaps I might as well send for the doctor too And I sent right off but the doctor wa n t to hum and didn t get here till long after Mis Plumfield she come and mister Ringgan was asleep then and I didn t know as it was going to be anything more after all than just a turn such as anybody might take and Mis Plumfield went in and sot by him and there wa n t no one else in the room and after a while he come to and talked to her she said a spell but he seemed to think it was something more than common ailed him and all of a sudden he just riz up half way in bed and then fell back and died with no more warning than that And how is the little girl Why said Cynthy looking off at right angles from her visitor she s middling now I s pose but she won t be before long or else she must be harder to make sick than other folks We can t get her out of the room she added bringing her eyes to bear for an instant upon the young gentleman she stays in there the hull time since morning I ve tried and Mis Plumfield s tried and everybody has tried and there can t none of us manage it she will stay in there and it s an awful cold room when there ain t no fire Cynthy and her visitor were both taking the benefit of the chill blast which rushed in at the open door The room said mister Carleton The room where the body lies Yes it s dreadful chill in there when the stove ain t heated and she sits there the hull time And she ha n t got much to boast of now she looks as if a feather would blow her away The door at the further end of the hall opened about two inches and a voice called out through the crack Cynthy Mis Plumfield wants to know if that is mister Carleton Yes Well she d like to see him Ask him to walk into the front room she says Cynthy upon this shewed the way and mister Carleton walked into the same room where a very few days before he had been so kindly welcomed by his fine old host Cold indeed it was now as was the welcome he would have given There was no fire in the chimney and even all the signs of the fire of the other day had been carefully cleared away the clean empty fireplace looked a mournful assurance that its cheerfulness would not soon come back again It was a raw disagreeable day the paper window shades fluttered uncomfortably in the wind which had its way now and the very chairs and tables seemed as if they had taken leave of life and society for ever mister Carleton walked slowly up and down his thoughts running perhaps somewhat in the train where poor little Fleda s had been so busy last night and wrapped up in broadcloth as he was to the chin he shivered when he heard the chill wind moaning round the house and rustling the paper hangings and thought of little Fleda s delicate frame exposed as Cynthia had described it He made up his mind it must not be missus Plumfield presently came in and met him with the calm dignity of that sorrow which needs no parade and that truth and meekness of character which can make none Yet there was nothing like stoicism no affected or proud repression of feeling her manner was simply the dictate of good sense borne out by a firm and quiet spirit mister Carleton was struck with it it was a display of character different from any he had ever before met with it was something he could not quite understand For he wanted the key But all the high respect he had felt for this lady from the first was confirmed and strengthened After quietly receiving mister Carleton s silent grasp of the hand aunt Miriam said I troubled you to stop sir that I might ask you how much longer you expect to stop at Montepoole Not more than two or three days he said I understood said aunt Miriam after a minute s pause that missus Carleton was so kind as to say she would take care of Elfleda to France and put her in the hands of her aunt She would have great pleasure in doing it said mister Carleton I can promise for your little niece that she shall have a mother s care so long as my mother can render it Aunt Miriam was silent and he saw her eyes fill You should not have had the pain of seeing me to day said he gently if I could have known it would give you any but since I am here may I ask whether it is your determination that Fleda shall go with us It was my brother s said aunt Miriam sighing he told me last night that he wished her to go with missus Carleton if she would still be so good as to take her I have just heard about her from the housekeeper said mister Carleton what has disturbed me a good deal Will you forgive me if I venture to propose that she should come to us at once Of course we will not leave the place for several days till you are ready to part with her Aunt Miriam hesitated and again the tears flushed to her eyes I believe it would be best she said since it must be I cannot get the child away from her grandfather I am afraid I want firmness to do it and she ought not to be there she is a tender little creature For once self command failed her she was obliged to cover her face A stranger s hands cannot be more tender of her than ours will be said mister Carleton his warm pressure of aunt Miriam s hand repeating the promise My mother will bring a carriage for her this afternoon if you will permit If you please sir since it must be it does not matter a day sooner or later repeated aunt Miriam if she can be got away I don t know whether it will be possible mister Carleton had his own private opinion on that point He merely promised to be there again in a few hours and took his leave He came with his mother about five o clock in the afternoon They were shewn this time into the kitchen where they found two or three neighbours and friends with aunt Miriam and Cynthy The former received them with the same calm simplicity that mister Carleton had admired in the morning but said she was afraid their coming would be in vain she had talked with Fleda about the proposed plan and could not get her to listen to it She doubted whether it would be possible to persuade her And yet Aunt Miriam s self possession seemed to be shaken when she thought of Fleda she could not speak of her without watering eyes She s fixing to be sick as fast as ever she can remarked Cynthia dryly in a kind of aside meant for the audience there wa n t a grain of colour in her face when I went in to try to get her out a little while ago and Mis Plumfield ha n t the heart to do anything with her nor nobody else Mother will you see what you can do said mister Carleton missus Carleton went with an expression of face that her son nobody else knew meant that she thought it a particularly disagreeable piece of business She came back after the lapse of a few minutes in tears I can do nothing with her she said hurriedly I don t know what to say to her and she looks like death Go yourself Guy you can manage her if any one can mister Carleton went immediately The room into which a short passage admitted him was cheerless indeed On a fair afternoon the sun s rays came in there pleasantly but this was a true November day a grey sky and a chill raw wind that found its way in between the loose window sashes and frames One corner of the room was sadly tenanted by the bed which held the remains of its late master and owner At a little table between the windows with her back turned towards the bed Fleda was sitting her face bowed in her hands upon the old quarto bible that lay there open a shawl round her shoulders mister Carleton went up to the side of the table and softly spoke her name Fleda looked up at him for an instant and then buried her face in her hands on the book as before That look might have staggered him but that mister Carleton rarely was staggered in any purpose when he had once made up his mind It did move him so much that he was obliged to wait a minute or two before he could muster firmness to speak to her again Such a look so pitiful in its sorrow so appealing in its helplessness so imposing in its purity he had never seen and it absolutely awed him Many a child s face is lovely to look upon for its innocent purity but more commonly it is not like this it is the purity of snow unsullied but not unsullyable there is another kind more ethereal like that of light which you feel is from another sphere and will not know soil But there were other signs in the face that would have nerved mister Carleton s resolution if he had needed it Twenty four hours had wrought a sad change The child looked as if she had been ill for weeks Her cheeks were colourless the delicate brow would have seemed pencilled on marble but for the dark lines which weeping and watching and still more sorrow had drawn underneath and the beautiful moulding of the features shewed under the transparent skin like the work of the sculptor She was not crying then but the open pages of the great bible had been wet with very many tears since her head had rested there Illustration Fleda was sitting her face bowed in her hands Fleda said mister Carleton after a moment you must come with me The words were gently and tenderly spoken yet they had that tone which young and old instinctively know it is vain to dispute Fleda glanced up again a touching imploring look it was very difficult to bear and her Oh no I cannot went to his heart It was not resistance but entreaty and all the arguments she would have urged seemed to lie in the mere tone of her voice She had no power of urging them in any other way for even as she spoke her head went down again on the bible with a burst of sorrow mister Carleton was moved but not shaken in his purpose He was silent a moment drawing back the hair that fell over Fleda s forehead with a gentle caressing touch and then he said still lower and more tenderly than before but without flinching You must come with me Fleda Mayn t I stay said Fleda sobbing while he could see in the tension of the muscles a violent effort at self control which he did not like to see mayn t I stay till till the day after to morrow No dear Fleda said he still stroking her head kindly I will bring you back but you must go with me now Your aunt wishes it and we all think it is best I will bring you back She sobbed bitterly for a few minutes Then she begged in smothered words that he would leave her alone a little while He went immediately She checked her sobs when she heard the door close upon him or as soon as she could and rising went and knelt down by the side of the bed It was not to cry though what she did could not be done without many tears it was to repeat with equal earnestness and solemnity her mother s prayer that she might be kept pure from the world s contact There beside the remains of her last dear earthly friend as it were before going out of his sight forever little Fleda knelt down to set the seal of faith and hope to his wishes and to lay the constraining hand of Memory upon her conscience It was soon done and then there was but one thing more to do But oh the tears that fell as she stood there before she could go on how the little hands were pressed to the bowed face as if they would have borne up the load they could not reach the convulsive struggle before the last look could be taken the last good by said But the sobs were forced back the hands wiped off the tears the quivering features were bidden into some degree of calmness and she leaned forward over the loved face that in death had kept all its wonted look of mildness and placid dignity It was in vain to try to look through Fleda s blinded eyes the hot tears dropped fast while her trembling lips kissed and kissed those cold and silent that could make no return and then feeling that it was the last that the parting was over she stood again by the side of the bed as she had done a few minutes before in a convulsion of grief her face bowed down and her little frame racked with feeling too strong for it shaken visibly as if too frail to bear the trial to which it was put mister Carleton had waited and waited as he thought long enough and now at last came in again guessing how it was with her He put his arm round the child and gently drew her away and sitting down took her on his knee and endeavoured rather with actions than with words to soothe and comfort her for he did not know what to say But his gentle delicate way the soft touch with which he again stroked back her hair or took her hand speaking kindness and sympathy the loving pressure of his lips once or twice to her brow the low tones in which he told her that she was making herself sick that she must not do so that she must let him take care of her were powerful to soothe or quiet a sensitive mind and Fleda felt them It was a very difficult task and if undertaken by any one else would have been more likely to disgust and distress her But his spirit had taken the measure of hers and he knew precisely how to temper every word and tone so as just to meet the nice sensibilities of her nature He had said hardly anything but she had understood all he meant to say and when he told her at last softly that it was getting late and she must let him take her away she made no more difficulty rose up and let him lead her out of the room without once turning her head to look back missus Carleton looked relieved that there was a prospect of getting away and rose up with a happy adjusting of her shawl round her shoulders Aunt Miriam came forward to say good by but it was very quietly said Fleda clasped her round the neck convulsively for an instant kissed her as if a kiss could speak a whole heartful and then turned submissively to mister Carleton and let him lead her to the carriage There was no fault to be found with missus Carleton s kindness when they were on the way She held the forlorn little child tenderly in her arm and told her how glad she was to have her with them how glad she should be if she were going to keep her always but her saying so only made Fleda cry and she soon thought it best to say nothing All the rest of the way Fleda was a picture of resignation transparently pale meek and pure and fragile seemingly as the delicatest wood flower that grows mister Carleton looked grieved and leaning forward he took one of her hands in his own and held it affectionately till they got to the end of their journey It marked Fleda s feeling towards him that she let it lie there without making a motion to draw it away She was so still for the last few miles that her friends thought she had fallen asleep but when the carriage stopped and the light of the lantern was flung inside they saw the grave hazel eyes broad open and gazing intently out of the window You will order tea for us in your dressing room mother said mister Carleton Us who is us Fleda and me unless you will please to make one of the party Certainly I will but perhaps Fleda might like it better down stairs Wouldn t you dear If you please ma am said Fleda Wherever you please But which would you rather Fleda said mister Carleton I would rather have it up stairs said Fleda gently but it s no matter We will have it up stairs said missus Carleton We will be a nice little party up there by ourselves You shall not come down till you like You are hardly able to walk up said mister Carleton tenderly Shall I carry you The tears rushed to Fleda s eyes but she said no and managed to mount the stairs though it was evidently an exertion missus Carleton s dressing room as her son had called it looked very pleasant when they got there It was well lighted and warmed and something answering to curtains had been summoned from its obscurity in store room or garret and hung up at the windows them air fussy English folks had made such a pint of it the landlord said Truth was that mister Carleton as well as his mother wanted this room as a retreat for the quiet and privacy which travelling in company as they did they could have nowhere else Everything the hotel could furnish in the shape of comfort had been drawn together to give this room as little the look of a public house as possible Easy chairs as missus Carleton remarked with a disgusted face one could not expect to find in a country inn there were instead as many as half a dozen of those miserable substitutes as she called rocking chairs and sundry fashions of couches and sofas in various degrees of elegance and convenience The best of these a great chintz covered thing full of pillows stood invitingly near the bright fire There mister Carleton placed little Fleda took off her bonnet and things and piled the cushions about her just in the way that would make her most easy and comfortable He said little and she nothing but her eyes watered again at the kind tenderness of his manner And then he left her in peace till the tea came The tea was made in that room for those three alone Fleda knew that mister and missus Carleton staid up there only for her sake and it troubled her but she could not help it Neither could she be very sorry so far as one of them was concerned mister Carleton was too good to be wished away All that evening his care of her never ceased At tea which the poor child would hardly have shared but for him and after tea when in the absence of bustle she had leisure to feel more fully her strange circumstances and position he hardly permitted her to feel either doing everything for her ease and pleasure and quietly managing at the same time to keep back his mother s more forward and less happily adapted tokens of kind feeling Though she knew he was constantly occupied with her Fleda could not feel oppressed his kindness was as pervading and as unobtrusive as the summer air itself she felt as if she was in somebody s hands that knew her wants before she did and quietly supplied or prevented them in a way she could not tell how It was very rarely that she even got a chance to utter the quiet and touching thank you which invariably answered every token of kindness or thoughtfulness that permitted an answer How greatly that harsh and sad day was softened to little Fleda a heart by the good feeling and fine breeding of one person She thought when she went to bed that night thought seriously and gratefully that since she must go over the ocean and take that long journey to her aunt how glad she was how thankful she ought to be that she had so very kind and pleasant people to go with Kind and pleasant she counted them both but what more she thought of mister Carleton it would be hard to say Her admiration of him was very high appreciating as she did to the full all that charm of manner which she could neither analyze nor describe Her last words to him that night spoken with a most wistful anxious glance into his face were You will take me back again mister Carleton He knew what she meant Certainly I will I promised you Fleda Whatever Guy promises you may be very sure he will do said his mother with a smile Fleda believed it But the next morning it was very plain that this promise he would not be called upon to perform Fleda would not be well enough to go to the funeral She was able indeed to get up but she lay all day upon the sofa in the dressing room mister Carleton had bargained for no company last night to day female curiosity could stand it no longer and missus Thorn and missus Evelyn came up to look and gossip openly and to admire and comment privately when they had a chance Fleda lay perfectly quiet and still seeming not much to notice or care for their presence they thought she was tolerably easy in body and mind perhaps tired and sleepy and like to do well enough after a few days How little they knew How little they could imagine the assembly of Thought which was holding in that child s mind how little they deemed of the deep sad serious look into life which that little spirit was taking How far they were from fancying while they were discussing all manner of trifles before her sometimes when they thought her sleeping that in the intervals between sadder and weighter things her nice instincts were taking the gauge of all their characters unconsciously but surely how they might have been ashamed if they had known that while they were busy with all affairs in the universe but those which most nearly concerned them the little child at their side whom they had almost forgotten was secretly looking up to her Father in heaven and asking to be kept pure from the world Not unto the wise and prudent how strange it may seem in one view of the subject in another how natural how beautiful how reasonable Fleda did not ask again to be taken to Queechy But as the afternoon drew on she turned her face away from the company and shielded it from view among the cushions and lay in that utterly motionless state of body which betrays a concentrated movement of the spirits in some hidden direction To her companions it betrayed nothing They only lowered their tones a little lest they should disturb her It had grown dark and she was sitting up again leaning against the pillows and in her usual quietude when mister Carleton came in They had not seen him since before dinner He came to her side and taking her hand made some gentle inquiry how she was She has had a fine rest said missus Evelyn She has been sleeping all the afternoon said missus Carleton she lay as quiet as a mouse without stirring you were sleeping weren t you dear Fleda s lips hardly formed the word no and her features were quivering sadly mister Carleton s were impenetrable Dear Fleda said he stooping down and speaking with equal gravity and kindliness of manner you were not able to go Fleda s shake of the head gave a meek acquiescence But her face was covered and the gay talkers around her were silenced and sobered by the heaving of her little frame with sobs that she could not keep back mister Carleton secured the permanence of their silence for that evening He dismissed them the room again and would have nobody there but himself and his mother Instead of being better the next day Fleda was not able to get up she was somewhat feverish and exceedingly weak She lay like a baby missus Carleton said and gave as little trouble Gentle and patient always she made no complaint and even uttered no wish and whatever they did made no objection Though many a tear that day and the following paid its faithful tribute to the memory of what she had lost no one knew it she was never seen to weep and the very grave composure of her face and her passive unconcern as to what was done or doing around her alone gave her friends reason to suspect that the mind was not as quiet as the body mister Carleton was the only one who saw deeper the only one that guessed why the little hand often covered the eyes so carefully and read the very very grave lines of the mouth that it could not hide As soon as she could bear it he had her brought out to the dressing room again and laid on the sofa and it was several days before she could be got any further But there he could be more with her and devote himself more to her pleasure and it was not long before he had made himself necessary to the poor child s comfort in a way beyond what he was aware of He was not the only one who shewed her kindness Unwearied care and most affectionate attention were lavished upon her by his mother and both her friends they all thought they could not do enough to mark their feeling and regard for her missus Carleton and missus Evelyn nursed her by night and by day missus Evelyn read to her missus Thorn would come often to look and smile at her and say a few words of heart felt pity and sympathy Yet Fleda could not feel quite at home with any one of them They did not see it Her manner was affectionate and grateful to the utmost of their wish her simple natural politeness her nice sense of propriety were at every call she seemed after a few days to be as cheerful and to enter as much into what was going on about her as they had any reason to expect she could and they were satisfied But while moving thus smoothly among her new companions in secret her spirit stood aloof there was not one of them that could touch her that could understand her that could meet the want of her nature missus Carleton was incapacitated for it by education missus Evelyn by character missus Thorn by natural constitution Of them all though by far the least winning and agreeable in personal qualifications Fleda would soonest have relied on missus Thorn could soonest have loved her Her homely sympathy and kindness made their way to the child s heart Fleda felt them and trusted them But there were too few points of contact Fleda thanked her and did not wish to see her again With missus Carleton Fleda had almost nothing at all in common And that notwithstanding all this lady s politeness intelligence cultivation and real kindness towards herself Fleda would readily have given her credit for them all and yet the nautilus may as soon compare notes with the navigator the canary might as well study Maelzel s Metronome as a child of nature and a woman of the world comprehend and suit each other The nature of the one must change or the two must remain the world wide apart Fleda felt it she did not know why missus Carleton was very kind and perfectly polite but Fleda had no pleasure in her kindness no trust in her politeness or if that be saying too much at least she felt that for some inexplicable reason both were unsatisfactory Even the tact which each possessed in an exquisite degree was not the same in each in one it was the self graduating power of a clever machine in the other the delicateness of the sensitive plant missus Carleton herself was not without some sense of this distinction she confessed secretly that there was something in Fleda out of the reach of her discernment and consequently beyond the walk of her skill and felt rather uneasily that more delicate hands were needed to guide so delicate a nature missus Evelyn came nearer the point She was very pleasant and she knew how to do things in a charming way and there were times frequently when Fleda thought she was everything lovely But yet now and then a mere word or look would contradict this fair promise a something of hardness which Fleda could not reconcile with the soft gentleness of other times and on the whole missus Evelyn was unsure ground to her she could not adventure her confidence there With mister Carleton alone Fleda felt at home He only she knew completely understood and appreciated her Yet she saw also that with others he was not the same as with her Whether grave or gay there was about him an air of cool indifference very often reserved and not seldom haughty and the eye which could melt and glow when turned upon her was sometimes as bright and cold as a winter sky Fleda felt sure however that she might trust him entirely so far as she herself was concerned of the rest she stood in doubt She was quite right in both cases Whatever else there might be in that blue eye there was truth in it when it met hers she gave that truth her full confidence and was willing to honour every draught made upon her charity for the other parts of his character He never seemed to lose sight of her He was always doing something for which Fleda loved him but so quietly and happily that she could neither help his taking the trouble nor thank him for it It might have been matter of surprise that a gay young man of fashion should concern himself like a brother about the wants of a little child the young gentlemen down stairs who were not of the society in the dressing room did make themselves very merry upon the subject and rallied mister Carleton with the common amount of wit and wisdom about his little sweetheart a raillery which met the most flinty indifference But none of those who saw Fleda ever thought strange of anything that was done for her and missus Carleton was rejoiced to have her son take up the task she was fain to lay down So he really more than any one else had the management of her and Fleda invariably greeted his entrance into the room with a faint smile which even the ladies who saw agreed was well worth working for Chapter IX If large possessions pompous titles honourable charges and profitable commissions could have made this proud man happy there would have been nothing wanting L Estrange Several days had passed Fleda a cheeks had gained no colour but she had grown a little stronger and it was thought the party might proceed on their way without any more tarrying trusting that change and the motion of travelling would do better things for Fleda than could be hoped from any further stay at Montepoole The matter was talked over in an evening consultation in the dressing room and it was decided that they would set off on the second day thereafter Fleda was lying quietly on her sofa with her eyes closed having had nothing to say during the discussion They thought she had perhaps not heard it mister Carleton s sharper eyes however saw that one or two tears were glimmering just under the eyelash He bent down over her and whispered I know what you are thinking of Fleda do I not I was thinking of aunt Miriam Fleda said in an answering whisper without opening her eyes I will take care of that Fleda looked up and smiled most expressively her thanks and in five minutes was asleep mister Carleton stood watching her querying how long those clear eyes would have nothing to hide how long that bright purity could resist the corrosion of the world s breath and half thinking that it would be better for the spirit to pass away with its lustre upon it than stay till self interest should sharpen the eye and the lines of diplomacy write themselves on that fair brow Better so better so What are you thinking of so gloomily Guy said his Mother That is a tender little creature to struggle with a rough world She won t have to struggle with it said missus Carleton She will do very well said missus Evelyn I don t think she d find it a rough world where you were mister Carleton said missus Thorn Thank you ma am he said smiling But unhappily my power reaches very little way Perhaps said missus Evelyn with a sly smile that might be arranged differently missus Rossitur I have no doubt would desire nothing better than a smooth world for her little niece and mister Carleton s power might be unlimited in its extent There was no answer and the absolute repose of all the lines of the young gentleman s face bordered too nearly on contempt to encourage the lady to pursue her jest any further The next day Fleda was well enough to bear moving mister Carleton had her carefully bundled up and then carried her down stairs and placed her in the little light wagon which had once before brought her to the Pool Luckily it was a mild day for no close carriage was to be had for love or money The stage coach in which Fleda had been fetched from her grandfather s was in use away somewhere mister Carleton drove her down to aunt Miriam s and leaving her there he went off again and whatever he did with himself it was a good two hours before he came back All too little yet they were for the tears and the sympathy which went to so many things both in the past and in the future Aunt Miriam had not said half she wished to say when the wagon was at the gate again and mister Carleton came to take his little charge away He found her sitting happily in aunt Miriam s lap Fleda was very grateful to him for leaving her such a nice long time and welcomed him with even a brighter smile than usual But her head rested wistfully on her aunt s bosom after that and when he asked her if she was almost ready to go she hid her face there and put her arms about her neck The old lady held her close for a few minutes in silence Elfleda said aunt Miriam gravely and tenderly do you know what was your mother s prayer for you Yes she whispered What was it That I might be kept Unspotted from the world repeated aunt Miriam in a tone of tender and deep feeling My sweet blossom how wilt thou keep so Will you remember always your mother s prayer I will try How will you try Fleda I will pray Aunt Miriam kissed her again and again fondly repeating The Lord hear thee The Lord bless thee The Lord keep thee as a lily among thorns my precious little babe though in the world not of it Do you think that is possible said mister Carleton significantly when a few moments after they had risen and were about to separate Aunt Miriam looked at him in surprise and asked What sir To live in the world and not be like the world She cast her eyes upon Fleda fondly smoothing down her soft hair with both hands for a minute or two before she answered By the help of one thing sir yes And what is that said he quickly The blessing of God with whom all things are possible His eyes fell and there was a kind of incredulous sadness in his half smile which aunt Miriam understood better than he did She sighed as she folded Fleda again to her breast and whisperingly bade her Remember But Fleda knew nothing of it and when she had finally parted from aunt Miriam and was seated in the little wagon on her way home to her fancy the best friend she had in the world was sitting beside her Neither was her judgment wrong so far as it went She saw true where she saw at all But there was a great deal she could not see mister Carleton was an unbeliever Not maliciously not wilfully not stupidly rather the fool of circumstance His skepticism might be traced to the joint workings of a very fine nature and a very bad education That is education in the broad sense of the term of course none of the means and appliances of mental culture had been wanting to him He was an uncommonly fine example of what nature alone can do for a man A character of nature s building is at best a very ragged affair without religion s finishing hand at the utmost a fine ruin no more And if that be the utmost of nature s handiwork what is at the other end of the scale alas the rubble stones of the ruin what of good and fair nature had reared there was not strong enough to stand alone But religion cannot work alike on every foundation and the varieties are as many as the individuals Sometimes she must build the whole from the very ground and there are cases where nature s work stands so strong and fair that religion s strength may be expended in perfecting and enriching and carrying it to an uncommon height of grace and beauty and dedicating the fair temple to a new use Of religion mister Carleton had nothing at all and a true Christian character had never crossed his path near enough for him to become acquainted with it His mother was a woman of the world his father had been a man of the world and what is more so deep dyed a politician that to all intents and purposes except as to bare natural affection he was nothing to his son and his son was nothing to him Both mother and father thought the son a piece of perfection and mothers and fathers have very often indeed thought so on less grounds mister Carleton saw whenever he took time to look at him that Guy had no lack either of quick wit or manly bearing that he had pride enough to keep him from low company and make him abhor low pursuits if anything more than pride and better than pride mingled with it the father s discernment could not reach so far He had a love for knowledge too that from a child made him eager in seeking it in ways both regular and desultory and tastes which his mother laughingly said would give him all the elegance of a woman joined to the strong manly character which no one ever doubted he possessed She looked mostly at the outside willing if that pleased her to take everything else upon trust and the grace of manner which a warm heart and fine sensibilities and a mind entirely frank and above board had given him from his earliest years had more than met all her wishes No one suspected the stubbornness and energy of will which was in fact the back bone of his character Nothing tried it His father s death early left little Guy to his mother s guardianship Contradicting him was the last thing she thought of and of course it was attempted by no one else If she would ever have allowed that he had a fault which she never would it was one that grew out of his greatest virtue an unmanageable truth of character and if she ever unwillingly recognised its companion virtue firmness of will it was when she endeavoured to combat certain troublesome demonstrations of the other In spite of all the grace and charm of manner in which he was allowed to be a model and which was as natural to him as it was universal if ever the interests of truth came in conflict with the dictates of society he flung minor considerations behind his back and came out with some startling piece of bluntness at which his mother was utterly confounded These occasions were very rare he never sought them Always where it was possible he chose either to speak or be silent in an unexceptionable manner But sometimes the barrier of conventionalities or his mother s unwise policy pressed too hard upon his integrity or his indignation and he would then free the barrier and present the shut out truth in its full size and proportions before his mother s shocked eyes It was in vain to try to coax or blind him a marble statue is not more unruffled by the soft air of summer and missus Carleton was fain to console herself with the reflection that Guy s very next act after one of these breaks would be one of such happy fascination that the former would be forgotten and that in this world of discordancies it was impossible on the whole for any one to come nearer perfection And if there was inconvenience there were also great comforts about this character of truthfulness So nearly up to the time of his leaving the University the young heir lived a life of as free and uncontrolled enjoyment as the deer on his grounds happily led by his own fine instincts to seek that enjoyment in pure and natural sources His tutor was proud of his success his dependants loved his frank and high bearing his mother rejoiced in his personal accomplishments and was secretly well pleased that his tastes led him another way from the more common and less safe indulgences of other young men He had not escaped the temptations of opportunity and example But gambling was not intellectual enough jockeying was too undignified and drinking too coarse a pleasure for him Even hunting and coursing charmed him but for a few times when he found he could out ride and out leap all his companions he hunted no more telling his mother when she attacked him on the subject that he thought the hare the worthier animal of the two upon a chase and that the fox deserved an easier death His friends twitted him with his want of spirit and want of manliness but such light shafts bounded back from the buff suit of cool indifference in which their object was cased and his companions very soon gave over the attempt either to persuade or annoy him with the conclusion that nothing could be done with Carleton The same wants that had displeased him in the sports soon led him to decline the company of those who indulged in them From the low minded from the uncultivated from the unrefined in mind and manner and such there are in the highest class of society as well as in the less favoured he shrank away in secret disgust or weariness There was no affinity To his books to his grounds which he took endless delight in overseeing to the fine arts in general for which he had a great love and for one or two of them a great talent he went with restless energy and no want of companionship and at one or the other always pushing eagerly forward after some point of excellence or some new attainment not yet reached and which sprang up after one another as fast as ever Alps on Alps he was happily and constantly busy Too solitary his mother thought caring less for society than she wished to see him but that she trusted would mend itself He would be through the University and come of age and go into the world as a matter of necessity But years brought a change not the change his mother looked for That restless active energy which had made the years of his youth so happy became in connection with one or two other qualities a troublesome companion when he had reached the age of manhood and obeying manhood s law had put away childish things On what should it spend itself It had lost none of its strength while his fastidious notions of excellence and a far reaching clear sightedness which belonged to his truth of nature greatly narrowed the sphere of its possible action He could not delude himself into the belief that the oversight of his plantations and the perfecting his park scenery could be a worthy end of existence or that painting and music were meant to be the stamina of life or even that books were their own final cause These things had refined and enriched him they might go on doing so to the end of his days but for what For what It is said that everybody has his niche failing to find which nobody fills his place or acts his part in society mister Carleton could not find his niche and he consequently grew dissatisfied everywhere His mother s hopes from the University and the World were sadly disappointed At the University he had not lost his time The pride of character which joined with less estimable pride of birth was a marked feature in his composition made him look with scorn upon the ephemeral pursuits of one set of young men while his strong intellectual tastes drew him in the other direction and the energetic activity which drove him to do everything well that he once took in hand carried him to high distinction Being there he would have disdained to be anywhere but at the top of the tree But out of the University and in possession of his estates what should he do with himself and them A question easy to settle by most young men very easy to settle by Guy if he had had the clue of Christian truth to guide him through the labyrinth But the clue was wanting and the world seemed to him a world of confusion A certain clearness of judgment is apt to be the blessed handmaid of uncommon truth of character the mind that knows not what it is to play tricks upon its neighbours is rewarded by a comparative freedom from self deception Guy could not sit down upon his estates and lead an insect life like that recommended by Rossitur His energies wanted room to expend themselves But the world offered no sphere that would satisfy him even had his circumstances and position laid all equally open It was a busy world but to him people seemed to be busy upon trifles or working in a circle or working mischief and his nice notions of what ought to be were shocked by what he saw was in every direction around him He was disgusted with what he called the drivelling of some unhappy specimens of the Church which had come in his way he disbelieved the truth of what such men professed If there had been truth in it he thought they would deserve to be drummed out of the profession He detested the crooked involvments and double dealing of the law He despised the butterfly life of a soldier and as to the other side of a soldier s life again he thought what is it for to humour the arrogance of the proud to pamper the appetite of the full to tighten the grip of the iron hand of power and though it be sometimes for better ends yet the soldier cannot choose what letters of the alphabet of obedience he will learn Politics was the very shaking of the government sieve where if there were any solid result it was accompanied with a very great flying about of chaff indeed Society was nothing but whip syllabub a mere conglomeration of bubbles as hollow and as unsatisfying And in lower departments of human life as far as he knew he saw evils yet more deplorable The Church played at shuttlecock with men s credulousness the law with their purses the medical profession with their lives the military with their liberties and hopes He acknowledged that in all these lines of action there was much talent much good intention much admirable diligence and acuteness brought out but to what great general end He saw in short that the machinery of the human mind both at large and in particular was out of order He did not know what was the broken wheel the want of which set all the rest to running wrong This was a strange train of thought for a very young man but Guy had lived much alone and in solitude one is like a person who has climbed a high mountain the air is purer about him his vision is freer the eye goes straight and clear to the distant view which below on the plain a thousand things would come between to intercept But there was some morbidness about it too Disappointment in two or three instances where he had given his full confidence and been obliged to take it back had quickened him to generalize unfavourably upon human character both in the mass and in individuals And a restless dissatisfaction with himself and the world did not tend to a healthy view of things Yet truth was at the bottom truth rarely arrived at without the help of revelation He discerned a want he did not know how to supply His fine perceptions felt the jar of the machinery which other men are too busy or too deaf to hear It seemed to him hopelessly disordered This habit of thinking wrought a change very unlike what his mother had looked for He mingled more in society but missus Carleton saw that the eye with which he looked upon it was yet colder than it wont to be A cloud came over the light gay spirited manner he had used to wear The charm of his address was as great as ever where he pleased to shew it but much more generally now he contented himself with a cool reserve as impossible to disturb as to find fault with His temper suffered the same eclipse It was naturally excellent His passions were not hastily moved He had never been easy to offend his careless good humour and an unbounded proud self respect made him look rather with contempt than anger upon the things that fire most men though when once moved to displeasure it was stern and abiding in proportion to the depth of his character The same good humour and cool self respect forbade him even then to be eager in shewing resentment the offender fell off from his esteem and apparently from the sphere of his notice as easily as a drop of water from a duck s wing and could with as much ease regain his lost lodgment but unless there were wrong to be righted or truth to be vindicated he was in general safe from any further tokens of displeasure In those cases mister Carleton was an adversary to be dreaded As cool as unwavering as persevering there as in other things he there as in other things no more failed of his end And at bottom these characteristics remained the same it was rather his humour than his temper that suffered a change That grew more gloomy and less gentle He was more easily irritated and would shew it more freely than in the old happy times had ever been missus Carleton would have been glad to have those times back again It could not be Guy could not be content any longer in the Happy Valley of Amhara Life had something for him to do beyond his park palings He had carried manly exercises and personal accomplishments to an uncommon point of perfection he knew his library well and his grounds thoroughly and had made excellent improvement of both it was in vain to try to persuade him that seed time and harvest were the same thing and that he had nothing to do but to rest in what he had done shew his bright colours and flutter like a moth in the sunshine or sit down like a degenerate bee in the summer time and eat his own honey The power of action which he knew in himself could not rest without something to act upon It longed to be doing But what Conscience is often morbidly far sighted mister Carleton had a very large tenantry around him and depending upon him in bettering whose condition if he had but known it all those energies might have found full play It never entered into his head He abhorred business the detail of business and his fastidious taste especially shrank from having anything to do among those whose business was literally their life The eye sensitively fond of elegance the extreme of elegance in everything and permitting no other around or about him could not bear the tokens of mental and bodily wretchedness among the ignorant poor he escaped from them as soon as possible thought that poverty was one of the irregularities of this wrong working machine of a world and something utterly beyond his power to do away or alleviate and left to his steward all the responsibility that of right rested on his own shoulders And at last unable to content himself in the old routine of things he quitted home and England even before he was of age and roved from place to place trying and trying in vain to soothe the vague restlessness that called for a very different remedy On change de ciel l on ne change point du sol Chapter X Faire Christabelle that ladye bright Was had forth of the towre But ever she droopeth in her minde As nipt by an ungentle winde Doth some faire lillye flowre Syr Cauline That evening the last of their stay at Montepoole Fleda was thought well enough to take her tea in company So mister Carleton carried her down though she could have walked and placed her on the sofa in the parlour Whatever disposition the young officers might have felt to renew their pleasantry on the occasion it was shamed into silence There was a pure dignity about that little pale face which protected itself They were quite struck and Fleda had no reason to complain of want of attention from any of the party mister Evelyn kissed her mister Thorn brought a little table to the side of the sofa for her cup of tea to stand on and handed her the toast most dutifully and her cousin Rossitur went back and forth between her and the tea urn All of the ladies seemed to take immense satisfaction in looking at her they did it so much standing about the hearth rug with their cups in their hands sipping their tea Fleda was quite touched with everybody s kindness but somebody at the back of the sofa whom she did not see was the greatest comfort of all You must let me carry you up stairs when you go Fleda said her cousin I shall grow quite jealous of your friend mister Carleton No said Fleda smiling a little I shall not let any one but him carry me up if he will We shall all grow jealous of mister Carleton said Thorn He means to monopolize you keeping you shut up there up stairs He didn t keep me shut up said Fleda mister Carleton was welcome to monopolize her if it depended on her vote Not fair play Carleton continued the young officer wisely shaking his head all start alike or there s no fun in the race You ve fairly distanced us left us nowhere He might have talked Chinese and been as intelligible to Fleda and as interesting to Guy for all that appeared How are we going to proceed to morrow mister Evelyn said missus Carleton Has the missing stage coach returned yet or Will it be forthcoming in the morning Promised missus Carleton The landlord s faith stands pledged for it Then it won t disappoint us of course What a dismal way of travelling This young country hasn t grown up to post coaches yet said missus Evelyn How many will it hold inquired missus Carleton Hum Nine inside I suppose And we number ten with the servants Just take us said mister Evelyn There s room on the box for one It will not take me said mister Carleton How will you go ride said his mother I should think you would since you have found a horse you like so well By George I wish there was another that I liked said Rossitur and I d go on horseback too Such weather The landlord says it s the beginning of Indian summer It s too early for that said Thorn Well eight inside will do very well for one day said missus Carleton That will give little Fleda a little more space to lie at her ease You may put Fleda out of your calculations too mother said mister Carleton I will take care of her How in the world exclaimed his mother if you are on horseback And Fleda twisted herself round so as to give a look of bright inquiry at his face She got no answer beyond a smile which however completely satisfied her As to the rest he told his mother that he had arranged it and they should see in the morning missus Carleton was far from being at ease on the subject of his arrangements but she let the matter drop Fleda was secretly very much pleased She thought she would a great deal rather go with mister Carleton in the little wagon than in the stage coach with the rest of the people Privately she did not at all admire mister Thorn or her cousin Rossitur They amused her though and feeling very much better and stronger in body and at least quiet in mind she sat in tolerable comfort on her sofa looking and listening to the people who were gayly talking around her In the gaps of talk she sometimes thought she heard a distressed sound in the hall The buzz of tongues covered it up then again she heard it and she was sure at last that it was the voice of a dog Never came an appeal in vain from any four footed creature to Fleda s heart All the rest being busy with their own affairs she quietly got up and opened the door and looked out and finding that she was right went softly into the hall In one corner lay her cousin Rossitur s beautiful black pointer which she well remembered and had greatly admired several times The poor creature was every now and then uttering short cries in a manner as if he would not but they were forced from him What is the matter with him asked Fleda stepping fearfully towards the dog and speaking to mister Carleton who had come out to look after her As she spoke the dog rose and came crouching and wagging his tail to meet them O mister Carleton Fleda almost screamed look at him O what is the matter with him he s all over bloody Poor creature You must ask your cousin Fleda said mister Carleton with as much cold disgust in his countenance as it often expressed and that is saying a good deal Fleda could speak in the cause of a dog where she would have been silent in her own She went back to the parlour and begged her cousin with a face of distress to come out into the hall she did not say for what Both he and Thorn followed her Rossitur s face darkened as Fleda repeated her inquiry her heart so full by this time as hardly to allow her to make any Why the dog didn t do his duty and has been punished he said gloomily Punished said Fleda Shot said mister Carleton coolly Shot exclaimed Fleda bursting into heart wrung tears Shot O how could any one do it Oh how could you how could you cousin Charlton It was a picture The child was crying bitterly her fingers stroking the poor dog s head with a touch in which lay O what tender healing if the will had but had magnetic power Carleton s eye glanced significantly from her to the young officers Rossitur looked at Thorn It was not Charlton it was I Miss Fleda said the latter Charlton lent him to me to day and he disobeyed me and so I was angry with him and punished him a little severely but he ll soon get over it But all Fleda s answer was I am very sorry I am very sorry poor dog and to weep such tears as made the young gentlemen for once ashamed of themselves It almost did the child a mischief She did not get over it all the evening And she never got over it as far as mister Thorn was concerned missus Carleton hoped faintly that Guy would come to reason by the next morning and let Fleda go in the stage coach with the rest of the people But he was as unreasonable as ever and stuck to his purpose She had supposed however with Fleda that the difference would be only an open vehicle and his company instead of a covered one and her own Both of them were sadly discomfited when on coming to the hall door to take their carriages it was found that mister Carleton s meaning was no less than to take Fleda before him on horseback He was busy even then in arranging a cushion on the pommel of the saddle for her to sit upon missus Carleton burst into indignant remonstrances Fleda silently trembled But mister Carleton had his own notions on the subject and they were not moved by anything his mother could say He quietly went on with his preparations taking very slight notice of the raillery of the young officers answering missus Evelyn with polite words and silencing his mother as he came up with one of those looks out of his dark eyes to which she always forgave the wilfulness for the sake of the beauty and the winning power She was completely conquered and stepped back with even a smile But Carleton cried Rossitur impatiently you can t ride so you ll find it deucedly inconvenient Possibly said mister Carleton Fleda would be a great deal better off in the stage coach Have you studied medicine mister Rossitur said the young man Because I am persuaded of the contrary I don t believe your horse will like it said Thorn My horse is always of my mind sir or if he be not I generally succeed in convincing him But there is somebody else that deserves to be consulted said missus Thorn I wonder how little Fleda will like it I will ask her when we get to our first stopping place said mister Carleton smiling Come Fleda Fleda would hardly have said a word if his purpose had been to put her under the horse s feet instead of on his back But she came forward with great unwillingness and a very tremulous little heart He must have understood the want of alacrity in her face and manner though he took no notice of it otherwise than by the gentle kindness with which he led her to the horse block and placed her upon it Then mounting and riding the horse up close to the block he took Fleda in both hands and bidding her spring in a moment she was safely seated before him At first it seemed dreadful to Fleda to have that great horse s head so near her and she was afraid that her feet touching him would excite his most serious disapprobation However a minute or so went by and she could not see that his tranquillity seemed to be at all ruffled or even that he was sensible of her being upon his shoulders They waited to see the stage coach off and then gently set forward Fleda feared very much again when she felt the horse moving under her easy as his gait was and looking after the stagecoach in the distance now beyond call she felt a little as if she was a great way from help and dry land cast away on a horse s back But mister Carleton s arm was gently passed round her and she knew it held her safely and would not let her fall and he bent down his face to her and asked her so kindly and tenderly and with such a look too that seemed to laugh at her fears whether she felt afraid and with such a kind little pressure of his arm that promised to take care of her that Fleda s courage mounted twenty degrees at once And it rose higher every minute the horse went very easily and mister Carleton held her so that she could not be tired and made her lean against him and before they had gone a mile Fleda began to be delighted Such a charming way of travelling Such a free view of the country and in this pleasant weather too neither hot nor cold and when all nature s features were softened by the light veil of haze that hung over them and kept off the sun s glare mister Carleton was right In the stage coach Fleda would have sat quiet in a corner and moped the time sadly away now she was roused excited interested even cheerful forgetting herself which was the very thing of all others to be desired for her She lost her fears she was willing to have the horse trot or canter as fast as his rider pleased but the trotting was too rough for her so they cantered or paced along most of the time when the hills did not oblige them to walk quietly up and down which happened pretty often For several miles the country was not very familiar to Fleda It was however extremely picturesque and she sat silently and gravely looking at it her head lying upon mister Carleton s breast her little mind very full of thoughts and musings curious deep sometimes sorrowful but not unhappy I am afraid I tire you mister Carleton said she in a sudden fit of recollection starting up His look answered her and his arm drew her back to her place again Are you not tired Elfie Oh no You have got a new name for me mister Carleton said she a moment after looking up and smiling Do you like it Yes You are my good genius said he so I must have a peculiar title for you different from what other people know you by What is a genius sir said Fleda Well a sprite then said he smiling A sprite said Fleda I have read a story of a lady Elfie who had a great many little unearthly creatures a kind of sprites to attend upon her Some sat in the ringlets of her hair and took charge of them some hid in the folds of her dress and made them lie gracefully another lodged in a dimple in her cheek and another perched on her eyebrows and so on To take care of her eyebrows said Fleda laughing Yes to smooth out all the ill humoured wrinkles and frowns I suppose But am I such a sprite said Fleda Something like it Why what do I do said Fleda rousing herself in a mixture of gratification and amusement that was pleasant to behold What office would you choose Elfie what good would you like to do me It was a curious wistful look with which Fleda answered his question an innocent look in which mister Carleton read perfectly that she felt something was wanting in him and did not know exactly what His smile almost made her think she had been mistaken You are just the sprite you would wish to be Elfie he said Fleda s head took its former position and she sat for some time musing over his question and answer till a familiar waymark put all such thoughts to flight They were passing Deepwater Lake and would presently be at aunt Miriam s Fleda looked now with a beating heart Every foot of ground was known to her She was seeing it perhaps for the last time It was with even an intensity of eagerness that she watched every point and turn of the landscape endeavouring to lose nothing in her farewell view to give her farewell look at every favourite clump of trees and old rock and at the very mill wheels which for years whether working or at rest had had such interest for her If tears came to bid their good by too they were hastily thrown off or suffered to roll quietly down they might bide their time but eyes must look now or never How pleasant how pleasant the quiet old country seemed to Fleda as they went long in that most quiet light and colouring the brightness of the autumn glory gone and the sober warm hue which the hills still wore seen under that hazy veil All the home like peace of the place was spread out to make it hard going away Would she ever see any other so pleasant again Those dear old hills and fields among which she had been so happy they were not to be her home any more would she ever have the same sweet happiness anywhere else The Lord will provide thought little Fleda with swimming eyes It was hard to go by aunt Miriam s Fleda eagerly looked as well as she could but no one was to be seen about the house It was just as well A sad gush of tears must come then but she got rid of them as soon as possible that she might not lose the rest of the way promising them another time The little settlement on the hill was passed the factories and mills and mill ponds one after the other they made Fleda feel very badly for here she remembered going with her grandfather to see the work and there she had stopped with him at the turner s shop to get a wooden bowl turned and there she had been with Cynthy when she went to visit an acquaintance and there never was a happier little girl than Fleda had been in those old times All gone It was no use trying to help it Fleda put her two hands to her face and cried at last a silent but not the less bitter leave taking of the shadows of the past She forced herself into quiet again resolved to look to the last As they were going down the hill past the saw mill mister Carleton noticed that her head was stretched out to look back at it with an expression of face he could not withstand He wheeled about immediately and went back and stood opposite to it The mill was not working to day The saw was standing still though there were plenty of huge trunks of trees lying about in all directions waiting to be cut up There was a desolate look of the place No one was there the little brook most of its waters cut oft did not go roaring and laughing down the hill but trickled softly and plaintively over the stones It seemed exceeding sad to Fleda Thank you mister Carleton she said after a little earnest fond looking at her old haunt you needn t stay any longer But as soon as they had crossed the little rude bridge at the foot of the hill they could see the poplar trees which skirted the courtyard fence before her grandfather s house Poor Fleda s eyes could hardly serve her She managed to keep them open till the horse had made a few steps more and she had caught the well known face of the old house looking at her through the poplars Her fortitude failed and bowing her little head she wept so exceedingly that mister Carleton was fain to draw bridle and try to comfort her My dear Elfie do not weep so he said tenderly Is there anything you would like Can I do anything for you He had to wait a little He repeated his first query O it s no matter said Fleda striving to conquer her tears which found their way again if I only could have gone into the house once more but it s no matter you needn t wait mister Carleton The horse however remained motionless Do you think you would feel better Elfie if you had seen it again Oh yes But never mind mister Carleton you may go on mister Carleton ordered his servant to open the gate and rode up to the back of the house I am afraid there is nobody here Elfie he said the house seems all shut up I know how I can get in said Fleda there s a window down stairs I don t believe it is fastened if you wouldn t mind waiting mister Carleton I won t keep you long The child had dried her tears and there was the eagerness of something like hope in her face mister Carleton dismounted and took her off I must find a way to get in too Elfie I cannot let you go alone O I can open the door when I get in said Fleda But you have not the key There s no key it s only hoi ted on the inside that door I can open it She found the window unfastened as she had expected mister Carleton held it open while she crawled in and then she undid the door for him He more than half questioned the wisdom of his proceeding The house had a dismal look cold empty deserted it was a dreary reminder of Fleda s loss and he feared the effect of it would be anything but good He followed and watched her as with an eager business step she went through the hall and up the stairs putting her head into every room and giving an earnest wistful look all round it Here and there she went in and stood a moment where associations were more thick and strong sometimes taking a look out of a particular window and even opening a cupboard door to give that same kind and sorrowful glance of recognition at the old often resorted to hiding place of her own or her grandfather s treasures and trumpery Those old corners seemed to touch Fleda more than all the rest and she turned away from one of them with a face of such extreme sorrow that mister Carleton very much regretted he had brought her into the house For her sake for his own it was a curious show of character Though tears were sometimes streaming she made no delay and gave him no trouble with the calm steadiness of a woman she went regularly through the house leaving no place unvisited but never obliging him to hasten her away She said not a word during the whole time her very crying was still the light tread of her little feet was the only sound in the silent empty rooms and the noise of their footsteps in the halls and of the opening and shutting doors echoed mournfully through the house She had left her grandfather s room for the last mister Carleton did not follow her in there guessing that she would rather be alone But she did not come back and he was forced to go to fetch her The chill desolateness of that room had been too much for poor little Fleda The empty bedstead the cold stove the table bare of books only one or two lay upon the old bible the forlorn order of the place that bespoke the master far away the very sunbeams that stole in at the little windows and met now no answering look of gladness or gratitude it had struck the child s heart too heavily and she was standing crying by the window A second time in that room mister Carleton sat down and drew his little charge to his breast and spoke words of soothing and sympathy I am very sorry I brought you here dear Elfie he said kindly It was too hard for you O no even through her tears Fleda said she was very glad Hadn t we better try to overtake our friends he whispered after another pause She immediately almost immediately put away her tears and with a quiet obedience that touched him went with him from the room fastened the door and got out again at the little window O mister Carleton she said with great earnestness when they had almost reached the horses won t you wait for me one minute more I just want a piece of the burning bush Illustration She stood back and watched Drawing her hand from him she rushed round to the front of the house A little more slowly mister Carleton followed and found her under the burning bush tugging furiously at a branch beyond her strength to break off That s too much for you Elfie said he gently taking her hand from the tree let my hand try She stood back and watched tears running down her face while he got a knife from his pocket and cut off the piece she had been trying for nicely and gave it to her The first movement of Fleda s head was down bent over the pretty spray of red berries but by the time she stood at the horse s side she looked up at mister Carleton and thanked him with a face of more than thankfulness She was crying however constantly till they had gone several miles on their way again and mister Carleton doubted he had done wrong It passed away and she had been sitting quite peacefully for some time when he told her they were near the place where they were to stop and join their friends She looked up most gratefully in his face I am very much obliged to you mister Carleton for what you did I was afraid I had made a mistake Elfie Oh no you didn t Do you think you feel any easier after it Elfie Oh yes indeed I do said she looking up again thank you mister Carleton A gentle kind pressure of his arm answered her thanks I ought to be a good sprite to you mister Carleton Fleda said after musing a little while you are so very good to me Perhaps mister Carleton felt too much pleasure at this speech to make any answer for he made none It is only selfishness Elfie said he presently looking down to the quiet sweet little face which seemed to him and was more pure than anything of earth s mould he had ever seen You know I must take care of you for my own sake Fleda laughed a little But what will you do when we get to Paris I don t know I should like to have you always Elfie You ll have to get aunt Lucy to give me to you said Fleda mister Carleton said she a few minutes after is that story in a book What story About the lady and the little sprites that waited on her Yes it is in a book you shall see it Elfie Here we are And here it was proposed to stay till the next day lest Fleda might not be able to bear so much travelling at first But the country inn was not found inviting the dinner was bad and the rooms were worse uninhabitable the ladies said and about the middle of the afternoon they began to cast about for the means of reaching Albany that night None very comfortable could be had however it was thought better to push on at any rate than wear out the night in such a place The weather was very mild the moon at the full How is Fleda to go this afternoon said missus Evelyn She shall decide herself said missus Carleton How will you go my sweet Fleda Fleda was lying upon a sort of rude couch which had been spread for her where she had been sleeping incessantly ever since she arrived the hour of dinner alone excepted missus Carleton repeated her question I am afraid mister Carleton must be tired said Fleda without opening her eyes That means that you are don t it said Rossitur No said Fleda gently mister Carleton smiled and went out to press forward the arrangements In spite of good words and good money there was some delay It was rather late before the cavalcade left the inn and a journey of several hours was before them mister Carleton rode rather slowly too for Fleda s sake so the evening had fallen while they were yet a mile or two from the city His little charge had borne the fatigue well thanks partly to his admirable care and partly to her quiet pleasure in being with him She had been so perfectly still for some distance that he thought she had dropped asleep Looking down closer however to make sure about it he saw her thoughtful clear eyes most unsleepily fixed upon the sky What are you gazing at Elfie The look of thought changed to a look of affection as the eyes were brought to bear upon him and she answered with a smile Nothing I was looking at the stars What are you dreaming about I wasn t dreaming said Fleda I was thinking Thinking of what O of pleasant things Mayn t I know them I like to hear of pleasant things I was thinking said Fleda looking up again at the stars which shone with no purer ray than those grave eyes sent back to them I was thinking of being ready to die The words and the calm thoughtful manner in which they were said thrilled upon mister Carleton with a disagreeable shock How came you to think of such a thing said he lightly I don t know said Fleda still looking at the stars I suppose I was thinking What said mister Carleton inexpressibly curious to get at the workings of the child s mind which was not easy for Fleda was never very forward to talk of herself what were you thinking I want to know how you could get such a thing into your head It wasn t very strange said Fleda The stars made me think of heaven and grandpa s being there and then I thought how he was ready to go there and that made him ready to die I wouldn t think of such things Elfie said mister Carleton after a few minutes Why not sir said Fleda quickly I don t think they are good for you But mister Carleton said Fleda gently if I don t think about it how shall I ever be ready to die It is not fit for you said he evading the question it is not necessary now there s time enough You are a little body and should have none but gay thoughts But mister Carleton said Fleda with timid earnestness don t you think one could have gay thoughts better if one knew one was ready to die What makes a person ready to die Elfie said her friend disliking to ask the question but yet more unable to answer hers and curious to hear what she would say O to be a Christian said Fleda But I have seen Christians said mister Carleton who were no more ready to die than other people Then they were make believe Christians said Fleda decidedly What makes you think so said her friend carefully guarding his countenance from anything like a smile Because said Fleda grandpa was ready and my father was ready and my mother too and I know it was because they were Christians Perhaps your kind of Christians are different from my kind said mister Carleton carrying on the conversation half in spite of himself What do you mean by a Christian Elfie Why what the Bible means said Fleda looking at him with innocent earnestness mister Carleton was ashamed to tell her he did not know what that was or he was unwilling to say what he felt would trouble the happy confidence she had in him He was silent but as they rode on a bitter wish crossed his mind that he could have the simple purity of the little child in his arms and he thought he would give his broad acres supposing it possible that religion could be true in exchange for that free happy spirit that looks up to all its possessions in heaven Chapter XI Starres are poore books and oftentimes do misse This book of starres lights to eternall blisse George Herber The voyage across the Atlantic was not in itself at all notable The first half of the passage was extremely unquiet and most of the passengers uncomfortable to match Then the weather cleared and the rest of the way though lengthened out a good deal by the tricks of the wind was very fair and pleasant Fifteen days of tossing and sea sickness had brought little Fleda to look like the ghost of herself So soon as the weather changed and sky and sea were looking gentle again mister Carleton had a mattress and cushions laid in a sheltered corner of the deck for her and carried her up She had hardly any more strength than a baby What are you looking at me so for mister Carleton said she a little while after he had carried her up with a sweet serious smile that seemed to know the answer to her question He stooped down and clasped her little thin hand as reverentially as if she really had not belonged to the earth You are more like a sprite than I like to see you just now said he unconsciously fastening the child s heart to himself with the magnetism of those deep eyes I must get some of the sailors salt beef and sea biscuit for you they say that is the best thing to make people well O I feel better already said Fleda and settling her little face upon the cushion and closing her eyes she added thank you mister Carleton The fresh air began to restore her immediately she was no more sick her appetite came back and from that time without the help of beef and sea biscuit she mended rapidly mister Carleton proved himself as good a nurse on the sea as on land She seemed to be never far from his thoughts He was constantly finding out something that would do her good or please her and Fleda could not discover that he took any trouble about it she could not feel that she was a burden to him the things seemed to come as a matter of course missus Carleton was not wanting in any shew of kindness or care and yet when Fleda looked back upon the day it somehow was Guy that had done everything for her she thought little of thanking anybody but him There were other passengers that petted her a great deal or would have done so if Fleda s very timid retiring nature had not stood in the way She was never bashful nor awkward but yet it was only a very peculiar sympathetic style of address that could get within the wall of reserve which in general hid her from other people Hid what it could for through that reserve a singular modesty sweetness and gracefulness of spirit would shew themselves But there was much more behind There were no eyes however on board that did not look kindly on little Fleda excepting only two pair The Captain shewed her a great deal of flattering attention and said she was a pattern of a passenger even the sailors noticed and spoke of her and let slip no occasion of shewing the respect and interest she had raised But there were two pair of eyes and one of them Fleda thought most remarkably ugly that were an exception to the rest these belonged to her cousin Rossitur and Lieut Thorn Rossitur had never forgiven her remarks upon his character as a gentleman and declared preference of mister Carleton in that capacity and Thorn was mortified at the invincible childish reserve which she opposed to all his advances and both absurd as it seems were jealous of the young Englishman s advantage over them Both not the less because their sole reason for making her a person of consequence was that he had thought fit to do so Fleda would permit neither of them to do anything for her that she could help They took their revenge in raillery which was not always good natured mister Carleton never answered it in any other way than by his look of cold disdain not always by that little Fleda could not be quite so unmoved Many a time her nice sense of delicacy confessed itself hurt by the deep and abiding colour her cheeks would wear after one of their ill mannered flings at her She bore them with a grave dignity peculiar to herself but the same nice delicacy forbade her to mention the subject to any one and the young gentlemen contrived to give the little child in the course of the voyage a good deal of pain She shunned them at last as she would the plague As to the rest Fleda liked her life on board ship amazingly In her quiet way she took all the good that offered and seemed not to recognise the ill mister Carleton had bought for her a copy of The Rape of the Lock and Bryant s poems With these sitting or lying among her cushions Fleda amused herself a great deal and it was an especial pleasure when he would sit down by her and read and talk about them Still a greater was to watch the sea in its changes of colour and varieties of agitation and to get from mister Carleton bit by bit all the pieces of knowledge concerning it that he had ever made his own Even when Fleda feared it she was fascinated and while the fear went off the fascination grew deeper Daintily nestling among her cushions she watched with charmed eyes the long rollers that came up in detachments of three to attack the good ship that like a slandered character rode patiently over them or the crested green billows or sometimes the little rippling waves that shewed old Ocean s placidest face while with ears as charmed as if he had been delivering a fairy tale she listened to all mister Carleton could tell her of the green water where the whales feed or the blue water where Neptune sits in his own solitude the furtherest from land and the pavement under his feet outdoes the very canopy overhead in its deep colouring of the transparent seas where the curious mysterious marine plants and animals may be clearly seen many feet down and in the North where hundreds of feet of depth do not hide the bottom of the icebergs and whirling great fields of ice between which if a ship gets she had as good be an almond in a pair of strong nut crackers How the water grows colder and murkier as it is nearer the shore how the mountain waves are piled together and how old Ocean like a wise man however roughened and tumbled outwardly by the currents of Life is always calm at heart Of the signs of the weather the out riders of the winds and the use the seaman makes of the tidings they bring and before mister Carleton knew where he was he found himself deep in the science of navigation and making a star gazer of little Fleda Sometimes kneeling beside him as he sat on her mattress with her hand leaning on his shoulder Fleda asked listened and looked as engaged as rapt as interested as another child would be in Robinson Crusoe gravely drinking in knowledge with a fresh healthy taste for it that never had enough mister Carleton was about as amused and as interested as she There is a second taste of knowledge that some minds get in imparting it almost as sweet as the first relish At any rate Fleda never felt that she had any reason to fear tiring him and his mother complaining of his want of sociableness said she believed Guy did not like to talk to anybody but that little pet of his and one or two of the old sailors If left to her own resources Fleda was never at a loss she amused herself with her books or watching the sailors or watching the sea or with some fanciful manufacture she had learned from one of the ladies on board or with what the company about her were saying and doing One evening she had been some time alone looking out upon the restless little waves that were tossing and tumbling in every direction She had been afraid of them at first and they were still rather fearful to her imagination This evening as her musing eye watched them rise and fall her childish fancy likened them to the up springing chances of life uncertain unstable alike too much for her skill and her strength to manage She was not more helpless before the attacks of the one than of the other But then that calm blue Heaven that hung over the sea It was like the heaven of power and love above her destinies only this was far higher and more pure and abiding He knoweth them that trust in him There shall not a hair of your head perish Not these words perhaps but something like the sense of them was in little Fleda s head mister Carleton coming up saw her gazing out upon the water with an eye that seemed to see nothing Elfie Are you looking into futurity No yes not exactly said Fleda smiling No yes and not exactly said he throwing himself down beside her What does all that mean I wasn t exactly looking into futurity said Fleda What then Don t tell me you were thinking I know that dready What Fleda was always rather shy of opening her cabinet of thoughts She glanced at him and hesitated and then yielded to a fascination of eye and smile that rarely failed of its end Looking off to the sea again as if she had left her thoughts there she said I was only thinking of that beautiful hymn of mister Newton s What hymn That long one The Lord will provide Do you know it Tell it to me Elfie let us see whether I shall think it beautiful Fleda knew the whole and repeated it Though troubles assail And dangers affright Though friends should all fall And foes all unite Yet one thing secures us Whatever betide The Scripture assures us The Lord will provide The birds without barn Or storehouse are fed From them let us learn To trust for our bread His saints what is fitting Shall ne er be denied So long as tis written The Lord will provide His call we obey Like Abraham of old Not knowing our way But faith makes us bold And though we are strangers We have a good guide And trust in all dangers The Lord will provide We may like the ships In tempests be tossed On perilous deeps But cannot be lost Though Satan enrages The wind and the tide The promise engages The Lord will provide When Satan appears To stop up our path And fills us with fears We triumph by faith He cannot take from us Though oft he has tried This heart cheering promise The Lord will provide He tells us we re weak Our hope is in vain The good that we seek We ne er shall obtain But when such suggestions Our spirits have tried This answers all questions The Lord will provide No strength of our own Or goodness we claim But since we have known The Saviour s great name In this our strong tower For safety we hide The Lord is our power The Lord will provide When life sinks apace And death is in view This word of his grace Shall comfort us through No fearing nor doubting With Christ on our side We hope to die shouting The Lord will provide Guy listened very attentively to the whole He was very far from understanding the meaning of several of the verses but the bounding expression of confidence and hope he did understand and did feel Happy to be so deluded he thought I almost wish I could share the delusion He was gloomily silent when she had done and little Fleda s eyes were so full that it was a little while before she could look towards him and ask in her gentle way Do you like it mister Carleton She was gratified by his grave Yes But Elfie said he smiling again you have not told me your thoughts yet What had these verses to do with the sea you were looking at so hard Nothing I was thinking said Fleda slowly that the sea seemed something like the world I don t mean it was like but it made me think of it and I thought how pleasant it is to know that God takes care of his people Don t he take care of everybody Yes in one sort of way said Fleda but then it is only his children that he has promised to keep from everything that will hurt them I don t see how that promise is kept Elfie I think those who call themselves so meet with as many troubles as the rest of the world and perhaps more Yes said Fleda quickly they have troubles but then God won t let the troubles do them any harm A subtle evasion thought mister Carleton Where did you learn that Elfie The Bible says so said Fleda Well how do you know it from that aid mister Carleton impelled he hardly knew whether by his bad or his good angel to carry on the conversation Why said Fleda looking as if it were a very simple question and mister Carleton were catechising her you know mister Carleton the Bible was written by men who were taught by God exactly what to say so there could be nothing in it that is not true How do you know those men were so taught The Bible says so A child s answer but with a child s wisdom in it not learnt of the schools He that is of God heareth God s words To little Fleda as to every simple and humble intelligence the Bible proved itself she had no need to go further mister Carleton did not smile for nothing would have tempted him to hurt her feelings but he said though conscience did not let him do it without a twinge But don t you know Elfie there are some people who do not believe the Bible Ah but those are bad people replied Fleda quickly all good people believe it A child s reason again but hitting the mark this time Unconsciously little Fleda had brought forward a strong argument for her cause mister Carleton felt it and rising up that he might not be obliged to say anything more he began to pace slowly up and down the deck turning the matter over Was it so that there were hardly any good men he thought there might be a few who did not believe in the Bible and uphold its authority and that all the worst portion of society was comprehended in the other class and if so how had he overlooked it He had reasoned most unphilosophically from a few solitary instances that had come under his own eye but applying the broad principle of induction it could not be doubted that the Bible was on the side of all that is sound healthful and hopeful in this disordered world And whatever might be the character of a few exceptions it was not supposable that a wide system of hypocrisy should tell universally for the best interests of mankind Summoning history to produce her witnesses as he went on with his walk up and down he saw with increasing interest what he had never seen before that the Bible had come like the breath of spring upon the moral waste of mind that the ice bound intellect and cold heart of the world had waked into life under its kindly influence and that all the rich growth of the one and the other had come forth at its bidding And except in that sun lightened tract the world was and had been a waste indeed Doubtless in that waste intellect had at different times put forth sundry barren shoots such as a vigorous plant can make in the absence of the sun but also like them immature unsound and groping vainly after the light in which alone they could expand and perfect themselves ripening no seed for a future and richer growth And flowers the wilderness had none The affections were stunted and overgrown All this was so how had he overlooked it His unbelief had come from a thoughtless ignorant one sided view of life and human things The disorder and ruin which he saw where he did not also see the adjusting hand at work had led him to refuse his credit to the Supreme Fabricator He thought the waste would never be reclaimed and did not know how much it already owed to the sun of revelation but what was the waste where that light had not been mister Carleton was staggered He did not know what to think He began to think he had been a fool Poor little Fleda was meditating less agreeably the while With the sure tact of truth she had discerned that there was more than jest in the questions that had been put to her She almost feared that mister Carleton shared himself the doubts he had so lightly spoken of and the thought gave her great distress However when he came to take her down to tea with all his usual manner Fleda s earnest look at him ended in the conviction that there was nothing very wrong under that face For several days mister Carleton pondered the matter of this evening s conversation characteristically restless till he had made up his mind He wished very much to draw Fleda to speak further upon the subject but it was not easy she never led to it He sought in vain an opportunity to bring it in easily and at last resolved to make one Elfie said he one morning when all the rest of the passengers were happily engaged at a distance with the letter bags I wish you would let me hear that favourite hymn of yours again I like it very much Fleda was much gratified and immediately with great satisfaction repeated the hymn Its peculiar beauty struck him yet more the second time than the first Do you understand those two last verses said he when she had done Fleda said Yes rather surprised I do not he said gravely Fleda paused a minute or two and then finding that it depended on her to enlighten him said in her modest way Why it means that we have no goodness of our own and only expect to be forgiven and taken to heaven for the Saviour s sake mister Carleton asked How for his sake Why you know mister Carleton we don t deserve to go there and if we are forgiven at all it must be for what he has done And what is that Elfie He died for us said Fleda with a look of some anxiety into mister Carleton s face Died for us And what end was that to serve Elfie said he partly willing to hear the full statement of the matter and partly willing to see how far her intelligence could give it Because we are sinners said Fleda and God has said that sinners shall die Then how can he keep his word and forgive at all Because Christ has died for us said Fleda eagerly instead of us Do you understand the justice of letting one take the place of others He was willing mister Carleton said Fleda with a singular wistful expression that touched him Still Elfie said he after a minute s silence how could the ends of justice be answered by the death of one man in the place of millions No mister Carleton but he was God as well as man Fleda said with a sparkle in her eye which perhaps delayed her companion s rejoinder What should induce him Elfie he said gently to do such a thing for people who had displeased him Because he loved us mister Carleton She answered with so evident a strong and clear appreciation of what she was saying that it half made its way into mister Carleton s mind by the force of sheer sympathy Her words came almost as something new Certainly mister Carleton had heard these things before though perhaps never in a way that appealed so directly to his intelligence and his candour He was again silent an instant pondering and so was Fleda Do you know Elfie said mister Carleton there are some people who do not believe that the Saviour was anything more than a man Yes I know it said Fleda it is very strange Why is it strange Because the Bible says it so plainly But those people hold I believe that the Bible does not say it I don t see how they could have read the Bible said Fleda Why he said so himself Who said so Jesus Christ Don t you believe it mister Carleton She saw he did not and the shade that had come over her face was reflected in his before he said No But perhaps I shall believe it yet Elfie he said kindly Can you shew me the place in your Bible where Jesus says this of himself Fleda looked in despair She hastily turned over the leaves of her Bible to find the passages he had asked for and mister Carleton was cut to the heart to see that she twice was obliged to turn her face from him and brush her hand over her eyes before she could find them She turned to Matt xxvi sixty three sixty four sixty five and without speaking gave him the book pointing to the passage He read it with great care and several times over You are right Elfie he said I do not see how those who honour the authority of the Bible and the character of Jesus Christ can deny the truth of his own declaration If that is false so must those be Fleda took the Bible and hurriedly sought out another passage Grandpa shewed me these places she said once when we were talking about mister Didenhover he didn t believe that There are a great many other places grandpa said but one is enough She gave him the latter part of the twentieth chapter of John You see mister Carleton he let Thomas fall down and worship him and call him God and if he had not been you know God is more displeased with that than with any thing With what Elfie With men s worshipping any other than himself He says he will not give his glory to another Where is that I am afraid I can t find it said Fleda it is somewhere in Isaiah I know She tried in vain and failing then looked up in mister Carleton s face to see what impression had been made You see Thomas believed when he saw said he answering her I will believe too when I see Ah if you wait for that said Fleda Her voice suddenly checked she bent her face down again to her little Bible and there was a moment s struggle with herself Are you looking for something more to shew me said mister Carleton kindly stooping his face down to hers Not much said Fleda hurriedly and then making a great effort she raised her head and gave him the book again Look here mister Carleton Jesus said Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed mister Carleton was profoundly struck and the thought recurred to him afterwards and was dwelt upon Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed It was strange at first and then he wondered that it should ever have been so His was a mind peculiarly open to conviction peculiarly accessible to truth and his attention being called to it he saw faintly now what he had never seen before the beauty of the principle of faith how natural how reasonable how necessary how honourable to the Supreme Being how happy even for man that the grounds of his trust in God being established his acceptance of many other things should rest on that trust alone mister Carleton now became more reserved and unsociable than ever He wearied himself with thinking If be could have got at the books he would have spent his days and nights in studying the evidences of Christianity but the ship was bare of any such books and he never thought of turning to the most obvious of all the Bible itself His unbelief was shaken it was within an ace of falling in pieces to the very foundation or rather he began to suspect how foundationless it had been It came at last to one point with him If there were a God he would not have left the world without a revelation no more would he have suffered that revelation to defeat its own end by becoming corrupted or alloyed if there was such a revelation it could be no other than the Bible and his acceptance of the whole scheme of Christianity now hung upon the turn of a hair Yet he could not resolve himself He balanced the counter doubts and arguments on one side and on the other and strained his mind to the task he could not weigh them nicely enough He was in a maze and seeking to clear and calm his judgment that he might see the way out it was in vain that he tried to shake his dizzied head from the effect of the turns it had made By dint of anxiety to find the right path reason had lost herself in the wilderness Fleda was not as mister Carleton had feared she would be at all alienated from him by the discovery that had given her so much pain It wrought in another way rather to add a touch of tender and anxious interest to the affection she had for him It gave her however much more pain than he thought If he had seen the secret tears that fell on his account he would have been grieved and if he had known of the many petitions that little heart made for him he could hardly have loved her more than he did One evening mister Carleton had been a long while pacing up and down the deck in front of little Fleda s nest thinking and thinking without coming to any end It was a most fair evening near sunset the sky without a cloud except two or three little dainty strips which set off its blue The ocean was very quiet only broken into cheerful mites of waves that seemed to have nothing to do but sparkle The sun s rays were almost level now and a long path of glory across the sea led off towards his sinking disk Fleda sat watching and enjoying it all in her happy fashion which always made the most of everything good and was especially quick in catching any form of natural beauty mister Carleton s thoughts were elsewhere too busy to take note of things around him Fleda looked now and then as he passed at his gloomy brow wondering what he was thinking of and wishing that he could have the same reason to be happy that she had In one of his turns his eye met her gentle glance and vexed and bewildered as he was with study there was something in that calm bright face that impelled him irresistibly to ask the little child to set the proud scholar right Placing himself beside her he said Elfie how do you know there is a God what reason have you for thinking so out of the Bible It was a strange look little Fleda gave him He felt it at the time and he never forgot it Such a look of reproach sorrow and pity he afterwards thought as an angel s face might have worn The question did not seem to occupy her a moment After this answering look she suddenly pointed to the sinking sun and said Who made that mister Carleton mister Carleton s eyes following the direction of hers met the long bright rays whose still witness bearing was almost too powerful to be borne The sun was just dipping majestically into the sea and its calm self assertion seemed to him at that instant hardly stronger than its vindication of its Author A slight arrow may find the joint in the armour before which many weightier shafts have fallen powerless mister Carleton was an unbeliever no more from that time Chapter XII He borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able Merchant of Venice One other incident alone in the course of the voyage deserves to be mentioned both because it served to bring out the characters of several people and because it was not what is without its lingering consequences Thorn and Rossitur had kept up indefatigably the game of teasing Fleda about her English admirer as they sometimes styled him Poor Fleda grew more and more sore on the subject She thought it was very strange that two grown men could not find enough to do to amuse themselves without making sport of the comfort of a little child She wondered they could take pleasure in what gave her so much pain but so it was and they had it up so often that at last others caught it from them and though not in malevolence yet in thoughtless folly many a light remark was made and question asked of her that set little Fleda s sensitive nerves a quivering She was only too happy that they were never said before mister Carleton that would have been a thousand times worse As it was her gentle nature was constantly suffering from the pain or the fear of these attacks Where s mister Carleton said her cousin coming up one day I don t know said Fleda I don t know but he is gone up into one of the tops Your humble servant leaves you to yourself a great while this morning it seems to me He is growing very inattentive I wouldn t permit it Miss Fleda if I were you said Thorn maliciously You let him have his own way too much I wish you wouldn t talk so cousin Charlton said Fleda But seriously said Charlton I think you had better call him to account He is very suspicious lately I have observed him walking by himself and looking very glum indeed I am afraid he has taken some fancy into his head that would not suit you I advise you to enquire into it I wouldn t give myself any concern about it said Thorn lightly enjoying the child s confusion and his own fanciful style of backbiting I d let him go if he has a mind to Miss Fleda He s no such great catch He s neither lord nor knight nothing in the world but a private gentleman with plenty of money I dare say but you don t care for that and there s as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it I don t think much of him He is wonderfully better than you thought Fleda as she looked in the young gentleman s face for a second but she said nothing Why Fleda said Charlton laughing it wouldn t be a killing affair would it How has this English admirer of yours got so far in your fancy praising your pretty eyes eh Eh he repeated as Fleda kept a dignified silence No said Fleda in displeasure he never says such things No said Charlton What then What does he say I wouldn t let him make a fool of me if I were you Fleda did he ever ask you for a kiss No exclaimed Fleda half beside herself and bursting into tears I wish you wouldn t talk so How can you They had carried the game pretty far that time and thought best to leave it Fleda stopped crying as soon as she could lest somebody should see her and was sitting quietly again alone as before when one of the sailors whom she had never spoken to came by and leaning over towards her with a leer as he passed said Is this the young English gentleman s little sweetheart Poor Fleda She had got more than she could bear She jumped up and ran down into the cabin and in her berth missus Carleton found her some time afterwards quietly crying and most sorry to be discovered She was exceeding unwilling to tell what had troubled her missus Carleton really distressed tried coaxing soothing reasoning promising in a way the most gentle and kind that she could use Oh it s nothing it s nothing Fleda said at last eagerly it s because I am foolish it s only something they said to me Who love Again was Fleda most unwilling to answer and it was after repeated urging that she at last said Cousin Charlton and mister Thorn Charlton and mister Thorn What did they say What did they say darling Fleda O it s only that they tease me said Fleda trying hard to put an end to the tears which caused all this questioning and to speak as if they were about a trifle But missus Carleton persisted What do they say to tease you love what is it about Guy come in here and help me to find out what is the matter with Fleda Fleda hid her face in missus Carleton s neck resolved to keep her lips sealed mister Carleton came in but to her great relief his question was directed not to her but his mother Fleda has been annoyed by something those young men her cousin and mister Thorn have said to her they tease her she says and she will not tell me what it is mister Carleton did not ask and he presently left the state room O I am afraid he will speak to them exclaimed Fleda as soon as he was gone O I oughtn t to have said that missus Carleton tried to soothe her and asked what she was afraid of But Fleda would not say any more Her anxious fear that she had done mischief helped to dry her tears and she sorrowfully resolved she would keep her griefs to herself next time Rossitur and Thorn were in company with a brother officer and friend of the latter when mister Carleton approached them mister Rossitur and mister Thorn said he you have indulged yourselves in a style of conversation extremely displeasing to the little girl under my mother s care You will oblige me by abandoning it for the future There was certainly in mister Carleton s manner a sufficient degree of the cold haughtiness with which he usually expressed displeasure though his words gave no other cause of offence Thorn retorted rather insolently I shall oblige myself in the matter and do as I think proper I have a right to speak as I please to my own cousin said Rossitur sulkily without asking anybody s leave I don t see what you have to do with it Simply that she is under my protection and that I will not permit her to be annoyed I don t see how she is under your protection said Rossitur And I do not see how the potency of it will avail in this case said his companion Neither position is to be made out in words said mister Carleton calmly You see that I desire there be no repetition of the offence The rest I will endeavour to make clear if I am compelled to it Stop sir said Thorn as the young Englishman was turning away adding with an oath I won t bear this You shall answer this to me sir Easily said the other And me too said Rossitur You have an account to settle with me Carleton I will answer what you please said Carleton carelessly and as soon as we get to land provided you do not in the mean time induce me to refuse you the honour However incensed the young men endeavoured to carry it off with the same coolness that their adversary shewed No more words passed But missus Carleton possibly quickened by Fleda s fears was not satisfied with the carriage of all parties and resolved to sound her son happy in knowing that nothing but truth was to be had from him She found an opportunity that very afternoon when he was sitting alone on the deck The neighbourhood of little Fleda she hardly noticed Fleda was curled up among her cushions luxuriously bending over a little old black Bible which was very often in her hand at times when she was quiet and had no observation to fear Reading always reading said missus Carleton as she came up and took a place by her son By no means he said closing his book with a smile not enough to tire any one s eyes on this voyage mother I wish you liked intercourse with living society said missus Carleton leaning her arm on his shoulder and looking at him rather wistfully You need not wish that when it suits me he answered But none suits you Is there any on board A small proportion he said with the slight play of feature which always effected a diversion of his mother s thoughts no matter in what channel they had been flowing But those young men she said returning to the charge you hold yourself very much aloof from them He did not answer even by a look but to his mother the perfectly quiet composure of his face was sufficiently expressive I know what you think but Guy you always had the same opinion of them I have never shewn any other Guy she said speaking low and rather anxiously have you got into trouble with those young men I am in no trouble mother he answered somewhat haughtily I cannot speak for them missus Carleton waited a moment You have done something to displease them have you not They have displeased me which is somewhat more to the purpose But their folly is nothing to you No not their folly Guy said his mother again pausing a minute and pressing her hand more heavily upon his shoulder you will not suffer this to alter the friendly terms you have been on whatever it be let it pass Certainly if they choose to apologize and behave themselves What about Fleda Yes I have no idea they meant to trouble her I suppose they did not at all know what they were doing thoughtless nonsense and they could have had no design to offend you Promise me that you will not take any further notice of this He shook off her beseeching hand as he rose up and answered haughtily and not without something like an oath that he would missus Carleton knew him better than to press the matter any further and her fondness easily forgave the offence against herself especially as her son almost immediately resumed his ordinary manner It had well nigh passed from the minds of both parties when in the middle of the next day mister Carleton asked what had become of Fleda he had not seen her except at the breakfast table missus Carleton said she was not well What s the matter She complained of some headache I think she made herself sick yesterday she was crying all the afternoon and I could not get her to tell me what for I tried every means I could think of but she would not give me the least clue she said no to everything I guessed I can t bear to see her do so it makes it all the worse she does it so quietly it was only by a mere chance I found she was crying at all but I think she cried herself ill before she stopped She could not eat a mouthful of breakfast mister Carleton said nothing and with a changed countenance went directly down to the cabin The stewardess whom he sent in to see how she was brought back word that Fleda was not asleep but was too ill to speak to her mister Carleton went immediately into the little crib of a state room There he found his little charge sitting bolt upright her feet on the rung of a chair and her hands grasping the top to support herself Her eyes were closed her face without a particle of colour except the dark shade round the eyes which bespoke illness and pain She made no attempt to answer his shocked questions and words of tender concern not even by the raising of an eyelid and he saw that the intensity of pain at the moment was such as to render breathing itself difficult He sent off the stewardess with all despatch after iced water and vinegar and brandy and himself went on an earnest quest of restoratives among the lady passengers in the cabin which resulted in sundry supplies of salts and cologne and also offers of service in greater plenty still which he all refused Most tenderly and judiciously he himself applied various remedies to the suffering child who could not direct him otherwise than by gently putting away the things which she felt would not avail her Several were in vain But there was one bottle of strong aromatic vinegar which was destined to immortalize its owner in Fleda s remembrance Before she had taken three whiffs of it her colour changed mister Carleton watched the effect of a few whiffs more and then bade the stewardess take away all the other things and bring him a cup of fresh strong coffee By the time it came Fleda was ready for it and by the time mister Carleton had administered the coffee he saw it would do to throw his mother s shawl round her and carry her up on deck which he did without asking any questions All this while Fleda had not spoken a word except once when he asked her if she felt better But she had given him on finishing the coffee a full look and half smile of such pure affectionate gratitude that the young gentleman s tongue was tied for some time after With happy skill when he had safely bestowed Fleda among her cushions on deck mister Carleton managed to keep off the crowd of busy inquirers after her well doing and even presently to turn his mother s attention another way leaving Fleda to enjoy all the comfort of quiet and fresh air at once He himself seeming occupied with other things did no more but keep watch over her till he saw that she was able to bear conversation again Then he seated himself beside her and said softly Illustration Then he seated himself beside her Elfie what were you crying about all yesterday afternoon Fleda changed colour for soft and gentle as the tone was she heard in it a determination to have the answer and looking up beseechingly into his face she saw in the steady full blue eye that it was a determination she could not escape from Her answer was an imploring request that he would not ask her But taking one of her little hands and carrying it to his lips he in the same tone repeated his question Fleda snatched away her hand and burst into very frank tears mister Carleton was silent but she knew through silence that he was only quietly waiting for her to answer him I wish you wouldn t ask me sir said poor Fleda who still could not turn her face to meet his eye It was only something that happened yesterday What was it Elfie You need not be afraid to tell me It was only what you said to missus Carleton yesterday when she was talking About my difficulty with those gentlemen Yes said Fleda with a new gush of tears as if her grief stirred afresh at the thought mister Carleton was silent a moment and when he spoke there was no displeasure and more tenderness than usual in his voice What troubled you in that Elfie tell me the whole I was sorry because it wasn t right said Fleda with a grave truthfulness which yet lacked none of her universal gentleness and modesty What wasn t right To speak I am afraid you won t like me to say it mister Carleton I will Elfie for I ask you To speak to missus Carleton so and besides you know what you said mister Carleton It was not right said he after a minute and I very seldom use such an expression but you know one cannot always be on one s guard Elfie But said Fleda with gentle persistence one can always do what is right The deuce one can thought mister Carleton to himself Elfie was that all that troubled you that I had said what was not right It wasn t quite that only said Fleda hesitating What else She stooped her face from his sight and he could but just understand her words I was disappointed What in me Her tears gave the answer she could add to them nothing but an assenting nod of her head They would have flowed in double measure if she had guessed the pain she had given Her questioner heard her with a keen pang which did not leave him for days There was some hurt pride in it though other and more generous feelings had a far larger share He who had been admired lauded followed cited and envied by all ranks of his countrymen and countrywomen in whom nobody found a fault that could be dwelt upon amid the lustre of his perfections and advantages one of the first young men in England thought so by himself as well as by others this little pure being had been disappointed in him He could not get over it He reckoned the one judgment worth all the others Those whose direct or indirect flatteries had been poured at his feet were the proud the worldly the ambitious the interested the corrupted their praise was given to what they esteemed and that his candour said was the least estimable part of him Beneath all that this truth loving truth discerning little spirit had found enough to weep for She was right and they were wrong The sense of this was so keen upon him that it was tea or fifteen minutes before he could recover himself to speak to his little reprover He paced up and down the deck while Fleda wept more and more from the fear of having offended or grieved him But she was soon reassured on the former point She was just wiping away her tears with the quiet expression of patience her face often wore when mister Carleton sat down beside her and took one of her hands Elfie said he I promise you I will never say such a thing again He might well call her his good angel for it was an angelic look the child gave him So purely humble grateful glad so rosy with joyful hope the eyes were absolutely sparkling through tears But when she saw that his were not dry her own overflowed She clasped her other hand to his hand and bending down her face affectionately upon it she wept if ever angels weep such tears as they Elfie said mister Carleton as soon as he could I want you to go down stairs with me so dry those eyes or my mother will be asking all sorts of difficult questions Happiness is a quick restorative Elfie was soon ready to go where he would They found missus Carleton fortunately wrapped up in a new novel some distance apart from the other persons in the cabin The novel was immediately laid aside to take Fleda on her lap and praise Guy s nursing But she looks more like a wax figure yet than anything else don t she Guy Not like any that ever I saw said mister Carleton gravely Hardly substantial enough Mother I have come to tell you I am ashamed of myself for having given you such cause of offence yesterday missus Carleton s quick look as she laid her hand on her son s arm said sufficiently well that she would have excused him from making any apology rather than have him humble himself in the presence of a third person Fleda heard me yesterday said he it was right she should hear me to day Then my dear Guy said his mother with a secret eagerness which she did not allow to appear if I may make a condition for my forgiveness which you had before you asked for it will you grant me one favour Certainly mother if I can You promise me As well in one word as in two Promise me that you will never by any circumstances allow yourself to be drawn into what is called an affair of honour mister Carleton s brow changed and without making any reply perhaps to avoid his mother s questioning gaze he rose up and walked two or three times the length of the cabin His mother and Fleda watched him doubtfully Do you see how you have got me into trouble Elfie said he stopping before them Fleda looked wonderingly and missus Carleton exclaimed What trouble Elfie said he without immediately answering his mother what would your conscience do with two promises both of which cannot be kept What such promises have you made said missus Carleton eagerly Let me hear first what Fleda says to my question Why said Fleda looking a little bewildered I would keep the right one Not the one first made said he smiling No said Fleda not unless it was the right one But don t you think one ought to keep one s word in any event I don t think anything can make it right to do wrong Fleda said gravely and not without a secret trembling consciousness to what point she was speaking He left them and again took several turns up and down the cabin before he sat down You have not given me your promise yet Guy said his mother whose eye had not once quitted him You said you would I said if I could Well you can I have two honourable meetings of the proscribed kind now on hand to which I stand pledged Fleda hid her face in an agony missus Carleton s agony was in every line of hers as she grasped her son s wrist exclaiming Guy promise me She had words for nothing else He hesitated still a moment and then meeting his mother s look he said gravely and steadily I promise you mother I never will His mother threw herself upon his breast and hid her face there too much excited to have any thought of her customary regard to appearances sobbing out thanks and blessings even audibly Fleda s gentle head was bowed in almost equal agitation and mister Carleton at that moment had no doubt that he had chosen well which promise to keep There remained however a less agreeable part of the business to manage After seeing his mother and Fleda quite happy again though without satisfying in any degree the curiosity of the former Guy went in search of the two young West Point officers They were together but without Thorn s friend captain Beebee Him Carleton next sought and brought to the forward deck where the others were enjoying their cigars or rather Charlton Rossitur was enjoying his with the happy self satisfaction of a pair of epaulettes off duty Thorn had too busy a brain to be much of a smoker Now however when it was plain that mister Carleton had something to say to them Charlton s cigar gave way to his attention it was displaced from his mouth and held in abeyance while Thorn puffed away more intently than ever Gentlemen Carleton began I gave you yesterday reason to expect that so soon as circumstances permitted you should have the opportunity which offended honour desires of trying sounder arguments than those of reason upon the offender I have to tell you to day that I will not give it you I have thought further of it Is it a new insult that you mean by this sir exclaimed Rossitur in astonishment Thorn s cigar did not stir Neither new nor old I mean simply that I have changed my mind But this is very extraordinary said Rossitur What reason do you give I give none sir In that case said captain Beebee perhaps mister Carleton will not object to explain or unsay the things which gave offence yesterday I apprehend there is nothing to explain sir I think I must have been understood and I never take back my words for I am in the habit of speaking the truth Then we are to consider this as a further unprovoked unmitigated insult for which you will give neither reason nor satisfaction cried Rossitur I have already disclaimed that mister Rossitur Are we on mature deliberation considered unworthy of tha honour you so condescendingly awarded to us yesterday My reasons have nothing to do with you sir nor with your friend they are entirely personal to myself mister Carleton must be aware said captain Beebee that his conduct if unexplained will bear a very strange construction mister Carleton was coldly silent It never was heard of the Captain went on that a gentleman declined both to explain and to give satisfaction for any part of his conduct which had called for it It never was heard that a gentleman did said Thorn removing his cigar a moment for the purpose of supplying the emphasis which his friend had carefully omitted to make Will you say mister Carleton said Rossitur that you did not mean to offend us yesterday in what you said No mister Rossitur You will not cried the Captain No sir for your friends had given me as I conceived just cause of displeasure and I was and am careless of offending those who have done so You consider yourself aggrieved then in the first place said Beebee I have said so sir Then said the Captain after a puzzled look out to sea supposing that my friends disclaim all intention to offend you in that case In that case I should be glad captain Beebee that they had changed their line of tactics there is nothing to change in my own Then what are we to understand by this strange refusal of a meeting mister Carleton what does it mean It means one thing in my own mind sir and probably another in yours but the outward expression I choose to give it is that I will not reward uncalled for rudeness with an opportunity of self vindication You are said Thorn sneeringly probably careless as to the figure your own name will cut in connection with this story Entirely so said mister Carleton eying him steadily You are aware that your character is at our mercy A slight bow seemed to leave at their disposal the very small portion of his character he conceived to lie in that predicament You will expect to hear yourself spoken of in terms that befit a man who has cowed out of an engagement he dared not fulfil Of course said Carleton haughtily by my present refusal I give you leave to say all that and as much more as your ingenuity can furnish in the same style but not in my hearing sir You can t help yourself said Thorn with the same sneer You have rid yourself of a gentleman s means of protection what others will you use I will leave that to the suggestion of the moment I do not doubt it will be found fruitful Nobody doubted it who looked just then on his steady sparkling eye I consider the championship of yesterday given up of course Thorn went on in a kind of aside not looking at anybody and striking his cigar against the guards to clear it of ashes the champion has quitted the field and the little princess but lately so walled in with defences must now listen to whatever knight and squire may please to address to her Nothing remains to be seen of her defender but his spurs They may serve for the heels of whoever is disposed to annoy her said mister Carleton He will need them He left the group with the same air of imperturbable self possession which he had maintained during the conference But presently Rossitur who had his private reasons for wishing to keep friends with an acquaintance who might be of service in more ways than one followed him and declared himself to have been in all his nonsense to Fleda most undesirous of giving displeasure to her temporary guardian and sorry that it had fallen out so He spoke frankly and mister Carleton with the same cool gracefulness with which he had carried on the quarrel waived his displeasure and admitted the young gentleman apparently to stand as before in his favour Their reconciliation was not an hour old when captain Beebee joined them I am sorry I must trouble you with a word more on this disagreeable subject mister Carleton he began after a ceremonious salutation My friend Lieut Thorn considers himself greatly outraged by your determination not to meet him He begs to ask by me whether it is your purpose to abide by it at all hazards Yes sir There is some misunderstanding here which I greatly regret I hope you will see and excuse the disagreeable necessity I am under of delivering the rest of my friend s message Say on sir mister Thorn declares that if you deny him the common courtesy which no gentleman refuses to another he will proclaim your name with the most opprobrious adjuncts to all the world and in place of his former regard he will hold you in the most unlimited contempt which he will have no scruple about shewing on all occasions mister Carleton coloured a little but replied coolly I have not lived in mister Thorn s favour As to the rest I forgive him except indeed he provoke me to measures for which I never will forgive him Measures said the Captain I hope not for my own self respect would be more grievously hurt than his But there is an unruly spring somewhere about my composition that when it gets wound up is once in a while too much for me But said Rossitur pardon me have you no regard to the effect of his misrepresentations You are mistaken mister Rossitur said Carleton slightly this is but the blast of a bellows not the Simoom Then what answer shall I have the honour of carrying back to my friend said captain Beebee after a sort of astounded pause of a few minutes None of my sending sir captain Beebee touched his cap and went back to mister Thorn to whom he reported that the young Englishman was thoroughly impracticable and that there was nothing to be gained by dealing with him and the vexed conclusion of Thorn s own mind in the end was in favour of the wisdom of letting him alone In a very different mood saddened and disgusted mister Carleton shook himself free of Rossitur and went and stood alone by the guards looking out upon the sea He did not at all regret his promise to his mother nor wish to take other ground than that he had taken Both the theory and the practice of duelling he heartily despised and he was not weak enough to fancy that he had brought any discredit upon either his sense or his honour by refusing to comply with an unwarrantable and barbarous custom And he valued mankind too little to be at all concerned about their judgment in the matter His own opinion was at all times enough for him But the miserable folly and puerility of such an altercation as that in which he had just been engaged the poor display of human character the little low passions which bad been called up even in himself alike destitute of worthy cause and aim and which had perhaps but just missed ending in the death of some and the living death of others it all wrought to bring him back to his old wearying of human nature and despondent eying of the everywhere jarrings confusions and discordances in the moral world The fresh sea breeze that swept by the ship roughening the play of the waves and brushing his own cheek with its health bearing wing brought with it a sad feeling of contrast Free and pure and steadily directed it sped on its way to do its work And like it all the rest of the natural world faithful to the law of its Maker was stamped with the same signet of perfection Only man in all the universe seemed to be at cross purposes with the end of his being Only man of all animate or inanimate things lived an aimless fruitless broken life or fruitful only in evil How was this and whence and when would be the end and would this confused mass of warring elements ever be at peace would this disordered machinery ever work smoothly without let or stop any more and work out the beautiful something for which sure it was designed And could any hand but its first Maker mend the broken wheel or supply the spring that was wanting Has not the Desire of all nations been often sought of eyes that were never taught where to look for him mister Carleton was standing still by the guards looking thoughtfully out to windward to meet the fresh breeze as if the Spirit of the Wilderness were in it and could teach him the truth that the Spirit of the World knew not and had not to give when he became sensible of something close beside him and looking down met little Fleda s upturned face with such a look of purity freshness and peace it said as plainly as ever the dial plate of a clock that that little piece of machinery was working right There was a sunlight upon it too of happy confidence and affection mister Carleton s mind experienced a sudden revulsion Fleda might see the reflection of her own light in his face as he helped her up to a stand where she could be more on a level with him putting his arm round her to guard against any sudden roll of the ship What makes you wear such a happy face said he with an expression half envious half regretful I don t know said Fleda innocently You I suppose He looked as bright as she did for a minute Were you ever angry Elfie I don t know said Fleda I don t know but I have He smiled to see that although evidently her memory could not bring the charge her modesty would not deny it Were you not angry yesterday with your cousin and that unmannerly friend of his No said Fleda a shade crossing her face I was not angry And as she spoke her hand was softly put upon mister Carleton s as if partly in the fear of what might have grown out of his anger and partly in thankfulness to him that he had rendered it unnecessary There was a singular delicate timidity and tenderness in the action I wish I had your secret Elfie said mister Carleton looking wistfully into the clear eyes that met his What secret said Fleda smiling You say one can always do right is that the reason you are happy because you follow that out No said Fleda seriously But I think it is a great deal pleasanter I have no doubt at all of that neither I dare say have the rest of the world only somehow when it comes to the point they find it is easier to do wrong What s your secret Elfie I haven t any secret said Fleda But presently seeming to bethink herself she added gently and gravely Aunt Miriam says What She says that when we love Jesus Christ it is easy to please him And do you love him Elfie mister Carleton asked after a minute Her answer was a very quiet and sober Yes He doubted still whether she were not unconsciously using a form of speech the spirit of which she did not quite realize That one might not see and yet believe he could understand but for affection to go forth towards an unseen object was another matter His question was grave and acute By what do you judge that you do Elfie Why mister Carleton said Fleda with an instant look of appeal who else should I love If not him her eye and her voice made sufficiently plain mister Carleton was obliged to confess to himself that she spoke intelligently with deeper intelligence than he could follow He asked no more questions Yet truth shines by its own light like the sun He had not perfectly comprehended her answers but they struck him as something that deserved to be understood and he resolved to make the truth of them his own The rest of the voyage was perfectly quiet Following the earnest advice of his friend captain Beebee Thorn had given up trying to push mister Carleton to extremity who on his part did not seem conscious of Thorn s existence Chapter XIII There the most daintie paradise on ground Itselfe doth offer to his sober eye The painted flowres the trees upshooting hye The dales for shade the hills for breathing space The trembling groves the christall running by And that which all faire works doth most aggrace The art which all that wrought appeared in no place Faery Queene They had taken ship for London as mister and missus Carleton wished to visit home for a day or two before going on to Paris So leaving Charlton to carry news of them to the French capital so soon as he could persuade himself to leave the English one they with little Fleda in company posted down to Carleton in shire It was a time of great delight to Fleda that is as soon as mister Carleton had made her feel at home in England and somehow he had contrived to do that and to scatter some clouds of remembrance that seemed to gather about her before they had reached the end of their first day s journey To be out of the ship was itself a comfort and to be alone with kind friends was much more With great joy Fleda put her cousin Charlton and mister Thorn at once out of sight and out of mind and gave herself with even more than her usual happy readiness to everything the way and the end of the way had for her Those days were to be painted days in Fleda s memory She thought Carleton was a very odd place That is the house not the village which went by the same name If the manner of her two companions had not been such as to put her entirely at her ease she would have felt strange and shy As it was she felt half afraid of losing herself in the house to Fleda s unaccustomed eyes it was a labyrinth of halls and staircases set with the most unaccountable number and variety of rooms old and new quaint and comfortable gloomy and magnificent some with stern old fashioned massiveness of style and garniture others absolutely bewitching to Fleda s eyes and understanding in the rich beauty and luxuriousness of their arrangements mister Carleton s own particular haunts were of these his private room the little library as it was called the library and the music room which was indeed rather a gallery of fine arts so many treasures of art were gathered there To an older and nice judging person these rooms would have given no slight indications of their owner s mind it had been at work on every corner of them No particular fashion had been followed in anything nor any model consulted but that which fancy had built to the mind s order The wealth of years had drawn together an enormous assemblage of matters great and small every one of which was fitted either to excite fancy or suggest thought or to satisfy the eye by its nice adaptation And if pride had had the ordering of them all these might have been but a costly museum a literary alphabet that its possessor could not put together an ungainly confession of ignorance on the part of the intellect that could do nothing with this rich heap of material But pride was not the genius of the place A most refined taste and curious fastidiousness had arranged and harmonized all the heterogeneous items the mental hieroglyphics had been ordered by one to whom the reading of them was no mystery Nothing struck a stranger at first entering except the very rich effect and faultless air of the whole and perhaps the delicious facilities for every kind of intellectual cultivation which appeared on every hand facilities which it must be allowed do seem in general not to facilitate the work they are meant to speed In this case however it was different The mind that wanted them bad brought them together to satisfy its own craving These rooms were Guy s peculiar domain In other parts of the house where his mother reigned conjointly with him their joint tastes had struck out another style of adornment which might be called a style of superb elegance Not superb alone for taste had not permitted so heavy a characteristic to be predominant not merely elegant for the fineness of all the details would warrant an ampler word A larger part of the house than both these together had been left as generations past had left it in various stages of refinement comfort and comeliness It was a day or two before Fleda found out that it was all one she thought at first that it was a collection of several houses that had somehow inexplicably sat down there with their backs to each other it was so straggling and irregular a pile of building covering so much ground and looking so very unlike the different parts to each other One portion was quite old the other parts ranged variously between the present and the far past After she once understood this it was a piece of delicious wonderment and musing and great admiration to Fleda she never grew weary of wandering round it and thinking about it for from a child fanciful meditation was one of her delights Within doors she best liked mister Carleton s favourite rooms Their rich colouring and moderated light and endless stores of beauty and curiosity made them a place of fascination Out of doors she found still more to delight her Morning noon and night she might be seen near the house gazing taking in pictures of natural beauty which were for ever after to hang in Fleda s memory as standards of excellence in that sort Nature s hand had been very kind to the place moulding the ground in beautiful style Art had made happy use of the advantage thus given her and now what appeared was neither art nor nature but a perfection that can only spring from the hands of both Fleda s eyes were bewitched She stood watching the rolling slopes of green turf so soft and lovely and the magnificent trees that had kept their ground for ages and seen generations rise and fall before their growing strength and grandeur They were scattered here and there on the lawn and further back stood on the heights and stretched along the ridges of the undulating ground the outposts of a wood of the same growth still beyond them How do you like it Elfie mister Carleton asked her the evening of the first day as he saw her for a length of time looking out gravely and intently from before the hall door I think it is beautiful said Fleda The ground is a great deal smoother here than it was at home I ll take you to ride to morrow said he smiling and shew you rough ground enough As you did when we came from Montepoole raid Fleda rather eagerly Would you like that Yes very much if you would like it mister Carleton Very well said he So it shall be And not a day passed during their short stay that he did not give her one of those rides He shewed her rough ground according to his promise but Fleda still thought it did not look much like the mountains at home And indeed unsightly roughnesses had been skilfully covered or removed and though a large part of the park which was a very extensive one was wildly broken and had apparently been left as nature left it the hand of taste had been there and many an unsuspected touch instead of hindering had heightened both the wild and the beautiful character Landscape gardening had long been a great hobby of its owner How far does your ground come mister Carleton inquired Fleda on one of these rides when they had travelled a good distance from home Further than you can see Elfie Further than I can see It must be a very large farm This is not a farm where we are now said he did you mean that this is the park we are almost at the edge of it on this side What is the difference between a farm and a park said Fleda The grounds of a farm are tilled for profit a park is an uncultivated enclosure kept merely for men and women and deer to take pleasure in I have taken a good deal of pleasure in it said Fleda And have you a farm besides mister Carleton A good many Elfie Fleda looked surprised and then remarked that it must be very nice to have such a beautiful piece of ground just for pleasure She enjoyed it to the full during the few days she was there And one thing more the grand piano in the music room The first evening of their arrival she was drawn by the far off sounds and missus Carleton seeing it went immediately to the music room with her The room had no light except from the moonbeams that stole in through two glass doors which opened upon a particularly private and cherished part of the grounds in summer time full of flowers for in the very refinement of luxury delights had been crowded about this favourite apartment mister Carleton was at the instrument playing Fleda sat down quietly in one corner and listened in a rapture of pleasure she had hardly ever known from any like source She did not think it could be greater till after a time in a pause of the music missus Carleton asked her son to sing a particular ballad and that one was followed by two or three more Fleda left her corner she could not contain herself and favoured by the darkness came forward and stood quite near and if the performer bad bad light to see by he would have been gratified with the tribute paid to his power by the unfeigned tears that ran down her cheeks This pleasure was also repeated from evening to evening Do you know we set off for Paris to morrow said missus Carleton the last evening of their stay as Fleda came up to the door after a prolonged ramble in the park leaving mister Carleton with one or two gardeners at a little distance Yes said Fleda with a sigh that was more than half audible Are you sorry said missus Carleton smiling I cannot be glad said Fleda giving a sober look over the lawn Then you like Carleton Very much It is a prettier place than Queechy But we shall have you here again dear Fleda said missus Carleton restraining her smile at this to her very moderate complement Perhaps not said Fleda quietly mister Carleton said she added a minute after with more animation that a park was a place for men and women and deer to take pleasure in I am sure it is for children too Did you have a pleasant ride this morning O very I always do There isn t anything I like so well What as to ride on horseback with Guy said missus Carleton looking exceedingly benignant Yes unless Unless what my dear Fleda Unless perhaps I don t know I was going to say unless perhaps to hear him sing missus Carleton s delight was unequivocally expressed and she promised Fleda that she should have both rides and songs there in plenty another time a promise upon which Fleda built no trust at all The short journey to Pans was soon made The next morning missus Carleton making an excuse of her fatigue left Guy to end the care he had rather taken upon himself by delivering his little charge into the hands of her friends So they drove to the Hotel Rue where mister Rossitur had apartments in very handsome style The found him alone in the saloon Ha Carleton come back again Just in time very glad to see you And who is this Ah another little daughter for aunt Lucy mister Rossitur who gave them this greeting very cordially was rather a fine looking man decidedly agreeable both in person and manner Fleda was pleasantly disappointed after what her grandfather had led her to expect There might be something of sternness in his expression people gave him credit for a peremptory not to say imperious temper but if truly it could not often meet with opposition The sense and gentlemanly character which marked his face and bearing had an air of smooth politeness which seemed habitual There was no want of kindness nor even of tenderness in the way he drew Fleda within his arm and held her there while he went on talking to mister Carleton now and then stooping his face to look in at her bonnet and kiss her which was his only welcome He said nothing to her after his first question He was too busy talking to Guy He seemed to have a great deal to tell him There was this for him to see and that for him to hear and charming new things which had been done or doing since mister Carleton left Paris The impression upon Fleda s mind after listening awhile was that the French capital was a great Gallery of the Fine Arts with a magnified likeness of mister Carleton s music room at one end of it She thought her uncle must be most extraordinarily fond of pictures and works of art in general and must have a great love for seeing company and hearing people sing This latter taste Fleda was disposed to allow might be a very reasonable one mister Carleton she observed seemed much more cool on the whole subject But meanwhile where was aunt Lucy and had mister Rossitur forgotten the little armful that he held so fast and so perseveringly No for here was another kiss and another look into her face so kind that Fleda gave him a piece of her heart from that time Hugh said mister Rossitur suddenly to somebody she had not seen before Hugh here is your little cousin Take her off to your mother A child came forward at this bidding hardly larger than herself He was a slender graceful little figure with nothing of the boy in his face or manner delicate as a girl and with something almost melancholy in the gentle sweetness of his countenance Fleda s confidence was given to it on the instant which had not been the case with anything in her uncle and she yielded without reluctance the hand he took to obey his father s command Before two steps had been taken however she suddenly broke away from him and springing to mister Carleton s side silently laid her hand in his She made no answer whatever to a ligit word or two of kindness that he spoke just for her ear She listened with downcast eyes and a lip that he saw was too unsteady to be trusted and then after a moment more without looking pulled away her hand and followed her cousin Hugh did not once get a sight of her face on the way to his mother s room but owing to her exceeding efforts and quiet generalship he never guessed the cause There was nothing in her face to raise suspicion when he reached the door and opening it announced her with Mother here s cousin Fleda come Fleda had seen her aunt before though several years back and not long enough to get acquainted with her But no matter it was her mother s sister sitting there whose face gave her so lovely a welcome at that speech of Hugh s whose arms were stretched out so eagerly towards her and springing to them as to a very haven of rest Fleda wept on her bosom those delicious tears that are only shed where the heart is at home And even before they were dried the ties were knit that bound her to her new sphere Who came with you dear Fleda said missus Rossitur then Is missus Carleton here I must go and thank her for bringing you to me Mr Carleton is here said Hugh I must go and thank him then Jump down dear Fleda I ll be back in a minute Fleda got off her lap and stood looking in a kind of enchanted maze while her aunt hastily arranged her hair at the glass Looking while fancy and memory were making strong the net in which her heart was caught She was trying to see something of her mother in one who had shared her blood and her affection so nearly A miniature of that mother was left to Fleda and she had studied it till she could hardly persuade herself that she had not some recollection of the original and now she thought she caught a precious shadow of something like it in her aunt Lucy Not in those pretty bright eyes which had looked through kind tears so lovingly upon her but in the graceful ringlets about the temples the delicate contour of the face and a something Fleda could only have said it was a something about the mouth when at rest the shadow of her mother s image rejoiced her heart Rather that faint shadow of the loved lost one for little Fleda than any other form or combination of beauty on earth As she stood fascinated watching the movements of her aunt s light figure Fleda drew a long breath with which went off the whole burden of doubt and anxiety that had lain upon her mind ever since the journey began She had not known it was there but she felt it go Yet even when that sigh of relief was breathed and while fancy and feeling were weaving their rich embroidery into the very tissue of Fleda s happiness most persons would have seen merely that the child looked very sober and have thought probably that she felt very tired and strange Perhaps missus Rossitur thought so for again tenderly kissing her before she left the room she told Hugh to take off her things and make her feel at home Hugh upon this made Fleda sit down and proceeded to untie her tippet strings and take off her coat with an air of delicate tenderness which shewed he had great pleasure in his task and which made Fleda take a good deal of pleasure in it too Are you tired cousin Fleda said he gently No said Fleda O no Charlton said you were tired on board ship I wasn t tired said Fleda in not a little surprise I liked it very much Then maybe I mistook I know Charlton said he was tired and I thought he said you were too You know my brother Charlton don t you Yes Are you glad to come to Paris I am glad now said Fleda I wasn t glad before I am very glad said Hugh I think you will like it We didn t know you were coming till two or three days ago when Charlton got here Do you like to take walks Yes very much Father and mother will take us delightful walks in the Tuileries the gardens you know and the Champs Elysees and Versailles and the Boulevards and ever so many places and it will be a great deal pleasanter now you are here Do you know French No Then you ll have to learn I ll help you if you will let me It is very easy Did you get my last letter I don t know said Fleda the last one I had came with one of aunt Lucy s telling me about missus Carleton I got it just before Alas before what Fleda suddenly remembered and was stopped short From all the strange scenes and interests which lately had whirled her along her spirit leaped back with strong yearning recollection to her old home and her old ties and such a rain of tears witnessed the dearness of what she had lost and the tenderness of the memory that had let them slip for a moment that Hugh was as much distressed as startled With great tenderness and touching delicacy he tried to soothe her and at the same time though guessing to find out what was the matter lest he should make a mistake Just before what said he laying his hand caressingly on his little cousin s shoulder Don t grieve so dear Fleda It was only just before grandpa died said Fleda Hugh had known of that before though like her he had forgotten it for a moment A little while his feeling was too strong to permit any further attempt at condolence but as he saw Fleda grow quiet he took courage to speak again Was he a good man he asked softly Oh yes Then said Hugh you know he is happy now Fleda If he loved Jesus Christ he is gone to be with him That ought to make you glad as well as sorry Fleda looked up though tears were streaming yet to give that full happy answer of the eye that no words could do This was consolation and sympathy The two children had a perfect understanding of each other from that time forward a fellowship that never knew a break nor a weakening missus Rossitur found on her return that Hugh had obeyed her charge to the letter He had made Fleda feel at home They were sitting close together Hugh s hand affectionately clasping hers and he was holding forth on some subject with a gracious politeness that many of his elders might have copied while Fleda listened and assented with entire satisfaction The rest of the morning she passed in her aunt s arms drinking draughts of pleasure from those dear bright eyes taking in the balm of gentlest words of love and soft kisses every one of which was felt at the bottom of Fleda s heart and the pleasure of talking over her young sorrows with one who could feel them all and answer with tears as well as words of sympathy And Hugh stood by the while looking at his little orphan cousin as if she might have dropped from the clouds into his mother s lap a rare jewel or delicate flower but much more delicate and precious than they or any other possible gift Hugh and Fleda dined alone For as he informed her his father never would have children at the dinner table when he had company and mister and missus Carleton and other people were to be there to day Fleda made no remark on the subject by word or look but she thought none the less She thought it was a very mean fashion She not come to the table when strangers were there And who would enjoy them more When mister Rossitur and mister Carleton had dined with her grandfather had she not taken as much pleasure in their society and in the whole thing as any other one of the party And at Carleton had she not several times dined with a tableful and been unspeakably amused to watch the different manners and characteristics of people who were strange to her However mister Rossitur had other notions So she and Hugh had their dinner in aunt Lucy s dressing room by themselves and a very nice dinner it was Fleda thought and Rosaline missus Rossitur s French maid was well affected and took admirable care of them Indeed before the close of the day Rosaline privately informed her mistress qu elle serait entetee surement de cet enfant dans trois jours and que son regard vraiment lui serrait le coeur And Hugh was excellent company failing all other and did the honours of the table with the utmost thoughtfulness and amused Fleda the whole time with accounts of Paris and what they would do and what she should see and how his sister Marion was at school at a convent and what kind of a place a convent was and how he himself always staid at home and learned of his mother and his father or by himself he said just as it happened and he hoped they would keep Fleda at home too So Fleda hoped exceedingly but this stern rule about the dining had made her feel a little shy of her uncle she thought perhaps he was not kind and indulgent to children like her aunt Lucy and if he said she must go to a convent she would not dare to ask him to let her stay The next time she saw him however she was obliged to change her opinion again in part for he was very kind and indulgent both to her and Hugh and more than that he was very amusing He shewed her pictures and told her new and interesting things and finding that she listened eagerly he seemed pleased to prolong her pleasure even at the expense of a good deal of his own time mister Rossitur was a man of cultivated mind and very refined and fastidious taste He lived for the pleasures of Art and Literature and the society where these are valued For this and not without some secret love of display he lived in Paris not extravagant in his pleasures nor silly in his ostentation but leading like a gentleman as worthy and rational a life as a man can lead who lives only to himself with no further thought than to enjoy the passing hours mister Rossitur enjoyed them elegantly and for a man of the world moderately bestowing however few of those precious hours upon his children It was his maxim that they should be kept out of the way whenever their presence might by any chance interfere with the amusements of their elders and this maxim a good one certainly in some hands was in his reading of it a very broad one Still when he did take time to give his family he was a delightful companion to those of them who could understand him If they shewed no taste for sensible pleasure he had no patience with them nor desire of their company Report had done him no wrong in giving him a stern temper but this almost never came out in actual exercise Fleda knew it only from an occasional hint now and then and by her childish intuitive reading of the lines it had drawn round the mouth and brow It had no disagreeable bearing on his everyday life and manner and the quiet fact probably served but to heighten the love and reverence in which his family held him very high mister Rossitur did once moot the question whether Fleda should not join Marion at her convent But his wife looked very grave and said that she was too tender and delicate a little thing to be trusted to the hands of strangers Hugh pleaded and argued that she might share all his lessons and Fleda s own face pleaded more powerfully There was something appealing in its extreme delicacy and purity which seemed to call for shelter and protection from every rough breath of the world and mister Rossitur was easily persuaded to let her remain in the stronghold of home Hugh had never quitted it Neither father nor mother ever thought of such a thing He was the cherished idol of the whole family Always a delicate child always blameless in life and behaviour his loveliness of mind and person his affectionateness the winning sweetness that was about him like a halo and the slight tenure by which they seemed to hold him had wrought to bind the hearts of father and mother to this child as it were with the very life strings of both Not his mother was more gentle with Hugh than his much sterner father And now little Fleda sharing somewhat of Hugh s peculiar claims upon their tenderness and adding another of her own was admitted not to the same place in their hearts that could not be but to their honour be it spoken to the same place in all outward shew of thought and feeling Hugh had nothing that Fleda did not have even to the time care and caresses of his parents And not Hugh rendered them a more faithful return of devoted affection Illustration The children were always together Once made easy on the question of school which was never seriously stirred again Fleda s life became very happy It was easy to make her happy affection and sympathy would have done it almost anywhere but in Paris she had much more and after time had softened the sorrow she brought with her no bird ever found existence less of a burden nor sang more light heartedly along its life In her aunt she had all but the name of a mother in her uncle with kindness and affection she had amusement interest and improvement in Hugh everything love confidence sympathy society help their tastes opinions pursuits went hand in hand The two children were always together Fleda s spirits were brighter than Hugh s and her intellectual tastes stronger and more universal That might be as much from difference of physical as of mental constitution Hugh s temperament led him somewhat to melancholy and to those studies and pleasures which best side with subdued feeling and delicate nerves Fleda s nervous system was of the finest too but in short she was as like a bird as possible Perfect health which yet a slight thing was enough to shake to the foundation joyous spirits which a look could quell happy energies which a harsh hand might easily crush for ever Well for little Fleda that so tender a plant was permitted to unfold in so nicely tempered an atmosphere A cold wind would soon have killed it Besides all this there were charming studies to be gone through every day with Hugh some for aunt Lucy to hear some for masters and mistresses There were amusing walks in the Boulevards and delicious pleasure taking in the gardens of Paris and a new world of people and manners and things and histories for the little American And despite her early rustic experience Fleda had from nature an indefeasible taste for the elegancies of life it suited her well to see all about her in dress in furniture in various appliances as commodious and tasteful as wealth and refinement could contrive it and she very soon knew what was right in each kind There were now and then most gleeful excursions in the environs of Paris when she and Hugh found in earth and air a world of delights more than they could tell anybody but each other And at home what peaceful times they two had what endless conversations discussions schemes air journeys of memory and fancy backward and forward what sociable dinners alone and delightful evenings with mister and missus Rossitur in the saloon when nobody or only a very few people were there how pleasantly in those evenings the foundations were laid of a strong and enduring love for the works of art painted sculptured or engraven what a multitude of curious and excellent bits of knowledge Fleda s ears picked up from the talk of different people They were capital ears what they caught they never let fall In the course of the year her gleanings amounted to more than many another person s harvest Chapter XIV Heav n bless thee Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look d on Shakspeare One of the greatest of Fleda s pleasures was when mister Carleton came to take her out with him He did that often Fleda only wished he would have taken Hugh too but somehow he never did Nothing but that was wanting to make the pleasure of those times perfect Knowing that she saw the common things in other company Guy was at the pains to vary the amusement when she went with him Instead of going to Versailles or saint Cloud he would take her long delightful drives into the country and shew her some old or interesting place that nobody else went to see Often there was a history belonging to the spot which Fleda listened to with the delight of eye and fancy at once In the city where they more frequently walked still he shewed her what she would perhaps have seen under no other guidance He made it his business to give her pleasure and understanding the inquisitive active little spirit he had to do with he went where his own tastes would hardly have led him The Quai aux Fleurs was often visited but also the Halle aux Bles the great Halle aux Vins the Jardin des Plantes and the Marche des Innocens Guy even took the trouble more for her sake than his own to go to the latter place once very early in the morning when the market bell had not two hours sounded while the interest and prettiness of the scene were yet in their full life Hugh was in company this time and the delight of both children was beyond words as it would have been beyond anybody s patience that had not a strong motive to back it They never discovered that mister Carleton was in a hurry as indeed he was not They bargained for fruit with any number of people upon all sorts of inducements and to an extent of which they had no competent notion but Hugh had his mother s purse and Fleda was skilfully commissioned to purchase what she pleased for missus Carleton Verily the two children that morning bought pleasure not peaches Fancy and Benevolence held the purse strings and Economy did not even look on They revelled too Fleda especially amidst the bright pictures of the odd the new and the picturesque and the varieties of character and incident that were displayed around them even till the country people began to go away and the scene to lose its charm It never lost it in memory and many a time in after life Hugh and Fleda recurred to something that was seen or done that morning when we bought fruit at the Innocens Besides these scenes of everyday life which interested and amused Fleda to the last degree mister Carleton shewed her many an obscure part of Paris where deeds of daring and of blood had been and thrilled the little listener s ear with histories of the Past He judged her rightly She would rather at any time have gone to walk with him than with anybody else to see any show that could be devised His object in all this was in the first place to give her pleasure and in the second place to draw out her mind into free communion with his own which he knew could only be done by talking sense to her He succeeded as he wished Lost in the interest of the scenes he presented to her eye and mind she forgot everything else and shewed him herself precisely what he wanted to see It was strange that a young man an admired man of fashion a flattered favourite of the gay and great world and furthermore a reserved and proud repeller of almost all who sought his intimacy should seek and delight in the society of a little child His mother would have wondered if she had known it missus Rossitur did marvel that even Fleda should have so won upon the cold and haughty young Englishman and her husband said he probably chose to have Fleda with him because he could make up his mind to like nobody else A remark which perhaps arose from the utter failure of every attempt to draw him and Charlton nearer together But mister Rossitur was only half right The reason lay deeper mister Carleton had admitted the truth of Christianity upon what he considered sufficient grounds and would now have steadily fought for it as he would for anything else that he believed to be truth But there he stopped He had not discovered nor tried to discover whether the truth of Christianity imposed any obligation upon him He had cast off his unbelief and looked upon it now as a singular folly But his belief was almost as vague and as fruitless as his infidelity had been Perhaps a little his bitter dissatisfaction with the world and human things or rather his despondent view of them was mitigated If there was as he now held a Supreme Orderer of events it might be and it was rational to suppose there would be in the issues of time an entire change wrought in the disordered and dishonoured state of his handiwork There might be a remedial system somewhere nay it might be in the Bible he meant to look some day But that he had anything to do with that change that the working of the remedial system called for hands that his had any charge in the matter had never entered into his imagination or stirred his conscience He was living his old life at Paris with his old dissatisfaction perhaps a trifle less bitter He was seeking pleasure in whatever art learning literature refinement and luxury can do for a man who has them all at command but there was something within him that spurned this ignoble existence and called for higher aims and worthier exertion He was not vicious he never had been vicious or as somebody else said his vices were all refined vices but a life of mere self indulgence although pursued without self satisfaction is constantly lowering the standard and weakening the forces of virtue lessening the whole man He felt it so and to leave his ordinary scenes and occupations and lose a morning with little Fleda was a freshening of his better nature it was like breathing pure air after the fever heat of a sick room it was like hearing the birds sing after the meaningless jabber of Bedlam mister Carleton indeed did not put the matter quite so strongly to himself He called Fleda his good angel He did not exactly know that the office this good angel performed was simply to hold a candle to his conscience For conscience was not by any means dead in him it only wanted light to see by When he turned from the gay and corrupt world in which he lived where the changes were rung incessantly upon self interest falsehood pride and the various more or less refined forms of sensuality and when he looked upon that pure bright little face so free from selfishness those clear eyes so innocent of evil the peaceful brow under which a thought of double dealing had never hid mister Carleton felt himself in a healthier region Here as elsewhere he honoured and loved the image of truth in the broad sense of truth that which suits the perfect standard of right But his pleasure in this case was invariably mixed with a slight feeling of self reproach and it was this hardly recognised stir of his better nature this clearing of his mental eye sight under the light of a bright example that made him call the little torch bearer his good angel If this were truth this purity uprightness and singleness of mind as conscience said it was where was he how far wandering from his beloved Idol One other feeling saddened the pleasure he had in her society a belief that the ground of it could not last If she could grow up so he said to himself But it is impossible A very few years and all that clear sunshine of the mind will be overcast there is not a cloud now Under the working of these thoughts mister Carleton sometimes forgot to talk to his little charge and would walk for a length of way by her side wrapped up in sombre musings Fleda never disturbed him then but waited contentedly and patiently for him to come out of them with her old feeling wondering what he could be thinking of and wishing he were as happy as she But he never left her very long he was sure to waive his own humour and give her all the graceful kind attention which nobody else could bestow so well Nobody understood and appreciated it better than Fleda One day some months after they had been in Paris they were sitting in the Place de la Concorde mister Carleton was in one of these thinking fits He had been giving Fleda a long detail of the scenes that had taken place in that spot a history of it from the time when it had lain an unsightly waste such a graphic lively account as he knew well how to give The absorbed interest with which she had lost everything else in what he was saying had given him at once reward and motive enough as he went on Standing by his side with one little hand confidingly resting on his knee she gazed alternately into his face and towards the broad highly adorned square by the side of which they had placed themselves and where it was hard to realize that the ground had once been soaked in blood while madness and death filled the air and her changing face like a mirror gave him back the reflection of the times he held up to her view And still standing there in the same attitude after he had done she had been looking out towards the square in a fit of deep meditation mister Carleton had forgotten her for awhile in his own thoughts and then the sight of the little gloved hand upon his knee brought him back again What are you musing about Elfie dear he said cheerfully taking the hand in one of his Fleda gave a swift glance into his face as if to see whether it would be safe for her to answer his question a kind of exploring look in which her eyes often acted as scouts for her tongue Those she met pledged their faith for her security yet Fleda s look went back to the square and then again to his face in silence How do you like living in Paris said he You should know by this time I like it very much indeed said Fleda I thought you would I like Queechy better though she went on gravely her eyes turning again to the square Like Queechy better Were you thinking of Queechy just now when I spoke to you Oh no with a smile Were you going over all those horrors I have been distressing you with No said Fleda I was thinking of them awhile ago What then said he pleasantly You were looking so sober I should like to know how near your thoughts were to mine I was thinking said Fleda gravely and a little unwillingly but Guy s manner was not to be withstood I was wishing I could be like the disciple whom Jesus loved mister Carleton let her see none of the surprise he felt at this answer Was there one more loved than the rest Yes the Bible calls him the disciple whom Jesus loved That was John Why was he preferred above the others I don t know I suppose he was more gentle and good than the others and loved Jesus more I think aunt Miriam said so when I asked her once mister Carleton thought Fleda had not far to seek for the fulfilment of her wish But how in the world Elfie did you work round to this gentle and good disciple from those scenes of blood you set out with Why said Elfie I was thinking how unhappy and bad people are especially people here I think and how much must be done before they will all be brought right and then I was thinking of the work Jesus gave his disciples to do and so I wished I could be like that disciple Hugh and I were talking about it this morning What is the work he gave them to do said mister Carleton more and more interested Why said Fleda lifting her gentle wistful eyes to his and then looking away to bring everybody to be good and happy And how in the world are they to do that said mister Carleton astonished to see his own problem quietly handled by this child By telling them about Jesus Christ and getting them to believe and love him said Fleda glancing at him again and living so beautifully that people cannot help believing them That last is an important clause said mister Carleton thoughtfully But suppose people will not hear when they are spoken to Elfie Some will at any rate said Fleda and by and by everybody will How do you know Because the Bible says so Are you sure of that Elfie Why yes mister Carleton God has promised that the world shall be full of good people and then they will be all happy I wish it was now But if that be so Elfie God can make them all good without our help Yes but I suppose he chooses to do it with our help mister Carleton said Fleda with equal naivete and gravity But is not this you speak of said he half smiling rather the business of clergymen you have nothing to do with it No said Fleda everybody has something to do with it the Bible says so ministers must do it in their way and other people in other ways everybody has his own work Don t you remember the parable of the ten talents mister Carleton mister Carleton was silent for a minute I do not know the Bible quite as well as you do Elfie he said then nor as I ought to do Elfie s only answer was by a look somewhat like that he well remembered on shipboard he had thought was angel like a look of gentle sorrowful wistfulness which she did not venture to put into words It had not for that the less power But he did not choose to prolong the conversation They rose up and began to walk homeward Elfie thinking with all the warmth of her little heart that she wished very much mister Carleton knew the Bible better divided between him and that disciple whom she and Hugh had been talking about I suppose you are very busy now Elfie observed her companion when they had walked the length of several squares in silence O yes said Fleda Hugh and I are as busy as we can be We are busy every minute Except when you are on some chase after pleasure Well said Fleda laughing that is a kind of business and all the business is pleasure too I didn t mean that we were always busy about work O mister Carleton we had such a nice time the day before yesterday And she went on to give him the history of a very successful chase after pleasure which they had made to saint Cloud And yet you like Queechy better Yes said Fleda with a gentle steadiness peculiar to herself if I had aunt Lucy and Hugh and uncle Rolf there and everybody that I care for I should like it a great deal better Unspotted yet he thought mister Carleton said Fleda presently do you play and sing every day here in Paris Yes said he smiling about every day Why I was thinking how pleasant it was at your house in England Has Carleton the honour of rivalling Queechy in your liking I haven t lived there so long you know said Fleda I dare say it would if I had I think it is quite as pretty a place mister Carleton smiled with a very pleased expression Truth and politeness had joined hands in her answer with a child s grace He brought Fleda to her own door and there was leaving her Stop O mister Carleton cried Fleda come in just for one minute I want to shew you something He made no resistance to that She led him to the saloon where it happened that nobody was and repeating One minute rushed out of the room In less than that time she came running back with a beautiful half blown bud of a monthly rose in her hand and in her face such a bloom of pleasure and eagerness as more than rivalled it The rose was fairly eclipsed She put the bud quietly but with a most satisfied air of affection into mister Carleton s hand It had come from a little tree which he had given her on one of their first visits to the Quai aux Fleurs She had had the choice of what she liked best and had characteristically taken a flourishing little rose bush that as yet shewed nothing but leaves and green buds partly because she would have the pleasure of seeing its beauties come forward and partly because she thought having no flowers it would not cost much The former reason however was all that she had given to mister Carleton s remonstrances What is all this Elfie said he Have you been robbing your rose tree No said Elfie there are plenty more buds Isn t it lovely This is the first one They ve been a great while coming out His eye went from the rose to her he thought the one was a mere emblem of the other Fleda was usually very quiet in her demonstrations it was as if a little green bud had suddenly burst into a flush of loveliness and he saw it was as plain as possible that good will to him had been the moving power He was so much struck and moved that his thanks though as usual perfect in their kind were far shorter and graver than he would have given if he had felt less He turned away from the house his mind full of the bright unsullied purity and single hearted good will that had looked out of that beaming little face he seemed to see them again in the flower held in his hand and he saw nothing else as he went mister Carleton preached to himself all the way home and his text was a rose Laugh who will To many it may seem ridiculous and to most minds it would have been impossible but to a nature very finely wrought and highly trained many a voice that grosser senses cannot hear comes with an utterance as clear as it is sweet spoken many a touch that coarser nerves cannot heed reaches the springs of the deeper life many a truth that duller eyes have no skill to see shews its fair features hid away among the petals of a rose or peering out between the wings of a butterfly or reflected in a bright drop of dew The material is but a veil for the spiritual but then eyes must be quickened or the veil becomes an impassable cloud That particular rose was to mister Carleton s eye a most perfect emblem and representative of its little giver He traced out the points of resemblance as he went along The delicacy and character of refinement for which that kind of rose is remarkable above many of its more superb kindred a refinement essential and unalterable by decay or otherwise as true a characteristic of the child as of the flower a delicacy that called for gentle handling and tender cherishing the sweetness rare indeed but asserting itself as it were timidly at least with equally rare modesty the very style of the beauty that with all its loveliness would not startle nor even catch the eye among its more showy neighbours and the breath of purity that seemed to own no kindred with earth nor liability to infection As he went on with his musing and drawing out this fair character from the type before him the feeling of contrast that he had known before pressed upon mister Carleton s mind the feeling of self reproach and the bitter wish that he could be again what he once had been something like this How changed now he seemed to himself not a point of likeness left How much less honourable how much less worth how much less dignified than that fair innocent child How much better a part she was acting in life what an influence she was exerting as pure as sweet breathed and as unobtrusive as the very rose in his hand And he doing no good to an earthly creature and losing himself by inches He reached his room put the flower in a glass on the table and walked up and down before it It had come to a struggle between the sense of what was and the passionate wish for what might have been It is late sir said his servant opening the door and you were I am not going out This evening sir No not at all to day Spenser I don t wish to see any body let no one come near me The servant retired and Guy went on with his walk and his meditations looking back over his life and reviewing with a wiser ken now the steps by which he had come He compared the selfish disgust with which he had cast off the world with the very different spirit of little Fleda s look upon it that morning the useless self pleasing vain life he was leading with her wish to be like the beloved disciple and do something to heal the troubles of those less happy than herself He did not very well comprehend the grounds of her feeling or reasoning but he began to see mistily that his own had been mistaken and wild His steps grew slower his eye more intent his brow quiet She is right and I am wrong he thought She is by far the nobler creature worth many such as I Like her I cannot be I cannot regain what I have lost I cannot undo what years have done But I can be something other than I am If there be a system of remedy as there well may it may as well take effect on myself first She says everybody has his work I believe her It must in the nature of things be so I will make it my business to find out what mine is and when I have made that sure I will give myself to the doing of it An Allwise Governor must look for service of me He shall have it Whatever my life be it shall be to some end If not what I would what I can If not the purity of the rose that of tempered steel mister Carleton walked his room for three hours then rung for his servant and ordered him to prepare everything for leaving Paris the second day thereafter The next morning over their coffee he told his mother of his purpose Leave Paris To morrow My dear Guy that is rather a sudden notice No mother for I am going alone His mother immediately bent an anxious and somewhat terrified look upon him The frank smile she met put half her suspicions out of her head at once What is the matter Nothing at all if by matter you mean mischief You are not in difficulty with those young men again No mother said he coolly I am in difficulty with no one but myself With yourself But why will you not let me go with you My business will go on better if I am quite alone What business Only to settle this question with myself said he smiling But Guy you are enigmatical this morning Is it the question that of all others I wish to see settled No mother said he laughing and colouring a little I don t want another half to take care of till I have this one under management I don t understand you said missus Carleton There is no hidden reason under all this that you are keeping from me I won t say that But there is none that need give you the least uneasiness There are one or two matters I want to study out I cannot do it here so I am going where I shall be free Where I think I shall pass the summer between Switzerland and Germany And when and where shall I meet you again I think at home I cannot say when At home said his mother with a brightening face Then you are beginning to be tired of wandering at last Not precisely mother rather out of humour I shall be glad of anything said his mother gazing at him admiringly that brings you home again Guy Bring me home a better man I hope mother said he kissing her as he left the room I will see you again by and by A better man thought missus Carleton as she sat with full eyes the image of her son filling the place where his presence had been I would be willing never to see him better and be sure of his never being worse mister Carleton s farewell visit found mister and missus Rossitur not at home They had driven out early into the country to fetch Marion from her convent for some holiday Fleda came alone into the saloon to receive him I have your rose in safe keeping Elfie he said It has done me more good than ever a rose did before Fleda smiled an innocently pleased smile But her look changed when he added I have come to tell you so and to bid you good bye Are you going away mister Carleton Yes But you will be back soon No Elfie I do not know that I shall ever come back He spoke gravely more gravely than he was used and Fleda s acuteness saw that there was some solid reason for this sudden determination Her face changed sadly but she was silent her eyes never wavering from those that read hers with such gentle intelligence You will be satisfied to have me go Elfie when I tell you that I am going on business which I believe to be duty Nothing else takes me away I am going to try to do right said he smiling Elfie could not answer the smile She wanted to ask whether she should never see him again and there was another thought upon her tongue too but her lip trembled and she said nothing I shall miss my good fairy mister Carleton went on lightly I don t know how I shall do without her If your wand was long enough to reach so far I would ask you to touch me now and then Elfie Poor Elfie could not stand it Her head sank She knew she had a wand that could touch him and well and gratefully she resolved that its light blessing should now and then rest on his head but he did not understand that he was talking whether lightly or seriously and Elfie knew it was a little of both he was talking of wanting her help and was ignorant of the help that alone could avail him Oh that he knew but that What with this feeling and sorrow together the child s distress was exceeding great and the tokens of grief in one so accustomed to hide them were the more painful to see mister Carleton drew the sorrowing little creature within his arm and endeavoured with a mixture of kindness and lightness in his tone to cheer her I shall often remember you dear Elfie he said I shall keep your rose always and take it with me wherever I go You must not make it too hard for me to quit Paris you are glad to have me go on such an errand are you not She presently commanded herself bade her tears wait till another time as usual and trying to get rid of those that covered her face asked him What errand He hesitated I have been thinking of what we were talking of yesterday Elfie he said at length I am going to try to discover my duty and then to do it But Fleda at that clasped his hand and squeezing it in both hers bent down her little head over it to hide her face and the tears that streamed again He hardly knew how to understand or what to say to her He half suspected that there were depths in that childish mind beyond his fathoming He was not however left to wait long Fleda though she might now and then be surprised into shewing it never allowed her sorrow of any kind to press upon the notice or the time of others She again checked herself and dried her face There is nobody else in Paris that will be so sorry for my leaving it said mister Carleton half tenderly and half pleasantly There is nobody else that has so much cause said Elfie near bursting out again but she restrained herself And you will not come here again mister Carleton she said after a few minutes I do not say that it is possible if I do it will be to see you Elfie A shadow of a smile passed over her face at that It was gone instantly My mother will not leave Paris yet he went on you will see her often But he saw that Fleda was thinking of something else she scarce seemed to hear him She was thinking of something that troubled her mister Carleton she began and her colour changed Speak Elfie Her colour changed again mister Carleton will you be displeased if I say something Don t you know me better than to ask me that Elfie he said gently I want to ask you something if you won t mind my saying it What is it said he reading in her face that a request was behind I will do it Her eyes sparkled but she seemed to have some difficulty in going on I will do it whatever it is he said watching her Will you wait for one moment mister Carleton Half an hour She sprang away her face absolutely flashing pleasure through her tears It was much soberer and again doubtful and changing colour when a few minutes afterwards she came back with a book in her hand With a striking mixture of timidity modesty and eagerness in her countenance she came forward and putting the little volume which was her own Bible into mister Carleton s hands said under her breath Please read it She did not venture to look up He saw what the book was and then taking the gentle hand which had given it he kissed it two or three times If it had been a princess s he could not with more respect You have my promise Elfie he said I need not repeat it She raised her eyes and gave him a look so grateful so loving so happy that it dwelt for ever in his remembrance A moment after it had faded and she stood still where he had left her listening to his footsteps as they went down the stairs She heard the last of them and then sank upon her knees by a chair and burst into a passion of tears Their time was now and she let them come It was not only the losing a loved and pleasant friend it was not only the stirring of sudden and disagreeable excitement poor Elfie was crying for her Bible It had been her father s own it was filled with his marks it was precious to her above price and Elfie cried with all her heart for the loss of it She had done what she had on the spur of the emergency she was satisfied she had done right she would not take it back if she could but not the less her Bible was gone and the pages that loved eyes had looked upon were for hers to look upon no more Her very heart was wrung that she should have parted with it and yet what could she do It was as bad as the parting with mister Carleton That agony was over and even that was shortened for Hugh would find out that she had been crying Hours had passed and the tears were dried and the little face was bending over the wonted tasks with a shadow upon its wonted cheerfulness when Rosaline came to tell her that Victor said there was somebody in the passage who wanted to see her and would not come in It was mister Carleton himself He gave her a parcel smiled at her without saying a word kissed her hand earnestly and was gone again Fleda ran to her own room and took the wrappers off such a beauty of a Bible as she had never seen bound in blue velvet with clasps of gold and her initials in letters of gold upon the cover Fleda hardly knew whether to be most pleased or sorry for to have its place so supplied seemed to put her lost treasure further away than ever The result was another flood of very tender tears in the very shedding of which however the new little Bible was bound to her heart with cords of association as bright and as incorruptible as its gold mountings Chapter XV Her sports were such as carried riches of knowledge upon the stream of light Sidney Fleda had not been a year in Paris when her uncle suddenly made up his mind to quit it and go home Some trouble in money affairs felt or feared brought him to this step which a month before he had no definite purpose of ever taking There was cloudy weather in the financial world of New York and he wisely judged it best that his own eyes should be on the spot to see to his own interests Nobody was sorry for this determination missus Rossitur always liked what her husband liked but she had at the same time a decided predilection for home Marion was glad to leave her convent for the gay world which her parents promised she should immediately enter And Hugh and Fleda had too lively a spring of happiness within themselves to care where its outgoings should be So home they came in good mood bringing with them all manner of Parisian delights that Paris could part with Furniture that at home at least they might forget where they were dresses that at home or abroad nobody might forget where they had been pictures and statuary and engravings and books to satisfy a taste really strong and well cultivated And indeed the other items were quite as much for this purpose as for any other A French cook for mister Rossitur and even Rosaline for his wife who declared she was worth all the rest of Paris Hugh cared little for any of these things he brought home a treasure of books and a flute to which he was devoted Fleda cared for them all even Monsieur Emile and Rosaline for her uncle s and aunt s sake but her special joy was a beautiful little King Charles which had been sent her by mister Carleton a few weeks before It came with the kindest of letters saying that some matters had made it inexpedient for him to pass through Paris on his way home but that he hoped nevertheless to see her soon That intimation was the only thing that made Fleda sorry to leave Paris The little dog was a beauty allowed to be so not only by his mistress but by every one else of the true black and tan colours and Fleda s dearly loved and constant companion The life she and Hugh led was little changed by the change of place They went out and came in as they had done in Paris and took the same quiet but intense happiness in the same quiet occupations and pleasures only the Tuileries and Champs Elysees had a miserable substitute in the Battery and no substitute at all anywhere else And the pleasant drives in the environs of Paris were missed too and had nothing in New York to supply their place missus Rossitur always said it was impossible to get out of New York by land and not worth the trouble to do it by water But then in the house Fleda thought there was a great gain The dirty Parisian Hotel was well exchanged for the bright clean well appointed house in State street And if Broadway was disagreeable and the Park a weariness to the eyes after the dressed gardens of the French capital Hugh and Fleda made it up in the delights of the luxuriously furnished library and the dear at home feeling of having the whole house their own They were left those two children quite as much to themselves as ever Marion was going into company and she and her mother were swallowed up in the consequent necessary calls upon their time Marion never had been anything to Fleda She was a fine handsome girl outwardly but seemed to have more of her father than her mother in her composition though colder natured and more wrapped up in self than mister Rossitur would be called by anybody that knew him She had never done anything to draw Fleda towards her and even Hugh had very little of her attention They did not miss it They were everything to each other Everything for now morning and night there was a sort of whirlwind in the house which carried the mother and daughter round and round and permitted no rest and mister Rossitur himself was drawn in It was worse than it had been in Paris There with Marion in her convent there were often evenings when they did not go abroad nor receive company and spent the time quietly and happily in each other s society No such evenings now if by chance there were an unoccupied one missus Rossitur and her daughter were sure to be tired and mister Rossitur busy Hugh and Fleda in those bustling times retreated to the library mister Rossitur would rarely have that invaded and while the net was so eagerly cast for pleasure among the gay company below pleasure had often slipped away and hid herself among the things on the library table and was dancing on every page of Hugh s book and minding each stroke of Fleda s pencil and cocking the spaniel s ears whenever his mistress looked at him King the spaniel lay on a silk cushion on the library table his nose just touching Fleda s fingers Fleda s drawing was mere amusement she and Hugh were not so burthened with studies that they had not always their evenings free and to tell truth much more than their evenings Masters indeed they had but the heads of the house were busy with the interests of their grown up child and perhaps with other interests and took it for granted that all was going right with the young ones Haven t we a great deal better time than they have down stairs Fleda said Hugh one of these evenings Hum yes answered Fleda abstractedly stroking into order some old man in her drawing with great intentness King you rascal keep back and be quiet sir Nothing could be conceived more gentle and loving than Fleda s tone of fault finding and her repulse only fell short of a caress What s he doing Wants to get into my lap Why don t you let him Because I don t choose to a silk cushion is good enough for his majesty King laying her soft cheek against the little dog s soft head and forsaking her drawing for the purpose How you do love that dog said Hugh Very well why shouldn t I provided he steals no love from anybody else said Fleda still caressing him What a noise somebody is making down stairs said Hugh I don t think I should ever want to go to large parties Fleda do you I don t know said Fleda whose natural taste for society was strongly developed it would depend upon what kind of parties they were I shouldn t like them I know of whatever kind said Hugh What are you smiling at Only mister Pickwick s face that I am drawing here Hugh came round to look and laugh and then began again I can t think of anything pleasanter than this room as we are now You should have seen mister Carleton s library said Fleda in a musing tone going on with her drawing Was it so much better than this Fleda s eyes gave a slight glance at the room and then looked down again with a little shake of her head sufficiently expressive Well said Hugh you and I do not want any better than this do we Fleda Fleda s smile a most satisfactory one was divided between him and King I don t believe said Hugh you would have loved that dog near so well if anybody else had given him to you I don t believe I should not a quarter said Fleda with sufficient distinctness I never liked that mister Carleton as well as you did That is because you did not know him said Fleda quietly Do you think he was a good man Fleda He was very good to me said Fleda always What rides I did have on that great black horse of his A black horse Yes a great black horse strong but so gentle and he went so delightfully His name was Harold Oh I should like to see that horse When I wasn t with him mister Carleton used to ride another the greatest beauty of a horse Hugh a brown Arabian so slender and delicate her name was Zephyr ind she used to go like the wind to be sure mister Carleton said he wouldn t trust me on such a fly away thing But you didn t use to ride alone said Hugh Oh no and I wouldn t have been afraid if he had chosen to take me on any one But do you think Fleda he was a good man as I mean I am sure he was better than a great many others answered Fleda evasively the worst of him was infinitely better than the best of half the people down stairs mister Sweden included Sweden you don t call his name right The worse it is called the better in my opinion said Fleda Well I don t like him but what makes you dislike him so much I don t know partly because uncle Rolf and Marion like him so much I believe I don t think there is any moral expression in his face I wonder why they like him said Hugh It was a somewhat irregular and desultory education that the two children gathered under this system of things The masters they had were rather for accomplishments and languages than for anything solid the rest they worked out for themselves Fortunately they both loved books and rational books and hours and hours when missus Rossitur and her daughter were paying or receiving visits they always together were stowed away behind the book cases or in the library window poring patiently over pages of various complexion the soft turning of the leaves or Fleda s frequent attentions to King the only sound in the room They walked together talking of what they had read though indeed they ranged beyond that into nameless and numberless fields of speculation where if they sometimes found fruit they as often lost their way However the habit of ranging was something Then when they joined the rest of the family at the dinner table especially if others were present and most especially if a certain German gentleman happened to be there who the second winter after their return Fleda thought came very often she and Hugh would be sure to find the strange talk of the world that was going on unsuited and wearisome to them and they would make their escape up stairs again to handle the pencil and to play the flute and to read and to draw plans for the future while King crept upon the skirts of his mistress s gown and laid his little head on her feet Nobody ever thought of sending them to school Hugh was a child of frail health and though not often very ill was often near it and as for Fleda she and Hugh were inseparable and besides by this time her uncle and aunt would almost as soon have thought of taking the mats off their delicate shrubs in winter as of exposing her to any atmosphere less genial than that of home For Fleda this doubtful course of mental training wrought singularly well An uncommonly quick eye and strong memory and clear head which she had even in childhood passed over no field of truth or fancy without making their quiet gleanings and the stores thus gathered though somewhat miscellaneous and unarranged were both rich and uncommon and more than any one or she herself knew Perhaps such a mind thus left to itself knew a more free and luxuriant growth than could ever have flourished within the confinement of rules Perhaps a plant at once so strong and so delicate was safest without the hand of the dresser At all events it was permitted to spring and to put forth all its native gracefulness alike unhindered and unknown Cherished as little Fleda dearly was her mind kept company with no one but herself and Hugh As to externals music was uncommonly loved by both the children and by both cultivated with great success So much came under missus Rossitur s knowledge Also every foreign Signor and Madame that came into the house to teach them spoke with enthusiasm of the apt minds and flexile tongues that honoured their instructions In private and in public the gentle docile and affectionate children answered every wish both of taste and judgment And perhaps in a world where education is not understood their guardians might be pardoned for taking it for granted that all was right where nothing appeared that was wrong certainly they took no pains to make sure of the fact In this case one of a thousand their neglect was not punished with disappointment They never found out that Hugh s mind wanted the strengthening that early skilful training might have given it His intellectual tastes were not so strong as Fleda s his reading was more superficial his gleanings not so sound and in far fewer fields and they went rather to nourish sentiment and fancy than to stimulate thought or lay up food for it But his parents saw nothing of this The third winter had not passed when Fleda s discernment saw that mister Sweden as she called him the German gentleman would not cease coming to the house till he had carried off Marion with him Her opinion on the subject was delivered to no one but Hugh That winter introduced them to a better acquaintance One evening doctor Gregory an uncle of missus Rossitur s had been dining with her and was in the drawing room mister Schweden had been there too and he and Marion and one or two other young people had gone out to some popular entertainment The children knew little of doctor Gregory but that he was a very respectable looking elderly gentleman a little rough in his manners the doctor had not long been returned from a stay of some years in Europe where he had been collecting rare books for a fine public library the charge of which was now entrusted to him After talking some time with mister and missus Rossitur the doctor pushed round his chair to take a look at the children So that s Amy s child said he Come here Amy That is not my name said the little girl coming forward Isn t it It ought to be What is then Elfleda Elfleda Where in the name of all that is auricular did you get such an outlandish name My father gave it to me sir said Fleda with a dignified sobriety which amused the old gentleman Your father Hum I understand And couldn t your father find a cap that fitted you without going back to the old fashioned days of King Alfred Yes sir it was my grandmother s cap I am afraid your grandmother s cap isn t all of her that s come down to you said he tapping his snuff box and looking at her with a curious twinkle in his eyes What do you call yourself Haven t you some variations of this tongue twisting appellative to serve for every day and save trouble They call me Fleda said the little girl who could not help laughing Nothing better than that Fleda remembered two prettier nick names which had been hers but one had been given by dear lips long ago and she was not going to have it profaned by common use and Elfie belonged to mister Carleton She would own to nothing but Fleda Well Miss Fleda said the doctor are you going to school No sir You intend to live without such a vulgar thing as learning No sir Hugh and I have our lessons at home Teaching each other I suppose O no sir said Fleda laughing Mme Lascelles and mister Schweppenhesser and Signor Barytone come to teach us besides our music masters Do you ever talk German with this mister What s his name who has just gone out with your cousin Marion I never talk to him at all sir Don t you why not Don t you like him Fleda said not particularly and seemed to wish to let the subject pass but the doctor was amused and pressed it Why why don t you like him said he I am sure he s a fine looking dashing gentleman dresses as well as anybody and talks as much as most people why don t you like him Isn t he a handsome fellow eh I dare say he is to many people said Fleda She said she didn t think there was any moral expression in his face said Hugh by way of settling the matter Moral expression cried the doctor moral expression and what if there isn t you Elf what if there isn t I shouldn t care what other kind of expression it had said Fleda colouring a little mister Rossitur pished rather impatiently The doctor glanced at his niece and changed the subject Well who teaches you English Miss Fleda you haven t told me that yet O that we teach ourselves said Fleda smiling as if it was a very innocent question Hum you do Pray how do you teach yourselves By reading sir Reading And what do you read what have you read in the last twelve months now I don t think I could remember all exactly said Fleda But you have got a list of them all said Hugh who chanced to have been looking over said list of a day or two before and felt quite proud of it Let s have it let s have it said the doctor And missus Rossitur laughing said Let s have it and even her husband commanded Hugh to go and fetch it so poor Fleda though not a little unwilling was obliged to let the list be forthcoming Hugh brought it in a neat little book covered with pink blotting paper Now for it said the doctor let us see what this English amounts to Can you stand fire Elfleda Jan one Robinson Crusoe Footnote A true list made by a child of that age Hum that sounds reasonable at all events I had it for a New Year present remarked Fleda who stood by with down cast eyes like a person undergoing an examination Jan two Histoire de France What history of France is this Fleda hesitated and then said it was by Lacretelle Lacretelle what of the Revolution No sir it is before that it is in five or six large volumes What Louis XV s time said the doctor muttering to himself Jan twenty seven two ditto ditto Two means the second volume I suppose Yes sir Hum if you were a mouse you would gnaw through the wall in time at that rate This is in the original Yes sir Feb three Paris L E K What do these hieroglyphics mean That stands for the Library of Entertaining Knowledge said Fleda But how is this do you go hop skip and jump through these books or read a little and then throw them away Here it is only seven days since you began the second volume of Lacretelle not time enough to get through it O no sir said Fleda smiling I like to have several books that I am reading in at once I mean at the same time you know and then if I am not in the mood of one I take up another She reads them all through said Hugh always though she reads them very quick Hum I understand said the old doctor with a humorous expression going on with the list March three three Hist de France But you finish one of these volumes I suppose before you begin another or do you dip into different parts of the same work at once O no sir of course not Mar five Modern Egyptians L E K Ap thirteen What are these dates on the right as well as on the left Those on the right shew when I finished the volume Well I wonder what you were cut out for said the doctor A Quaker you aren t a Quaker are you No sir

finished March twenty nine I declare you keep it up pretty well Ap nineteen Incidents of Travel Whose is that It is by mister Stephens How did you like it O very much indeed Ay I see you did you finished it by the first of May Tour to the Hebrides what Johnson s Yes sir Read it all fairly through Yes sir certainly He smiled and went on May twelve Peter Simple There was quite a shout at the heterogeneous character of Fleda s reading which she not knowing exactly what to make of it heard rather abashed Peter Simple said the doctor settling himself to go on with his list well let us see World without Souls Why you Elf read in two days It is very short you know sir What did you think of it I liked parts of it very much He went on still smiling June fifteen Goldsmith s Animated Nature June eighteen one Life of Washington What Life of Washington Marshall s Hum July nine two Goldsmith s An Na As I live begun the very day the first volume was finished did you read the whole of that O yes sir I liked that book very much four July twelve five Hist de France Two histories on hand at once Out of all rule Miss Fleda We must look after you Yes sir sometimes I wanted to read one and sometimes I wanted to read the other And you always do what you want to do I suppose I think the reading does me more good in that way July fifteen Paley s Natural Theology There was another shout Poor Fleda s eyes filled with tears What in the world put that book into your head or before your eyes said the doctor I don t know sir I thought I should like to read it said Fleda drooping her eyelids that the bright drops under them might not be seen And finished in eleven days as I live said the doctor wagging his head July nineteen three Goldsmith s A N Aug six four Do Do That is one of Fleda s favourite books put in Hugh So it seems six Hist de France What does this little cross mean That shews when the book is finished said Fleda looking on the page the last volume I mean Retrospect of Western Travel Goldsmith s A N last vol Memoirs de Sully in the French Yes sir Life of Newton What s this Sep eight one Fairy Queen not Spenser s Yes sir I believe so the Fairy Queen in five volumes The doctor looked up comically at his niece and her husband who were both sitting or standing close by Sep ten Paolo e Virginia In what language Italian sir I was just beginning and I haven t finished it yet Sep sixteen Milner s Church History What the deuce Vol two Fairy Queen Why this must have been a favourite book too That s one of the books Fleda loves best said Hugh she went through that very fast Over it you mean I reckon how much did you skip Fleda I didn t skip at all said Fleda I read every word of it Sep twenty two Mem de Sully Well you re an industrious mouse I ll say that for you What s this Don Quixotte Life of Howard Nov seventeen three Fairy Queen Nov twenty nine four Fairy Queen Dec eight one Goldsmith s England Well if this list of books is a fair exhibit of your taste and capacity you have a most happily proportioned set of intellectuals Let us see History fun facts nature theology poetry and divinity upon my soul and poetry and history the leading features a little fun as much as you could lay your hand on I ll warrant by that pinch in the corner of your eye And here the eleventh of December you finished the Fairy Queen and ever since I suppose you have been imagining yourself the faire Una with Hugh standing for Prince Arthur or the Red cross knight haven t you No sir I didn t imagine anything about it Don t tell me What did you read it for Only because I liked it sir I liked it better than any other book I read last year You did Well the year ends I see with another volume of Sully I won t enter upon this year s list Pray how much of all these volumes do you suppose you remember I ll try and find out next time I come to see you I can give a guess if you study with that little pug in your lap He is not a pug said Fleda in whose arms King was lying luxuriously and he never gets into my lap besides Illustration He is not a pug Don t he Why not Because I don t like it sir I don t like to see dogs in laps But all the ladies in the land do it you little Saxon it is universally considered a mark of distinction I can t help what all the ladies in the land do said Fleda That won t alter my liking and I don t think a lady s lap is a place for a dog I wish you were my daughter said the old doctor shaking his head at her with a comic fierce expression of countenance which Fleda perfectly understood and laughed at accordingly Then as the two children with the dog went off into the other room he said turning to his niece and mister Rossitur If that girl ever takes a wrong turn with the bit in her teeth you ll be puzzled to hold her What stuff will you make the reins of I don t think she ever will take a wrong turn said mister Rossitur A look is enough to manage her if she did said his wife Hugh is not more gentle I should be inclined rather to fear her not having stability of character enough said mister Rossitur She is so very meek and yielding I almost doubt whether anything would give her courage to take ground of her own and keep it Hum well well said the old doctor walking off after the children Prince Arthur will you bring this damsel up to my den some of these days the faire Una is safe from the wild beasts you know and I ll shew her books enough to build herself a house with if she likes The acceptance of this invitation led to some of the pleasantest hours of Fleda s city life The visits to the great library became very frequent doctor Gregory and the children were little while in growing fond of each other he loved to see them and taught them to come at such times as the library was free of visitors and his hands of engagements Then he delighted himself with giving them pleasure especially Fleda whose quick curiosity and intelligence were a constant amusement to him He would establish the children in some corner of the large apartments out of the way behind a screen of books and tables and there shut out from the world they would enjoy a kind of fairyland pleasure over some volume or set of engravings that they could not see at home Hours and hours were spent so Fleda would stand clasping her hands before Audubon or rapt over a finely illustrated book of travels or going through and through with Hugh the works of the best masters of the pencil and the graver The doctor found he could trust them and then all the treasures of the library were at their disposal Very often he put chosen pieces of reading into their hands and it was pleasantest of all when he was not busy and came and sat down with them for with all his odd manner he was extremely kind and could and did put them in the way to profit greatly by their opportunities The doctor and the children had nice times there together They lasted for many months and grew more and more worth mister Schweden carried off Marion as Fleda had foreseen he would before the end of spring and after she was gone something like the old pleasant Paris life was taken up again They had no more company now than was agreeable and it was picked not to suit Marion s taste but her father s a very different matter Fleda and Hugh were not forbidden the dinner table and so had the good of hearing much useful conversation from which the former according to custom made her steady precious gleanings The pleasant evenings in the family were still better enjoyed than they used to he Fleda was older and the snug handsome American house had a home feeling to her that the wide Parisian saloons never knew She had become bound to her uncle and aunt by all but the ties of blood nobody in the house ever remembered that she was not born their daughter except indeed Fleda herself who remembered everything and with whom the forming of any new affections or relations somehow never blotted out or even faded the register of the old It lived in all its brightness the writing of past loves and friendships was as plain as ever in her heart and often often the eye and the kiss of memory fell upon it In the secret of her heart s core for still as at the first no one had a suspicion of the movings of thought that were beneath that childish brow No one guessed how clear a judgment weighed and decided upon many things No one dreamed amid their busy hustling thoughtless life how often in the street in her bed in company and alone her mother s last prayer was in Fleda s heart well cherished never forgotten Her education and Hugh s meanwhile went on after the old fashion If mister Rossitur had more time he seemed to have no more thought for the matter and missus Rossitur fine natured as she was had never been trained to self exertion and of course was entirely out of the way of training others Her children were pieces of perfection and needed no oversight her house was a piece of perfection too If either had not been missus Rossitur would have been utterly at a loss how to mend matters except in the latter instance by getting a new housekeeper and as missus Renney the good woman who held that station was in everybody s opinion another treasure missus Rossitur s mind was uncrossed by the shadow of such a dilemma With missus Renney as with every one else Fleda was held in highest regard always welcome to her premises and to those mysteries of her trade which were sacred from other intrusion Fleda s natural inquisitiveness carried her often to the housekeeper s room and made her there the same curious and careful observer that she had been in the library or at the Louvre Come said Hugh one day when he had sought and found her in missus Renney s precincts come away Fleda What do you want to stand here and see missus Renney roll butter and sugar for My dear mister Rossitur said Fleda you don t understand quelquechoses How do you know but I may have to get my living by making them some day By making what said Hugh Quelquechoses anglice kickshaws alias sweet trifles denominated merrings Pshaw Fleda Miss Fleda is more likely to get her living by eating them mister Hugh isn t she said the housekeeper I hope to decline both lines of life said Fleda laughingly as she followed Hugh out of the room But her chance remark had grazed the truth sufficiently near Those years in New York were a happy time for little Fleda a time when mind and body flourished under the sun of prosperity Luxury did not spoil her and any one that saw her in the soft furs of her winter wrappings would have said that delicate cheek and frame were never made to know the unkindliness of harsher things Chapter XVI Whereunto is money good Who has it not wants hardihood Who has it has much trouble and care Who once has had it has despair Longfellow From the German It was the middle of winter One day Hugh and Fleda had come home from their walk They dashed into the parlour complaining that it was bitterly cold and began unrobing before the glowing grate which was a mass of living fire from end to end missus Rossitur was there in an easy chair alone and doing nothing That was not a thing absolutely unheard of but Fleda had not pulled off her second glove before she bent down towards her and in a changed tone tenderly asked if she did not feel well missus Rossitur looked up in her face a minute and then drawing her down kissed the blooming cheeks one and the other several times But as she looked off to the fire again Fleda saw that it was through watering eyes She dropped on her knees by the side of the easy chair that she might have a better sight of that face and tried to read it as she asked again what was the matter and Hugh coming to the other side repeated her question His mother passed an arm round each looking wistfully from one to the other and kissing them earnestly but she said only with a very heart felt emphasis Poor children Fleda was now afraid to speak but Hugh pressed his inquiry Why poor mamma what makes you say so Because you are poor really dear Hugh We have lost everything we have in the world Mamma What do you mean Your father has failed Failed But mamma I thought he wasn t in business So I thought said missus Rossitur I didn t know people could fail that were not in business but it seems they can He was a partner in some concern or other and it s all broken to pieces and your father with it he says missus Rossitur s face was distressful They were all silent for a little Hugh kissing his mother s wet cheeks Fleda had softly nestled her head in her bosom But missus Rossitur soon recovered herself How bad is it mother said Hugh As bad as can possibly be Is everything gone Everything You don t mean the house mamma The house and all that is in it The children s hearts were struck and they were silent again only a trembling touch of Fleda s lips spoke sympathy and patience if ever a kiss did But mamma said Hugh after he had gathered breath for it do you mean to say that everything literally everything is gone is there nothing left Nothing in the world not a sou Then what are we going to do missus Rossitur shook her head and had no words Fleda looked across to Hugh to ask no more and putting her arms round her aunt s neck and laying cheek to cheek she spoke what comfort she could Don t dear aunt Lucy there will be some way things always turn out better than at first I dare say we shall find out it isn t so bad by and by Don t you mind it and then we won t We can be happy anywhere together If there was not much in the reasoning there was something in the tone of the words to bid missus Rossitur bear herself well Its tremulous sweetness its anxious love was without a taint of self recollection its sorrow was for her missus Rossitur felt that she must not shew herself overcome She again kissed and blessed and pressed closer in her arms her little comforter while her other hand was given to Hugh I have only heard about it this morning Your uncle was here telling me just now a little while before you came Don t say anything about it before him Why not The words struck Fleda disagreeably What will be done with the house mamma said Hugh Sold sold and everything in it Papa s books mamma and all the things in the library exclaimed Hugh looking terrified missus Rossitur s face gave the answer do it in words she could not The children were a long time silent trying hard to swallow this bitter pill and still Hugh s hand was in his mother s and Fleda s head lay on her bosom Thought was busy going up and down and breaking the companionship they had so long held with the pleasant drawing room and the tasteful arrangements among which Fleda was so much at home the easy chairs in whose comfortable arms she had had so many an hour of nice reading the soft rug where in the very wantonness of frolic she had stretched herself to play with King that very luxurious bright grateful of fire which had given her so often the same warm welcome home an apt introduction to the other stores of comfort which awaited her above and below stairs the rich coloured curtains and carpet the beauty of which had been such a constant gratification to Fleda s eye and the exquisite French table and lamps they had brought out with them in which her uncle and aunt had so much pride and which could nowhere be matched for elegance they must all be said good bye to and as yet fancy had nothing to furnish the future with it looked very bare King had come in and wagged himself up close to his mistress but even he could obtain nothing but the touch of most abstracted finger ends Yet though keenly recognized these thoughts were only passing compared with the anxious and sorrowful ones that went to her aunt and uncle for Hugh and her she judged it was less matter And missus Rossitur s care was most for her husband and Hugh s was for them all His associations were less quick and his tastes less keen than Fleda s and less a part of himself Hugh lived in his affections with a salvo to them he could bear to lose anything and go anywhere Mamma said he after a long time will anything be done with Fleda s books A question that had been in Fleda s mind before but which she had patiently forborne just then to ask No indeed said missus Rossitur pressing Fleda more closely and kissing in a kind of rapture the sweet thoughtful face not yours my darling they can t touch anything that belongs to you I wish it was more and I don t suppose they will take anything of mine either Ah well said Fleda raising her head you have got quite a parcel of books aunt Lucy and I have a good many how well it is I have had so many given me since I have been here That will make quite a nice little library both together and Hugh has some I thought perhaps we shouldn t have one at all left and that would have been rather bad Rather bad missus Rossitur looked at her and was dumb Only don t you wear a sad face for anything Fleda went on earnestly we shall be perfectly happy if you and uncle Rolf only will be My dear children said missus Rossitur wiping her eyes it is for you I am unhappy you and your uncle I do not think of myself And we do not think of ourselves mamma said Hugh I know it but having good children don t make one care less about them said missus Rossitur the tears fairly raining over her fingers Hugh pulled the fingers down and again tried the efficacy of his lips And you know papa thinks most of you mamma Ah your father said missus Rossitur shaking her head I am afraid it will go hard with him But I will be happy as long as I have you two or else I should be a very wicked woman It only grieves me to think of your education and prospects Fleda s piano mamma said Hugh with sudden dismay missus Rossitur shook her head again and covered her eyes while Fleda stretching across to Hugh gave him by look and touch an earnest admonition to let that subject alone And then with a sweetness and gentleness like nothing but the breath of the south wind she wooed her aunt to hope and resignation Hugh held back feeling or thinking that Fleda could do it better than he and watching her progress as missus Rossitur took her hand from her face and smiled at first mournfully and then really mirthfully in Fleda s face at some sally that nobody but a nice observer would have seen was got up for the occasion And it was hardly that so completely had the child forgotten her own sorrow in ministering to that of another Blessed are the peacemakers It is always so You are a witch or a fairy said missus Rossitur catching her again in her arms nothing else You must try your powers of charming upon your uncle Fleda laughed without any effort but as to trying her slight wand upon mister Rossitur she had serious doubts And the doubts became certainty when they met at dinner he looked so grave that she dared not attack him It was a gloomy meal for the face that should have lighted the whole table cast a shadow there Without at all comprehending the whole of her husband s character the sure magnetism of affection had enabled missus Rossitur to divine his thoughts Pride was his ruling passion not such pride as mister Carleton s which was rather like exaggerated self respect but wider and more indiscriminate in its choice of objects It was pride in his family name pride in his own talents which were considerable pride in his family wife and children and all of which he thought did him honour if they had not his love for them assuredly would have known some diminishing pride in his wealth and in the attractions with which it surrounded him and lastly pride in the skill taste and connoisseurship which enabled him to bring those attractions together Furthermore his love for both literature and art was true and strong and for many years he had accustomed himself to lead a life of great luxuriousness catering for body and mind in every taste that could be elegantly enjoyed and again proud of the elegance of every enjoyment The change of circumstances which touched his pride wounded him at every point where he was vulnerable at all Fleda had never felt so afraid of him She was glad to see doctor Gregory come in to tea mister Rossitur was not there The doctor did not touch upon affairs if he had heard of their misfortune he went on as usual in a rambling cheerful way all tea time talking mostly to Fleda and Hugh But after tea he talked no more but sat still and waited till the master of the house came in Fleda thought mister Rossitur did not look glad to see him But how could he look glad about anything He did not sit down and for a few minutes there was a kind of meaning silence Fleda sat in the corner with the heartache to see her uncle s gloomy tramp up and down the rich apartment and her aunt Lucy gaze at him Humph well So said the doctor at last You ve all gone overboard with a smash I understand The walker gave him no regard True is it said the doctor mister Rossitur made no answer unless a smothered grunt might be taken for one How came it about Folly and Devilry Humph bad capital to work upon I hope the principal is gone with the interest What s the amount of your loss Ruin Humph French ruin or American ruin because there s a difference What do you mean I am not so happy as to understand you sir but we shall not pay seventy cents on the dollar The old gentleman got up and stood before the fire with his back to mister Rossitur saying that was rather bad What are you going to do mister Rossitur hesitated a few moments for an answer and then said Pay the seventy cents and begin the world anew with nothing Of course said the doctor I understand that but where and how What end of the world will you take up first mister Rossitur writhed in impatience or disgust and after again hesitating answered dryly that he had not determined Have you thought of anything in particular Zounds no sir except my misfortune That s enough for one day And too much said the old doctor unless you can mix some other thought with it That s what I came for Will you go into business Fleda was startled by the vehemence with which her uncle said No never and he presently added I ll do nothing here Well well said the doctor to himself Will you go into the country Yes anywhere the further the better missus Rossitur startled but her husband s face did not encourage her to open her lips Ay but on a farm I mean On anything that will give me a standing I thought that too said doctor Gregory now whirling about I have a fine piece of land that wants a tenant You may take it at an easy rate and pay me when the crops come in I shouldn t expect so young a farmer you know to keep any closer terms How far is it Far enough up in Wyandot County How large A matter of two or three hundred acres or so It is very fine they say It came into a fellow s hands that owed me what I thought was a bad debt so for fear he would never pay me I thought best to take it and pay him whether the place will ever fill my pockets again remains to be seen doubtful I think I ll take it doctor Gregory and see if I cannot bring that about Pooh pooh fill your own I am not careful about it the less money one has the more it jingles unless it gets too low indeed I will take it doctor Gregory and feel myself under obligation to you No I told you not till the crops come in No obligation is binding till the term is up Well I ll see you further about it But Rolf said missus Rossitur stop a minute uncle don t go yet Rolf don t know anything in the world about the management of a farm neither do I The faire Una can enlighten you said the doctor waving his hand towards his little favourite in the corner but I forgot Well if you don t know the crops won t come in that s all the difference But missus Rossitur looked anxiously at her husband Do you know exactly what you are undertaking Rolf she said If I do not I presume I shall discover in time But it may be too late said missus Rossitur in the tone of sad remonstrance that had gone all the length it dared It can not be too late said her husband impatiently If I do not know what I am taking up I know very well what I am laying down and it does not signify a straw what comes after if it was a snail shell that would cover my head Hum said the old doctor the snail is very well in his way but I have no idea that he was ever cut out for a farmer Do you think you will find it a business you would like mister Rossitur said his wife timidly I tell you said he facing about it is not a question of liking I will like anything that will bury me out of the world Poor missus Rossitur She had not yet come to wishing herself buried alive and she had small faith in the permanence of her husband s taste for it She looked desponding You don t suppose said mister Rossitur stopping again in the middle of the floor after another turn and a half you do not suppose that I am going to take the labouring of the farm upon myself I shall employ some one of course who understands the matter to take all that off my hands The doctor thought of the old proverb and the alternative the plough presents to those who would thrive by it Fleda thought of mister Didenhover missus Rossitur would fain have suggested that such an important person must be well paid but neither of them spoke Of course said mister Rossitur haughtily as he went on with his walk I do not expect any more than you to live in the back woods the life we have been leading here That is at an end Is it a very wild country asked missus Rossitur of the doctor No wild beasts my dear if that is your meaning and I do not suppose there are even many snakes left by this time No but dear uncle I mean is it in an unsettled state No my dear not at all perfectly quiet Ah but do not play with me exclaimed poor missus Rossitur between laughing and crying I mean is it far from any town and not among neighbours Far enough to be out of the way of morning calls said the doctor and when your neighbours come to see you they will expect tea by four o clock There are not a great many near by but they don t mind coming from five or six miles off missus Rossitur looked chilled and horrified To her he had described a very wild country indeed Fleda would have laughed if it had not been for her aunt s face but that settled down into a doubtful anxious look that pained her It pained the old doctor too Come said he touching her pretty chin with his forefinger what are you thinking of folks may be good folks and yet have tea at four o clock mayn t they When do they have dinner said missus Rossitur I really don t know When you get settled up there I ll come and see Hardly said missus Rossitur I don t believe it would be possible for Emile to get dinner before the tea time and I am sure I shouldn t like to propose such a thing to missus Renney The doctor fidgeted about a little on the hearth rug and looked comical perfectly understood by one acute observer in the corner Are you wise enough to imagine Lucy said mister Rossitur sternly that you can carry your whole establishment with you What do you suppose Emile and missus Renney would do in a farmhouse I can do without whatever you can said missus Rossitur meekly I did not know that you would be willing to part with Emile and I do not think missus Renney would like to leave us I told you before it is no more a question of liking answered he And if it were said the doctor I have no idea that Monsieur Emile and Madame Renney would be satisfied with the style of a country kitchen or think the interior of Yankee land a hopeful sphere for their energies What sort of a house is it said missus Rossitur A wooden frame house I believe No but dear uncle do tell me What sort of a house Humph Large enough I am told It will accommodate you in one way Comfortable I don t know said the doctor shaking his head depends on who s in it No house is that per se But I reckon there isn t much plate glass I suppose you ll find the doors all painted blue and every fireplace with a crane in it A crane said missus Rossitur to whose imagination the word suggested nothing but a large water bird with a long neck Ay said the doctor But it s just as well You won t want hanging lamps there and candelabra would hardly be in place either to hold tallow candles Tallow candles exclaimed missus Rossitur Her husband winced but said nothing Ay said the doctor again and make them yourself if you are a good housewife Come Lucy said he taking her hand do you know how the wild fowl do on the Chesapeake duck and swim under water till they can shew their heads with safety O spoil your eyes to see by a tallow candle missus Rossitur half smiled but looked anxiously towards her husband Pooh pooh Rolf won t care what the light burns that lights him to independence and when you get there you may illuminate with a whole whale if you like By the way Rolf there is a fine water power up yonder and a saw mill in good order they tell me but a short way from the house Hugh might learn to manage it and it would be fine employment for him Hugh said his mother disconsolately mister Rossitur neither spoke nor looked an answer Fleda sprang forward A saw mill Uncle Orrin where is it Just a little way from the house they say You can t manage it fair Saxon though you look as if you would undertake all the mills in creation for a trifle No but the place uncle Orrin where is the place The place Hum why it s up in Wyandot County some five or six miles from the Montepoole Spring what s this they call it Queechy By the way said he reading Fleda s countenance it is the very place where your father was born it is I didn t think of that before Fleda s hands were clasped O I am very glad she said It s my old home It is the most lovely place aunt Lucy most lovely and we shall have some good neighbours there too O I am very glad The dear old saw mill Dear old saw mill said the doctor looking at her Rolf I ll tell you what you shall give me this girl I want her I can take better care of her perhaps now than you can Let her come to me when you leave the city it will be better for her than to help work the saw mill and I have as good a right to her as anybody for Amy before her was like my own child The doctor spoke not with his usual light jesting manner but very seriously Hugh s lips parted missus Rossitur looked with a sad thoughtful look at Fleda mister Rossitur walked up and down looking at nobody Fleda watched him What does Fleda herself say said he stopping short suddenly His face softened and his eye changed as it fell upon her for the first time that day Fleda saw her opening she came to him within his arms and laid her head upon his breast What does Fleda say said he softly kissing her Fleda s tears said a good deal that needed no interpreter She felt her uncle s hand passed more and more tenderly over her head so tenderly that it made it all the more difficult for her to govern herself and stop her tears But she did stop them and looked up at him then with such a face so glowing through smiles and tears it was like a very rainbow of hope upon the cloud of their prospects mister Rossitur felt the power of the sunbeam wand it reached his heart it was even with a smile that he said as he looked at her Will you go to your uncle Orrin Fleda Not if uncle Rolf will keep me Keep you said mister Rossitur I should like to see who wouldn t keep you There doctor Gregory you have your answer Hum I might have known said the doctor that the faire Una would abjure cities Come here you Elf and he wrapped her in his arms so tight she could not stir I have a spite against you for this What amends will you make me for such an affront Let me take breath said Fleda laughing and I ll tell you You don t want any amends uncle Orrin Well said he gazing with more feeling than he cared to shew into that sweet face so innocent of apology making you shall promise me that you will not forget uncle Orrin and the old house in Bleecker street Fleda s eyes grew more wistful And will you promise me that if ever you want anything you will come or send straight there If ever I want anything I can t get nor do without said Fleda Pshaw said the doctor letting her go but laughing at the same time Mind my words mister and missus Rossitur if ever that girl takes the wrong bit in her mouth Well well I ll go home Home he went The rest drew together particularly near round the fire Hugh at his father s shoulder and Fleda kneeling on the rug between her uncle and aunt with a hand on each and there was not one of them whose gloom was not lightened by her bright face and cheerful words of hope that in the new scenes they were going to they would all be so happy The days that followed were gloomy but Fleda s ministry was unceasing Hugh seconded her well though more passively Feeling less pain himself he perhaps for that very reason was less acutely alive to it in others not so quick to foresee and ward off not so skilful to allay it Fleda seemed to have intuition for the one and a charm for the other To her there was pain in every parting her sympathies clung to whatever wore the livery of habit There was hardly any piece of furniture there was no book or marble or picture that she could take leave of without a pang But it was kept to herself her sorrowful good byes were said in secret before others in all those weeks she was a very Euphrosyne light bright cheerful of eye and foot and hand a shield between her aunt and every annoyance that she could take instead a good little fairy that sent her sunbeam wand quick as a flash where any eye rested gloomily People did not always find out where the light came from but it was her witchery The creditors would touch none of missus Rossitur s things her husband s honourable behaviour had been so thorough They even presented him with one or two pictures which he sold for a considerable sum and to missus Rossitur they gave up all the plate in daily use a matter of great rejoicing to Fleda who knew well how sorely it would have been missed She and her aunt had quite a little library too of their own private store a little one it was indeed but the worth of every volume was now trebled in her eyes Their furniture was all left behind and in its stead went some of neat light painted wood which looked to Fleda deliciously countryfied A promising cook and housemaid were engaged to go with them to the wilds and about the first of April they turned their backs upon the city Chapter XVII The thresher s weary flingin tree The lee lang day had tired me And whan the day bad closed his e e Far i the west Ben i the spence right pensivelie I gaed to rest Burns Queechy was reached at night Fleda had promised herself to be off almost with the dawn of light the next morning to see aunt Miriam but a heavy rain kept her fast at home the whole day It was very well she was wanted there Despite the rain and her disappointment it was impossible for Fleda to lie abed from the time the first grey light began to break in at her windows those old windows that had rattled their welcome to her all night She was up and dressed and had had a long consultation with herself over matters and prospects before anybody else had thought of leaving the indubitable comfort of a feather bed for the doubtful contingency of happiness that awaited them down stairs Fleda took in the whole length and breadth of it half wittingly and half through some finer sense than that of the understanding The first view of things could not strike them pleasantly it was not to be looked for The doors did not happen to be painted blue they were a deep chocolate colour doors and wainscot The fireplaces were not all furnished with cranes but they were all uncouthly wide and deep Nobody would have thought them so indeed in the winter when piled up with blazing hickory logs but in summer they yawned uncomfortably upon the eye The ceilings were low the walls rough papered or rougher white washed the sashes not hung the rooms otherwise well enough proportioned stuck with little cupboards in recesses and corners and out of the way places in a style impertinently suggestive of housekeeping and fitted to shock any symmetrical set of nerves The old house had undergone a thorough putting in order it is true the chocolate paint was just dry and the paper hangings freshly put up and the bulk of the new furniture had been sent on before and unpacked though not a single article of it was in its right place The house was clean and tight that is as tight as it ever was But the colour had been unfortunately chosen perhaps there was no help for that the paper was very coarse and countryfied the big windows were startling they looked so bare without any manner of drapery and the long reaches of wall were unbroken by mirror or picture frame And this to eyes trained to eschew ungracefulness and that abhorred a vacuum as much as nature is said to do Even Fleda felt there was something disagreeable in the change though it reached her more through the channel of other people s sensitiveness than her own To her it was the dear old house still though her eyes had seen better things since they loved it No corner or recess had a pleasanter filling to her fancy than the old brown cupboard or shelves which had always been there But what would her uncle say to them and to that dismal paper and what would aunt Lucy think of those rattling window sashes this cool raw day too for the first Think as she might Fleda did not stand still to think She had gone softly all over the house taking a strange look at the old places and the images with which memory filled them thinking of the last time and many a time before that and she had at last come back to the sitting room long before anybody else was down stairs the two tired servants were just rubbing their eyes open in the kitchen and speculating themselves awake Leaving them at their peril to get ready a decent breakfast by the way she grudged them the old kitchen Fleda set about trying what her wand could do towards brightening the face of affairs in the other part of the house It was quite cold enough for a fire luckily She ordered one made and meanwhile busied herself with the various stray packages and articles of wearing apparel that lay scattered about giving the whole place a look of discomfort Fleda gathered them up and bestowed them in one or two of the impertinent cupboards and then undertook the labour of carrying out all the wrong furniture that had got into the breakfast room and bringing in that which really belonged there from the hall and the parlour beyond moving like a mouse that she might not disturb the people up stairs A quarter of an hour was spent in arranging to the best advantage these various pieces of furniture in the room it was the very same in which mister Carleton and Charlton Rossitur had been received the memorable day of the roast pig dinner but that was not the uppermost association in Fleda s mind Satisfied at last that a happier effect could not be produced with the given materials and well pleased too with her success Fleda turned to the fire It was made but not by any means doing its part to encourage the other portions of the room to look their best Fleda knew something of wood fires from old times she laid hold of the tongs and touched and loosened and coaxed a stick here and there with a delicate hand till seeing the very opening it had wanted without which neither fire nor hope can keep its activity the blaze sprang up energetically crackling through all the piled oak and hickory and driving the smoke clean out of sight Fleda had done her work It would have been a misanthropical person indeed that could have come into the room then and not felt his face brighten One other thing remained setting the breakfast table and Fleda would let no hands but hers do it this morning she was curious about the setting of tables How she remembered or divined where everything had been stowed how quietly and efficiently her little fingers unfastened hampers and pried into baskets without making any noise till all the breakfast paraphernalia of silver china and table linen was found gathered from various receptacles and laid in most exquisite order on the table State street never saw better Fleda stood and looked at it then in immense satisfaction seeing that her uncle s eye would miss nothing of its accustomed gratification To her the old room shining with firelight and new furniture was perfectly charming If those great windows were staringly bright health and cheerfulness seemed to look in at them And what other images of association with nods and becks and wreathed smiles looked at her out of the curling flames in the old wide fireplace And one other angel stood there unseen the one whose errand it is to see fulfilled the promise Give and it shall be given to you full measure and pressed down and heaped up and running over A little while Fleda sat contentedly eying her work then a new idea struck her and she sprang up In the next meadow only one fence between a little spring of purest water ran through from the woodland water cresses used to grow there Uncle Rolf was very fond of them It was pouring with rain but no matter Her heart beating between haste and delight Fleda slipped her feet into galoches and put an old cloak of Hugh s over her head and ran out through the kitchen the old accustomed way The servants exclaimed and entreated but Fleda only flashed a bright look at them from under her cloak as she opened the door and ran off over the wet grass under the fence and over half the meadow till she came to the stream She was getting a delicious taste of old times and though the spring water was very cold and with it and the rain one half of each sleeve was soon thoroughly wetted she gathered her cresses and scampered back with a pair of eyes and cheeks that might have struck any city belle chill with envy Then but that s a sweet girl said Mary the cook to Jane the housemaid A lovely countenance she has answered Jane who was refined in her speech Take her away and you ve taken the best of the house I m a thinking missus Rossitur is a lady said Jane in a low voice Ay and a very proper behaved one she is and him the same that is for a gentleman I maan but Jane I say I m thinking he ll have eat too much sour bread lately I wish I knowed how they d have their eggs boiled till I d have em ready Sure it s on the table itself they ll do em said Jane They ve an elegant little fixture in there for the purpose Is that it Nobody found out how busy Fleda s wand had been in the old breakfast room But she was not disappointed she had not worked for praise Her cresses were appreciated that was enough She enjoyed her breakfast the only one of the party that did mister Rossitur looked moody his wife looked anxious and Hugh s face was the reflection of theirs If Fleda s face reflected anything it was the sunlight of heaven How sweet the air is after New York said she They looked at her There was a fresh sweetness of another kind about that breakfast table They all felt it and breathed more freely Delicious cresses said missus Rossitur Yes I wonder where they came from said her husband Who got them I guess Fleda knows said Hugh They grow in a little stream of spring water over here in the meadow said Fleda demurely Yes but you don t answer my question said her uncle putting his hand under her chin and smiling at the blushing face he brought round to view Who got them I did You have been out in the rain O Queechy rain don t hurt me uncle Rolf And don t it wet you either Yes sir a little How much My sleeves O I dried them long ago Don t you repeat that experiment Fleda said he seriously but with a look that was a good reward to her nevertheless It is a raw day said missus Rossitur drawing her shoulders together as an ill disposed window sash gave one of its admonitory shakes What little panes of glass for such big windows said Hugh But what a pleasant prospect through them said Fleda look Hugh worth all the Batteries and Parks in the world In the world in New York you mean said her uncle Not better than the Champs Elysees Better to me said Fleda For to day I must attend to the prospect in doors said missus Rossitur Now aunt Lucy said Fleda you are just going to put yourself down in the corner in the rocking chair there with your book and make yourself comfortable and Hugh and I will see to all these things Hugh and I and Mary and Jane that makes quite an army of us and we can do everything without you and you must just keep quiet I ll build you up a fine fire and then when I don t know what to do I will come to you for orders Uncle Rolf would you be so good as just to open that box of books in the hall because I am afraid Hugh isn t strong enough I ll take care of you aunt Lucy Fleda s plans were not entirely carried out but she contrived pretty well to take the brunt of the business on her own shoulders She was as busy as a bee the whole day To her all the ins and outs of the house its advantages and disadvantages were much better known than to anybody else nothing could be done but by her advice and more than that she contrived by some sweet management to baffle missus Rossitur s desire to spare her and to bear the larger half of every burden that should have come upon her aunt What she had done in the breakfast room she did or helped to do in the other parts of the house she unpacked boxes and put away clothes and linen in which Hugh was her excellent helper she arranged her uncle s dressing table with a scrupulosity that left nothing uncared for and the last thing before tea she and Hugh dived into the book box to get out some favourite volumes to lay upon the table in the evening that the room might not look to her uncle quite so dismally bare He had been abroad notwithstanding the rain near the whole day It was a weary party that gathered round the supper table that night weary it seemed as much in mind as in body and the meal exerted its cheering influence over only two of them mister and missus Rossitur sipped their cups of tea abstractedly I don t believe that fellow Donohan knows much about his business remarked the former at length Why don t you get somebody else then said his wife I happen to have engaged him unfortunately A pause What doesn t he know mister Rossitur laughed not a pleasant laugh It would take too long to enumerate If you had asked me what part of his business he does understand I could have told you shortly that I don t know But you do not understand it very well yourself Are you sure Am I sure of what That this man does not know his business No further sure than I can have confidence in my own common sense What will you do said missus Rossitur after a moment A question men are not fond of answering especially when they have not made up their minds mister Rossitur was silent and his wife too after that If I could get some long headed Yankee to go along with him he remarked again balancing his spoon on the edge of his cup in curious illustration of his own mental position at the moment Donohan being the only fixed point and all the rest wavering in uncertainty There were a few silent minutes before anybody answered If you want one and don t know of one uncle Rolf said Fleda I dare say cousin Seth might That gentle modest speech brought his attention round upon her His face softened Cousin Seth who is cousin Seth He is aunt Miriam s son said Fleda Seth Plumfield He s a very good farmer I know grandpa used to say he was and he knows everybody missus Plumfield said missus Rossitur as her husband s eyes went inquiringly to her missus Plumfield was mister Ringgan s sister you remember This is her son Cousin Seth eh said mister Rossitur dubiously Well Why Fleda your sweet air don t seem to agree with you as far as I see I have not known you look so so triste since we left Paris What have you been doing my child She has been doing everything father said Hugh O it s nothing said Fleda answering mister Rossitur s look and tone of affection with a bright smile I m a little tired that s all A little tired She went to sleep on the sofa directly after supper and slept like a baby all the evening but her power did not sleep with her for that quiet sweet tired face tired in their service seemed to bear witness against the indulgence of anything harsh or unlovely in the same atmosphere A gentle witness bearing but strong in its gentleness They sat close together round the fire talked softly and from time to time cast loving glances at the quiet little sleeper by their side They did not know that she was a fairy and that though her wand had fallen out of her hand it was still resting upon them Chapter XVIII Gon Here is everything advantageous to lift Ant True save means to live

none	none	Fleda s fatigue did not prevent her being up before sunrise the next day Fatigue was forgotten for the light of a fair spring morning was shining in at her windows and she meant to see aunt Miriam before breakfast She ran out to find Hugh and her merry shout reached him before she did and brought him to meet her Come Hugh I m going off up to aunt Miriam s and I want you Come Isn t this delicious Hush said Hugh Father s just here in the barn I can t go Fleda Fleda s countenance clouded Can t go what s the matter can t you go Hugh He shook his head and went off into the barn A chill came upon Fleda She turned away with a very sober step What if her uncle was in the barn why should she hush He never had been a check upon her merriment never what was coming now Hugh too looked disturbed It was a spring morning no longer Fleda forgot the glittering wet grass that had set her own eyes a sparkling but a minute ago she walked along cogitating swinging her bonnet by the strings in thoughtful vibration till by the help of sunlight and sweet air and the loved scenes her spirits again made head and swept over the sudden hindrance they had met There were the blessed old sugar maples seven in number that fringed the side of the road how well Fleda knew them Only skeletons now but she remembered how beautiful they looked after the October frosts and presently they would be putting out their new green leaves and be beautiful in another way How different in their free born luxuriance from the dusty and city prisoned elms and willows she had left She came to the bridge then and stopped with a thrill of pleasure and pain to look and listen Unchanged all but herself The mill was not going the little brook went by quietly chattering to itself just as it had done the last time she saw it when she rode past on mister Carleton s horse Four and a half years ago And now how strange that she had come to live there again Drawing a long breath and swinging her bonnet again Fleda softly went on up the hill past the saw mill the ponds the factories the houses of the settlement The same and not the same Bright with the morning sun and yet somehow a little browner and homelier than of old they used to be Fleda did not care for that she would hardly acknowledge it to herself her affection never made any discount for infirmity Leaving the little settlement behind her thoughts as behind her back she ran on now towards aunt Miriam s breathlessly till field after field was passed and her eye caught a bit of the smooth lake and the old farmhouse in its old place Very brown it looked but Fleda dashed on through the garden and in at the front door Nobody at all was in the entrance room the common sitting room of the family With trembling delight Fleda opened the well known door and stole noiselessly through the little passage way to the kitchen The door of that was only on the latch and a gentle movement of it gave to Fleda s eye the tall figure of aunt Miriam just before her stooping down to look in at the open mouth of the oven which she was at that moment engaged in supplying with more work to do It was a huge one and beyond her aunt s head Fleda could see in the far end the great loaves of bread half baked and more near a perfect squad of pies and pans of gingerbread just going in to take the benefit of the oven s milder mood Fleda saw all this as it were without seeing it she stood still as a mouse and breathless till her aunt turned and then a spring and a half shout of joy and she had clasped her in her arms and was crying with her whole heart Aunt Miriam was taken all aback she could do nothing but sit down and cry too and forget her oven door Ain t breakfast ready yet mother said a manly voice coming in I must be off to see after them ploughs Hollo why mother The first exclamation was uttered as the speaker put the door to the oven s mouth the second as he turned in quest of the hand that should have done it He stood wondering while his mother and Fleda between laughing and crying tried to rouse themselves and look up What is all this Don t you see Seth I see somebody that had like to have spoiled your whole baking I don t know who it is yet Don t you now cousin Seth said Fleda shaking away her tears and getting up I ha n t quite lost my recollection Cousin you must give me a kiss How do you do You ha n t forgot how to colour I see for all you ve been so long among the pale city folks I haven t forgotten any thing cousin Seth said Fleda blushing indeed but laughing and shaking his hand with as hearty good will I don t believe you have anything that is good said he Where have you been all this while O part of the time in New York and part of the time in Paris and some other places Well you ha n t seen anything better than Queechy or Queechy bread and butter have you No indeed Come you shall give me another kiss for that said he suiting the action to the word and now sit down and eat as much bread and butter as you can It s just as good as it used to be Come mother I guess breakfast is ready by the looks of that coffee pot Breakfast ready said Fleda Ay indeed it s a good half hour since it ought to ha been ready If it ain t I can t stop for it Them boys will be running their furrows like sarpents f I ain t there to start them Which like serpents said Fleda the furrows or the men Well I was thinking of the furrows said he glancing at her I guess there ain t cunning enough in the others to trouble them Come sit down and let me see whether you have forgotten a Queechy appetite I don t know said Fleda doubtfully they will expect me at home I don t care who expects you sit down you ain t going to eat any bread and butter this morning but my mother s you haven t got any like it at your house Mother give her a cup of coffee will you and set her to work Fleda was too willing to comply with the invitation were it only for the charm of old times She had not seen such a table for years and little as the conventionalities of delicate taste were known there it was not without a comeliness of its own in its air of wholesome abundance and the extreme purity of all its arrangements If but a piece of cold pork were on aunt Miriam s table it was served with a nicety that would not have offended the most fastidious and amid irregularities that the fastidious would scorn there was a sound excellence of material and preparation that they very often fail to know Fleda made up her mind she would be wanted at home all the rather perhaps for Hugh s mysterious hush and there was something in the hearty kindness and truth of these friends that she felt particularly genial And if there was a lack of silver at the board its place was more than filled with the pure gold of association They sat down to table but aunt Miriam s eyes devoured Fleda mister Plum field set about his more material breakfast with all despatch Illustration They will expect me at home So mister Rossitur has left the city for good said aunt Miriam How does he like it He hasn t been here but a day you know aunt Miriam said Fleda evasively Is he anything of a farmer asked her cousin Not much said Fleda Is he going to work the farm himself How do you mean I mean is he going to work the farm himself or hire it out or let somebody else work it on shares I don t know said Fleda I think he is going to have a farmer and oversee things himself He ll get sick o that said Seth unless he s the luck to get hold of just the right hand Has he hired anybody yet said aunt Miriam after a little interval of supplying Fleda with bread and butter Yes ma am I believe so What s his name Donohan an Irishman I believe uncle Rolf hired him in New York For his head man said Seth with a sufficiently intelligible look Yes said Fleda Why But he did not immediately answer her The land s in poor heart now said he a good deal of it it has been wasted it wants first rate management to bring it in order and make much of it for two or three years to come I never see an Irishman s head yet that was worth more than a joke Their hands are all of em that s good for anything I believe uncle Rolf wants to have an American to go with this man said Fleda Seth said nothing but Fleda understood the shake of his head as he reached over after a pickle Are you going to keep a dairy Fleda said her aunt I don t know ma am I haven t heard anything about it Does missus Rossitur know anything about country affairs No nothing Fleda said her heart sinking perceptibly with every new question She hasn t any cows yet She any cows But Fleda only said they had not come she believed they were coming What help has she got Two women Irishwomen said Fleda Mother you ll have to take hold and learn her said mister Plumfield Teach her cried Fleda repelling the idea aunt Lucy she cannot do anything she isn t strong enough not anything of that kind What did she come here for said Seth You know said his mother that mister Rossitur s circumstances obliged him to quit New York Ay but that ain t my question A man had better keep his fingers off anything he can t live by A farm s one thing or t other just as it s worked The land won t grow specie it must be fetched out of it Is mister Rossitur a smart man Very Fleda said about everything but farming Well if he ll put himself to school maybe he ll learn Seth concluded as he finished his breakfast and went off Fleda rose too and was standing thoughtfully by the fire when aunt Miriam came up and put her arms round her Fleda s eyes sparkled again You re not changed you re the same little Fleda she said Not quite so little said Fleda smiling Not quite so little but my own darling The world hasn t spoiled thee yet I hope not aunt Miriam You have remembered your mother s prayer Fleda Always How tenderly aunt Miriam s hand was passed over the bowed head how fondly she pressed her And Fleda s answer was as fond I wanted to bring Hugh up to see you aunt Miriam with me but he couldn t come You will like Hugh He is so good I will come down and see him said aunt Miriam and then she went to look after her oven s doings Fleda stood by amused to see the quantities of nice things that were rummaged out of it They did not look like missus Renney s work but she knew from old experience that they were good How early you must have been up to put these things in said Fleda Put them in yes and make them These were all made this morning Fleda This morning before breakfast Why the sun was only just rising when I set out to come up the hill and I wasn t long coming aunt Miriam To be sure that s the way to get things done Before breakfast What time do you breakfast Fleda Not till eight or nine o clock Eight or nine Here There hasn t been any change made yet and I don t suppose there will be Uncle Rolf is always up early but he can t bear to have breakfast early Aunt Miriam s face showed what she thought and Fleda went away with all its gravity and doubt settled like lead upon her heart Though she had one of the identical apple pies in her hands which aunt Miriam had quietly said was for her and Hugh and though a pleasant savour of old times was about it Fleda could not get up again the bright feeling with which she had come up the hill There was a miserable misgiving at heart It would work off in time It had begun to work off when at the foot of the hill she met her uncle He was coming after her to ask mister Plumfield about the desideratum of a Yankee Fleda put her pie in safety behind a rock and turned back with him and aunt Miriam told them the way to Seth s ploughing ground A pleasant word or two had get Fleda s spirits a bounding again and the walk was delightful Truly the leaves were not on the trees but it was April and they soon would be there was promise in the light and hope in the air and everything smelt of the country and spring time The soft tread of the sod that her foot had not felt for so long the fresh look of the newly turned earth here and there the brilliance of a field of winter grain and that nameless beauty of the budding trees that the full luxuriance of summer can never equal Fleda s heart was springing for sympathy And to her with whom association was everywhere so strong there was in it all a shadowy presence of her grandfather with whom she had so often seen the spring time bless those same hills and fields long ago She walked on in silence as her manner commonly was when deeply pleased there were hardly two persons to whom she would speak her mind freely then mister Kossitur had his own thoughts Can anything equal the spring time she burst forth at length Her uncle looked at her and smiled Perhaps not but it is one thing said he sighing for taste to enjoy and another thing for calculation to improve But one can do both can t one said Fleda brightly I don t know said he sighing again Hardly Fleda knew he was mistaken and thought the sighs out of place But they reached her and she had hardly condemned them before they set her off upon a long train of excuses for him and she had wrought herself into quite a fit of tenderness by the time they reached her cousin They found him on a gentle side hill with two other men and teams both of whom were stepping away in different parts of the field mister Plumfield was just about setting off to work his way to the other side of the lot when they came up with him Fleda was not ashamed of her aunt Miriam s son even before such critical eyes as those of her uncle Farmer like as were his dress and air they shewed him nevertheless a well built fine looking man with the independent bearing of one who has never recognised any but mental or moral superiority His face might have been called handsome there was at least manliness in every line of it and his excellent dark eye shewed an equal mingling of kindness and acute common sense Let mister Plumfield wear what clothes he would one felt obliged to follow Burns notable example and pay respect to the man that was in them A fine day sir he remarked to mister Rossitur after they had shaken hands Yes and I will not interrupt you but a minute mister Plumfield I am in want of hands hands for this very business you are about ploughing and Fleda says you know everybody so I have come to ask if you can direct me Heads or hands do you want said Seth clearing his boot sole from some superfluous soil upon the share of his plough Why both to tell you the truth I want hands and teams for that matter for I have only two and I suppose there is no time to be lost And I want very much to get a person thoroughly acquainted with the business to go along with my man He is an Irishman and I am afraid not very well accustomed to the ways of doing things here Like enough said Seth and the worst of em is you can t learn em Well can you help me mister Douglass said Seth raising his voice to speak to one of his assistants who was approaching them mister Douglass you re holding that ere plough a little too obleekly for my grounds Very good mister Plumfield said the person called upon with a quick accent that intimated If you don t know what is best it is not my affair the voice very peculiar seeming to come from no lower than the top of his throat with a guttural roll of the words Is that Earl Douglass said Fleda You remember him said her cousin smiling He s just where he was and his wife too Well mister Rossitur tain t very easy to find what you want just at this season when most folks have their hands full and help is all taken up I ll see if I can t come down and give you a lift myself with the ploughing for a day or two as I m pretty beforehand with the spring but you ll want more than that I ain t sure I haven t more hands than I ll want myself but I think it is possible Squire Springer may spare you one of his n He ain t taking in any new land this year and he s got things pretty snug I guess he don t care to do any more than common anyhow you might try You know where uncle Joshua lives Fleda Well Philetus what now They had been slowly walking along the fence towards the furthest of mister Plumfield s coadjutors upon whom his eye had been curiously fixed as he was speaking a young man who was an excellent sample of what is called the raw material He had just come to a sudden stop in the midst of the furrow when his employer called to him and he answered somewhat lack a daisically Why I ve broke this here clevis I ha n t touched anything nor nothing and it broke right in teu What do you s pose ll be done now said mister Plumfield gravely going up to examine the fracture Well twa n t none of my doings said the young man I ha n t touched anything nor nothing and the mean thing broke right in teu Tain t so handy as the old kind o plough by a long jump You go long down to the house and ask my mother for a new clevis and talk about ploughs when you know how to hold em said mister Plumfield It don t look so difficult a matter said mister Rossitur but I am a novice myself What is the principal thing to be attended to in ploughing mister Plumfield There was a twinkle in Seth s eye as he looked down upon a piece of straw he was breaking to bits which Fleda who could see interpreted thoroughly Well said he looking up the breadth of the stitches and the width and depth of the farrow must be regulated according to the nature of the soil and the lay of the ground and what you re ploughing for there s stubble ploughing and breaking up old lays and ploughing for fallow crops and ribbing where the land has been some years in grass and so on and the plough must be geared accordingly and so as not to take too much land nor go out of the land and after that the best part of the work is to guide the plough right and run the furrows straight and even He spoke with the most impenetrable gravity while mister Rossitur looked blank and puzzled Fleda could hardly keep her countenance That row of poles said mister Rossitur presently are they to guide you in running the furrow straight Yes sir they are to mark out the crown of the stitch I keep em right between the horses and plough em down one after another It s a kind of way country folks play at ninepins said Seth with a glance half inquisitive half sly at his questioner mister Rossitur asked no more Fleda felt a little uneasy again It was rather a longish walk to uncle Joshua s and hardly a word spoken on either side The old gentleman was to hum and while Fleda went back into some remote part of the house to see aunt Syra mister Rossitur set forth his errand Well and so you re looking for help eh said uncle Joshua when he had heard him through Yes sir I want help And a team too So I have said sir mister Rossitur answered rather shortly Can you supply me Well I don t know as I can said the old man rubbing his hands slowly over his knees You ha n t got much done yet I s pose Nothing I came the day before yesterday Land s in rather poor condition in some parts ain t it I really am not able to say sir till I have seen it It ought to be said the old gentleman shaking his head the fellow that was there last didn t do right by it he worked the land too hard and didn t put on it anywhere near what he had ought to I guess you ll find it pretty poor in some places He was trying to get all he could out of it I s pose There s a good deal of fencing to be done too ain t there All that there was sir I have done none since I came Seth Plumfield got through ploughing yet We found him at it Ay he s a smart man What are you going to do mister Rossitur with that piece of marsh land that lies off to the south east of the barn beyond the meadow between the hills I had just sich another and I Before I do anything with the wet land mister I am so unhappy as to have forgotten your name Springer sir said the old gentleman Springer Joshua Springer That is my name sir mister Springer before I do anything with the wet land I should like to have something growing on the dry and as that is the present matter in hand will you be so good as to let me know whether I can have your assistance Well I don t know said the old gentleman there ain t anybody to send but my boy Lucas and I don t know whether he would make up his mind to go or not Well sir said mister Rossitur rising in that case I will bid you good morning I am sorry to have given you the trouble Stop said the old man stop a bit Just sit down I ll go in and see about it mister Rossitur sat down and uncle Joshua left him to go into the kitchen and consult his wife without whose counsel of late years especially he rarely did anything They never varied in opinion but aunt Syra s wits supplied the steel edge to his heavy metal I don t know but Lucas would as leave go as not the old gentleman remarked on coming back from this sharpening process and I can make out to spare him I guess You calculate to keep him I s pose Until this press is over and perhaps longer if I find he can do what I want You ll find him pretty handy at a most anything but I mean I s pose he ll get his victuals with you I have made no arrangements of the kind said mister Rossitur controlling with some effort his rebelling muscles Donohan is boarded somewhere else and for the present it will be best for all in my employ to follow the same plan Very good said uncle Joshua it makes no difference only of course in that case it is worth more when a man has to find himself and his team Whatever it is worth I am quite ready to pay sir Very good You and Lucas can agree about that He ll be along in the morning So they parted and Fleda understood the impatient quick step with which her uncle got over the ground Is that man a brother of your grandfather No sir Oh no only his brother in law My grandmother was his sister but they weren t in the least like each other I should think they could not said mister Rossitur Oh they were not Fleda repeated I have always heard that After paying her respects to aunt Syra in the kitchen she had come back time enough to hear the end of the discourse in the parlour and had felt its full teaching Doubts returned and her spirits were sobered again Not another word was spoken till they reached home when Fleda seized upon Hugh and went off to the rock after her forsaken pie Have you succeeded asked missus Rossitur while they were gone Yes that is a cousin has kindly consented to come and help me A cousin said missus Rossitur Ay we re in a nest of cousins In a what mister Rossitur In a nest of cousins and I had rather be in a nest of rooks I wonder if I shall be expected to ask my ploughmen to dinner Every second man is a cousin and the rest are uncles Chapter XIX Whilst skies are blue and bright Whilst flowers are gay Whilst eyes that change ere night Make glad the day Whilst yet the calm hours creep Dream thou and from thy sleep Then wake to weep Shelley The days of summer flew by for the most part lightly over the heads of Hugh and Fleda The farm was little to them but a place of pretty and picturesque doings and the scene of nameless delights by wood and stream in all which all that summer Fleda rejoiced pulling Hugh along with her even when sometimes he would rather have been poring over his books at home She laughingly said it was good for him and one half at least of every fine day their feet were abroad They knew nothing practically of the dairy but that it was an inexhaustible source of the sweetest milk and butter and indirectly of the richest custards and syllabubs The flock of sheep that now and then came in sight running over the hill side were to them only an image of pastoral beauty and a soft link with the beauty of the past The two children took the very cream of country life The books they had left were read with greater eagerness than ever When the weather was too lovely to stay in the house Shakspeare or Massillon or Sully or the Curiosities of Literature or Corinne or Milner s Church History for Fleda s reading was as miscellaneous as ever was enjoyed under the flutter of leaves and along with the rippling of the mountain spring whilst King curled himself up on the skirt of his mistress s gown and slept for company hardly more thoughtless and fearless of harm than his two companions Now and then Fleda opened her eyes to see that her uncle was moody and not like himself and that her aunt s gentle face was clouded in consequence and she could not sometimes help the suspicion that he was not making a farmer of himself but the next summer wind would blow these thoughts away or the next look of her flowers would put them out of her head The whole courtyard in front of the house had been given up to her peculiar use as a flower garden and there she and Hugh made themselves very busy But the summer time came to an end It was a November morning and Fleda had been doing some of the last jobs in her flower beds She was coming in with spirits as bright as her cheeks when her aunt s attitude and look more than usually spiritless suddenly checked them Fleda gave her a hopeful kiss and asked for the explanation How bright you look darling said her aunt stroking her cheek Yes but you don t aunt Lucy What has happened Mary and Jane are going away Going away What for They are tired of the place don t like it I suppose Very foolish of them Well aunt Lucy what matter we can get plenty more in their room Not from the city not possible they would not come at this time of year Sure Well then here we can at any rate Here But what sort of persons shall we get here And your uncle just think O but I think we can manage said Fleda When do Mary and Jane want to go Immediately to morrow they are not willing to wait till we can get somebody Think of it Well let them go said Fleda the sooner the better Yes and I am sure I don t want to keep them but and missus Rossitur wrung her hands I haven t money enough to pay them quite and they won t go without it Fleda felt shocked so much that she could not help looking it But can t uncle Rolf give it you missus Rossitur shook her head I have asked him How much is wanting Twenty five Think of his not being able to give me that missus Rossitur burst into tears Now don t aunt Lucy said Fleda guarding well her own composure you know he has had a great deal to spend upon the farm and paying men and all and it is no wonder that he should be a little short just now now cheer up we can get along with this anyhow I asked him said missus Rossitur through her tears when he would be able to give it to me and he told me he didn t know Fleda ventured no reply but some of the tenderest caresses that lips and arms could give and then sprang away and in three minutes was at her aunt s side again Look here aunt Lucy said she gently here is twenty dollars if you can manage the five Where did you get this missus Rossitur exclaimed I got it honestly It is mine aunt Lucy said Fleda smiling Uncle Orrin gave me some money just before we came away to do what I liked with and I haven t wanted to do anything with it till now But this seemed to hurt missus Rossitur more than all the rest Leaning her head forward upon Fleda s breast and clasping her arms about her she cried worse tears than Fleda had seen her shed If it had not been for the emergency Fleda would have broken down utterly too That it should have come to this I can t take it dear Fleda Yes you must aunt Lucy said Fleda soothingly I couldn t do anything else with it that would give me so much pleasure I don t want it it would lie in my drawer till I don t know when We ll let these people be off as soon as they please Don t take it so uncle Rolf will have money again only just now he is out I suppose and we ll get somebody else in the kitchen that will do nicely you see if we don t missus Rossitur s embrace said what words were powerless to say But I don t know how we re to find any one here in the country I don t know who ll go to look I am sure your uncle won t want to and Hugh wouldn t know I ll go said Fleda cheerfully Hugh and I We can do famously if you ll trust me I won t promise to bring home a French cook No indeed we must take what we can get But you can get no one to day and they will be off by the morning s coach what shall we do to morrow for dinner Your uncle I ll get dinner said Fleda caressing her I ll take all that on myself It sha n t be a bad dinner either Uncle Rolf will like what I do for him I dare say Now cheer up aunt Lucy do that s all I ask of you Won t you for me She longed to speak a word of that quiet hope with which in every trouble she secretly comforted herself she wanted to whisper the words that were that moment in her own mind Truly I know that it shall be well with them that fear God but her natural reserve and timidity kept her lips shut to her grief The women were paid off and dismissed and departed in the next day s coach from Montepoole Fleda stood at the front door to see them go with a curious sense that there was an empty house at her back and indeed upon her back And in spite of all the cheeriness of her tone to her aunt she was not without some shadowy feeling that soberer times might be coming upon them What is to be done now said Hugh close beside her O we are going to get somebody else said Fleda Where I don t know You and I are going to find out You and I Yes We are going out after dinner Hugh dear said she turning her bright merry face towards him to pick up somebody Linking her arm within his she went back to the deserted kitchen premises to see how her promise about taking Mary s place was to be fulfilled Do you know where to look said Hugh I ve a notion but the first thing is dinner that uncle Rolf mayn t think the world is turning topsy turvy There is nothing at all here Hugh nothing in the world but bread it s a blessing there is that Uncle Rolf will have to be satisfied with a coffee dinner to day and I ll make him the most superb omelette that my skill is equal to Hugh dear you shall set the table You don t know how then you shall make the toast and I will set it the first thing of all You perceive it is well to know how to do everything mister Hugh Rossitur Where did you learn to make omelettes said Hugh with laughing admiration as Fleda bared two pretty arms and ran about the very impersonation of good humoured activity The table was set the coffee was making and she had him established at the fire with two great plates a pile of slices of bread and a toasting iron Where Oh don t you remember the days of missus Renney I have seen Emile make them And by dint of trying to teach Mary this summer I have taught myself There is no knowing you see what a person may come to I wonder what father would say if he knew you had made all the coffee this summer That is an unnecessary speculation my dear Hugh as I have no intention of telling him But see that is the way with speculators While they go on refining the toast burns The coffee and the omelette and the toast and mister Rossitur s favourite French salad were served with beautiful accuracy and he was quite satisfied But aunt Lucy looked sadly at Fleda s flushed face and saw that her appetite seemed to have gone off in the steam of her preparations Fleda had a kind of heart feast however which answered as well Hugh harnessed the little wagon for no one was at hand to do it and he and Fleda set off as early as possible after dinner Fleda s thoughts had turned to her old acquaintance Cynthia Gall who she knew was out of employment and staying at home somewhere near Montepoole They got the exact direction from aunt Miriam who approved of her plan It was a pleasant peaceful drive they had They never were alone together they two but vexations seemed to lose their power or be forgotten and an atmosphere of quietness gather about them the natural element of both hearts It might refuse its presence to one but the attraction of both together was too strong to be resisted Miss Cynthia s present abode was in an out of the way place and a good distance off they were some time in reaching it The barest looking and dingiest of houses set plump in a green field without one softening or home like touch from any home feeling within not a flower not a shrub not an out house not a tree near One would have thought it a deserted house but that a thin wreath of smoke lazily stole up from one of the brown chimneys and graceful as that was it took nothing from the hard stern barrenness below which told of a worse poverty than that of paint and glazing Can this be the place said Hugh It must be You stay here with the horse and I ll go in and seek my fortune Don t promise much said Fleda shaking her head The house stood back from the road Fleda picked her way to it along a little footpath which seemed to be the equal property of the geese Her knock brought an invitation to come in An elderly woman was sitting there whose appearance did not mend the general impression She had the same dull and unhopeful look that her house had Does missus Gall live here I do said this person Is Cynthia at home The woman upon this raised her voice and directed it at an inner door Lucindy said she in a diversity of tones Lucindy tell Cynthy here s somebody wants to see her But no one answered and throwing the work from her lap the woman muttered she would go and see and left Fleda with a cold invitation to sit down Dismal work Fleda wished herself out of it The house did not look poverty stricken within but poverty must have struck to the very heart Fleda thought where there was no apparent cherishing of anything There was no absolute distress visible neither was there a sign of real comfort or of a happy home She could not fancy it was one She waited so long that she was sure Cynthia did not hold herself in readiness to see company And when the lady at last came in it was with very evident marks of smarting up about her Why it s Flidda Ringgan said Miss Gall after a dubious look or two at her visitor How do you do I didn t spect to see you How much you have growed She looked really pleased and gave Fleda s hand a very strong grasp as she shook it There ain t no fire here to day pursued Cynthy paying her attentions to the fireplace we let it go down on account of our being all busy out at the back of the house I guess you re cold ain t you Fleda said no and remembered that the woman she had first seen was certainly not busy at the back of the house nor anywhere else but in that very room where she had found her deep in a pile of patchwork I heerd you had come to the old place Were you glad to be back again Cynthy asked with a smile that might be taken to express some doubt upon the subject I was very glad to see it again I hain t seen it in a great while I ve been staying to hum this year or two I got tired o going out Cynthy remarked with again a smile very peculiar and Fleda thought a little sardonical She did not know how to answer Well how do you come along down yonder Cynthy went on making a great fuss with the shovel and tongs to very little purpose Ha you come all the way from Queechy Yes I came on purpose to see you Cynthy Without staying to ask what for Miss Gall now went out to the back of the house and came running in again with a live brand pinched in the tongs and a long tail of smoke running after it Fleda would have compounded for no fire and no choking The choking was only useful to give her time to think She was uncertain how to bring in her errand And how is Mis Plumfield said Cynthy in an interval of blowing the brand She is quite well but Cynthy you need not have taken all that trouble for me I cannot stay but a few minutes There is wood enough Cynthia remarked with one of her grim smiles an assertion Fleda could not help doubting Indeed she thought Miss Gall had grown altogether more disagreeable than she used to be in old times Why she could not divine unless the souring effect had gone on with the years And what s become of Earl Douglass and Mis Douglass I hain t heerd nothin of em this great while I always told your grandpa he d ha saved himself a great deal o trouble if he d ha let Earl Douglass take hold of things You ha n t got mister Didenhover into the works again I guess have you He was there a good spell after your grandpa died I haven t seen missus Douglass said Fleda But Cynthy what do you think I have come here for I don t know said Cynthy with another of her peculiar looks directed at the fire I s pose you want someh n nother of me I have come to see if you wouldn t come and live with my aunt missus Rossitur We are left alone and want somebody very much and I thought I would find you out and see if we couldn t have you first of all before I looked for anybody else Cynthy was absolutely silent She sat before the fire her feet stretched out towards it as far as they would go and her arms crossed and not moving her steady gaze at the smoking wood or the chimney back whichever it might be but there was in the corners of her mouth the threatening of a smile that Fleda did not at all like What do you say to it Cynthy I reckon you d best get somebody else said Miss Gall with a kind of condescending dryness and the smile shewing a little more Why said Fleda I would a great deal rather have an old friend than a stranger Be you the housekeeper said Cynthy a little abruptly O I am a little of everything said Fleda cook and housekeeper and whatever comes first I want you to come and be housekeeper Cynthy I reckon Mis Rossitur don t have much to do with her help does she said Cynthy after a pause during which the corners of her mouth never changed The tone of piqued independence let some light into Fleda s mind She is not strong enough to do much herself and she wants some one that will take all the trouble from her You d have the field all to yourself Cynthy Your aunt sets two tables I calculate don t she Yes my uncle doesn t like to have any but his own family around him I guess I shouldn t suit said Miss Gall after another little pause and stooping very diligently to pick up some scattered shreds from the floor But Fleda could see the flushed face and the smile which pride and a touch of spiteful pleasure in the revenge she was taking made particularly hateful She needed no more convincing that Miss Gall wouldn t suit but she was sorry at the same time for the perverseness that had so needlessly disappointed her and went rather pensively back again down the little foot path to the waiting wagon This is hardly the romance of life dear Hugh she said as she seated herself Haven t you succeeded Fleda shook her head What s the matter O pride injured pride of station The wrong of not coming to our table and putting her knife into our butter And living in such a place said Hugh You don t know what a place They are miserably poor I am sure and yet I suppose that the less people have to be proud of the more they make of what is left Poor people Poor Fleda said Hugh looking at her What will you do now O we ll do somehow said she cheerfully Perhaps it is just as well after all for Cynthy isn t the smartest woman in the world I remember grandpa used to say he didn t believe she could get a bean into the middle of her bread A bean into the middle of her bread said Hugh But Fleda s sobriety was quite banished by his mystified look and her laugh rang along over the fields before she answered him That laugh had blown away all the vapours for the present at least and they jogged on again very sociably Do you know said Fleda after a while of silent enjoyment in the changes of scene and the mild autumn weather I am not sure that it wasn t very well for me that we came away from New York I dare say it was said Hugh since we came but what makes you say so I don t mean that it was for anybody else but for me I think I was a little proud of our nice things there You Fleda said Hugh with a look of appreciating affection Yes I was a little It didn t make the greatest part of my love for them I am sure but I think I had a little undefined sort of pleasure in the feeling that they were better and prettier than other people had You are sure you are not proud of your little King Charles now said Hugh I don t know but I am said Fleda laughing But how much pleasanter it is here on almost every account Look at the beautiful sweep of the ground off among those hills isn t it What an exquisite horizon line Hugh And what a sky over it Yes I love these fall skies Oh I would a great deal rather be here than in any city that ever was built So would I said Hugh But the thing is Fleda knew quite well what the thing was and did not answer But my dear Hugh she said presently I don t remember that sweep of hills when we were coming You were going the other way said Hugh Yes but Hugh I am sure we did not pass these grain fields We must have got into the wrong road Hugh drew the reins and looked and doubted There is a house yonder said Fleda we had better drive on and ask There is no house Yes there is behind that piece of wood Look over it don t you see a light curl of blue smoke against the sky We never passed that house and wood I am certain We ought to make haste for the afternoons are short now and you will please to recollect there is nobody at home to get tea I hope Lucas will get upon one of his everlasting talks with father said Hugh And that it will hold till we get home said Fleda It will be the happiest use Lucas has made of his tongue in a good while Just as they stopped before a substantial looking farm house a man came from the other way and stopped there too with his hand upon the gate How far are we from Queechy sir said Hugh You re not from it at all sir said the man politely You re in Queechy sir at present Is this the right road from Montepoole to Queechy village It is not sir It is a very tortuous direction indeed Have I not the pleasure of speaking to mister Rossitur s young gentleman mister Rossitur s young gentleman acknowledged his relationship and begged the favour of being set in the right way home With much pleasure You have been shewing Miss Rossitur the picturesque country about Montepoole My cousin and I have been there on business and lost our way coming back Ah I dare say Very easy First time you have been there Yes sir and we are in a hurry to get home Well sir you know the road by Deacon Patterson s comes out just above the lake Hugh did not remember Well you keep this road straight on I m sorry you are in a hurry you keep on till do you know when you strike mister Harris s ground No Hugh knew nothing about it nor Fleda Well I ll tell you now how it is said the stranger if you ll permit me You and your a cousin come in and do us the pleasure of taking some refreshment I know my sister ll have her table set out by this time and I ll do myself the honour of introducing you to a these strange roads afterwards Thank you sir but that trouble is unnecessary cannot you direct us No trouble indeed sir I assure you I should esteem it a favour very highly I I am doctor Quackenboss sir you may have heard Thank you doctor Quackenboss but we have no time this afternoon we are very anxious to reach home as soon as possible if you would be be so good as to put us in the way Illustration Well sir you know the road by Deacon Patterson s I really sir I am afraid to a person ignorant of the various localities You will lose no time I will just hitch your horse here and I ll have mine ready by the time this young lady has rested Miss a won t you join with me I assure you I will not put you to the expense of a minute Thank you mister Harden Just clap the saddle on to Lollypop and have him up here in three seconds Thank you My dear Miss a won t you take my arm I am gratified I assure you Yielding to the apparent impossibility of getting anything out of doctor Quackenboss except civility and to the real difficulty of disappointing such very earnest good will Fleda and Hugh did what older persons would not have done alighted and walked up to the house This is quite a fortuitous occurrence the doctor went on I have often had the pleasure of seeing mister Rossitur s family in church in the little church at Queechy Run and that enabled me to recognise your cousin as soon as I saw him in the wagon Perhaps Miss a you may have possibly heard of my name Quackenboss I don t know that you understood I have heard it sir My Irishmen Miss a my Irish labourers can t get hold of but one end of it they call me Boss ha ha ha Fleda hoped his patients did not get hold of the other end of it and trembled visibly Hard to pull a man s name to pieces before his face ha ha but I am a not one thing myself a kind of heterogynous I am a piece of a physician and a little in the agricultural line also so it s all fair The Irish treat my name as hardly doctor Quackenboss they call me nothing but Miss Ring again And then Fleda could laugh and laugh she did so heartily that the doctor was delighted Ring again ha ha Very good Well Miss a I shouldn t think that anybody in your service would ever a ever let you put your name in practice But Fleda s delight at the excessive gallantry and awkwardness of this speech was almost too much or as the doctor pleasantly remarked her nerves were too many for her and every one of them was dancing by the time they reached the hall door The doctor s flourishes lost not a bit of their angularity from his tall ungainly figure and a lantern jawed face the lower member of which had now and then a somewhat lateral play when he was speaking which curiously aided the quaint effect of his words He ushered his guests into the house seeming in a flow of self gratulation The supper table was spread sure enough and hovering about it was the doctor s sister a lady in whom Fleda only saw a Dutch face with eyes that made no impression disagreeable fair hair and a string of gilt beads round her neck A painted yellow floor under foot a room that looked excessively wooden and smelt of cheese bare walls and a well filled table was all that she took in besides I have the honour of presenting you to my sister said the doctor with suavity Flora the Irish domestics of this young lady call her name Miss Ring again if she will let us know how it ought to be called we shall be happy to be informed doctor Quackenboss was made happy Miss Ringgan and this young gentleman is young mister Rossitur the gentleman that has taken Squire Ringgan s old place We were so fortunate as to have them lose their way this afternoon coming from the Pool and they have just stepped in to see if you can t find em a mouthful of something they can eat while Lollypop is a getting ready to see them home Poor Miss Flora immediately disappeared into the kitchen to order a bit of superior cheese and to have some slices of ham put on the gridiron and then coming back to the common room went rummaging about from cupboard to cupboard in search of cake and sweetmeats Fleda protested and begged in vain She was so sorry she hadn t knowed Miss Flora said she d ha had some cakes made that maybe they could have eaten but the bread was dry and the cheese wa n t as good somehow as the last one they cut maybe Miss Ringgan would prefer a piece of newer made if she liked it and she hadn t had good luck with her preserves last summer the most of em had fomented she thought it was the damp weather but there was some stewed pears that maybe she would be so good as to approve and there was some ham whatever else it was it was hot It was impossible it was impossible to do dishonour to all this hospitality and kindness and pride that was brought out for them Early or late they must eat in mere gratitude The difficulty was to avoid eating everything Hugh and Fleda managed to compound the matter with each other one taking the cake and pears and the other the ham and cheese In the midst of all this over flow of good will Fleda bethought her to ask if Miss Flora knew of any girl or woman that would go out to service Miss Flora took the matter into grave consideration as soon as her anxiety on the subject of their cups of tea had subsided She did not commit herself but thought it possible that one of the Finns might be willing to go out Where do they live It s a not far from Queechy Run said the doctor whose now and then hesitation in the midst of his speech was never for want of a thought but simply and merely for the best words to clothe it in Is it in our way to night He could make it so the doctor said with pleasure for it would give him permission to gallant them a little further They had several miles yet to go and the sun went down as they were passing through Queechy Run Under that still cool clear autumn sky Fleda would have enjoyed the ride very much but that her unfulfilled errand was weighing upon her and she feared her aunt and uncle might want her services before she could be at home Still late as it was she determined to stop for a minute at missus Finn s and go home with a clear conscience At her door and not till there the doctor was prevailed upon to part company the rest of the way being perfectly plain Not I at least I think not But Hugh don t say anything about all this to aunt Lucy She would be troubled Fleda had certainly when she came away no notion of improving her acquaintance with Miss Anastasia but the supper and the breakfast and the dinner of the next day with all the nameless and almost numberless duties of housework that filled up the time between wrought her to a very strong sense of the necessity of having some kind of help soon missus Rossitur wearied herself excessively with doing very little and then looked so sad to see Fleda working on that it was more disheartening and harder to bear than the fatigue Hugh was a most faithful and invaluable coadjutor and his lack of strength was like her own made up by energy of will but neither of them could bear the strain long and when the final clearing away of the dinner dishes gave her a breathing time she resolved to dress herself and put her thimble in her pocket and go over to Miss Finn s quilting Miss Lucy might not be like Miss Anastasia and if she were anything that had hands and feet to move instead of her own would be welcome Hugh went with her to the door and was to come for her at sunset Chapter XX With superfluity of breeding First makes you sick and then with feeding Jenyns Miss Anastasia was a little surprised and a good deal gratified Fleda saw by her coming and played the hostess with great benignity The quilting frame was stretched in an upper room not in the long kitchen to Fleda s joy most of the company were already seated at it and she had to go through a long string of introductions before she was permitted to take her place First of all Earl Douglass s wife who rose up and taking both Fleda s hands squeezed and shook them heartily giving her with eye and lip a most genial welcome This lady had every look of being a very clever woman a manager she was said to be and indeed her very nose had a little pinch which prepared one for nothing superfluous about her Even her dress could not have wanted another breadth from the skirt and had no fulness to spare about the body Neat as a pin though and a well to do look through it all Miss Quackenboss Fleda recognised as an old friend gilt beads and all Catherine Douglass had grown up to a pretty girl during the five years since Fleda had left Queechy and gave her a greeting half smiling half shy There was a little more affluence about the flow of her drapery and the pink ribbon round her neck was confined by a little dainty Jew s harp of a brooch she had her mother s pinch of the nose too Then there were two other young ladies Miss Letitia Ann Thornton a tall grown girl in pantalettes evidently a would be aristocrat from the air of her head and lip with a well looking face and looking well knowing of the same and sporting neat little white cuffs at her wrists the only one who bore such a distinction The third of these damsels Jessie Healy impressed Fleda with having been brought up upon coarse meat and having grown heavy in consequence the other two were extremely fair and delicate both in complexion and feature Her aunt Syra Fleda recognised without particular pleasure and managed to seat herself at the quilt with the sewing woman and Miss Hannah between them Miss Lucy Finn she found seated at her right hand but after all the civilities she had just gone through Fleda had not courage just then to dash into business with her and Miss Lucy herself stitched away and was dumb So were the rest of the party rather The presence of the new comer seemed to have the effect of a spell Fleda could not think they had been as silent before her joining them as they were for some time afterwards The young ladies were absolutely mute and conversation seemed to flag even among the elder ones and if Fleda ever raised her eyes from the quilt to look at somebody she was sure to see somebody s eyes looking at her with a curiosity well enough defined and mixed with a more or less amount of benevolence and pleasure Fleda was growing very industrious and feeling her cheeks grow warm when the checked stream of conversation began to take revenge by turning its tide upon her Are you glad to be back to Queechy Fleda said missus Douglass from the opposite far end of the quilt Yes ma am said Fleda smiling back her answer on some accounts Ain t she growed like her father Mis Douglass said the sewing woman Do you recollect Walter Ringgan what a handsome feller he was The two opposite girls immediately found something to say to each other She ain t a bit more like him than she is like her mother said missus Douglass biting off the end of her thread energetically Amy Ringgan was a sweet good woman as ever was in this town Again her daughter s glance and smile went over to the speaker You stay in Queechy and live like Queechy folks do missus Douglass added nodding encouragingly and you ll beat both on em But this speech jarred and Fleda wished it had not been spoken How does your uncle like farming said aunt Syra A home thrust which Fleda parried by saying he had hardly got accustomed to it yet What s been his business what has he been doing all his life till now said the sewing woman Fleda replied that he had had no business and after the minds of the company had had time to entertain this statement she was startled by Miss Lucy s voice at her elbow It seems kind o curious don t it that a man should live to be forty or fifty years old and not know anything of the earth he gets his bread from What makes you think he don t said Miss Thornton rather tartly She wa n t speaking o nobody said aunt Syra I was I was speaking of man I was speaking abstractly said Fleda s right hand neighbour What s abstractly said Miss Anastasia scornfully Where do you get hold of such hard words Lucy said missus Douglass I don t know Mis Douglass they come to me it s practice I suppose I had no intention of being obscure One kind o word s as easy as another I suppose when you re used to it ain t it said the sewing woman What s abstractly said the mistress of the house again Look in the dictionary if you want to know said her sister I don t want to know I only want you to tell When do you get time for it Lucy ha n t you nothing else to practise pursued missus Douglass Yes Mis Douglass but then there are times for exertion and other times less disposable and when I feel thoughtful or low I commonly retire to my room and contemplate the stars or write a composition The sewing woman greeted this speech with an unqualified ha ha and Fleda involuntarily raised her head to look at the last speaker but there was nothing to be noticed about her except that she was in rather nicer order than the rest of the Finn family Did you get home safe last night inquired Miss Quackenboss bending forward over the quilt to look down to Fleda Fleda thanked her and replied that they had been overturned and had several ribs broken And where have you been Fleda all this while said missus Douglass Fleda told upon which all the quilting party raised their heads simultaneously to take another review of her Your uncle s wife ain t a Frenchwoman be she asked the sewing woman Fleda said oh no and Miss Quackenboss remarked that she thought she wa n t whereby Fleda perceived it had been a subject of discussion She lives like one don t she said aunt Syra Which imputation Fleda also refuted to the best of her power Well don t she have dinner in the middle of the afternoon pursued aunt Syra Fleda was obliged to admit that And she can t eat without she has a fresh piece of roast meat on table every day can she It is not always roast said Fleda half vexed and half laughing I d rather have a good dish o bread and lasses than the hull on t observed old missus Finn from the corner where she sat manifestly turning up her nose at the far off joints on missus Rossitur s dinner table The girls on the other side of the quilt again held counsel together deep and low Well didn t she pick up all them notions in that place yonder where you say she has been aunt Syra went on No said Fleda everybody does so in New York I want to know what kind of a place New York is now said old missus Finn drawlingly I s pose it s pretty big ain t it Fleda replied that it was I shouldn t wonder if it was a most as far as from here to Queechy Run now ain t it The distance mentioned being somewhere about one eighth of New York s longest diameter Fleda answered that it was quite as far I s pose there s plenty o mighty rich folks there ain t there Plenty I believe said Fleda I should hate to live in it awfully was the old woman s conclusion I should admire to travel in many countries said Miss Lucy for the first time seeming to intend her words particularly for Fleda s ear I think nothing makes people more genteel I have observed it frequently Fleda said it was very pleasant but though encouraged by this opening could not muster enough courage to ask if Miss Lucy had a notion to come and prove their gentility Her next question was startling if Fleda had ever studied mathematics No said Fleda Have you O my yes There was a lot of us concluded we would learn it and we commenced to study it a long time ago I think it s a most elevating The discussion was suddenly broken off for the sewing woman exclaimed as the other sister came in and took her seat Why Hannah you ha n t been makin bread with that crock on your hands Well Mis Barnes said the girl I ve washed em and I ve made bread with em and even that didn t take it off Do you look at the stars too Hannah said missus Douglass Amidst a small hubbub of laugh and talk which now became general poor Fleda fell back upon one single thought one wish that Hugh would come to fetch her home before tea time But it was a vain hope Hugh was not to be there till sundown and supper was announced long before that They all filed down and Fleda with them to the great kitchen below stairs and she found herself placed in the seat of honour indeed but an honour she would gladly have escaped at Miss Anastasia s right hand A temporary locked jaw would have been felt a blessing Fleda dared hardly even look about her but under the eye of her hostess the instinct of good breeding was found sufficient to swallow everything literally and figuratively There was a good deal to swallow The usual variety of cakes sweetmeats beef cheese biscuits and pies was set out with some peculiarity of arrangement which Fleda had never seen before and which left that of Miss Quackenboss elegant by comparison Down each side of the table ran an advanced guard of little sauces in Indian file but in companies of three the file leader of each being a saucer of custard its follower a ditto of preserves and the third keeping a sharp look out in the shape of pickles and to Fleda s unspeakable horror she discovered that the guests were expected to help themselves at will from these several stores with their own spoons transferring what they took either to their own plates or at once to its final destination which last mode several of the company preferred The advantage of this plan was the necessary great display of the new silver tea spoons which missus Douglass slyly hinted to aunt Syra were the moving cause of the tea party But aunt Syra swallowed sweetmeats and would not give heed There was no relief for poor Fleda Aunt Syra was her next neighbour and opposite to her at Miss Anastasia s left hand was the disagreeable countenance and peering eyes of the old crone her mother Fleda kept her own eyes fixed upon her plate and endeavoured to see nothing but that Why here s Fleda ain t eating anything said missus Douglass Won t you have some preserves take some custard do Anastasy she ha n t a spoon no wonder Fleda had secretly conveyed hers under cover There was one said Miss Anastasia looking about where one should have been I ll get another as soon as I give Mis Springer her tea Ha n t you got enough to go round said the old woman plucking at her daughter s sleeve Anastasy ha n t you got enough to go round This speech which was spoken with a most spiteful simplicity Miss Anastasia answered with superb silence and presently produced spoons enough to satisfy herself and the company But Fleda No earthly persuasion could prevail upon her to touch pickles sweetmeats or custard that evening and even in the bread and cakes she had a vision of hands before her that took away her appetite She endeavoured to make a shew with hung beef and cups of tea which indeed was not Pouchong but her supper came suddenly to an end upon a remark of her hostess addressed to the whole table that they needn t be surprised if they found any bite of pudding in the gingerbread for it was made from the molasses the children left the other day Who the children were Fleda did not know neither was it material It was sundown but Hugh had not come when they went to the upper rooms again Two were open now for they were small and the company promised not to be such Fathers and brothers and husbands began to come and loud talking and laughing and joking took place of the quilting chit chat Fleda would fain have absorbed herself in the work again but though the frame still stood there the minds of the company were plainly turned aside from their duty or perhaps they thought that Miss Anastasia had had admiration enough to dispense with service Nobody shewed a thimble but one or two old ladies and as numbers and spirits gathered strength a kind of romping game was set on foot in which a vast deal of kissing seemed to be the grand wit of the matter Fleda shrank away out of sight behind the open door of communication between the two rooms pleading with great truth that she was tired and would like to keep perfectly quiet and she had soon the satisfaction of being apparently forgotten In the other room some of the older people were enjoying themselves more soberly Fleda s ear was too near the crack of the door not to have the benefit of more of their conversation than she cared for It soon put quiet of mind out of the question He ll twist himself up pretty short that s my sense of it and he won t take long to do it nother said Earl Douglass s voice Fleda would have known it anywhere from its extreme peculiarity It never either rose or fell much from a certain pitch and at that level the words gurgled forth seemingly from an ever brimming fountain he never wanted one and the stream had neither let nor stay till his modicum of sense had fairly run out People thought he had not a greater stock of that than some of his neighbours but he issued an amount of word currency sufficient for the use of the county He ll run himself agin a post pretty quick said uncle Joshua in a confirmatory tone of voice Fleda had a confused idea that somebody was going to hang himself He ain t a workin things right said Douglass he ain t a workin things right he s takin hold o everything by the tail end He ain t studied the business he doesn t know when things is right and he doesn t know when things is wrong and if they re wrong he don t know how to set em right He s got a feller there that ain t no more fit to be there than I am to be Vice President of the United States and I ain t a going to say what I think I am fit for but I ha n t studied for that place and I shouldn t like to stand an examination for t and a man hadn t ought to be a farmer no more if he ha n t qualified himself That s my idee I like to see a thing done well if it s to be done at all and there ain t a stitch o land been laid right on the hull farm nor a furrow driv as it had ought to be since he come on to it and I say Squire Springer a man ain t going to get along in that way and he hadn t ought to I work hard myself and I calculate to work hard and I make a livin by t and I m content to work hard When I see a man with his hands in his pockets I think he ll have nothin else in em soon I don t believe he s done a hand s turn himself on the land the hull season And upon this mister Douglass brought up My son Lucas has been workin with him off and on pretty much the hull time since he come and he says he ha n t begun to know how to spell farmer yet Ay ay My wife she s a little harder on folks than I be I think it ain t worth while to say nothin of a man without I can say some good of him that s my idee and it don t do no harm nother but my wife she says he s got to let down his notions a peg or two afore they ll hitch just in the right place and I won t say but what I think she ain t maybe fur from right If a man s above his business he stands a pretty fair chance to be below it some day I won t say myself for I haven t any acquaintance with him and a man oughtn t to speak but of what he is knowing to but I have heerd say that he wa n t as conversationable as it would ha been handsome in him to be all things considerin There seems to be a good many things said of him somehow and I always think men don t talk of a man if he don t give em occasion but anyhow I ve been past the farm pretty often myself this summer workin with Seth Plumfield and I ve took notice of things myself and I know he s been makin beds o sparrowgrass when he had ought to ha been makin fences and he s been helpin that little girl o his n set her flowers when he would ha been better sot to work lookin after his Irishman but I don t know as it made much matter nother for if he went wrong mister Rossitur wouldn t know how to set him right and if he was a going right mister Rossitur would ha been just as likely to ha set him wrong Well I m sorry for him mister Rossitur is a most gentlemanlike man said the voice of doctor Quackenboss Ay I dare say he is Earl responded in precisely the same tone I was down to his house one day last summer to see him He wa n t to hum though It would be strange if harm come to a man with such a guardian angel in the house as that man has in his n said doctor Quackenboss Well she s a pretty creetur said Douglass looking up with some animation I wouldn t blame any man that sot a good deal by her I will say I think she s as handsome as my own darter and a man can t go no furder than that I suppose She won t help his farming much I guess said uncle Joshua nor his wife nother Fleda heard doctor Quackenboss coming through the doorway and started from her corner for fear he might find her out there and know what she had heard He very soon found her out in the new place she had chosen and came up to pay his compliments Fleda was in a mood for anything but laughing yet the mixture of the ludicrous which the doctor administered set her nerves a twitching Bringing his chair down sideways at one angle and his person at another so as to meet at the moment of the chair s touching the floor and with a look and smile slanting to match the doctor said Well Miss Ringgan has a missus Rossitur does she feel herself reconciled yet Reconciled sir said Fleda Yes a to Queechy She never quarrelled with it sir said Fleda quite unable to keep from laughing Yes I mean a she feels that she can sustain her spirits in different situations She is very well sir thank you It must have been a great change to her and to you all coming to this place Yes sir the country is very different from the city In what part of New York was mister Rossitur s former residence In State street sir State street that is somewhere in the direction of the Park No sir not exactly Was missus Rossitur a native of the city Not of New York O Hugh my dear Hugh exclaimed Fleda in another tone what have you been thinking of Father wanted me said Hugh I could not help it Fleda You are not going to have the cruelty to take your a cousin away mister Rossitur said the doctor But Fleda was for once happy to be cruel she would hear no remonstrances Though her desire for Miss Lucy s help had considerably lessened she thought she could not in politeness avoid speaking on the subject after being invited there on purpose But Miss Lucy said she calculated to stay at home this winter unless she went to live with somebody at Kenton for the purpose of attending a course of philosophy lectures that she heard were to be given there So that matter was settled and clasping Hugh s arm Fleda turned away from the house with a step and heart both lightened by the joy of being out of it I couldn t come sooner Fleda said Hugh No matter O I m so glad to be away Walk a little faster dear Hugh Have you missed me at home Do you want me to say no or yes said Hugh smiling We did very well mother and I and I have left everything ready to have tea the minute you get home What sort of a time have you had In answer to which Fleda gave him a long history and then they walked on awhile in silence The evening was still and would have been dark but for the extreme brilliancy of the stars through the keen clear atmosphere Fleda looked up at them and drew large draughts of bodily and mental refreshment with the bracing air Do you know to morrow will be Thanksgiving day Ye what made you think of it They were talking about it they make a great fuss here Thanksgiving day I don t think we shall make much of a fuss said Hugh I don t think we shall I wonder what I shall do I am afraid uncle Rolf will get tired of coffee and omelettes in the course of time and my list of receipts is very limited It is a pity you didn t beg one of missus Renney s books said Hugh laughing If you had only known Tisn t too late said Fleda quickly I ll send to New York for one I will I ll ask uncle Orrin to get it for me That s the best thought But Fleda you re not going to turn cook in that fashion It would be no harm to have the book said Fleda I can tell you we mustn t expect to get anybody here that can make an omelette or even coffee that uncle Rolf will drink Oh Hugh What I don t know where we are going to get anybody But don t say anything to aunt Lucy about it Well we can keep Thanksgiving day Fleda without a dinner said Hugh cheerfully Yes indeed I am sure I can after being among these people to night How much I have that they want Look at the Great Bear over there isn t that better than New York The Great Bear hangs over New York too Hugh said with a smile Ah but it isn t the same thing Heaven hasn t the same eyes for the city and the country As Hugh and Fleda went quick up to the kitchen door they overtook a dark figure at whom looking narrowly as she passed Fleda recognised Seth Plumfield He was joyfully let into the kitchen and there proved to be the bearer of a huge dish carefully covered with a napkin Mother guessed you hadn t any Thanksgiving ready he said and she wanted to send this down to you so I thought I would come and fetch it myself O thank her and thank you cousin Seth how good you are Mother ha n t lost her old trick at em said he so I hope that s good O I know it is said Fleda I remember aunt Miriam s Thanksgiving chicken pies Now cousin Seth you must come in and see aunt Lucy No said he quietly I ve got my farm boots on I guess I won t see anybody but you But Fleda would not suffer that and finding she could not move him she brought her aunt out into the kitchen missus Rossitur s manner of speaking and thanking him quite charmed Seth and he went away with a kindly feeling towards those gentle bright eyes which he never forgot Now we ve something for to morrow Hugh said Fleda and such a chicken pie I can tell you as you never saw Hugh isn t it odd how different a thing is in different circumstances You don t know how glad I was when I put my hands upon that warm pie dish and knew what it was and when did I ever care in New York about Emile s doings Except the almond gauffres said Hugh smiling I never thought to be so glad of a chicken pie said Fleda shaking her head Aunt Miriam s dish bore out Fleda s praise in the opinion of all that tasted it for such fowls such butter and such cream as went to its composition could hardly be known but in an unsophisticated state of society But one pie could not last for ever and as soon as the signs of dinner were got rid of Thanksgiving day though it was poor Fleda was fain to go up the hill to consult aunt Miriam about the possibility of getting help I don t know dear Fleda said she if you cannot get Lucy Finn I don t know who else there is you can get missus Toles wants both her daughters at home I know this winter because she is sick and Marietta Winchel is working at aunt Syra s I don t know Do you remember Barby Elster that used to live with me O yes She might go she has been staying at home these two years to take care of her old mother that s the reason she left me but she has another sister come home now Hetty that married and went to Montepoole she s lost her husband and come home to live so perhaps Barby would go out again But I don t know how do you think your aunt Lucy would get along with her Dear aunt Miriam you know we must do as we can We must have somebody Barby is a little quick said missus Plumfield but I think she is good hearted and she is thorough and faithful as the day is long If your aunt and uncle can put up with her ways I am sure we can aunt Miriam Aunt Lucy s the easiest person in the world to please and I ll try and keep her away from uncle Rolf I think we can get along I know Barby used to like me But then Barby knows nothing about French cooking my child she can do nothing but the common country things What will your uncle and aunt say to that I don t know said Fleda but anything is better than nothing I must try and do what she can t do I ll come up and get you to teach me aunt Miriam Aunt Miriam hugged and kissed her before speaking I ll teach you what I know my darling and now we ll go right off and see Barby we shall catch her just in a good time It was a poor little unpainted house standing back from the road and with a double row of boards laid down to serve as a path to it But this board walk was scrubbed perfectly clean They went in without knocking There was nobody there but an old woman seated before the fire shaking all over with the saint Vitus s Dance She gave them no salutation calling instead on Barby who presently made her appearance from the inner door Barby who s this That s Mis Plumfield mother said the daughter speaking loud as to a deaf person The old lady immediately got up and dropped a very quick and what was meant to be a very respect shewing curtsey saying at the same time with much deference and with one of her involuntary twitches I maun to know The sense of the ludicrous and the feeling of pity together were painfully oppressive Fleda turned away to the daughter who came forward and shook hands with a frank look of pleasure at the sight of her elder visitor Barby said missus Plumfield this is little Fleda Ringgan do you remember her I mind to know said Barby transferring her hand to Fleda s and giving it a good squeeze She s growed a fine gal Mis Plumfield You ha n t lost none of your good looks ha you kept all your old goodness along with em Fleda laughed at this abrupt question and said she didn t know If you ha n t I wouldn t give much for your eyes said Barby letting go her hand missus Plumfield laughed too at Barby s equivocal mode of complimenting Who s that young gal Barby inquired missus Elster That s Mis Plumfield s niece mother She s a handsome little creetur ain t she They all laughed at that and Fleda s cheeks growing crimson missus Plumfield stepped forward to ask after the old lady s health and while she talked and listened Fleda s eyes noted the spotless condition of the room the white table the nice rag carpet the bright many coloured patch work counterpane on the bed the brilliant cleanliness of the floor where the small carpet left the boards bare the tidy look of the two women and she made up her mind that she could get along with Miss Barbara very

none	none	was rather tall and in face decidedly a fine looking woman though her figure had the usual scantling proportions which nature or fashion assigns to the hard working dwellers in the country A handsome quick grey eye and the mouth were sufficiently expressive of character and perhaps of temper but there were no lines of anything sinister or surly you could imagine a flash but not a cloud Barby you are not tied at home any longer are you said missus Plumfield coming back from the old lady and speaking rather low now that Hetty is here can t your mother spare you Well I reckon she could Mis Plumfield if I could work it so that she d be more comfortable by my being away Then you d have no objection to go out again Where to Fleda s uncle you know has taken my brother s old place and they have no help They want somebody to take the whole management just you Barby missus Rossitur isn t strong Nor don t want to be does she I ve heerd tell of her Mis Plumfield I should despise to have as many legs and arms as other folks and not be able to help myself But you wouldn t despise to help other folks I hope said missus Plumfield smiling People that want you very much too said Fleda for she quite longed to have that strong hand and healthy eye to rely upon at home Barby looked at her with a relaxed face and after a little consideration said she guessed she d try Mis Plumfield cried the old lady as they were moving Mis Plumfield you said you d send me a piece of pork I haven t forgotten it missus Elster you shall have it Well you get it out for me yourself said the old woman speaking very energetically don t you send no one else to the barrel for t because I know you ll give me the biggest piece missus Plumfield laughed and promised I ll come up and work it out some odd day said the daughter nodding intelligently as she followed them to the door We ll talk about that said missus Plumfield She was wonderful pleased with the pie said Barby and so was Hetty she ha n t seen anything so good she says since she quit Queechy Well Barby said missus Plumfield as she turned and grasped her hand did you remember your Thanksgiving over it Yes Mis Plumfield and the fine grey eyes fell to the floor but I minded it only because it had come from you I seemed to hear you saying just that out of every bone I picked You minded my message said the other gently Well I don t mind the things I had ought to most said Barby in a subdued voice never cept mother I ain t very apt to forget her missus Plumfield saw a tell tale glittering beneath the drooping eye lid She added no more but a sympathetic strong squeeze of the hand she held and turned to follow Fleda who had gone on ahead Mis Plumfield said Barby before they had reached the stile that led into the road where Fleda was standing Will I be sure of having the money regular down yonder You know I hadn t ought to go otherways on account of mother Yes it will be sure said missus Plumfield and regular adding quietly I ll make it so There was a bond for the whole amount in aunt Miriam s eyes and quite satisfied Barby went back to the house Will she expect to come to our table aunt Miriam said Fleda when they had walked a little way No she will not expect that but Barby will want a different kind of managing from those Irish women of yours She won t bear to be spoken to in a way that don t suit her notions of what she thinks she deserves and perhaps your aunt and uncle will think her notions rather high I don t know There is no difficulty with aunt Lucy said Fleda and I guess I can manage uncle Rolf I ll try I like her very much Barby is very poor said missus Plumfield she has nothing but her own earnings to support herself and her old mother and now I suppose her sister and her child for Hetty is a poor thing never did much and now I suppose does nothing Are those Finns poor aunt Miriam O no not at all they are very well off So I thought they seemed to have plenty of everything and silver spoons and all But why then do they go out to work They are a little too fond of getting money I expect said aunt Miriam And they are a queer sort of people rather the mother is queer and the children are queer they ain t like other folks exactly never were I am very glad we are to have Barby instead of that Lucy Finn said Fleda O aunt Miriam you can t think how much easier my heart feels Poor child said aunt Miriam looking at her But it isn t best Fleda to have things work too smooth in this world No I suppose not said Fleda sighing Isn t it very strange aunt Miriam that it should make people worse instead of better to have everything go pleasantly with them It is because they are apt then to be so full of the present that they forget the care of the future Yes and forget there is anything better than the present I suppose said Fleda So we mustn t fret at the ways our Father takes to keep us from hurting ourselves said aunt Miriam cheerfully O no said Fleda looking up brightly in answer to the tender manner in which these words were spoken and I didn t mean that this is much of a trouble only I am very glad to think that somebody is coming to morrow Aunt Miriam thought that gentle unfretful face could not stand in need of much discipline Chapter XXI Wise men alway Affyrme and say That best is for a man Diligently For to apply The business that he can More Fleda waited for Barby s coming the next day with a little anxiety The introduction and installation however were happily got over missus Rossitur as Fleda knew was most easily pleased and Barby Elster s quick eye was satisfied with the unaffected and universal gentleness and politeness of her new employer She made herself at home in half an hour and missus Rossitur and Fleda were comforted to perceive by unmistakeable signs that their presence was not needed in the kitchen and they might retire to their own premises and forget there was another part of the house Fleda had forgotten it utterly and deliciously enjoying the rest of mind and body she was stretched upon the sofa luxuriating over some volume from her remnant of a library when the inner door was suddenly pushed open far enough to admit the entrance of Miss Elster s head Where s the soft soap Fleda s book went down and her heart jumped to her mouth for her uncle was sitting over by the window missus Rossitur looked up in a maze and waited for the question to be repeated I say where s the soft soap Soft soap said missus Rossitur I don t know whether there is any Fleda do you know I was trying to think aunt Lucy I don t believe there is any Where is it said Barby There is none I believe said missus Rossitur Where was it then Nowhere there has not been any in the house said Fleda raising herself up to see over the back of her sofa There ha n t been none said Miss Elster in a tone more significant than her words and shutting the door as abruptly as she had opened it What upon earth does the woman mean exclaimed mister Rossitur springing up and advancing towards the kitchen door Fleda threw herself before him Nothing at all uncle Rolf she doesn t mean anything at all she doesn t know any better I will improve her knowledge get out the way Fleda But uncle Rolf just hear me one moment please don t she didn t mean any harm these people don t know any manners just let me speak to her please uncle Rolf said Fleda laying both hands upon her uncle s arms I ll manage her mister Rossitur s wrath was high and he would have run over or knocked down anything less gentle that had stood in his way but even the harshness of strength shuns to set itself in array against the meekness that does not oppose if the touch of those hands had been a whit less light or the glance of her eye less submissively appealing it would have availed nothing As it was he stopped and looked at her at first scowling but then with a smile You manage her said he Yes said Fleda laughing and now exerting her force she gently pushed him back towards the seat he had quitted yes uncle Rolf you ve enough else to manage don t undertake our help Deliver over all your displeasure upon me when anything goes wrong I will be the conductor to carry it off safely into the kitchen and discharge it just at that point where I think it will do most execution Now will you uncle Rolf Because we have got a new fashioned piece of firearms in the other room that I am afraid will go off unexpectedly if it is meddled with by an unskilful hand and that would leave us without arms you see or with only aunt Lucy s and mine which are not reliable You saucy girl said her uncle who was laughing partly at and partly with her I don t know what you deserve exactly Well keep this precious new operative of yours out of my way and I ll take care to keep out of hers But mind you must manage not to have your piece snapping in my face in this fashion for I won t stand it And so quieted mister Rossitur sat down to his book again and Fleda leaving hers open went to attend upon Barby There ain t much yallow soap neither said this personage if this is all There s one thing if we ha n t got it we can make it I must get Mis Rossitur to have a leach tub sot up right away I m a dreadful hand for havin plenty o soap What is a leach tub said Fleda Why a leach tub for to leach ashes in That s easy enough I ll fix it afore we re any on us much older If mister Rossitur ll keep me in good hard wood I sha n t cost him hardly anything for potash I ll see about it said Fleda and I will see about having the leach tub or whatever it is put up for you And Barby whenever you want anything will you just speak to me about it and if I am in the other room ask me to come out here Because my aunt is not strong and does not know where things are as well as I do and when my uncle is in there he sometimes does not like to be disturbed with hearing any such talk If you ll tell me I ll see and have everything done for you Well you get me a leach sot up that s all I ll ask of you just now said Barby good humouredly and help me to find the soap grease if there is any As to the rest I don t want to see nothin o him in the kitchen so I ll relieve him if he don t want to see much o me in the parlour I shouldn t wonder if there wa n t a speck of it in the house Not a speck was there to be found Your uncle s pockets must ha had a good hole in em by this time remarked Barby as they came back from the cellar However there never was a crock so empty it couldn t be filled You get me a leach tub sot up and I ll find work for it From that time Fleda had no more trouble with her uncle and Barby Each seemed to have a wholesome appreciation of the other s combative qualities and to shun them With missus Rossitur Barby was soon all powerful It was enough that she wanted a thing if missus Rossitur s own resources could compass it For Fleda to say that Barby had presently a perfect understanding with her and joined to that a most affectionate careful regard is not perhaps saying much for it was true of every one without exception with whom Fleda had much to do Barby was to all of them a very great comfort and stand by It was well for them that they had her within doors to keep things as she called it right and tight for abroad the only system in vogue was one of fluctuation and uncertainty mister Rossitur s Irishman Donohan staid his year out doing as little good and as much at least negative harm as he well could and then went leaving them a good deal poorer than he found them doctor Gregory s generosity had added to mister Rossitur s own small stock of ready money giving him the means to make some needed outlays on the farm But the outlay ill applied had been greater than the income a scarcity of money began to be more and more felt and the comfort of the family accordingly drew within more and more narrow bounds The temper of the head of the family suffered in at least equal degree From the first of Barby s coming poor Fleda had done her utmost to prevent the want of Mons Emile from being felt mister Rossitur s table was always set by her careful hand and all the delicacies that came upon it were unknown to him of her providing Even the bread One day at breakfast mister Rossitur had expressed his impatient displeasure at that of Miss Elster s manufacture Fleda saw the distressed shade that came over her aunt s face and took her resolution It was the last time She had followed her plan of sending for the receipts and she studied them diligently both at home and under aunt Miriam Natural quickness of eye and hand came in aid of her affectionate zeal and it was not long before she could trust herself to undertake any operation in the whole range of her cookery book But meanwhile materials were growing scarce and hard to come by The delicate French rolls which were now always ready for her uncle s plate in the morning had sometimes nothing to back them unless the unfailing water cress from the good little spring in the meadow Fleda could not spare her eggs for perhaps they might have nothing else to depend upon for dinner It was no burden to her to do these things she had a sufficient reward in seeing that her aunt and Hugh eat the better and that her uncle s brow was clear but it was a burden when her hands were tied by the lack of means for she knew the failure of the usual supply was bitterly felt not for the actual want but for that other want which it implied and prefigured On the first dismissal of Donohan Fleda hoped for a good turn of affairs But mister Rossitur disgusted with his first experiment resolved this season to be his own head man and appointed Lucas Springer the second in command with a posse of labourers to execute his decrees It did not work well mister Rossitur found he had a very tough prime minister who would have every one of his plans to go through a kind of winnowing process by being tossed about in an argument The arguments were interminable until mister Rossitur not unfrequently quit the field with Well do what you like about it not conquered but wearied The labourers either from want of ready money or of what they called manners in their employer fell off at the wrong times just when they were most wanted Hugh threw himself then into the breach and wrought beyond his strength and that tried Fleda worst of all She was glad to see haying and harvest pass over but the change of seasons seemed to bring only a change of disagreeableness and she could not find that hope had any better breathing time in the short days of winter than in the long days of summer Her gentle face grew more gentle than ever for under the shade of sorrowful patience which was always there now its meekness had no eclipse missus Rossitur was struck with it one morning She was coming down from her room and saw Fleda standing on the landing place gazing out of the window It was before breakfast one cold morning in winter missus Rossitur put her arms round her softly and kissed her What are you thinking about dear Fleda you ought not to be standing here I was looking at Hugh said Fleda and her eye went back to the window missus Rossitur s followed it The window gave them a view of the ground behind the house and there was Hugh just coming in with a large armful of heavy wood which he had been sawing He isn t strong enough to do that aunt Lucy said Fleda softly I know it said his mother in a subdued tone and not moving her eye though Hugh had disappeared It is too cold for him he is too thinly clad to bear this exposure said Fleda anxiously I know it said his mother again Can t you tell uncle Rolf can t you get him to do it I am afraid Hugh will hurt himself aunt Lucy I did tell him the other day I did speak to him about it said missus Rossitur but he said there was no reason why Hugh should do it there were plenty of other people But how can he say so when he knows we never can ask Lucas to do anything of the kind and that other man always contrives to be out of the way when he is wanted Oh what is he thinking of said Fleda bitterly as she saw Hugh again at his work It was so rarely that Fleda was seen to shed tears that they always were a signal of dismay to any of the household There was even agony in missus Rossitur s voice as she implored her not to give way to them But notwithstanding that Fleda s tears came this time from too deep a spring to be stopped at once It makes me feel as if all was lost Fleda when I see you do so Fleda put her arms about her neck and whispered that she would not that she should not Yet it was a little while before she could say any more But aunt Lucy he doesn t know what he is doing No and I can t make him know I cannot say anything more Fleda it would do no good I don t know what is the matter he is entirely changed from what he used to be I know what is the matter said Fleda now turning comforter in her turn as her aunt s tears fell more quietly because more despairingly than her own I know what it is he is not happy that is all He has not succeeded well in these farm doings and he wants money and he is worried it is no wonder if he don t seem exactly as he used to And oh that troubles me most of all said missus Rossitur The farm is bringing in nothing I know he don t know how to get along with it I was afraid it would be so and we are paying nothing to uncle Orrin and it is just a dead weight on his hands and I can t bear to think of it And what will it come to missus Rossitur was now in her turn surprised into shewing the strength of her sorrows and apprehensions Fleda was fain to put her own out of sight and bend her utmost powers to soothe and compose her aunt till they could both go down to the breakfast table She had got ready a nice little dish that her uncle was very fond of but her pleasure in it was all gone and indeed it seemed to be thrown away upon the whole table Half the meal was over before anybody said a word I am going to wash my hands of these miserable farm affairs said mister Rossitur Are you said his wife Yes of all personal concern in them that is I am wearied to death with the perpetual annoyances and vexations and petty calls upon my time life is not worth having at such a rate I ll have done with it You will give up the entire charge to Lucas said missus Rossitur Illustration O uncle Rolf don t have anything to do with him Lucas No I wouldn t undergo that man s tongue for another year if he would take out his wages in talking I could not have more of it in that case than I have had the last six months After money the thing that man loves best is certainly the sound of his own voice and a most insufferable egotist No I have been talking with a man who wants to take the whole farm for two years upon shares that will clear me of all trouble There was sober silence for a few minutes and then missus Rossitur asked who it was His name is Didenhover O uncle Rolf don t have anything to do with him exclaimed Fleda Why not Because he lived with grandpa a great while ago and behaved very ill Grandpa had a great deal of trouble with him How old were you then I was young to be sure said Fleda hanging her head but I remember very well how it was You may have occasion to remember it a second time said mister Rossitur dryly for the thing is done I have engaged him Not another word was spoken mister Rossitur went out after breakfast and missus Rossitur busied herself with the breakfast cups and a tub of hot water a work she never would let Fleda share with her and which lasted in consequence long enough Barby said to cook and eat three breakfasts Fleda and Hugh sat looking at the floor and the fire respectively I am going up the hill to get a sight of aunt Miriam said Fleda bringing her eyes from the fire upon her aunt Well dear do You have been shut up long enough by the snow Wrap yourself up well and put on my snow boots No indeed said Fleda I shall just draw on another pair of stockings over my shoes within my India rubbers I will take a pair of Hugh s woollen ones What has become of your own said Hugh My own what Stockings Snow boots Worn out mister Rossitur I have run them to death poor things Is that a slight intimation that you are afraid of the same fate for your socks No said Hugh smiling in spite of himself at her manner I will lend you anything I have got Fleda His tone put Fleda in mind of the very doubtful pretensions of the socks in question to be comprehended under the term she was silent a minute Will you go with me Hugh No dear I can t I must get a little ahead with the wood while I can it looks as if it would snow again and Barby isn t provided for more than a day or two And how for this fire Hugh shook his head and rose up to go forth into the kitchen Fleda went too linking her arm in his and bearing affectionately upon it a sort of tacit saying that they would sink or swim together Hugh understood it perfectly I am very sorry you have to do it dear Hugh Oh that wood shed If it had only been made Never mind can t help it now we shall get through the winter by and by Can t you get uncle Rolf to help you a little whispered Fleda It would do him good But Hugh only shook his head What are we going to do for dinner Barby said Fleda still holding Hugh there before the fire Ain t much choice said Barby It would puzzle anybody to spell much more out of it than pork and ham There s plenty o them I shan t starve this some time But we had ham yesterday and pork the day before yesterday and ham Monday said Fleda There is plenty of vegetables thanks to you and me Hugh she said with a little reminding squeeze of his arm I could make soups nicely if I had anything to make them of There s enough to be had for the catching said Barby If I hadn t a man mountain of work upon me I d start out and shoot or steal something You shoot Barby said Fleda laughing I guess I can do most anything I set my hand to If I couldn t I d shoot myself It won t do to kill no more o them chickens O no now they are laying so finely Well I am going up the hill and when I come home I ll try and make up something Barby Earl Douglass ll go out in the woods now and then of a day when he ha n t no work particular to do and fetch hum as many pigeons and woodchucks as you could shake a stick at Hugh my dear said Fleda laughing it s a pity you aren t a hunter I would shake a stick at you with great pleasure Well Barby we will see when I come home I was just a thinkin said Barby Mis Douglass sent round to know if Mis Rossitur would like a piece of fresh meat Earl s been killing a sheep there s a nice quarter she says if she d like to have it A quarter of mutton said Fleda I don t know no I think not Barby I don t know when we should be able to pay it back again And yet Hugh do you think uncle Rolf will kill another sheep this winter I am sure he will not said Hugh there have so many died If he only knowed it that is a reason for killing more said Barby and have the good of them while he can Tell missus Douglass we are obliged to her but we do not want the mutton Barby Hugh went to his chopping and Fleda set out upon her walk the lines of her face settling into a most fixed gravity so soon as she turned away from the house It was what might be called a fine winter s day cold and still and the sky covered with one uniform grey cloud The snow lay in uncompromising whiteness thick over all the world a kindly shelter for the young grain and covering for the soil but Fleda s spirits just then in another mood saw in it only the cold refusal to hope and the barren check to exertion The wind had cleared the snow from the trees and fences and they stood in all their unsoftened blackness and nakedness bleak and stern The high grey sky threatened a fresh fall of snow in a few hours it was just now a lull between two storms and Fleda s spirits that sometimes would have laughed in the face of nature s soberness to day sank to its own quiet Her pace neither slackened nor quickened till she reached aunt Miriam s house and entered the kitchen Aunt Miriam was in high tide of business over a pot of boiling lard and the enormous bread tray by the side of the fire was half full of very tempting light brown cruller which however were little more than a kind of sweet bread for the workmen In the bustle of putting in and taking out aunt Miriam could give her visitor but a word and a look Fleda pulled off her hood and sitting down watched in unusual silence the old lady s operations And how are they all at your house to day aunt Miriam asked as she was carefully draining her cruller out of the kettle Fleda answered that they were as well as usual but a slight hesitation and the tell tale tone of her voice made the old lady look at her more narrowly She came near and kissed that gentle brow and looking in her eyes asked her what the matter was I don t know said Fleda eyes and voice wavering alike I am foolish I believe Aunt Miriam tenderly put aside the hair from her forehead and kissed it again but the cruller was burning and she went back to the kettle I got down hearted somehow this morning Fleda went on trying to steady her voice and school herself You down hearted dear About what There was a world of sympathy in these words in the warmth of which Fleda s shut up heart unfolded itself at once It s nothing new aunt Miriam only somehow I felt it particularly this morning I have been kept in the house so long by this snow I have got dumpish I suppose Aunt Miriam looked anxiously at the tears which seemed to come involuntarily but she said nothing We are not getting along well at home I supposed that said missus Plumfield quietly But anything new Yes uncle Rolf has let the farm only think of it he has let the farm to that Didenhover Didenhover For two years Did you tell him what you knew about him Yes but it was too late the mischief was done Aunt Miriam went on skimming out her cruller with a very grave face How came your uncle to do so without learning about him first O I don t know he was in a hurry to do anything that would take the trouble of the farm off his hands he don t like it On what terms has he let him have it On shares and I know I know under that Didenhover it will bring us in nothing and it has brought us in nothing all the time we have been here and I don t know what we are going to live upon Has your uncle nor your aunt no property at all left Not a bit except some waste lands in Michigan I believe that were left to aunt Lucy a year or two ago but they are as good as nothing Has he let Didenhover have the saw mill too I don t know he didn t say if he has there will be nothing at all left for us to live upon I expect nothing from Didenhover his face is enough I should have thought it might have been for uncle Rolf O if it wasn t for aunt Lucy and Hugh I shouldn t care What has your uncle been doing all this year past I don t know aunt Miriam he can t bear the business and he has left the most of it to Lucas and I think Lucas is more of a talker than a doer Almost nothing has gone right The crops have been ill managed I do not know a great deal about it but I know enough for that and uncle Rolf did not know anything about it but what he got from books And the sheep are dying off Barby says it is because they were in such poor condition at the beginning of winter and I dare say she is right He ought to have had a thorough good man at the beginning to get along well O yes but he hadn t you see and so we have just been growing poorer every month And now aunt Miriam I really don t know from day to day what to do to get dinner You know for a good while after we came we used to have our marketing brought every few days from Albany but we have run up such a bill there already at the butcher s as I don t know when in the world will get paid and aunt Lucy and I will do anything before we will send for any more and if it wasn t for her and Hugh I wouldn t care but they haven t much appetite and I know that all this takes what little they have away this and seeing the effect it has upon uncle Rolf Does he think so much more of eating than of anything else said aunt Miriam Oh no it is not that said Fleda earnestly it is not that at all he is not a great eater but he can t bear to have things different from what they used to be and from what they ought to be O no don t think that I don t know whether I ought to have said what I have said but I couldn t help it Fleda s voice was lost for a little while He is changed from what he used to be a little thing vexes him now and I know it is because he is not happy he used to be so kind and pleasant and he is still sometimes but aunt Lucy s face Oh aunt Miriam Why dear said aunt Miriam tenderly It is so changed from what it used to be Poor Fleda covered her own and aunt Miriam came to her side to give softer and gentler expression to sympathy than words could do till the bowed face was raised again and hid in her neck I can t see thee do so my child my dear child Hope for brighter days dear Fleda I could bear it said Fleda after a little interval if it wasn t for aunt Lucy and Hugh oh that is the worst What about Hugh said aunt Miriam soothingly Oh he does what he ought not to do aunt Miriam and there is no help for it and he did last summer when we wanted men and in the hot haying time he used to work I know beyond his strength and aunt Lucy and I did not know what to do with ourselves Fleda s head which had been raised sunk again and more heavily Where was his father said missus Plumfield Oh he was in the house he didn t know it he didn t think about it Didn t think about it No O he didn t think Hugh was hurting himself but he was he shewed it for weeks afterward I have said what I ought not now said Fleda looking up and seeming to check her tears and the spring of them at once So much security any woman has in a man without religion said aunt Miriam going back to her work Fleda would have said something if she could she was silent she stood looking into the fire while the tears seemed to come as it were by stealth and ran down her face unregarded Is Hugh not well I don t know said Fleda faintly he is not ill but he never was very strong and he exposes himself now I know in a way he ought not I am sorry I have just come and troubled you with all this now aunt Miriam she said after a little pause I shall feel better by and by I don t very often get such a fit My dear little Fleda and there was unspeakable tenderness in the old lady s voice as she came up and drew Fleda s head again to rest upon her I would not let a rough wind touch thee if I had the holding of it But we may be glad the arranging of things is not in my hand I should be a poor friend after all for I do not know what is best Canst thou trust him who does know my child I do aunt Miriam O I do said Fleda burying her face in her bosom I don t often feel so as I did to day There comes not a cloud that its shadow is not wanted said aunt Miriam I cannot see why but it is that thou mayest bloom the brighter my dear one I know it Fleda s words were hardly audible I will try Remember his own message to every one under a cloud cast all thy care upon him for he careth for thee thou mayest keep none of it and then the peace that passeth understanding shall keep thee So he giveth his beloved sleep Fleda wept for a minute on the old lady s neck and then she looked up dried her tears and sat down with a face greatly quieted and lightened of its burden while aunt Miriam once more went back to her work The one wrought and the other looked on in silence The cruller were all done at last the great bread trough was filled and set away the remnant of the fat was carefully disposed of and aunt Miriam s handmaid was called in to take the watch She herself and her visitor adjourned to the sitting room Well said Fleda in a tone again steady and clear I must go home to see about getting up a dinner I am the greatest hand at making something out of nothing aunt Miriam that ever you saw There is nothing like practice I only wish the man uncle Orrin talks about would come along once in a while Who was that said aunt Miriam A man that used to go about from house to house said Fleda laughing when the cottages were making soup with a ham bone to give it a relish and he used to charge them so much for a dip and so much for a wallop Come come I can do as much for you as that said aunt Miriam proceeding to her store pantry see here wouldn t this be as good as a ham bone said she bringing out of it a fat fowl how would a wallop of this do Admirably only the ham bone used to come out again and I am confident this never would Well I guess I ll stand that said aunt Miriam smiling you wouldn t mind carrying this under your cloak would you I have no doubt I shall go home lighter with it than without it ma am thank you dear aunty dear aunt Miriam There was a change of tone and of eye as Fleda sealed each thank with a kiss But how is it does all the charge of the house come upon you dear O this kind of thing because aunt Lucy doesn t understand it and can t get along with it so well She likes better to sew and I had quite as lief do this And don t you sew too O a little She does as much as she can said Fleda gravely Where is your other cousin said missus Plumfield abruptly Marion she is in England I believe we don t hear from her very often No no I mean the one who is in the army Charlton O he is just ordered off to Mexico said Fleda sadly and that is another great trouble to aunt Lucy This miserable war Does he never come home Only once since we came from Paris while we were in New York He has been stationed away off at the West He has a captain s pay now hasn t he Yes but he doesn t know at all how things are at home he hasn t an idea of it and he will not have Well good bye dear aunt Miriam I must run home to take care of my chicken She ran away and if her eyes many a time on the way down the hill filled and overflowed they were not bitter nor dark tears they were the gushings of high and pure and generous affections weeping for fulness not for want That chicken was not wasted in soup it was converted into the nicest possible little fricassee because the toast would make so much more of it and to Fleda s own dinner little went beside the toast that a greater portion of the rest might be for her aunt and Hugh That same evening Seth Plumfield came into the kitchen while Fleda was there Here is something belongs to you I believe said he with a covert smile bringing out from under his cloak the mate to Fleda s fowl mother said somethin had run away with t other one and she didn t know what to do with this one alone Your uncle at home The next news that Fleda heard was that Seth had taken a lease of the saw mill for two years mister Didenhover did not disappoint Fleda s expectations Very little could be got from him or the farm under him beyond the immediate supply wanted for the use of the family and that in kind not in cash missus Rossitur was comforted by knowing that some portion of rent had also gone to doctor Gregory how large or how small a portion she could not find out But this left the family in increasing straits which narrowed and narrowed during the whole first summer and winter of Didenhover s administration Very straitened they would have been but for the means of relief adopted by the two children as they were always called Hugh as soon as the spring opened had a quiet hint through Fleda that if he had a mind to take the working of the saw mill he might for a consideration merely nominal This offer was immediately and gratefully closed with and Hugh s earnings were thenceforward very important at home Fleda had her own ways and means mister Rossitur more low spirited and gloomy than ever seemed to have no heart to anything He would have worked perhaps if he could have done it alone but to join Didenhover and his men or any other gang of workmen was too much for his magnanimity He helped nobody but Fleda For her he would do anything at any time and in the garden and among her flowers in the flowery courtyard he might often be seen at work with her But nowhere else Chapter XXII Some bring a capon some a rurall cake Some nuts some apples some that thinke they make The better cheeses bring hem or else send By their ripe daughters whom they would commend This way to husbands and whose baskets beare An embleme of themselves in plum or peare Ben Jonson So the time walked away for this family was not now of those whom time runneth withal to the second summer of mister Didenhover s term One morning missus Rossitur was seated in the breakfast room at her usual employment mending and patching no sinecure now Fleda opened the kitchen door and came in folding up a calico apron she had just taken off You are tired dear said missus Rossitur sorrowfully you look pale Do I said Fleda sitting down I am a little tired Why do you do so O it s nothing said Fleda cheerfully I haven t hurt myself I shall be rested again in a few minutes What have you been doing O I tired myself a little before breakfast in the garden I suppose Aunt Lucy don t you think I had almost a bushel of peas and there was a little over a half bushel last time so I shall call it a bushel Isn t that fine You didn t pick them all yourself Hugh helped me a little while but he had the horse to get ready and I was out before him this morning poor fellow he was tired from yesterday I dare say missus Rossitur looked at her a look between remonstrance and reproach and cast her eyes down without saying a word swallowing a whole heartful of thoughts and feelings Fleda stooped forward till her own forehead softly touched missus Rossitur s as gentle a chiding of despondency as a very sunbeam could have given Now aunt Lucy what do you mean Don t you know it s good for me And do you know mister Sweet will give me four shillings a bushel and aunt Lucy I sent three dozen heads of lettuce this morning besides Isn t that doing well and I sent two dozen day before yesterday It is time they were gone for they are running up to seed this set I have got another fine set almost ready missus Rossitur looked at her again as if she had been a sort of terrestrial angel And how much will you get for them I don t know exactly threepence or sixpence perhaps I guess not so much they are so easily raised though I don t believe there are so fine as mine to be seen in this region If I only had somebody to water the strawberries we should have a great many Aunt Lucy I am going to send as many as I can without robbing uncle Rolf he sha n t miss them but the rest of us don t mind eating rather fewer than usual I shall make a good deal by them And I think these morning rides do Hugh good don t you think so And what have you been busy about ever since breakfast Fleda O two or three things said Fleda lightly What I had bread to make and then I thought while my hands were in I would make a custard for uncle Rolf You needn t have done that dear it was not necessary Yes it was because you know we have only fried pork for dinner to day and while we have the milk and eggs it doesn t cost much the sugar is almost nothing He will like it better and so will Hugh As for you said Fleda gently touching her forehead again you know it is of no consequence I wish you would think yourself of some consequence said missus Rossitur Don t I think myself of consequence naid Fleda affectionately I don t know how you d all get on without me What do you think I have a mind to do now by way of resting myself Well said missus Rossitur thinking of something else It is the day for making presents to the minister you know The minister Yes the new minister they expect him to day you have heard of it the things are all to be carried to his house to day I have a great notion to go and see the fun if I only had anything in the world I could possibly take with me Aren t you too tired dear No it would rest me it is early yet if I only had something to take I couldn t go without taking something A basket of eggs said missus Rossitur Can t aunt Lucy I can t spare them so many of the hens are setting now A basket of strawberries that s the thing I ve got enough picked for that and to night too That will do Fleda s preparations were soon made and with her basket on her arm she was ready to set forth If pride had not been a little put down in me she said smiling I suppose I should rather stay at home than go with such a petty offering And no doubt every one that sees it or hears of it will lay it to anything but the right reason So much the world knows about the people it judges It is too bad to leave you all alone aunt Lucy missus Rossitur pulled her down for a kiss a kiss in which how much was said on both sides and Fleda set forth choosing as she very commonly did the old time way through the kitchen Off again said Barby who was on her knees scrubbing the great flag stones of the hearth Yes I am going up to see the donation party Has the minister come No but he is coming to day I understand He ha n t preached for em yet has he Not yet I suppose he will next Sunday They are in a mighty hurry to give him a donation party said Barby I d ha waited till he was here first I don t believe they d be quite so spry with their donations if they had paid the last man up as they ought I d rather give a man what belongs to him and make him presents afterwards Why so I hope they will Barby said Fleda laughing But Barby said no more The parsonage house was about a quarter of a mile a little more from the saw mill in a line at right angles with the main road Fleda took Hugh from his work to see her safe there The road ran north keeping near the level of the mid hill where it branched off a little below the saw mill and as the ground continued rising towards the east and was well clothed with woods the way at this hour was still pleasantly shady To the left the same slope of ground carried down to the foot of the hill gave them an uninterrupted view over a wide plain or bottom edged in the distance with a circle of gently swelling hills Close against the hills in the far corner of the plain lay the little village of Queechy Run hid from sight by a slight intervening rise of ground not a chimney shewed itself in the whole spread of country A sunny landscape just now but rich in picturesque associations of hay cocks and winnows spotting it near and far and close by below them was a field of mowers at work they could distinctly hear the measured rush of the scythes through the grass and then the soft clink of the rifles would seem to play some old delicious tune of childish days Fleda made Hugh stand still to listen It was a warm day but the sweet south that breathes upon a bank of violets could hardly be more sweet than the air which coming to them over the whole breadth of the valley had been charged by the new made hay How good it is Hugh said Fleda that one can get out of doors and forget everything that ever happened or ever will happen within four walls Do you said Hugh rather soberly Yes I do even in my flower patch right before the house door but here said Fleda turning away and swinging her basket of strawberries as she went I have no idea I ever did such a thing as make bread and how clothes get mended I do not comprehend in the least And have you forgotten the peas and the asparagus too I am afraid you haven t dear Hugh said Fleda linking her arm within his Hugh I must find some way to make money More money said Hugh smiling Yes this garden business is all very well but it doesn t come to any very great things after all if you are aware of it and Hugh I want to get aunt Lucy a new dress I can t bear to see her in that old merino and it isn t good for her Why Hugh she couldn t possibly see anybody if anybody should come to the house Who is there to come said Hugh Why nobody but still she ought not to be so What more can you do dear Fleda You work a great deal too hard already said Hugh sighing You should have seen the way father and mother looked at you last night when you were asleep on the sofa Fleda stifled her sigh and went on I am sure there are things that might be done things for the booksellers translating or copying or something I don t know exactly I have heard of people s doing such things I mean to write to uncle Orrin and ask him I am sure he can manage it for me What were you writing the other night said Hugh suddenly When The other night when you were writing by the firelight I saw your pencil scribbling away at a furious rate over the paper and you kept your hand up carefully between me and your face but I could see it was something very interesting Ha said Hugh laughingly trying to get another view of Fleda s face which was again kept from him Send that to uncle Orrin Fleda or shew it to me first and then I will tell you Fleda made no answer and at the parsonage door Hugh left her Two or three wagons were standing there but nobody to be seen Fleda went up the steps and crossed the broad piazza brown and unpainted but picturesque still and guided by the sound of tongues turned to the right where she found a large low room the very centre of the stir But the stir had not by any means reached the height yet Not more than a dozen people were gathered Here were aunt Syra and missus Douglass appointed a committee to receive and dispose the offerings as they were brought in Why there is not much to be seen yet said Fleda I did not know I was so early Time enough said missus Douglass They ll come the thicker when they do come Good morning doctor Quackenboss I hope you re a going to give us something else besides a bow and I won t take none of your physic neither I humbly submit said the doctor graciously that nothing ought to be expected of gentlemen that a are so unhappy as to be alone for they really a have nothing to give but themselves There was a shout of merriment And suppos n that s a gift that nobody wants said missus Douglass s sharp eye and voice at once In that case said the doctor I really Miss Ringgan may I a may I relieve your hand of this fair burden It is not a very fair burden sir said Fleda laughing and relinquishing her strawberries Ah but fair you know I mean we speak in that sense missus Douglass here is by far the most elegant offering that your hands will have the honour of receiving this day I hope so said missus Douglass or there won t be much to eat for the minister Did you never take notice how elegant things somehow made folks grow poor I guess he d as leave see something a little substantial said aunt Syra Well now said the doctor here is Miss Ringgan who is unquestionably a elegant and I am sure nobody will say that she looks poor In one sense surely not There could not be two opinions But with all the fairness of health and the flush which two or three feelings had brought to her cheeks there was a look as if the workings of the mind had refined away a little of the strength of the physical frame and as if growing poor in missus Douglass s sense that is thin might easily be the next step What s your uncle going to give us Fleda said aunt Syra But Fleda was saved replying for missus Douglass who if she was sharp could be good natured too and had watched to see how Fleda took the double fire upon elegance and poverty could beat no more trial of that sweet gentle face Without giving her time to answer she carried her off to see the things already stored in the closet bidding the doctor over her shoulder be off after his goods whether he had got em or no There was certainly a promising beginning made for the future minister s comfort One shelf was already completely stocked with pies and another shewed a quantity of cake and biscuits enough to last a good sized family for several meals That is always the way said missus Douglass it s the strangest thing that folks has no sense Now one half o them pies ll be dried up afore they can eat the rest tain t much loss for Mis Prin sent em down and if they are worth anything it s the first time anything ever come out of her house that was Now look at them biscuit How many are coming to eat them said Fleda How How large a family has the minister He ha n t a bit of a family He ain t married Not At the grave way in which missus Douglass faced around upon her and answered and at the idea of a single mouth devoted to all that closetful Fleda s gravity gave place to most uncontrollable merriment No said missus Douglass with a curious twist of her mouth but commanding herself he ain t to be sure not yet He ha n t any family but himself and some sort of a housekeeper I suppose they ll divide the house between em And the biscuits I hope said Fleda But what will he do with all the other things missus Douglass Sell em if he don t want em said missus Douglass quizzically Shut up Fleda I forget who sent them biscuit somebody that calculated to make a shew for a little I reckon My sakes I believe it was Mis Springer herself she didn t hear me though said missus Douglass peeping out of the half open door It s a good thing the world ain t all alike there s Mis Plumfield stop now and I ll tell you all she sent that big jar of lard there s as good as eighteen or twenty pound and that basket of eggs I don t know how many there is and that cheese a real fine one I ll be bound she wouldn t pick out the worst in her dairy and Seth fetched down a hundred weight of corn meal and another of rye flour now that s what I call doing things something like if everybody else would keep up their end as well as they keep up their n the world wouldn t be quite so one sided as it is I never see the time yet when I couldn t tell where to find Mis Plumfield No nor anybody else said Fleda looking happy There s Mis Silbert couldn t find nothing better to send than a kag of soap missus Douglass went on seeming very much amused I was beat when I saw that walk in I should think she d feel streaked to come here by and by and see it a standing between Mis Plumfield s lard and Mis Clavering s pork that s a handsome kag of pork ain t it What s that man done with your strawberries I ll put em up here afore somebody takes a notion to em I ll let the minister know who he s got to thank for em said she winking at Fleda Where s doctor Quackenboss Coming ma am sounded from the hall and forthwith at the open door entered the doctor s head simultaneously with a large cheese which he was rolling before him the rest of the doctor s person being thrown into the background in consequence A curious natural representation of a wheelbarrow the wheel being the only artificial part Oh that s you doctor is it said missus Douglass This is me ma am said the doctor rolling up to the closet door this has the honour to be a myself bringing my service to the feet of Miss Ringgan Tain t very elegant said the sharp lady Fleda thought if his service was at her feet her feet should be somewhere else and accordingly stepped quietly out of the way and went to one of the windows from whence she could have a view both of the comers and the come and by this time thoroughly in the spirit of the thing she used her eyes upon both with great amusement People were constantly arriving now in wagons and on foot and stores of all kinds were most literally pouring in Bags and even barrels of meal flour pork and potatoes strings of dried apples salt hams and beef hops pickles vinegar maple sugar and molasses rolls of fresh butter cheese and eggs cake bread and pies without end mister Penny the storekeeper sent a box of tea mister Winegar the carpenter a new ox sled Earl Douglass brought a handsome axe helve of his own fashioning his wife a quantity of rolls of wool Zan Finn carted a load of wood into the wood shed and Squire Thornton another Home made candles custards preserves and smoked liver came in a batch from two or three miles off up on the mountain Half a dozen chairs from the factory man Half a dozen brooms from the other store keeper at the Deepwater settlement A carpet for the best room from the ladies of the township who had clubbed forces to furnish it and a home made concern it was from the shears to the loom The room was full now for every one after depositing his gift turned aside to see what others had brought and were bringing and men and women the young and old had their several circles of gossip in various parts of the crowd Apart from them all Fleda sat in her window probably voted elegant by others than the doctor for they vouchsafed her no more than a transitory attention and sheered off to find something more congenial She sat watching the people smiling very often as some odd figure or look or some peculiar turn of expression or tone of voice caught her ear or her eye Both ear and eye were fastened by a young countryman with a particularly fresh face whom she saw approaching the house He came up on foot carrying a single fowl slung at his back by a stick thrown across his shoulder and without stirring hat or stick he came into the room and made his way through the crowd of people looking to the one hand and the other evidently in a maze of doubt to whom he should deliver himself and his chicken till brought up by missus Douglass s sharp voice Well Philetus what are you looking for Do Mis Douglass it is impossible to express the abortive attempt at a bow which accompanied this salutation I want to know if the minister ll be in town to day What do you want of him I don t want nothin of him I want to know if he ll be in town to day Yes I expect he ll be along directly why what then Cause I ve got ten chickens for him here and mother said they hadn t ought to be kept no longer and if he wa n t to hum I were to fetch em back straight Well he ll be here so let s have em said missus Douglass biting her lips What s become o t other one said Earl as the young man s stick was brought round to the table I guess you ve lost it ha n t you My gracious was all Philetus s powers were equal to missus Douglass went off into fits which rendered her incapable of speaking and left the unlucky chicken bearer to tell his story his own way but all he brought forth was Du tell I am beat Where s t other one said missus Douglass between paroxysms Why I ha n t done nothin to it said Philetus dismally there was teu on em afore I started and I took and tied em together and hitched em onto the stick and that one must ha loosened itself off some way I believe the darned thing did it o purpose I guess your mother knowed that one wouldn t keep till it got here said missus Douglass The room was now all one shout in the midst of which poor Philetus took himself off as speedily as possible Before Fleda had dried her eyes her attention was taken by a lady and gentleman who had just got out of a vehicle of more than the ordinary pretension and were coming up to the door The gentleman was young the lady was not both had a particularly amiable and pleasant appearance but about the lady there was something that moved Fleda singularly and somehow touched the spring of old memories which she felt stirring at the sight of her As they neared the house she lost them then they entered the room and came through it slowly looking about them with an air of good humoured amusement Fleda s eye was fixed but her mind puzzled itself in vain to recover what in her experience had been connected with that fair and lady like physiognomy and the bland smile that was overlooked by those acute eyes The eyes met hers and then seemed to reflect her doubt for they remained as fixed as her own while the lady quickening her steps came up to her I am sure she said holding out her hand and with a gentle graciousness that was very agreeable I am sure you are somebody I know What is your name Fleda Ringgan I thought so said the lady now shaking her hand warmly and kissing her I knew nobody could have been your mother but Amy Charlton How like her you look Don t you know me don t you remember missus Evelyn missus Evelyn said Fleda the whole coming back to her at once You remember me now How well I recollect you and all that old time at Montepoole Poor little creature that you were and dear little creature as I am sure you have been ever since And how is your dear aunt Lucy Fleda answered that she was well I used to love her very much that was before I knew you before she went abroad We have just got home this spring and now we are staying at Montepoole for a few days I shall come and see her to morrow I knew you were somewhere in this region but I did not know exactly where to find you that was one reason why I came here to day I thought I might hear something of you And where are your aunt Lucy s children and how are they Hugh is at home said Fleda and rather delicate Charlton is in the army In the army In Mexico In Mexico he has been Your poor aunt Lucy In Mexico he has been but he is just coming home now he has been wounded and he is coming home to spend a long furlough Coming home That will make you all very happy And Hugh is delicate and how are you love you hardly look like a country girl mister Olmney said missus Evelyn looking round for her companion who was standing quietly a few steps off surveying the scene mister Olmney I am going to do you a favour sir in introducing you to Miss Ringgan a very old friend of mine mister Olmney these are not exactly the apple cheeks and robustious demonstrations we are taught to look for in country land This was said with a kind of sly funny enjoyment which took away everything disagreeable from the appeal but Fleda conceived a favourable opinion of the person to whom it was made from the fact that he paid her no compliment and made no answer beyond a very pleasant smile What is missus Evelyn s definition of a very old friend said he with with another smile as that lady moved off to take a more particular view of what she had come to see To judge by the specimen before me I should consider it very equivocal Perhaps missus Evelyn counts friendships by inheritance said Fleda I think they ought to be counted so Thine own friend and thy father s friend forsake not said the young man Fleda looked up and smiled a pleased answer There is something very lovely in the faithfulness of tried friendship and very uncommon I know that it is uncommon only by hearsay said Fleda I have so many good friends He was silent for an instant possibly thinking there might be a reason for that unknown only to Fleda herself Perhaps one must be in peculiar circumstances to realize it he said sighing circumstances that leave one of no importance to any one in the world But it is a kind lesson I one learns to depend more on the one friendship that can never disappoint Fleda s eyes again gave an answer of sympathy for she thought from the shade that had come upon his face that these circumstances had probably been known to himself This is rather an amusing scene he remarked presently in a low tone Very said Fleda I have never seen such a one before Nor I said he It is a pleasant scene too it is pleasant to see so many evidences of kindness and good feeling on the part of all these people There is all the more shew of it I suppose to day said Fleda because we have a new minister coming they want to make a favourable impression Does the old proverb of the new broom hold good here too said he smiling What s the name of your new minister I am not certain said Fleda there were two talked of the last I heard was that it was an old mister Carey but from what I hear this morning I suppose it must be the other a mister Ollum or some such queer name I believe Fleda thought her hearer looked very much amused and followed his eye into the room where missus Evelyn was going about in all quarters looking at everything and finding occasion to enter into conversation with at least a quarter of the people who were present Whatever she was saying it seemed at that moment to have something to do with them for sundry eyes turned in their direction and presently doctor Quackenboss came up with even more than common suavity of manner I trust Miss Ringgan will do me the favour of making me acquainted with a with our future pastor said the doctor looking however not at all at Miss Ringgan but straight at the pastor in question I have great pleasure in giving you the first welcome sir or I should say rather the second since no doubt Miss Ringgan has been in advance of me It is not un a appropriate sir for I may say we a divide the town between us You are I am sure a worthy representative of Peter and Paul and I am a a pupil of Esculapus sir You are the intellectual physician and I am the external I hope we shall both prove ourselves good workmen sir said the young minister shaking the doctor s hand heartily This is doctor Quackenboss mister Olmney said Fleda making a tremendous effort But though she could see corresponding indications about her companion s eyes and mouth she admired the kindness and self command with which he listened to the doctor s civilities and answered them expressing his grateful sense of the favours received not only from him but from others O a little to begin with said the doctor looking round upon the room which would certainly have furnished that for fifty people I hope we ain t done yet by considerable But here is Miss Ringgan mister a Ummin that has brought you some of the fruits of her own garden with her own fair hands a basket of fine strawberries which I am sure a will make you forget everything else mister Olmney had the good breeding not to look at Fleda as he answered I am sure the spirit of kindness was the same in all doctor Quackenboss and I trust not to forget that readily Others now came up and mister Olmney was walked off to be made acquainted with all or with all the chief of his parishioners then and there assembled Fleda watched him going about shaking hands talking and smiling in all directions with about as much freedom of locomotion as a fly in a spider s web till at missus Evelyn s approach the others fell off a little and taking him by the arm she rescued him My dear mister Olmney she whispered with an intensely amused face I shall have a vision of you every day for a month to come sitting down to dinner with a rueful face to a whortleberry pie for there are so many of them your conscience will not let you have anything else cooked you cannot manage more than one a day Pies said the young gentleman as missus Evelyn left talking to indulge her feelings in ecstatic quiet laughing I have a horror of pies Yes yes said missus Evelyn nodding her head delightedly as she drew him towards the pantry I know Come and see what is in store for you You are to do penance for a month to come with tin pans of blackberry jam fringed with pie crust no they can t be blackberries they must be raspberries the blackberries are not ripe yet And you may sup upon cake and custards unless you give the custards for the little pig out there he will want something A pig said mister Olmney in a maze missus Evelyn again giving out in distress A pig said mister Olmney Yes a pig a very little one said missus Evelyn convulsively I am sure he is hungry now They had reached the pantry and mister Olmney s face was all that was wanting to missus Evelyn s delight How she smothered it so that it should go no further than to distress his self command is a mystery known only to the initiated missus Douglass was forthwith called into council missus Douglass said mister Olmney I feel very much inclined to play the host and beg my friends to share with me some of these good things they have been so bountifully providing He would enjoy them much more than he would alone missus Douglass said missus Evelyn who still had hold of mister Olmney s arm looking round to the lady with a most benign face I reckon some of em would be past enjoying by the time he got to em wouldn t they said the lady Well they ll have to take em in their fingers for our crockery ha n t come yet I shall have to jog mister Flatt s elbow but hungry folks ain t curious In their fingers or any way provided you have only a knife to cut them with said mister Olmney while missus Evelyn squeezed his arm in secret mischief and pray if we can muster two knives let us cut one of these cheeses missus Douglass And presently Fleda saw pieces of pie walking about in all directions supported by pieces of cheese And then missus Evelyn and mister Olmney came out from the pantry and came towards her the latter bringing her with his own hands a portion in a tin pan The two ladies sat down in the window together to eat and be amused My dear Fleda I hope you are hungry said missus Evelyn biting her pie Fleda could not help thinking with an air of good humoured condescension I am ma am she said laughing You look just as you used to do missus Evelyn went on earnestly Do I said Fleda privately thinking that the lady must have good eyes for features of resemblance Except that you have more colour in your cheeks and more sparkles in your eyes Dear little creature that you were I want to make you know my children Do you remember that mister and missus Carleton that took such care of you at Montepoole Certainly I do very well We saw them last winter we were down at their country place in shire They have a magnificent place there everything you can think of to make life pleasant We spent a week with them My dear Fleda I wish I could shew you that place you never saw anything like it Fleda eat her pie We have nothing like it in this country of course cannot have One of those superb English country seats is beyond even the imagination of an American Nature has been as kind to us hasn t she said Fleda O yes but such fortunes you know mister Olmney what do you think of those overgrown fortunes I was speaking to Miss Ringgan just now of a gentleman who has forty thousand pounds a year income sterling sir forty thousand pounds a year sterling Somebody says you know that he who has more than enough is a thief of the rights of his brother what do you think But mister Olmney s attention was at the moment forcibly called off by the income of a parishioner I suppose said Fleda his thievish character must depend entirely on the use he makes of what he has I don t know said missus Evelyn shaking her head I think the possession of great wealth is very hardening To a fine nature said Fleda missus Evelyn shook her head again but did not seem to think it worth while to reply and Fleda was trying the question in her own mind whether wealth or poverty might be the most hardening in its effects when mister Olmney having succeeded in getting free again came and took his station beside them and they had a particularly pleasant talk which Fleda who had seen nobody in a great while enjoyed very much They had several such talks in the course of the day for though the distractions caused by mister Olmney s other friends were many and engrossing he generally contrived in time to find his way back to their window Meanwhile missus Evelyn had a great deal to say to Fleda and to hear from her and left her at last under an engagement to spend the next day at the Pool Upon mister Olmney s departure with missus Evelyn the attraction which had held the company together was broken and they scattered fast Fleda presently finding herself in the minority was glad to set out with Miss Anastasia Finn and her sister Lucy who would leave her but very little way from her own door But she had more company than she bargained for doctor Quackenboss was pleased to attach himself to their party though his own shortest road certainly lay in another direction and Fleda wondered what he had done with his wagon which beyond a question must have brought the cheese in the morning She edged herself out of the conversation as much as possible and hoped it would prove so agreeable that he would not think of attending her home In vain When they made a stand at the cross roads the doctor stood on her side I hope now you ve made a commencement you will come to see us again Fleda said Miss Lucy What s the use of asking said her sister abruptly If she has a mind to she will and if she ha n t I am sure we don t want her They turned off Those are excellent people said the doctor when they were beyond hearing really respectable Are they said Fleda But your goodness does not look I am sure to find a Parisian graces in so remote a circle Certainly not said Fleda We have had a genial day said the doctor quitting the Finns I don t know said Fleda permitting a little of her inward merriment to work off I think it has been rather too hot Yes said the doctor the sun has been ardent but I referred rather to the a to the warming of affections and the pleasant exchange of intercourse on all sides which has taken place How do you like our a the stranger Who sir The new comer this young mister Ummin Fleda answered but she hardly knew what for she was musing whether the doctor would go away or come in They reached the door and Fleda invited him with terrible effort after her voice the doctor having just blandly offered an opinion upon the decided polish of mister Olmney s manners Chapter XXIII Labour is light where lore quoth I doth pay Saith he light burthens heavy if far borne Drayton Fleda pushed open the parlour door and preceded her convoy in a kind of tip toe state of spirits The first thing that met her eyes was her aunt in one of the few handsome silks which were almost her sole relic of past wardrobe prosperity and with a face uncommonly happy and pretty and the next instant she saw the explanation of this appearance in her cousin Charlton a little palish but looking better than she had ever seen him and another gentleman of whom her eye took in only the general outlines of fashion and comfortable circumstances now too strange to it to go unnoted In Fleda s usual mood her next movement would have been made with a demureness that would have looked like bashfulness But the amusement and pleasure of the day just passed had for the moment set her spirits free from the burden that generally bound them down and they were as elastic as her step as she came forward and presented to her aunt doctor Quackenboss and then turned to shake her cousin s hand Charlton Where did you come from We didn t expect you so soon You are not sorry to see me I hope Not at all very glad and then as her eye glanced towards the other new comer Charlton presented to her mister Thorn and Fleda s fancy made a sudden quick leap on the instant to the old hall at Montepoole and the shot dog And then doctor Quackenboss was presented an introduction which captain Rossitur received coldly and mister Thorn with something more than frigidity The doctor s elasticity however defied depression especially in the presence of a silk dress and a military coat Fleda presently saw that he was agonizing her uncle missus Rossitur had drawn close to her son Fleda was left to take care of the other visitor The young men had both seemed more struck at the vision presented to them than she had been on her part She thought neither of them was very ready to speak to her I did not know said mister Thorn softly what reason I had to thank Rossitur for bringing me home with him to night he promised me a supper and a welcome but I find he did not tell me the half of my entertainment That was wise in him said Fleda the half that is not expected is always worth a great deal more than the other In this case most assuredly said Thorn bowing and Fleda was sure not knowing what to make of her Have you been in Mexico too mister Thorn Not I that s an entertainment I beg to decline I never felt inclined to barter an arm for a shoulder knot or to abridge my usual means of locomotion for the privilege of riding on parade or selling oneself for a name Peter Schlemil s selling his shadow I can understand but this is really lessening oneself that one s shadow may grow the larger But you were in the army said Fleda Yes It wasn t my doing There is a time you know when one must please the old folks I grew old enough and wise enough to cut loose from the army before I had gained or lost much by it He did not understand the displeased gravity of Fleda s face and went on insinuatingly Unless I have lost what Charlton has gained something I did not know hung upon the decision Perhaps you think a man is taller for having iron heels to his boots I do not measure a man by his inches said Fleda Then you have no particular predilection for shooting men I have no predilection for shooting anything sir Then I am safe said he with an arrogant little air of satisfaction I was born under an indolent star but I confess to you privately of the two I would rather gather my harvests with the sickle than the sword How does your uncle find it Find what sir The worship of Ceres I remember he used to be devoted to Apollo and the Muses Are they rival deities Why I have been rather of the opinion that they were too many for one house to hold said Thorn glancing at mister Rossitur But perhays the Graces manage to reconcile them Did you ever hear of the Graces getting supper said Fleda Because Ceres sometimes sets them at that work Uncle Rolf she added as she passed him mister Thorn is inquiring after Apollo will you set him right while I do the same for the tablecloth Her uncle looked from her sparkling eyes to the rather puzzled expression of his guest s face I was only asking your lovely niece said mister Thorn coming down from his stilts how you liked this country life doctor Quackenboss bowed probably in approbation of the epithet Well sir what information did she give you on the subject Left me in the dark sir with a vague hope that you would enlighten me I trust mister Rossitur can give a favourable report said the doctor benignly But mister Rossitur s frowning brow looked very little like it What do you say to our country life sir It s a confounded life sir said mister Rossitur taking a pamphlet from the table to fold and twist as he spoke it is a confounded life for the head and the hands must either live separate or the head must do no other work but wait upon the hands It is an alternative of loss and waste sir The alternative seems to be of a limited application said the doctor as Fleda having found that Hugh and Barby had been beforehand with her now came back to the company I am sure this lady would not give such a testimony About what said Fleda colouring under the fire of so many eyes The blighting influence of Ceres sceptre said mister Thorn This country life said her uncle do you like it Fleda You know uncle said she cheerfully I was always of the old Douglasses mind I like better to hear the lark sing than the mouse squeak Is that one of Earl Douglass s sayings said the doctor Yes sir said Fleda with quivering lips but not the one you know an older man Ah said the doctor intelligently mister Rossitur speaking of hands I have employed the Irish very much of late years they are as good as one can have if you do not want a head That is to say if you have a head said Thorn Exactly said the doctor all abroad and when there are not too many of them together I had enough of that sir some years ago when a multitude of them were employed on the public works The Irish were in a state of mutilation sir all through the country Ah said Thorn had the military been at work upon them No sir but I wish they had I am sure it would have been for the peace of the town There were hundreds of them We were in want of an army Of surgeons I should think said Thorn Fleda saw the doctor s dubious air and her uncle s compressed lips and commanding herself with even a look of something like displeasure she quitted her seat by mister Thorn and called the doctor to the window to look at a cluster of rose acacias just then in their glory He admired and she expatiated till she hoped everybody but herself had forgotten what they had been talking about But they had no sooner returned to their seats than Thorn began again The Irish in your town are not in the same mutilated state now I suppose sir No sir no said the doctor there are much fewer of them to break each other s bones It was all among themselves sir The country is full of foreigners said mister Rossitur with praiseworthy gravity Yes sir said doctor Quackenboss thoughtfully we shall have none of our ancestors left in a short time if they go on as they are doing Fleda was beaten from the field and rushing into the breakfast room astonished Hugh by seizing hold of him and indulging in a most prolonged and unbounded laugh She did not shew herself again till the company came in to supper but then she was found as grave as Minerva She devoted herself particularly to the care and entertainment of doctor Quackenboss till he took leave nor could Thorn get another chance to talk to her through all the evening When he and Rossitur were at last in their rooms Fleda told her story You don t know how pleasant it was aunt Lucy how much I enjoyed it seeing and talking to somebody again missus Evelyn was so very kind I am very glad my darling said missus Rossitur stroking away the hair from the forehead that was bent down towards her I am glad you had it to day and I am glad you will have it again to morrow You will have it too aunt Lucy missus Evelyn will be here in the morning she said so I shall not see her Why Now aunt Lucy you will I have nothing in the world to see her in I cannot You have this For the morning A rich French silk It would be absurd No no it would be better to wear my old merino than that But you will have to dress in the morning for mister Thorn he will be here to breakfast I shall not come down to breakfast Don t look so love I can t help it Why was that calico got for me and not for you said Fleda bitterly A sixpenny calico said missus Rossitur smiling it would be hard if you could not have so much as that love And you will not see missus Evelyn and her daughters at all and I was thinking that it would do you so much good missus Rossitur drew her face a little nearer and kissed it over and over It will do you good my darling that is what I care for much more It will not do me half as much said Fleda sighing Her spirits were in their old place again no more a tip toe to night The short light of pleasure was overcast She went to bed feeling very quiet indeed and received missus Evelyn and excused her aunt the next day almost wishing the lady had not been as good as her word But though in the same mood she set off with her to drive to Montepoole it could not stand the bright influences with which she found herself surrounded She came home again at night with dancing spirits It was some days before captain Rossitur began at all to comprehend the change which had come upon his family One morning Fleda and Hugh having finished their morning s work were in the breakfast room waiting for the rest of the family when Charlton made his appearance with the cloud on his brow which had been lately gathering Where is the paper said he I haven t seen a paper since I have been here You mustn t expect to find Mexican luxuries in Queechy captain Rossitur said Fleda pleasantly Look at these roses and don t ask me for papers He did look a minute at the dish of flowers she was arranging for the breakfast table and at the rival freshness and sweetness of the face that hung over them You don t mean to say you live without a paper Illustration Look at these roses and don t ask me for papers Well it s astonishing how many things people can live without said Fleda rather dreamily intent upon settling an uneasy rose that would topple over I wish you d answer me really said Charlton Don t you take a paper here We would take one thankfully if it would be so good as to come but seriously Charlton we haven t any she said changing her tone And have you done without one all through the war No we used to borrow one from a kind neighbour once in a while to make sure as mister Thorn says that you had not bartered an arm for a shoulder knot You never looked to see whether I was killed in the meanwhile I suppose No never said Fleda gravely as she took her place on a low seat in the corner I always knew you were safe before I touched the paper What do you mean I am not an enemy Charlton said Fleda laughing I mean that I used to make aunt Miriam look over the accounts before I did Charlton walked up and down the room for a little while in sullen silence and then brought up before Fleda What are you doing Fleda looked up a glance that as sweetly and brightly as possible half asked half bade him be silent and ask no questions What are you doing he repeated I am putting a patch on my shoe His look expressed more indignation than anything else What do you mean Just what I say said Fleda going on with her work What in the name of all the cobblers in the land do you do it for Because I prefer it to having a hole in my shoe which would give me the additional trouble of mending my stockings Charlton muttered an impatient sentence of which Fleda only understood that the devil was in it and then desired to know if whole shoes would not answer the purpose as well as either holes or patches Quite if I had them said Fleda giving him another glance which with all its gravity and sweetness carried also a little gentle reproach But do you know said he after standing still a minute looking at her that any cobbler in the country would do what you are doing much better for sixpence I am quite aware of that said Fleda stitching away Your hands are not strong enough for that work Fleda again smiled at him in the very dint of giving a hard push to her needle a smile that would have witched him into good humour if he had not been determinately in a cloud and proof against everything It only admonished him that he could not safely remain in the region of sunbeams and he walked up and down the room furiously again The sudden ceasing of his footsteps presently made her look up What have you got there Oh Charlton don t please put that down I didn t know I had left them there They were a little wet and I laid them on the chair to dry What do you call this said he not minding her request They are only my gardening gloves I thought I had put them away Gloves said he pulling at them disdainfully why here are two one within the other what s that for It s an old fashioned way of mending matters two friends covering each other s deficiencies The inner pair are too thin alone and the outer ones have holes that are past cobbling Are we going to have any breakfast to day said he flinging the gloves down You are very late No said Fleda quietly it is not time for aunt Lucy to be down yet Don t you have breakfast before nine o clock Yes by half past eight generally Strange way of getting along on a farm Well I can t wait I promised Thorn I would meet him this morning Barby I wish you would bring me my boots Fleda made two springs one to touch Charlton s mouth the other to close the door of communication with the kitchen Well what is the matter can t I have them Yes yes but ask me for what you want You mustn t call upon Barby in that fashion Why not is she too good to be spoken to What is she in the kitchen for She wouldn t be in the kitchen long if we were to speak to her in that way said Fleda I suppose she would as soon put your boots on for you as fetch and carry them I ll see about it It seems to me Fleda rules the house remarked captain Rossitur when she had left the room Well who should rule it said Hugh Not she I don t think she does said Hugh but if she did I am sure it could not be in better hands It shouldn t be in her hands at all But I have noticed since I have been here that she takes the arrangement of almost everything My mother seems to have nothing to do in her own family I wonder what the family or anybody in it would do without Fleda said Hugh his gentle eyes quite firing with indignation You had better know more before you speak Charlton What is there for me to know Fleda does everything So I say and that is what I don t like How little you know what you are talking about said Hugh I can tell you she is the life of the house almost literally we should have had little enough to live upon this summer if it had not been for her What do you mean impatiently enough Fleda if it had not been for her gardening and management She has taken care of the garden these two years and sold I can t tell you how much from it mister Sweet the hotel man at the Pool takes all we can give him How much does her taking care of the garden amount to It amounts to all the planting and nearly all the other work after the first digging by far the greater part of it Charlton walked up and down a few turns in most unsatisfied silence How does she get the things to Montepoole I take them You When I ride with them there before breakfast Fleda is up very early to gather them You have not been there this morning Yes With what Peas and strawberries And Fleda picked them Yes with some help from Barby and me That glove of hers was wringing wet Yes with the pea vines and strawberries too you know they get so loaded with dew O Fleda gets more than her gloves wet But she does not mind anything she does for father and mother Humph And does she get enough when all is done to pay for the trouble I don t know said Hugh rather sadly She thinks so It is no trifle Which the pay or the trouble Both But I meant the pay Why she made ten dollars last year from the asparagus beds alone and I don t know how much more this year Ten dollars The devil Why Have you come to counting your dollars by the tens We have counted our sixpences so a good while said Hugh quietly Charlton strode about the room again in much perturbation Then came in Fleda looking as bright as if dollars had been counted by the thousand and bearing his boots What on earth did you do that for said he angrily I could have gone for them myself No harm done said Fleda lightly only I have got something else instead of the thanks I expected I can t conceive said he sitting down and sulkily drawing on his foot gear why this piece of punctiliousness should have made any more difficulty about bringing me my boots than about blacking them A sly glance of intelligence which Charlton was quick enough to detect passed between Fleda and Hugh His eye carried its question from one to the other Fleda s gravity gave way Don t look at me so Charlton said she laughing I can t help it you are so excessively comical I recommend that you go out upon the grass plat before the door and turn round two or three times Will you have the goodness to explain yourself Who did black these boots Never pry into the secrets of families said Fleda Hugh and I have a couple of convenient little fairies in our service that do things unknownst I blacked them Charlton said Hugh captain Rossitur gave his slippers a fling that carried them clean into the corner of the room I will see he said rising whether some other service cannot be had more satisfactory than that of fairies Now Charlton said Fleda with a sudden change of manner coming to him and laying her hand most gently on his arm please don t speak about these things before uncle Rolf or your mother Please do not Charlton It would only do a great deal of harm and do no good She looked up in his face but he would not meet her pleading eye and shook off her hand I don t need to be instructed how to speak to my father and mother and I am not one of the household that has submitted itself to your direction Fleda sat down on her bench and was quiet but with a lip that trembled a little and eyes that let fall one or two witnesses against him Charlton did not see them and he knew better than to meet Hugh s look of reproach But for all that there was a certain consciousness that hung about the neck of his purpose and kept it down in spite of him and it was not till breakfast was half over that his ill humour could make head against this gentle thwarting and cast it off For so long the meal was excessively dull Hugh and Fleda had their own thoughts Charlton was biting his resolution into every slice of bread and butter that occupied him and mister Rossitur s face looked like anything but encouraging an inquiry into his affairs Since his son s arrival he had been most uncommonly gloomy and missus Rossitur s face was never in sunshine when his was in shade You ll have a warm day of it at the mill Hugh said Fleda by way of saying something to break the dismal monotony of knives and forks Does that mill make much suddenly inquired Charlton It has made a new bridge to the brook literally said Fleda gayly for it has sawn out the boards and you know you mustn t speak evil of what carries you over the water Does that mill pay for the working said Charlton turning with the dryest disregard from her interference and addressing himself determinately to his father What do you mean It does not work gratuitously answered mister Rossitur with at least equal dryness But I mean are the profits of it enough to pay for the loss of Hugh s time If Hugh judges they are not he is at liberty to let it alone My time is not lost said Hugh I don t know what I should do with it I don t know what we should do without the mill said missus Rossitur That gave Charlton an unlucky opening Has the prospect of farming disappointed you father What is the prospect of your company said mister Rossitur swallowing half an egg before he replied A very limited prospect said Charlton if you mean the one that went with me Not a fifth part of them left What have you done with them Shewed them where the balls were flying sir and did my best to shew them the thickest of it Is it necessary to shew it to us too said Fleda I believe there are not twenty living that followed me into Mexico he went on as if he had not heard her Was all that havoc made in one engagement said missus Rossitur whose cheek had turned pale Yes mother in the course of a few minutes I wonder what would pay for that loss said Fleda indignantly Why the point was gained and it did not signify what the cost was so we did that My poor boys were a small part of it What point do you mean I mean the point we had in view which was taking the place And what was the advantage of gaining the place Pshaw The advantage of doing one s duty But what made it duty said Hugh Orders I grant you said Fleda I understand that but bear with me Charlton what was the advantage to the army or the country The advantage of great honour if we succeeded and avoiding the shame of failure Is that all said Hugh All said Charlton Glory must be a precious thing when other men s lives are so cheap to buy it said Fleda We did not risk theirs without our own said Charlton colouring No but still theirs were risked for you Not at all why this is absurd you are saying that the whole war was for nothing What better than nothing was the end of it We paid Mexico for the territory she yielded to us didn t we uncle Rolf Yes How much Twenty millions I believe And what do you suppose the war has cost Hum I don t know a hundred A hundred million besides how much besides And don t you suppose uncle Rolf that for half of that sum Mexico would have sold us peaceably what she did in the end It is possible I think it is very likely What was the fruit of the war captain Rossitur Why a great deal of honour to the army and the nation at large Honour again But granting that the army gained it which they certainly did for one I do not feel very proud of the nation s share Why they are one said Charlton impatiently In an unjust war It was not an unjust war That s what you call a knock downer said Fleda laughing But I confess myself so simple as to have agreed with Seth Plumfield when I heard him and Lucas disputing about it last winter that it was a shame to a great and strong nation like ours to display its might in crushing a weak one But they drew it upon themselves They began hostilities There is a diversity of opinion about that Not in heads that have two grains of information I beg your pardon missus Evelyn and Judge Sensible were talking over that very question the other day at Montepoole and he made it quite clear to my mind that we were the aggressors Judge Sensible is a fool said mister Rossitur Very well said Fleda laughing but as I do not wish to be comprehended in the same class will you shew me how he was wrong uncle This drew on a discussion of some length to which Fleda listened with profound attention long after her aunt had ceased to listen at all and Hugh was thoughtful and Charlton disgusted At the end of it mister Rossitur left the table and the room and Fleda subsiding turned to her cold coffee cup I didn t know you ever cared anything about politics before said Hugh Didn t you said Fleda smiling You do me injustice Their eyes met for a second with a most appreciating smile on his part and then he too went off to his work There was a few minutes silent pause after that Mother said Charlton looking up and bursting forth what is all this about the mill and the farm Is not the farm doing well I am afraid not very well said missus Rossitur gently What is the difficulty Why your father has let it to a man by the name of Didenhover and I am afraid he is not faithful it does not seem to bring us in what it ought What did he do that for He was wearied with the annoyances he had to endure before and thought it would be better and more profitable to have somebody else take the whole charge and management He did not know Didenhover s character at the time Engaged him without knowing him Fleda was the only third party present and Charlton unwittingly allowing himself to meet her eye received a look of keen displeasure that he was not prepared for That is not like him he said in a much moderated tone But you must be changed too mother or you would not endure such anomalous service in your kitchen There are a great many changes dear Charlton said his mother looking at him with such a face of sorrowful sweetness and patience that his mouth was stopped Fleda left the room And have you really nothing to depend upon but that child s strawberries and Hugh s wood saw he said in the tone he ought to have used from the beginning Little else Charlton stifled two or three sentences that rose to his lips and began to walk up and down the room again His mother sat musing by the tea board still softly clinking her spoon against the edge of her tea cup She has grown up very pretty he remarked after a pause Pretty said missus Rossitur Why No one that has seen much of Fleda would ever describe her by that name Charlton had the candour to think he had seen something of her that morning Poor child said missus Rossitur sadly I can t bear to think of her spending her life as she is doing wearing herself out I know sometimes and buried alive Buried said Charlton in his turn Yes without any of the advantages and opportunities she ought to have I can t bear to think of it And yet how should I ever live without her said missus Rossitur leaning her face upon her hands And if she were known she would not be mine long But it grieves me to have her go without her music that she is so fond of and the books she wants she and Hugh have gone from end to end of every volume there is in the house I believe in every language except Greek Well she looks pretty happy and contented mother I don t know said missus Rossitur shaking her head Isn t she happy I don t know said missus Rossitur again she has a spirit that is happy in doing her duty or anything for those she loves but I see her sometimes wearing a look that pains me exceedingly I am afraid the way she lives and the changes in our affairs have worn upon her more than we know of she feels doubly everything that touches me or Hugh or your father She is a gentle spirit She seems to me not to want character said Charlton Character I don t know who has so much She has at least fifty times as much character as I have And energy She is admirable at managing people she knows how to influence them somehow so that everybody does what she wants And who influences her said Charlton Who influences her Everybody that she loves Who has the most influence over her do you mean I am sure I don t know Hugh if anybody but she is rather the moving spirit of the household captain Rossitur resolved that he would be an exception to her rule He forgot however for some reason or other to sound his father any more on the subject of mismanagement His thoughts indeed were more pleasantly taken up Chapter XXIV My lord Sebastian The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in you rub the sore When you should bring the plaster Tempest The Evelyns spent several weeks at the Pool and both mother and daughters conceiving a great affection for Fleda kept her in their company as much as possible For those weeks Fleda had enough of gayety She was constantly spending the day with them at the Pool or going on some party of pleasure or taking quiet sensible walks and rides with them along or with only one or two more of the most rational and agreeable people that the place could command And even missus Rossitur was persuaded more times than one to put herself in her plainest remaining French silk and entertain the whole party with the addition of one or two of Charlton s friends at her Queechy farm house Fleda enjoyed it all with the quick spring of a mind habitually bent to the patient fulfilment of duty and habitually under the pressure of rather sobering thoughts It was a needed and very useful refreshment Charlton s being at home gave her the full good of the opportunity more than would else have been possible He was her constant attendant driving her to and from the Pool and finding as much to call him there as she had for besides the Evelyns his friend Thorn abode there all this time The only drawback to Fleda s pleasure as she drove off from Queechy would be the leaving Hugh plodding away at his saw mill She used to nod and wave to him as they went by and almost feel that she ought not to go on and enjoy herself while he was tending that wearisome machinery all day long Still she went on and enjoyed herself but the mere thought of his patient smile as she passed would have kept her from too much elation of spirits if there had been any danger There never was any That s a lovely little cousin of yours said Thorn one evening when he and Rossitur on horseback were leisurely making their way along the up and down road between Montepoole and Queechy She is not particularly little said Rossitur with a dryness that somehow lacked any savour of gratification She is of a most fair stature said Thorn I did not mean anything against that but there are characters to which one gives instinctively a softening appellative Are there said Charlton Yes She is a lovely little creature She is not to compare to one of those girls we have left behind us at Montepoole said Charlton Hum well perhaps you are right but which girl do you mean for I profess I don t know The second of missus Evelyn s daughters the auburn haired one Miss Constance eh said Thorn In what isn t the other one to be compared to her In anything Nobody would ever think of looking at her in the same room Why not said Thorn coolly I don t know why not said Charlton except that she has not a tithe of her beauty That s a superb girl For a matter of twenty yards mister Thorn went softly humming a tune to himself and leisurely switching the flies off his horse Well said he there s no accounting for tastes I ask no red and white To make up my delight No odd becoming graces Black eyes or little know not what in faces What do you want then said Charlton half laughing at him though his friend was perfectly grave A cool eye and a mind in it A cool eye said Rossitur Yes Those we have left behind us are arrant will o the wisps dancing fires no more I can tell you there is fire sometimes in the other eyes said Charlton Very likely said his friend composedly I could have guessed as much but that is a fire you may warm yourself at no eternal phosphorescence it is the leaping up of an internal fire that only shews itself upon occasion I suppose you know what you are talking about said Charlton but I can t follow you into the region of volcanos Constance Evelyn has superb eyes It is uncommon to see a light blue so brilliant I would rather trust a sick head to the handling of the lovely lady than the superb one at a venture I thought you never had a sick head said Charlton That is lucky for me as the hands do not happen to be at my service But no imagination could put Miss Constance in Desdemona s place when Othello complained of his headache you remember Charlton Faith that s with watching twill away again Let me but bind this handkerchief about it hard Thorn gave the intonation truly and admirably Fleda never said anything so soft as that said Charlton No No You speak well but soft do you know what you are talking about there Not very well said Charlton I only remember there was nothing soft about Othello what you quoted of his wife just now seemed to me to smack of that quality I forgive your memory said Thorn or else I certainly would not forgive you If there is a fair creation in all Shakespeare it is Desdemona and if there is a pretty combination on earth that nearly matches it I believe it is that one What one Your pretty cousin Charlton was silent It is generous in me to undertake her defence Thorn went on for she bestows as little of her fair countenance upon me as she can well help But try as she will she cannot be so repellant as she is attractive Charlton pushed his horse into a brisker pace not favourable to conversation and they rode forward in silence till in descending the hill below Deepwater they came within view of Hugh s workplace the saw mill Charlton suddenly drew bridle There she is And who is with her said Thorn As I live our friend what s his name who has lost all his ancestors And who is the other My brother said Charlton I don t mean your brother captain Rossitur said Thorn throwing himself off his horse He joined the party who were just leaving the mill to go down towards the house Very much at his leisure Charlton dismounted and came after him I have brought Charlton safe home Miss Ringgan said Thorn who leading his horse had quietly secured a position at her side What s the matter said Fleda laughing Couldn t he bring himself home I don t know what s the matter but he s been uncommonly dumpish we ve been as near as possible to quarrelling for half a dozen miles back We have been a more agreeably employed said doctor Quackenboss looking round at him with a face that was a concentration of affability I make no doubt of it sir I trust we shall bring no unharmonious interruption If I may change somebody else s words he added more low to Fleda disdain itself must convert to courtesy in your presence I am sorry disdain should live to pay me a compliment said Fleda mister Thorn may I introduce to you mister Olmney mister Thorn honoured the introduction with perfect civility but then fell back to his former position and slightly lowered tone Are you then a sworn foe to compliments I was never so fiercely attacked by them as to give me any occasion I should be very sorry to furnish the occasion but what s the harm in them Miss Ringgan Chiefly a want of agreeableness Of agreeableness Pardon me I hope you will be so good as to give me the rationale of that I am of Miss Edgeworth s opinion sir said Fleda blushing that a lady may always judge of the estimation in which she is held by the conversation which is addressed to her And you judge compliments to be a doubtful indication of esteem I am sure you do not need information on that point sir As to your opinion or the matter of fact said he somewhat keenly As to the matter of fact said Fleda with a glance both simple and acute in its expression I will not venture to say a word said Thorn smiling Protestations would certainly fall flat at the gates where les douces paroles cannot enter But do you know this is picking a man s pocket of all his silver pennies and obliging him to produce his gold That would be a hard measure upon a good many people said Fleda laughing But they re not driven to that There s plenty of small change left You certainly do not deal in the coin you condemn said Thorn bowing But you will remember that none call for gold but those who can exchange it and the number of them is few In a world where cowrie passes current a man may be excused for not throwing about his guineas I wish you d throw about a few for our entertainment said Charlton who was close behind I haven t seen a yellow boy in a good while A proof that your eyes are not jaundiced said his friend without turning his head whatever may be the case with you otherwise Is he out of humour with the country life you like so well Miss Ringgan or has he left his domestic tastes in Mexico How do you think he likes Queechy You might as well ask myself said Charlton How do you think he likes Queechy Miss Ringgan I am afraid something after the fashion of Touchstone said Fleda laughing he thinks that in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherd s life it is naught In respect that it is solitary he likes it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life Now in respect it is in the fields it pleaseth him well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious There s a guinea for you captain Rossitur said his friend Do you know out of what mint It doesn t bear the head of Socrates said Charlton Hast no philosophy in thee Charlton said Fleda laughing back at him Has not Queechy a the honour of your approbation captain Rossitur said the doctor Certainly sir I have no doubt of its being a very fine country Only he has imbibed some doubts whether happiness be an indigenous crop said Thorn Undoubtedly said the doctor blandly to one who has roamed over the plains of Mexico Queechy must seem rather a rather flat place If he could lose sight of the hills said Thorn Undoubtedly sir undoubtedly said the doctor they are a marked feature in the landscape and do much to relieve a the charge of sameness Luckily said mister Olmney smiling happiness is not a thing of circumstance it depends on a man s self I used to think so said Thorn that is what I have always subscribed to but I am afraid I could not live in this region and find it so long What an evening said Fleda Queechy is doing its best to deserve our regards under this light mister Olmney did you ever notice the beautiful curve of the hills in that hollow where the sun sets I do notice it now he said It is exquisite said the doctor captain Rossitur do you observe sir in that hollow where the sun sets captain Rossitur s eye made a very speedy transition from the hills to Fleda who had fallen back a little to take Hugh s arm and placing herself between him and mister Olmney was giving her attention undividedly to the latter And to him she talked perseveringly of the mountains the country and the people till they reached the courtyard gate mister Olmney then passed on So did the doctor though invited to tarry averring that the sun had gone down behind the firmament and he had something to attend to at home You will come in Thorn said Charlton Why I had intended returning but the sun has gone down indeed and as our friend says there is no chance of our seeing him again I may as well go in and take what comfort is to be had in the circumstances Gentle Euphrosyne doth it not become the Graces to laugh They always ask leave sir said Fleda hesitating A most Grace ful answer though it does not smile upon me said Thorn I am sorry sir said Fleda smiling now that you have so many silver pennies to dispose of we shall never get at the gold I will do my very best said he So he did and made himself agreeable that evening to every one of the circle though Fleda s sole reason for liking to see him come in had been that she was glad of everything that served to keep Charlton s attention from home subjects She saw sometimes the threatening of a cloud that troubled her But the Evelyns and Thorn and everybody else whom they knew left the Pool at last before Charlton who was sufficiently well again had near run out his furlough and then the cloud which had only shewed itself by turns during all those weeks gathered and settled determinately upon his brow He had long ago supplied the want of a newspaper One evening in September the family were sitting in the room where they had had tea for the benefit of the fire when Barby pushed open the kitchen door and came in Fleda will you let me have one of the last papers I ve a notion to look at it Fleda rose and went to rummaging in the cupboards You can have it again in a little while said Barby considerately The paper was found and Miss Elster went out with it What an unendurable piece of ill manners that woman is said Charlton She has no idea of being ill mannered I assure you said Fleda His voice was like a brewing storm hers was so clear and soft that it made a lull in spite of him But he began again There is no necessity for submitting to impertinence I never would do it I have no doubt you never will said his father Unless you can t help yourself Is there any good reason sir why you should not have proper servants in the house A very good reason said mister Rossitur Fleda would be in despair Is there none beside that said Charlton dryly None except a trifling one mister Rossitur answered in the same tone We cannot afford it dear Charlton said his mother softly There was a silence during which Fleda moralized on the ways people take to make themselves uncomfortable Does that man to whom you let the farm does he do his duty I am not the keeper of his conscience I am afraid it would be a small charge to any one said Fleda But are you the keeper of the gains you ought to have from him does he deal fairly by you May I ask first what interest it is of yours It is my interest sir because I come home and find the family living upon the exertions of Hugh and Fleda and find them growing thin and pale under it You at least are free from all pains of the kind captain Rossitur Don t listen to him uncle Rolf said Fleda going round to her uncle and making as she passed a most warning impression upon Charlton s arm don t mind what he says that young gentleman has been among the Mexican ladies till he has lost an eye for a really proper complexion Look at me do I look pale and thin I was paid a most brilliant compliment the other day upon my roses Uncle don t listen to him he hasn t been in a decent humour since the Evelyns went away She knelt down before him and laid her hands upon his and looked up in his face to bring all her plea the plea of most winning sweetness of entreaty in features yet flushed and trembling His own did not unbend as he gazed at her but he gave her a silent answer in a pressure of the hands that went straight from his heart to hers Fleda s eye turned to Charlton appealingly Is it necessary he repeated that that child and this boy should spend their days in labour to keep the family alive If it were replied mister Rossitur I am very willing that their exertions should cease For my own part I would quite as lief be out of the world as in it Charlton how can you said Fleda half beside herself you should know of what you speak or be silent Uncle don t mind him he is talking wildly my work does me good You do not understand yourself said Charlton obstinately it is more than you ought to do and I know my mother thinks so too Illustration She knelt down before him Well said mister Rossitur it seems there is an agreement in my own family to bring me to the bar get up Fleda let us hear all the charges to be brought against me at once and then pass sentence What have your mother and you agreed upon Charlton go on missus Rossitur now beyond speech left the room weeping even aloud Hugh followed her Fleda wrestled with her agitation for a minute or two and then got up and put both arms round her uncle s neck Don t talk so dear uncle Rolf you make us very unhappy aunt Lucy did not mean any such thing it is only Charlton s nonsense Do go and tell her you don t think so you have broken her heart by what you said do go uncle Rolf do go and make her happy again Forget it all Charlton did not know what he was saying won t you go dear uncle Rolf The words were spoken between bursts of tears that utterly overcame her though they did not hinder the utmost caressingness of manner It seemed at first spent upon a rock mister Rossitur stood like a man that did not care what happened or what became of him dumb and unrelenting suffering her sweet words and imploring tears with no attempt to answer the one or stay the other But he could not hold out against her beseeching He was no match for it He returned at last heartily the pressure of her arms and unable to give her any other answer kissed her two or three times such kisses as are charged with the heart s whole message and disengaging himself left the room For a minute after he was gone Fleda cried excessively and Charlton now alone with her felt as if he had not a particle of self respect left to stand upon One such agony would do her more harm than whole weeks of labour and weariness He was too vexed and ashamed of himself to be able to utter a word but when she recovered a little and was leaving the room he stood still by the door in an attitude that seemed to ask her to speak a word to him I am sure Charlton she said gently you will be sorry to morrow for what you have done I am sorry now he said But she passed out without saying anything more captain Rossitur passed the night in unmitigated vexation with himself But his repentance could not have been very genuine since his most painful thought was what Fleda must think of him He was somewhat reassured at breakfast to find no traces of the evening s storm indeed the moral atmosphere seemed rather clearer and purer than common His own face was the only one which had an unusual shade upon it There was no difference in anybody s manner towards himself and there was even a particularly gentle and kind pleasantness about Fleda intended he knew to soothe and put to rest any movings of self reproach he might feel It somehow missed of its aim and made him feel worse and after on his part a very silent meal he quitted the house and took himself and his discontent to the woods Whatever effect they had upon him it was the middle of the morning before he came back again He found Fleda alone in the breakfast room sewing and for the first time noticed the look his mother had spoken of a look not of sadness but rather of settled patient gravity the more painful to see because it could only have been wrought by long acting causes and might be as slow to do away as it must have been to bring Charlton s displeasure with the existing state of things had revived as his remorse died away and that quiet face did not have a quieting effect upon him What on earth is going on he began rather abruptly as soon as he entered the room What horrible cookery is on foot I venture to recommend that you do not inquire said Fleda It was set on foot in the kitchen and it has walked in here If you open the window it will walk out But you will be cold Never mind in that case I will walk out too into the kitchen Into the thick of it No I will try some other way of relief This is unendurable Fleda looked but made no other remonstrance and not heeding the look mister Charlton walked out into the kitchen shutting the door behind him Barby said he you have got something cooking here that is very disagreeable in the other room Is it said Barby I reckoned it would all fly up chimney I guess the draught ain t so strong as I thought it was But I tell you it fills the house Well it ll have to a spell yet said Barby cause if it didn t you see captain Rossitur there d be nothing to fill Fleda s chickens with Chickens where s all the corn in the land It s some place besides in our barn said Barby All last year s is out and mister Didenhover ha n t fetched any of this year s home so I made a bargain with em they shouldn t starve as long as they d eat boiled pursley What do you give them Most everything they ain t particler now a days chunks o cabbage and scarcity and pun kin and that all the sass that ain t wanted And do they eat that Eat it said Barby They don t know how to thank me for t But it ought to be done out of doors said Charlton coming back from a kind of maze in which he had been listening to her It is unendurable Then I guess you ll have to go some place where you won t know it said Barby that s the most likely plan I can hit upon for it ll have to stay on till it s ready Charlton went back into the other room really down hearted and stood watching the play of Fleda s fingers Is it come to this he said at length Is it possible that you are obliged to go without such a trifle as the miserable supply of food your fowls want That s a small matter said Fleda speaking lightly though she smothered a sigh We have been obliged to do without more than that What is the reason Why this man Didenhover is a rogue I suspect and he manages to spirit away all the profits that should come to uncle Rolf s hands I don t know how We have lived almost entirely upon the mill for some time And has my father been doing nothing all this while Nothing on the farm And what of anything else I don t know said Fleda speaking with evident unwillingness But surely Charlton he knows his own business best It is not our affair He is mad said Charlton violently striding up and down the floor No said Fleda with equal gentleness and sadness he is only unhappy I understand it all he has had no spirit to take hold of anything ever since we came here Spirit said Charlton he ought to have worked off his fingers to their joints before he let you do as you have been doing Don t say so said Fleda looking even pale in her eagerness don t think so Charlton it isn t right We cannot tell what he may have had to trouble him I know he has suffered and does suffer a great deal Do not speak again about anything as you did last night Oh said Fleda now shedding bitter tears this is the worst of growing poor the difficulty of keeping up the old kindness and sympathy and care for each other I am sure it does not work so upon you said Charlton in an altered voice Promise me dear Charlton said Fleda looking up after a moment and drying her eyes again promise me you will not say any more about these things I am sure it pains uncle Rolf more than you think Say you will not for your mother s sake I will not Fleda for your sake I would not give you any more trouble to bear Promise me that you will be more careful of yourself in future O there is no danger about me said Fleda with a faint smile and taking up her work again Who are you making shirts for said Charlton after a pause Hugh You do everything for Hugh don t you Little enough Not half so much as he does for me Is he up at the mill to day He is always there said Fleda sighing There was another silence Charlton said Fleda looking up with a face of the loveliest insinuation isn t there something you might do to help us a little I will help you garden Fleda with pleasure I would rather you should help somebody else said she still looking at him What Hugh You would have me go and work at the mill for him I suppose Don t be angry with me Charlton for suggesting it said Fleda looking down again Angry said he But is that what you would have me do Not unless you like I didn t know but you might take his place once in a while for a little to give him a rest And suppose some of the people from Montepoole that know me should come by What are you thinking of said he in a tone that certainly justified Fleda s deprecation Well said Fleda in a kind of choked voice there is a strange rule of honour in vogue in the world Why should I help Hugh rather than anybody else He is killing himself said Fleda letting her work fall and hardly speaking the words through thick tears Her head was down and they came fast Charlton stood abashed for a minute You sha n t do so Fleda said he gently endeavouring to raise her you have tired yourself with this miserable work Come to the window you have got low spirited but I am sure without reason about Hugh but you shall set me about what you will You are right I dare say and I am wrong but don t make me think myself a brute and I will do anything you please He had raised her up and made her lean upon him Fleda wiped her eyes and tried to smile I will do anything that will please you Fleda It is not to please me she answered meekly I would not have spoken a word last night if I had known it would have grieved you so I am sorry you should have none but so poor a reason for doing right said Fleda gently Upon my word I think you are about as good reason as anybody need have said Charlton She put her hand upon his arm and looked up such a look of pure rebuke as carried to his mind the full force of the words she did not speak Who art thou that carest for a worm which shall die and forgettest the Lord thy Maker Charlton s eyes fell Fleda turned gently away and began to mend the fire He stood watching her for a little What do you think of me Fleda he said at length A little wrong headed answered Fleda giving him a glance and a smile I don t think you are very bad If you will go with me Fleda you shall make what you please of me He spoke half in jest half in earnest and did not himself know at the moment which way he wished Fleda to take it But she had no notion of any depth in his words A hopeless task she answered lightly shaking her head as she got down on her knees to blow the fire I am afraid it is too much for me I have been trying to mend you ever since you came and I cannot see the slightest change for the better Where is the bellows said Charlton in another tone It has expired its last breath said Fleda In other words it has lost its nose Well look here said he laughing and pulling her away you will stand a fair chance of losing your face if you put it in the fire You sha n t do it Come and shew me where to find the scattered parts of that old wind instrument and I will see if it cannot be persuaded to play again Chapter XXV I dinna ken what I should want If I could get but a man Scotch Ballad captain Rossitur did no work at the saw mill But Fleda s words had not fallen to the ground He began to shew care for his fellow creatures in getting the bellows mended his next step was to look to his gun and from that time so long as he staid the table was plentifully supplied with all kinds of game the season and the country could furnish Wild ducks and partridges banished pork and bacon even from memory and Fleda joyfully declared she would not see another omelette again till she was in distress While Charlton was still at home came a very urgent invitation from missus Evelyn that Fleda should pay them a long visit in New York bidding her care for no want of preparation but come and make it there Fleda demurred however on that very score But before her answer was written another missive came from doctor Gregory not asking so much as demanding her presence and enclosing a fifty dollar bill for which he said he would hold her responsible till she had paid him with not her own hands but her own lips There was no withstanding the manner of this entreaty Fleda packed up some of missus Rossitur s laid by silks to be refreshed with an air of fashion and set off with Charlton at the end of his furlough To her simple spirit of enjoyment the weeks ran fast and all manner of novelties and kindnesses helped them on It was a time of cloudless pleasure But those she had left thought it long She wrote them how delightfully she kept house for the old doctor whose wife had long been dead and how joyously she and the Evelyns made time fly And every pleasure she felt awoke almost as strong a throb in the hearts at home But they missed her as Barby said dreadfully and she was most dearly welcomed when she came back It was just before New Year For half an hour there was most gladsome use of eyes and tongues Fleda had a great deal to tell them How well how well you are looking dear Fleda said her aunt for the third or fourth time That s more than lean say for you and Hugh aunt Lucy What have you been doing to yourself Nothing new they said as her eye went from one to the other I guess you have wanted me said Fleda shaking her head as she kissed them both again I guess we have said Hugh but don t fancy we have grown thin upon the want But where s uncle Rolf you didn t tell me He is gone to look after those lands in Michigan In Michigan When did he go Very soon after you And you didn t let me know O why didn t you How lonely you must have been Let you know indeed said missus Rossitur wrapping her in her arms again Hugh and I counted every week that you staid with more and pleasure each one I understand said Fleda laughing under her aunt s kisses Well I am glad I am at home again to take care of you I see you can t get along without me People have been very kind Fleda said Hugh Have they Yes thinking we were desolate I suppose There has been no end to aunt Miriam s goodness and pleasantness O aunt Miriam always said Fleda And Seth Catherine Douglass has been up twice to ask if her mother could do anything for us and missus Douglass sent us once a rabbit and once a quantity of wild pigeons that Earl had shot Mother and I lived upon pigeons for I don t know how long Barby wouldn t eat em she said she liked pork better but I believe she did it on purpose Like enough said Fleda smiling from her aunt s arms where she still lay And Seth has sent you plenty of your favourite hickory nuts very fine ones and I gathered butternuts enough for you near home Everything is for me said Fleda Well the first thing I do shall be to make some butternut candy for you You won t despise that mister Hugh Hugh smiled at her and went on And your friend mister Olmney has sent us a corn basket full of the superbest apples you ever saw He has one tree of the finest in Queechy he says My friend said Fleda colouring a little Well I don t know whose he is if he isn t yours said Hugh And even the Finns sent us some fish that their brother had caught because they said they had more than they wanted And doctor Quackenboss sent us a goose and a turkey We didn t like to keep them but we were afraid if we sent them back it would not be understood Send them back said Fleda That would never do All Queechy would have rung with it Well we didn t said Hugh But so we sent one of them to Barby s old mother for Christmas Poor doctor Quackenboss said Fleda That man has as near as possible killed me two or three times As for the others they are certainly the oddest of all the finny tribes I must go out and see Barby for a minute It was a good many minutes however before she could get free to do any such thing You ha n t lost no flesh said Barby shaking hands with her anew What did they think of Queechy keep down in York I don t know I didn t ask them said Fleda How goes the world with you Barby I m mighty glad you are come home Fleda said Barby lowering her voice Why said Fleda in a like tone I guess I ain t all that s glad of it Miss Elster went on with a glance of her bright eye I guess not said Fleda reddening a little but what is the matter There s two of our friends ha n t made us but one visit a piece since oh ever since some time in October Well never mind the people said Fleda Tell me what you were going to say And mister Olmney said Barby not minding her he s took and sent us a great basket chock full of apples Now wa n t that smart of him when he knowed there wa n t no one here that cared about em They are a particularly fine kind said Fleda Did you hear about the goose and turkey Yes said Fleda laughing The doctor thinks he has done the thing just about right this time I s pect He had ought to take out a patent right for his invention He d feel spry if he knowed who eat one on em Never mind the doctor Barby Was this what you wanted to see me for No said Barby changing her tone I d give something it was I ve been all but at my wit s end for you know Mis Rossitur ain t no hand about anything I couldn t say a word to her and ever since he went away we have been just winding ourselves up I thought I should clear out when Mis Rossitur said maybe you wa n t a coming till next week But what is it Barby what is wrong There ha n t been anything right to my notions for a long spell said Barby wringing out her dishcloth hard and flinging it down to give herself uninterruptedly to talk but now you see Didenhover nor none of the men never comes near the house to do a chore and there ain t wood to last three days and Hugh ain t fit to cut it if it was piled up in the yard and there ain t the first stick of it out of the woods yet Fleda sat down and looked very thoughtfully into the fire He had ought to ha seen to it afore he went away but he ha n t done it and there it is Why who takes care of the cows said Fleda O never mind the cows said Barby they ain t suffering I wish we was as well off as they be but I guess when he went away he made a hole in our pockets for to mend his n I don t say he hadn t ought to ha done it but we ve been pretty short ever sen Fleda we re in the last bushel of flour and there ain t but a handful of corn meal and mighty little sugar white or brown I did say something to Mis Rossitur but all the good it did was to spile her appetite I s pose and if there s grain in the floor there ain t nobody to carry it to mill nor to thresh it nor a team to draw it fur s I know Hugh cannot cut wood said Fleda nor drive to mill either in this weather I could go to mill said Barby now you re to hum but that s only the beginning and it s no use to try to do everything flesh and blood must stop somewhere No indeed said Fleda We must have somebody immediately That s what I had fixed upon said Barby If you could get hold o some young feller that wa n t sot up with an idee that he was a grown man and too big to be told I d just clap to and fix that little room up stairs for him and give him his victuals here and we d have some good of him instead o having him streakin off just at the minute when he d ought to be along Who is there we could get Barby I don t know said Barby but they say there is never a nick that there ain t a jog some place so I guess it can be made out I asked Mis Plumfield but she didn t know anybody that was out of work nor Seth Plumfield I ll tell you who does that is if there is anybody Mis Douglass She keeps hold of one end of most everybody s affairs I tell her Anyhow she s a good hand to go to I ll go there at once said Fleda Do you know anything about making maple sugar Barby That s the very thing exclaimed Barby ecstatically There s lots o sugar maples on the farm and it s murder to let them go to loss and they ha n t done us a speck o good ever since I come here And in your grandfather s time they used to make barrels and barrels You and me and Hugh and somebody else we ll have we could clap to and make as much sugar and molasses in a week as would last us till spring come round again There s no sense into it All we d want would be to borrow a team some place I had all that in my head long ago If we could see the last of that man Didenhover oncet I d take hold of the plough myself and see if I couldn t make a living out of it I don t believe the world would go now Fleda if it wa n t for women I never see three men yet that didn t try me more than they were worth Patience Barby said Fleda smiling Let us take things quietly Well I declare I m beat to see how you take em said Barby looking at her lovingly Don t you know why Barby I s pose I do said Barby her face softening still more or I can guess Because I know that all these troublesome things will be managed in the best way and by my best friend and I know that he will let none of them hurt me I am sure of it isn t that enough to keep me quiet Fleda s eyes were filling and Barby looked away from them Well it beats me she said taking up her dishcloth again why you should have anything to trouble you I can understand wicked folks being plagued but I can t see the sense of the good ones Troubles are to make good people better Barby Well said Barby with a very odd mixture of real feeling and seeming want of it it s a wonder I never got religion for I will say that all the decent people I ever see were of that kind Mis Rossitur ain t though is she No said Fleda a pang crossing her at the thought that all her aunt s loveliness must tell directly and heavily in this case to lighten religion s testimony It was that thought and no other which saddened her brow as she went back into the other room Troubles already said missus Rossitur You will be sorry you have come back to them dear No indeed said Fleda brightly I am very glad I have come home We will try and manage the troubles aunt Lucy There was no doing anything that day but the very next afternoon Fleda and Hugh walked down through the snow to missus Douglass s It was a long walk and a cold one and the snow was heavy but the pleasure of being together made up for it all It was a bright walk too in spite of everything In a most thrifty looking well painted farm house lived missus Douglass Why tain t you is it she said when she opened the door Catharine said it was and I said I guessed it wa n t for I reckoned you had made up your mind not to come and see me at all How do you do The last sentence in the tone of hearty and earnest hospitality Fleda made her excuses Ay ay I can understand all that just as well as if you said it I know how much it means too Take off your hat Fleda said she could not stay and explained her business So you ha n t come to see me after all Well now take off your hat cause I won t have anything to say to you till you do I ll give you supper right away But I have left my aunt alone missus Douglass and the afternoons are so short now it would be dark before we could get home Serve her right for not coming along and you sha n t walk home in the dark for Earl will harness the team and carry you home like a streak the horses have nothing to do Come you sha n t go And as missus Douglass laid violent hands on her bonnet Fleda thought best to submit She was presently rewarded with the promise of the very person she wanted a boy or young man then in Earl Douglass s employ but his wife said she guessed he d give him up to her and what his wife said Fleda knew Earl Douglass was in the habit of making good There ain t enough to do to keep him busy said missus Douglass I told Earl he made me more work than he saved but he s hung on till now What sort of a boy is he missus Douglass He ain t a steel trap I tell you beforehand said the lady with one of her sharp intelligent glances he don t know which way to go till you shew him but he s a clever enough kind of a chap he don t mean no harm I guess he ll do for what you want Is he to be trusted Trust him with anything but a knife and fork said she with another look and shake of the head He has no idea but what everything on the supper table is meant to be eaten straight off I would keep two such men as my husband as soon as I would Philetus Philetus said Fleda the person that brought the chicken and thought he had brought two You ve hit it said missus Douglass Now you know him How do you like our new minister We are all very much pleased with him He s very good looking don t you think so A very pleasant face I ha n t seen him much yet except in church but those that know say he is very agreeable in the house Truly I dare say answered Fleda for missus Douglass s face looked for her testimony But I think he looks as if he was beating his brains out there among his books I tell him he is getting the blues living in that big house by himself Do you manage to do all your work without help missus Douglass said Fleda knowing that the question was in order and that the affirmative answer was not counted a thing to be ashamed of Well I guess I ll know good reason said missus Douglass complacently before I ll have any help to spoil my work Come along and I ll let you see whether I want one Fleda went very willingly to be shewn all missus Douglass s household arrangements and clever contrivances of her own or her husband s devising for lessening or facilitating labour The lady was proud and had some reason to be of the very superb order and neatness of each part and detail No corner or closet that might not be laid open fearlessly to a visitor s inspection Miss Catharine was then directed to open her piano and amuse Fleda with it while her mother performed her promise of getting an early supper a command grateful to one or two of the party for Catharine had been carrying on all this while a most stately tete a tete with Hugh which neither had any wish to prolong So Fleda filled up the time good naturedly with thrumming over the two or three bits of her childish music that she could recall till mister Douglass came in and they were summoned to sit down to supper which missus Douglass introduced by telling her guests they must take what they could get for she had made fresh bread and cake and pies for them two or three times and she wa n t a going to do it again Her table was abundantly spread however and with most exquisite neatness and everything was of excellent quality saving only certain matters which call for a free hand in the use of material Fleda thought the pumpkin pies must have been made from that vaunted stock which is said to want no eggs nor sugar and the cakes she told missus Rossitur afterwards would have been good if half the flour had been left out and the other ingredients doubled The deficiency in one kind however was made up by superabundance in another the table was stocked with such wealth of crockery that one could not imagine any poverty in what was to go upon it Fleda hardly knew how to marshal the confusion of plates which grouped themselves around her cup and saucer and none of them might be dispensed with There was one set of little glass dishes for one kind of sweetmeat another set of ditto for another kind an army of tiny plates to receive and shield the tablecloth from the dislodged cups of tea saucers being the conventional drinking vessels and there were the standard bread and butter plates which besides their proper charge of bread and butter and beef and cheese were expected Fleda knew to receive a portion of every kind of cake that might happen to be on the table It was a very different thing however from Miss Anastasia s tea table or that of Miss Flora Quackenboss Fleda enjoyed the whole time without difficulty mister Douglass readily agreed to the transfer of Philetus s services He s a good boy said Earl he s a good boy he s as good a kind of a boy as you need to have He wants tellin most boys want tellin but he ll do when he is told and he means to do right How long do you expect your uncle will be gone said missus Douglass I do not know said Fleda Have you heard from him since he left Not since I came home said Fleda mister Douglass what is the first thing to be done about the maple trees in the sugar season Why you calculate to try makin sugar in the spring Perhaps at any rate I should like to know about it Well I should think you would said Earl and it s easy done there ain t nothin easier when you know the right way to set to work about it and there s a fine lot of sugar trees on the old farm I recollect of them sugar trees as long ago as when I was a boy I ve helped to work them afore now but there s a good many years since has made me a leetle older but the first thing you want is a man and a team to go about and empty the buckets the buckets must be emptied every day and then carry it down to the house Yes I know said Fleda but what is the first thing to be done to the trees Why la tain t much to do to the trees all you ve got to do is to take an axe and chip a bit out and stick a chip a leetle way into the cut for to dreen the sap and set a trough under and then go on to the next one and so on you may make one or two cuts in the south side of the tree and one or two cuts in the north side if the tree s big enough and if it ain t only make one or two cuts in the south side of the tree and for the sap to run good it had ought to be that kind o weather when it freezes in the day and thaws by night I would say when it friz in the night and thaws in the day the sap runs more bountifully in that kind o weather It needed little from Fleda to keep mister Douglass at the maple trees till supper was ended and then as it was already sundown he went to harness the sleigh It was a comfortable one and the horses if not very handsome nor bright curried were well fed and had good heart to their work A two mile drive was before them and with no troublesome tongues or eyes to claim her attention Fleda enjoyed it fully In the soft clear winter twilight when heaven and earth mingle so gently and the stars look forth brighter and cheerfuller than ever at another time they slid along over the fine roads too swiftly towards home and Fleda s thoughts as easily and swiftly slipped away from mister Douglass and maple sugar and Philetus and an unfilled wood yard and an empty flour barrel and revelled in the pure ether A dark rising ground covered with wood sometimes rose between her and the western horizon and then a long stretch of snow only less pure would leave free view of its unearthly white light dimmed by no exhalation a gentle mute but not the less eloquent witness to Earth of what Heaven must be But the sleigh stopped at the gate and Fleda s musings came home Good night said Earl in reply to their thanks and adieus tain t anything to thank a body for let me know when you re a goin into the sugar making and I ll come and help you How sweet a pleasant message may make an unmusical tongue said Fleda as she and Hugh made their way up to the house We had a stupid enough afternoon said Hugh But the ride home was worth it all Chapter XXVI Tis merry tis merry in good green wood So blithe Lady Alice is singing On the beech s pride and the oak s brown side Lord Richard s axe is ringing Lady of the Lake Philetus came and was inducted into office and the little room immediately and Fleda felt herself eased of a burden Barby reported him stout and willing and he proved it by what seemed a perverted inclination for bearing the most enormous logs of wood he could find into the kitchen He will hurt himself said Fleda I ll protect him against anything but buckwheat batter said Barby with a grave shake of her head Lazy folks takes the most pains I tell him But it would be good to have some more ground Fleda for Philetus says he don t care for no dinner when he has griddles to breakfast and there ain t anything much cheaper than that Aunt Lucy have you any change in the house said Fleda that same day There isn t but three and sixpence said missus Rossitur with a pained conscious look What is wanting dear Only candles Barby has suddenly found we are out and she won t have any more made before to morrow Never mind There is only that repeated missus Rossitur Hugh has a little money due to him from last summer but he hasn t been able to get it yet You may take that dear No said Fleda we mustn t We might want it more We can sit in the dark for once said Hugh and try to make an uncommon display of what doctor Quackenboss calls sociality No said Fleda who had stood busily thinking I am going to send Philetus down to the post office for the paper and when it comes I am not to be balked of reading it I ve made up my mind We ll go right off into the woods and get some pine knots Hugh come They make a lovely light You get us a couple of baskets and the hatchet I wish we had two and I ll be ready in no time That ll do It is to be noticed that Charlton had provided against any future deficiency of news in his family Fleda skipped away and in five minutes returned arrayed for the expedition in her usual out of door working trim namely an old dark merino cloak almost black the effect of which was continued by the edge of an old dark mousseline below and rendered decidedly striking by the contrast of a large whitish yarn shawl worn over it the whole crowned with a little close fitting hood made of some old silver grey silk shaped tight to the head without any bow or furbelow to break the outline But such a face within side of it She came almost dancing into the room This is Miss Ringgan as she appeared when she was going to see the pine trees Hugh don t you wish you had a picture of me I have got a tolerable picture of you somewhere said Hugh This is somebody very different from the Miss Ringgan that went to see missus Evelyn I can tell you Fleda went on gayly Do you know aunt Lucy I have made up my mind that my visit to New York was a dream and the dream is nicely folded away with my silk dresses Now I must go tell that precious Philetus about the post office I am so comforted aunt Lucy whenever I see that fellow staggering into the house under a great log of wood I have not heard anything in a long time so pleasant as the ringing strokes of his axe in the yard Isn t life made up of little things Why don t you put a better pair of shoes on Can t afford it missus Rossitur You are extravagant Go and put on my India rubbers No ma am the rocks would cut them to pieces I have brought my mind down to my shoes It isn t safe Fleda you might see somebody Well ma am But I tell you I am not going to see anybody but the chick a dees and the snow birds and there is great simplicity of manners prevailing among them The shoes were changed and Hugh and Fleda set forth lingering awhile however to give a new edge to their hatchet Fleda turning the grindstone They mounted then the apple orchard hill and went a little distance along the edge of the table land before striking off into the woods They had stood still a minute to look over the little white valley to the snow dressed woodland beyond This is better than New York Hugh said Fleda I am very glad to hear you say that said another voice Fleda turned and started a little to see mister Olmney at her side and congratulated herself instantly on her shoes missus Rossitur told me where you had gone and gave me permission to follow you but I hardly hoped to overtake you so soon We stopped to sharpen our tools said Fleda We are out on a foraging expedition Will you let me help you Certainly if you understand the business Do you know a pine knot when you see it He laughed and shook his head but avowed a wish to learn Well it would be a charity to teach you anything wholesome said Fleda for I heard one of mister Olmney s friends lately saying that he looked like a person who was in danger of committing suicide Suicide One of my friends he exclaimed in the utmost astonishment Yes said Fleda laughing and there is nothing like the open air for clearing away vapours You cannot have known that by experience said he looking at her Fleda shook her head and advising him to take nothing for granted set off into the woods They were in a beautiful state A light snow but an inch or two deep had fallen the night before the air had been perfectly still during the day and though the sun was out bright and mild it had done little but glitter on the earth s white capping The light dry flakes of snow had not stirred from their first resting place The long branches of the large pines were just tipped with snow at the ends on the smaller evergreens every leaf and tuft had its separate crest Stones and rocks were smoothly rounded over little shrubs and sprays that lay along the ground were all doubled in white and the hemlock branches bending with their feathery burthen stooped to the foreheads of the party and gave them the freshest of salutations as they brushed by The whole wood scene was particularly fair and graceful A light veil of purity no more thrown over the wilderness of stones and stumps and bare ground like the blessing of charity covering all roughnesses and unsightlinesses like the innocent unsullied nature that places its light shield between the eye and whatever is unequal unkindly and unlovely in the world What do you think of this for a misanthropical man mister Olmney there s a better tonic to be found in the woods than in any remedies of man s devising Better than books said he Certainly No comparison I have to learn that yet So I suppose said Fleda The very danger to be apprehended as I hear sir is from your running a tilt into some of those thick folios of yours head foremost There s no pitch there Hugh you may leave it alone We must go on there are more yellow pines higher up But who could give such a strange character of me to you said mister Olmney I am sure your wisdom would not advise me to tell you that sir You will find nothing there mister Olmney They went gayly on careering about in all directions and bearing down upon every promising stump or dead pine tree they saw in the distance Hugh and mister Olmney took turns in the labour of hewing out the fat pine knots and splitting down the old stumps to get at the pitchy heart of the wood and the baskets began to grow heavy The whole party were in excellent spirits and as happy as the birds that filled the woods and whose cheery chick a dee dee dee was heard whenever they paused to rest and let the hatchet be still How one sees everything in the colour of one s own spectacles said Fleda May I ask what colour yours are to day said mister Olmney Rose I think said Hugh No said Fleda they are better than that they are no worse colour than the snow s own they shew me everything just as it is It could not be lovelier Then we may conclude may we not said mister Olmney that you are not sorry to find yourself in Queechy again I am not sorry to find myself in the woods again That is not pitch mister Olmney It has the same colour and weight No it is only wet see this and smell of it do you see the difference Isn t it pleasant Everything is pleasant to day said he smiling I shall report you a cure Come I want to go a little higher and shew you a view Leave that Hugh we have got enough But Hugh chose to finish an obstinate stump and his companions went on without him It was not very far up the mountain and they came to a fine look out point the same where Fleda and mister Carleton had paused long before on their quest after nuts The wide spread of country was a white waste now the delicate beauties of the snow were lost in the far view and the distant Catskill shewed wintrily against the fair blue sky The air was gentle enough to invite them to stand still after the exercise they had taken and as they both looked in silence mister Olmney observed that his companion s face settled into a gravity rather at variance with the expression it had worn I should hardly think said he softly that you were looking through white spectacles if you had not told us so O a shade may come over what one is looking at you know said Fleda But seeing that he still watched her inquiringly she added I do not think a very wide landscape is ever gay in its effect upon the mind do you Perhaps I do not know said he his eyes turning to it again as if to try what the effect was My thoughts had gone back said Fleda to a time a good while ago when I was a child and stood here in summer weather and I was thinking that the change in the landscape is something like that which years make in the mind But you have not for a long time at least known any very acute sorrow No said Fleda but that is not necessary There is a gentle kind of discipline which does its work I think more surely Thank God for gentle discipline said mister Olmney if you do not know what those griefs are that break down mind and body together I am not unthankful I hope for anything said Fleda gently but I have been apt to think that after a crushing sorrow the mind may rise up again but that a long continued though much lesser pressure in time breaks the spring He looked at her again with a mixture of incredulous and tender interest but her face did not belie her words strange as they sounded from so young and in general so bright seeming a creature There shall no evil happen to the just he said presently and with great sympathy Fleda flashed a look of gratitude at him it was no more for she felt her eyes watering and turned them away You have not I trust heard any bad news No sir not at all I beg pardon for asking but missus Rossitur seemed to be in less good spirits than usual He had some reason to say so having found her in a violent fit of weeping You do not need to be told he went on of the need there is that a cloud should now and then come over this lower scene the danger that if it did not our eyes would look nowhere else There is something very touching in hearing a kind voice say what one has often struggled to say to oneself I know it sir said Fleda her words a little choked and one may not wish the cloud away but it does not the less cast a shade upon the face I guess Hugh has worked his way into the middle of that stump by this time mister Olmney They rejoined him and the baskets being now sufficiently heavy and arms pretty well tired they left the further riches of the pine woods unexplored and walked sagely homewards At the brow of the table land mister Olmney left them to take a shorter cut to the high road having a visit to make which the shortening day warned him not to defer Put down your basket and rest a minute Hugh said Fleda I had a world of things to talk to you about and this blessed man has driven them all out of my head But you are not sorry he came along with us O no We had a very good time How lovely it is Hugh Look at the snow down there without a track and the woods have been dressed by the fairies O look how the sun is glinting on the west side of that hillock Illustration How lovely it is Hugh It is twice as bright since you have come home said Hugh The snow is too beautiful to day O I was right one may grow morbid over books but I defy anybody in the company of those chick a dees I should think it would be hard to keep quite sound in the city You are glad to be here again aren t you said Hugh Very O Hugh it is better to be poor and have one s feet on these hills than to be rich and shut up to brick walls It is best as it is said Hugh quietly Once Fleda went on one fair day when I was out driving in New York it did come over me with a kind of pang how pleasant it would be to have plenty of money again and be at ease and then as I was looking off over that pretty North river to the other shore I bethought me A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked Hugh did not answer for the face she turned to him in its half tearful half bright submission took away his speech Why you cannot have enjoyed yourself as much as we thought Fleda if you dislike the city so much Yes I did O I enjoyed a great many things I enjoyed being with the Evelyns You don t know how much they made of me every one of them father and mother and all the three daughters and uncle Orrin I have been well petted I can tell you since I have been gone I am glad they shewed so much discrimination said Hugh they would be puzzled to make too much of you I must have been in a remarkably discriminating society said Fleda for everybody was very kind How do you like the Evelyns on a nearer view Very much indeed and I believe they really love me Nothing could possibly be kinder in all ways of shewing kindness I shall never forget it Who were you driving with that day said Hugh mister Thorn Did you see much of him Quite as much as I wished Hugh I took your advice About what said Hugh I carried down some of my scribblings and sent them to a Magazine Did you said Hugh looking delighted And will they publish them I don t know said Fleda that s another matter I sent them or uncle Orrin did when I first went down and I have heard nothing of them yet You shewed them to uncle Orrin Couldn t help it you know I had to And what did he say to them Come I m not going to be cross questioned said Fleda laughing He did not prevent my sending them And if they take them do you expect they will give anything for them the Magazine people I am sure if they don t they shall have no more that is my only possible inducement to let them be printed For my own pleasure I would far rather not Did you sign with your own name My own name Yes and desired it to be printed in large capitals What are you thinking of No I hope you ll forgive me but I signed myself what our friend the doctor calls Yugh I ll forgive you if you ll do one thing for me What Shew me all you have in your portfolio Do Fleda to night by the light of the pitch pine knots Why shouldn t you give me that pleasure And besides you know Moliere had an old woman Well said Fleda with a face that to Hugh was extremely satisfactory we ll see I suppose you might as well read my productions in manuscript as in print But they are in a terribly scratchy condition they go sometimes for weeks in my head before I find time to put them down you may guess polishing is pretty well out of the question Suppose we try to get home with these baskets Which they did Has Philetus got home was Fleda s first question No said missus Rossitur but doctor Quackenboss has been here and brought the paper he was at the post office this morning he says Did you see mister Olmney Yes ma am and I feel he has saved me from a lame arm those pine knots are so heavy He is a lovely young man said missus Rossitur with uncommon emphasis I should have been blind to the fact aunt Lucy if you had not made me change my shoes At present no disparagement to him I feel as if a cup of tea would be rather more lovely than anything else He sat with me some time said missus Rossitur I was afraid he would not overtake you Tea was ready and only waiting for missus Rossitur to come down stairs when Fleda whose eye was carelessly running along the columns of the paper uttered a sudden shout and covered her face with it Hugh looked up in astonishment but Fleda was beyond anything but exclamations laughing and flushing to the very roots of her hair What is the matter Fleda Why said Fleda how comical I was just looking over the list of articles in the January number of the Excelsior The Excelsior said Hugh Yes the Magazine I sent my things to I was running over their advertisement here where they give a special puff of the publication in general and of several things in particular and I saw here they speak of A tale of thrilling interest by missus Eliza Lothbury unsurpassed and so forth and so forth another valuable communication from mister Charleston whose first acute and discriminating paper all our readers will remember the beginning of a new tale from the infallibly graceful pen of Miss Delia Lawriston we are sure it will be so and so The wind s voices by our new correspondent Hugh has a delicate sweetness that would do no discredit to some of our most honoured names What do you think of that What Hugh thought he did not say but he looked delighted and came to read the grateful words for himself I did not know but they had declined it utterly said Fleda it was so long since I had sent it and they had taken no notice of it but it seems they kept it for the beginning of a new volume Would do no discredit to some of our most honoured names said Hugh Dear Fleda I am very glad But it is no more than I expected Expected said Fleda When you had not seen a line Hush My dear Hugh aren t you hungry The tea with this spice to their appetites was wonderfully relished and Hugh and Fleda kept making despatches of secret pleasure and sympathy to each other s eyes though Fleda s face after the first flush had faded was perhaps rather quieter than usual Hugh s was illuminated mister Skillcorn is a smart man said Barby coming in with a package he has made out to go two miles in two hours and get back again safe More from the post office exclaimed Fleda pouncing upon it oh yes there has been another mail A letter for you aunt Lucy from uncle Rolf We ll forgive him Barby And here s a letter for me from uncle Orrin and yes the Excelsior Hugh uncle Orrin said he would send it Now for those blessed pine knots Aunt Lucy you shall be honoured with the one whole candle the house contains The table soon cleared away the basket of fat fuel was brought in and one or two splinters being delicately insinuated between the sticks on the fire a very brilliant illumination sprang out Fleda sent a congratulatory look over to Hugh on the other side of the fireplace as she cosily established herself on her little bench at one corner with her letter he had the Magazine missus Rossitur between them at the table with her one candle was already insensible to all outward things And soon the other two were as delightfully absorbed The bright light of the fire shone upon three motionless and rapt figures and getting no greeting from them went off and danced on the old cupboard doors and paper hangings in a kindly hearty joviality that would have put any number of stately wax candles out of countenance There was no poverty in the room that night But the people were too busy to know how cosy they were till Fleda was ready to look up from her note and Hugh had gone twice carefully over the new poem when there was a sudden giving out of the pine splinters New ones were supplied in eager haste and silence and Hugh was beginning The wind s voices for the third time when a soft whispered Hugh across the fire made him look over to Fleda s corner She was holding up with both hands a five dollar bank note and just shewing him her eyes over it What s that said Hugh in an energetic whisper I don t know said Fleda shaking her head comically I am told The wind s voices have blown it here but privately I am afraid it is a windfall of another kind What said Hugh laughing Uncle Orrin says it is the first fruits of what I sent to the Excelsior and that more will come but I do not feel at all sure that it is entirely the growth of that soil I dare say it is said Hugh I am sure it is worth more than that Dear Fleda I like it so much Fleda gave him such a smile of grateful affection not at all as if she deserved his praise but as if it was very pleasant to have What put it into your head anything in particular No nothing I was looking out of the window one day and seeing the willow tree blow and that looked over my shoulder as you know Hans Andersen says his stories did It is just like you exactly as it can be Things put themselves in my head said Fleda tucking another splinter into the fire Isn t this better than a chandelier Ten times And so much pleasanter for having got it ourselves What a nice time we had Hugh Very Now for the portfolio Fleda come mother is fast she won t see or hear anything What does father say mother In answer to this they had the letter read which indeed contained nothing remarkable beyond its strong expressions of affection to each one of the little family a cordial which missus Rossitur drank and grew strong upon in the very act of reading It is pity the medicine of kind words is not more used in the world it has so much power Then having folded up her treasure and talked a little while about it missus Rossitur caught up the Magazine like a person who had been famished in that kind and soon she and it and her tallow candle formed a trio apart from all the world again Fleda and Hugh were safe to pass most mysterious looking little papers from hand to hand right before her though they had the care to read them behind newspapers and exchanges of thought and feeling went on more swiftly still and softly across the fire Looks and smiles and whispers and tears too under cover of a Tribune and an Express And the blaze would die down just when Hugh had got to the last verse of something and then while impatiently waiting for the new pine splinters to catch he would tell Fleda how much he liked it or how beautiful he thought it and whisper enquiries and critical questions till the fire reached the fat vein and leaped up in defiant emulation of gas lights unknown and then he would fall to again with renewed gusto And Fleda hunted out in her portfolio what bits to give him first and bade him as she gave them remember this and understand that which was necessary to be borne in mind in the reading And through all the brightening and fading blaze and all the whispering congratulating explaining and rejoicing going on at her side missus Rossitur and her tallow candle were devoted to each other happily and engrossingly At last however she flung the Magazine from her and turning from the table sat looking into the fire with a rather uncommonly careful and unsatisfied brow What did you think of the second piece of poetry there mother said Hugh that ballad The wind s voices it is called The wind s voices I don t know I didn t read it I believe Why mother I liked it very much Do read it read it aloud missus Rossitur took up the Magazine again abstractedly and read Mamma what makes your face so sad The sound of the wind makes me feel glad But whenever it blows as grave you look As if you were reading a sorrowful book A sorrowful book I am reading dear A book of weeping and pain and fear A book deep printed on my heart Which I cannot read but the tears will start That breeze to my ear was soft and mild Just so when I was a little child But now I hear in its freshening breath The voices of those that sleep in death Mamma said the child with shaded brow What is this book you are reading now And why do you read what makes you cry My child it comes up before my eye Tis the memory love of a far off day When my life s best friend was taken away Of the weeks and months that my eyes were dim Watching for tidings watching for him Many a year has come and past Since a ship sailed over the ocean fast Bound for a port on England s shore She sailed but was never heard of more Mamma and she closer pressed her side Was that the time when my father died Is it his ship you think you see Dearest mamma won t you speak to me The lady paused but then calmly said Yes Lucy the sea was his dying bed And now whenever I hear the blast I think again of that storm long past The winds fierce bowlings hurt not me But I think how they beat on the pathless sea Of the breaking mast of the parting rope Of the anxious strife and the failing hope Mamma said the child with streaming eyes My father has gone above the skies And you tell me this world is mean and base Compared with heaven that blessed place My daughter I know I believe it all I would not his spirit to earth recall The blest one he his storm was brief Mine a long tempest of tears and grief I have you my darling I should not sigh I have one star more in my cloudy sky The hope that we both shall join him there In that perfect rest from weeping and care Well mother how do you like it said Hugh whose eyes gave tender witness to his liking for it It is pretty said missus Rossitur Hugh exclaimed and Fleda laughing took it out of her hand Why mother said Hugh it is Fleda s Fleda s exclaimed missus Rossitur snatching the Magazine again My dear child I was not thinking in the least of what I was reading Fleda s She read it over anew with swimming eyes this time and then clasped Fleda in her arms and gave her not words but the better reward of kisses and tears They remained so a long time even till Hugh left them and then Fleda released from her aunt s embrace still crouched by her side with one arm in her lap They both sat thoughtfully looking into the fire till it had burnt itself out and nothing but a glowing bed of coals remained That is an excellent young man said missus Rossitur Who mister Olmney He sat with me some time after you had gone So you said before said Fleda wondering at the troubled expression of her aunt s face He made me wish said missus Rossitur hesitating that I could be something different from what I am I believe I should be a great deal happier The last word was hardly spoken Fleda rose to her knees and putting both arms about her aunt pressed face to face with a clinging sympathy that told how very near her spirit was while tears from the eyes of both fell without measure Dear aunt Lucy dear aunt Lucy I wish you would I am sure you would be a great deal happier But the mixture of feelings was too much for Fleda her head sank lower on her aunt s bosom and she wept aloud But I don t know anything about it said missus Rossitur as well as she could speak I am as ignorant as a child Dear aunty that is nothing God will teach you if you ask him he has promised Oh ask him aunt Lucy I know you would be happier I know it is better a million times to be a child of God than to have everything in the world If they only brought us that I would be very glad of all our troubles indeed I would But I don t think I ever did anything right in my life said poor missus Rossitur Dear aunt Lucy said Fleda straining her closer and with her very heart gushing out at these words dear aunty Christ came for just such sinners for just such as you and I You said missus Rossitur but speech failed utterly and with a muttered prayer that Fleda would help her she sunk her head upon her shoulder and sobbed herself into quietness or into exhaustion The glow of the firelight faded away till only a faint sparkle was left in the chimney There was not another word spoken but when they rose up with such kisses as gave and took unuttered affection counsel and sympathy they bade each other good night Fleda went to her window for the moon rode high and her childish habit had never been forgotten But surely the face that looked out that night was as the face of an angel In all the pouring moonbeams that filled the air she could see nothing but the flood of God s goodness on a dark world And her heart that night had nothing but an unbounded and unqualified thanksgiving for all the gentle discipline they had felt for every sorrow and weariness and disappointment except besides the prayer almost too deep to be put into words that its due and hoped for fruit might be brought forth unto perfection Chapter XXVII I become not a cart as well as another man a plague on my bringing up Shakspeare Every day could not be as bright as the last even by the help of pitch pine knots They blazed indeed many a time but the blaze shone upon faces that it could not sometimes light up Matters drew gradually within a smaller and smaller compass Another five dollars came from uncle Orrin and the hope of more but these were carefully laid by to pay Philetus and for all other wants of the household excepting those the farm supplied the family were dependent on mere driblets of sums None came from mister Rossitur Hugh managed to collect a very little That kept them from absolute distress that and Fleda s delicate instrumentality Regular dinners were given up fresh meat being now unheard of unless when a kind neighbour made them a present and appetite would have lagged sadly but for Fleda s untiring care She thought no time nor pains ill bestowed which could prevent her aunt and Hugh from feeling the want of old comforts and her nicest skill was displayed in varying the combinations of their very few and simple stores The diversity and deliciousness of her bread stuffs Barby said was beyond everything and a cup of rich coffee was found to cover all deficiencies of removes and entremets and this was always served Barby said further as if the President of the United States was expected Fleda never permitted the least slackness in the manner of doing this or anything else that she could control mister Plumfield had sent down an opportune present of a fine porker One cold day in the beginning of February Fleda was busy in the kitchen making something for dinner and Hugh at another table was vigorously chopping sausage meat I should like to have some cake again said Fleda Well why don t you said Hugh chopping away No eggs mister Rossitur and can t afford em at two shillings a dozen I believe I am getting discontented I have a great desire to do something to distinguish myself I would make a plum pudding if I had raisins but there is not one in the house You can get em up to mister Hemps s for sixpence a pound said Barby But Fleda shook her head at the sixpence and went on moulding out her biscuits diligently I wish Philetus would make his appearance with the cows it is a very odd thing they should be gone since yesterday morning and no news of them I only hope the snow ain t so bright it ll blind his eyes said Barby There he is this minute said Hugh It is impossible to tell from his countenance whether successful or not Well where are the cows mister Skillcorn said Barby as he came in I have went all over town said the person addressed and they ain t no place Have you asked news of them Philetus I have asked the hull town and I have went all over till I was a most beat out with the cold and I ha n t seen the first sight of em yet Fleda and Hugh exchanged looks while Barby and mister Skillcorn entered into an animated discussion of probabilities and impossibilities If we should be driven from our coffee dinners to tea with no milk in it said Hugh softly in mock dismay Wouldn t said Fleda We d beat up an egg and put it in the coffee We couldn t afford it said Hugh smiling Could cheaper than to keep the cows I ll have some sugar at any rate I m determined Philetus Marm I wish when you have got a good pile of wood chopped you would make some troughs to put under the maple trees you know how to make them don t you I do I wish you would make some you have pine logs out there large enough haven t you They hadn t ought to want much of it there s some gregious big ones I don t know how many we shall want but a hundred or two at any rate and the sooner the better Do you know how much sugar they make from one tree Wall I don t said mister Skillcorn with the air of a person who was at fault on no other point the big trees give more than the little ones Fleda s eyes flashed at Hugh who took to chopping in sheer desperation and the muscles of both gave them full occupation for five minutes Philetus stood comfortably warming himself at the fire looking first at one and then at the other as if they were a show and he had paid for it Barby grew impatient I guess this cold weather makes lazy people of me she said bustling about her fire with an amount of energy that was significant It seemed to signify nothing to Philetus He only moved a little out of the way Didenhover s cleared out he burst forth at length abruptly What said Fleda and Barby at once the broom and the biscuits standing still mister Didenhover What of him He has tuk himself off out o town Where to I can t tell you where teu he ain t coming back tain t likely How do you know Cause he s tuk all his traps and went and he said farming didn t pay and he wa n t a going to have nothin more to deu with it he telled Mis Simpson so he lived to Mis Simpson s and she telled mister Ten Eyck Are you sure Philetus Sure as lection he telled Mis Simpson so and she telled mister Ten Eyck and he s cleared out Fleda and Hugh again looked at each other mister Skillcorn having now delivered himself of his news went out to the woodyard I hope he ha n t carried off our cows along with him said Barby as she too went out to some other part of her premises He was to have made us quite a payment on the first of March said Fleda Yes and that was to have gone to uncle Orrin said Hugh We shall not see a cent of it And we wanted a little of it for ourselves I have that money from the Excelsior but I can t touch a penny of it for it must go to Philetus s wages What Barby does without hers I do not know she has had but one five dollars in six months Why she stays I cannot imagine unless it is for pure love As soon as the spring opens I can go to the mill again said Hugh after a little pause Fleda looked at him sorrowfully and shook her head as she withdrew her eyes I wish father would give up the farm Hugh went on under his breath I cannot bear to live upon uncle Orrin so Fleda s answer was to clasp her hands Her only words were Don t say anything to aunt Lucy It is of no use to say anything to anybody said Hugh But it weighs me to the ground Fleda If uncle Rolf doesn t come home by spring I hope I hope he will but if he does not I will take desperate measures I will try farming myself Hugh I have thought of it and I certainly will I will get Earl Douglass or somebody else to play second fiddle but I will have but one head on the farm and I will try what mine is worth You could not do it Fleda One can do anything with a strong enough motive I m afraid you d soon be tired Fleda Not if I succeeded not so tired as I am now Poor Fleda I dare say you are tired It wasn t that I meant said Fleda slightly drawing her breath I meant this feeling of everything going wrong and uncle Orrin and all But you are weary said Hugh affectionately I see it in your face Not so much body as mind after all Oh Hugh this is the worst part of being poor the constant occupation of one s mind on a miserable succession of trifles I am so weary sometimes If I only had a nice book to rest myself for a while and forget all these things I would give so much for it Dear Fleda I wish you had That was one delight of being in New York I forgot all about money from one end of it to the other I put all that away and not having to think of meals till I came to eat them You can t think how tired I get of ringing the changes on pork and flour and Indian meal and eggs and vegetables Fleda looked tired and pale and Hugh looked sadly conscious of it Don t tell aunt Lucy I have said all this she exclaimed after a moment rousing herself I don t always feel so only once in a while I get such a fit And now I have just troubled you by speaking of it You don t trouble any one in that way very often dear Fleda said Hugh kissing her I ought not at all you have enough else to think of but it is a kind of relief sometimes I like to do these things in general only now and then I get tired as I was just now I suppose and then one sees everything through a different medium I am afraid it would tire you more to have the charge of Earl Douglass and the farm upon your mind and mother could be no help to you nor I if I am at the mill But there s Seth Plumfield O I ve thought of it all You don t know what I am up to mister Rossitur You shall see how I will manage unless uncle Rolf comes home in which case I will very gladly forego all my honours and responsibilities together I hope he will come said Hugh But this hope was to be disappointed mister Rossitur wrote again about the first of March saying that he hoped to make something of his lands in Michigan and that he had the prospect of being engaged in some land agencies which would make it worth his while to spend the summer there He bade his wife let anybody take the farm that could manage it and would pay and to remit to doctor Gregory whatever she should receive and could spare He hoped to do something where he was It was just then the beginning of the sugar season and missus Douglass having renewed and urged Earl s offer of help Fleda sent Philetus down to ask him to come the next day with his team Seth Plumfield s which had drawn the wood in the winter was now busy in his own sugar business On Earl Douglass s ground there happpened to be no maple trees His lands were of moderate extent and almost entirely cultivated as a sheep farm and mister Douglass himself though in very comfortable circumstances was in the habit of assisting on advantageous terms all the farmers in the neighbourhood Philetus came back again in a remarkably short time and announced that he had met doctor Quackenboss in the way who had offered to come with his team for the desired service Then you have not been to mister Douglass s I have not said Philetus I thought likely you wouldn t calculate to want him teu How came the doctor to know what you were going for I told him But how came you to tell him Wall I guess he had a mind to know said Philetus so I didn t keep it no closer than I had teu Well said Fleda biting her lips you will have to go down to mister Douglass s nevertheless Philetus and tell him the doctor is coming to morrow but I should be very much obliged to him if he will be here next day Will you Yes marm Now dear Hugh will you make me those little spouts for the trees of some dry wood you can get plenty out here You want to split them up with a hollow chisel about a quarter of an inch thick and a little more than half an inch broad Have you got a hollow chisel No but I can get one up the hill Why must it be hollow To make little spouts you know for the sap to run in And then my dear Hugh they must be sharpened at one end so as to fit where the chisel goes in I am afraid I have given you a day s work of it How sorry I am you must go to morrow to the mill and yet I am glad too Why need you go round yourself with these people said Hugh I don t see the sense of it They don t know where the trees are said Fleda I am sure I do not Do you Perfectly well And besides said Fleda laughing I should have great doubts of the discreetness of Philetus s auger if it were left to his simple direction I have no notion the trees would yield their sap as kindly to him as to me But I didn t bargain for doctor Quackenboss doctor Quackenboss arrived punctually the next morning with his oxen and sled and by the time it was loaded with the sap troughs Fleda in her black cloak yarn shawl and grey little hood came out of the house to the wood yard Earl Douglass was there too not with his team but merely to see how matters stood and give advice Good day mister Douglass said the doctor You see I m so fortunate as to have got the start of you Very good said Earl contentedly you may have it the start s one thing and the pull s another I m willin anybody should have the start but it takes a pull to know whether a man s got stuff in him or no What do you mean said the doctor I don t mean nothin at all You make a start to day and I ll come ahint and take the pull to morrow Ha you got anythin to boil down in Fleda there s a potash kittle somewheres ain t there I guess there is There is in most houses There is a large kettle I suppose large enough said Fleda That ll do I guess Well what do you calculate to put the syrup in ha you got a good big cask or plenty o tubs and that or will you sugar off the hull lot every night and fix it that way You must do one thing or t other and it s good to know what you re a going to do afore you come to do it I don t know mister Douglass said Fleda whichever is the best way we have no cask large enough I am afraid Well I tell you what I ll do I know where there s a tub and where they ain t usin it nother and I reckon I can get em to let me have it I reckon I can and I ll go round for t and fetch it here to morrow mornin when I come with the team Twon t be much out of my way It s more handier to leave the sugarin off till the next day and it had ought to have a settlin besides Where ll you have your fire built in doors or out Out I would rather if we can But can we La tain t nothin easier it s as easy out as in all you ve got to do is to take and roll a couple of pretty sized billets for your fireplace and stick a couple o crotched sticks for to hang the kittle over I d as lieve have it out as in and if anythin a leetle liever If you ll lend me Philetus me and him ll fix it all ready agin you come back tain t no trouble at all and if the sticks ain t here we ll go into the woods after em and have it all sot up But Fleda represented that the services of Philetus were just then in requisition and that there would be no sap brought home till to morrow Very good said Earl amicably very good it s just as easy done one day as another it don t make no difference to me and if it makes any difference to you of course we ll leave it to day and there ll be time enough to do it to morrow me and him ll knock it up in a whistle What s them little shingles for Fleda explained the use and application of Hugh s mimic spouts He turned one about whistling while he listened to her That s some o Seth Plumfield s new jigs ain t it I wonder if he thinks now the sap s a goin to run any sweeter out o that ere than it would off the end of a chip that wa n t quite so handsome No mister Douglass said Fleda smiling he only thinks that this will catch a little more His sugar won t never tell where it come from remarked Earl throwing the spout down Well you shall see more o me to morrow Good bye doctor Quackenboss Do you contemplate the refining process said the doctor as they moved off I have often contemplated the want of it said Fleda but it is best not to try to do too much I should like to make sure of something worth refining in the first place mister Douglass and I said the doctor I hope a he s a very good hearted man Miss Fleda but ha ha he wouldn t suffer loss from a little refining himself Haw you rascal where are you going Haw I tell ye I am very sorry doctor Quackenboss said Fleda when she had the power and the chance to speak again I am very sorry you should have to take this trouble but unfortunately the art of driving oxen is not among mister Skillcorn s accomplishments My dear Miss Ringgan said the doctor I I nothing I assure you could give me greater pleasure than to drive my oxen to any place where you would like to have them go Poor Fleda wished she could have despatched them and him in one direction while she took another the art of driving oxen quietly was certainly not among the doctor s accomplishments She was almost deafened She tried to escape from the immediate din by running before to shew Philetus about tapping the trees and fixing the little spouts but it was a longer operation than she had counted upon and by the time they were ready to leave the tree the doctor was gee hawing alongside of it and then if the next maple was not within sight she could not in decent kindness leave him alone The oxen went slowly and though Fleda managed to have no delay longer than to throw down a trough as the sled came up with each tree which she and Philetus had tapped the business promised to make a long day of it It might have been a pleasant day in pleasant company but Fleda s spirits were down to set out with and doctor Quackenboss was not the person to give them the needed spring his long winded complimentary speeches had not interest enough even to divert her She felt that she was entering upon an untried and most weighty undertaking charging her time and thoughts with a burthen they could well spare Her energies did not flag but the spirit that should have sustained them was not strong enough for the task It was a blustering day of early March with that uncompromising brightness of sky and land which has no shadow of sympathy with a heart overcast The snow still lay a foot thick over the ground thawing a little in sunny spots the trees quite bare and brown the buds even of the early maples hardly shewing colour the blessed evergreens alone doing their utmost to redeem the waste and speaking of patience and fortitude that can brave the blast and outstand the long waiting and cheerfully bide the time when the winter shall be over and gone Poor Fleda thought they were like her in their circumstances but she feared she was not like them in their strong endurance She looked at the pines and hemlocks as she passed as if they were curious preachers to her and when she had a chance she prayed quietly that she might stand faithfully like them to cheer a desolation far worse and she feared far more abiding than snows could make or melt away She thought of Hugh alone in his mill work that rough chilly day when the wind stalked through the woods and over the country as if it had been the personification of March just come of ape and taking possession of his domains She thought of her uncle doing what in Michigan leaving them to fight with difficulties as they might why why and her gentle aunt at home sad and alone pining for the want of them all but most of him and fading with their fortunes And Fleda s thoughts travelled about from one to the other and dwelt with them all by turns till she was heart sick and tears tears fell hot on the snow many a time when her eyes had a moment s shield from the doctor and his somewhat more obtuse coadjutor She felt half superstitiously as if with her taking the farm were beginning the last stage of their falling prospects which would leave them with none of hope s colouring Not that in the least she doubted her own ability and success but her uncle did not deserve to have his affairs prosper under such a system and she had no faith that they would It is most grateful said the doctor with that sideway twist of his jaw and his head at once in harmony it is a most grateful thing to see such a young lady Haw I there now I what are you about haw haw then It is a most grateful thing to see But Fleda was not at his side she had bounded away and was standing under a great maple tree a little ahead making sure that Philetus screwed his auger up into the tree instead of down which he had several times shewed an unreasonable desire to do The doctor had steered his oxen by her little grey hood and black cloak all the day He made for it now Have we arrived at the termination of our a adventure said he as he came up and threw down the last trough Why no sir said Fleda for we have yet to get home again Tain t so fur going that way as it were this n said Philetus My ain t I glad Glad of what said the doctor Here s Miss Ringgan s walked the whole way and she a lady ain t you ashamed to speak of being tired I ha n t said the first word o being tired said Philetus in an injured tone of voice but a man ha n t no right to kill hisself if he ain t a gal I ll qualify to your being safe enough said the doctor But Miss Ringgan my dear you are a you have lost something since you came out What said Fleda laughing Not my patience No said the doctor no you re a you re an angel but your cheeks my dear Miss Ringgan shew that you have exceeded your a Not my intentions doctor said Fleda lightly I am very well satisfied with our day s work and with my share of it and a cup of coffee will make me quite up again Don t look at my cheeks till then I shall disobey you constantly said the doctor but my dear Miss Fleda we must give you some felicities for reaching home or missus Rossitur will be a distressed when she sees them Might I propose that you should just bear your weight on this wood sled and let my oxen and me have the honour The cup of coffee I am confident would be at your lips considerably earlier The sun won t be a great haighth by the time we get there said Philetus in a cynical manner and I ha n t took the first thing to day Well who has said the doctor you ain t the only one Follow your nose down hill mister Skillcorn and it ll smell supper directly Now my dear Miss Ringgan will you Fleda hesitated but her relaxed energies warned her not to despise a homely mode of relief The wood sled was pretty clean and the road decently good over the snow So Fleda gathered her cloak about her and sat down flat on the bottom of her rustic vehicle too grateful for the rest to care if there had been a dozen people to laugh at her but the doctor was only delighted and Philetus regarded every social phenomenon as coolly and in the same business light as he would the butter to his bread or any other infallible every day matter Fleda was very glad presently that she had taken this plan for besides the rest of body she was happily relieved from all necessity of speaking The doctor though but a few paces off was perfectly given up to the care of his team in the intense anxiety to shew his skill and gallantry in saving her harmless from every ugly place in the road that threatened a jar or a plunge Why his oxen didn t go distracted was a question but the very vehemence and iteration of his cries at last drowned itself in Fleda s ear and she could hear it like the wind s roaring without thinking of it She presently subsided to that With a weary frame and with that peculiar quietness of spirits that comes upon the ending of a days work in which mind and body have both been busily engaged and the sudden ceasing of any call upon either fancy asked no leave and dreamily roved hither and thither between the material and the spirit world the will too subdued to stir Days gone by came marshalling their scenes and their actors before her again she saw herself a little child under those same trees that stretched their great black arms over her head and swaying their tops in the wind seemed to beckon her back to the past They talked of their old owner whose steps had so often passed beneath them with her own light tread light now but how dancing then by his side and of her father whose hand perhaps had long ago tapped those very trees where she had noticed the old closed up soars of the axe At any rate his boyhood had rejoiced there and she could look back to one time at least in his manhood when she had taken a pleasant walk with him in summer weather among those same woods in that very ox track she believed Gone two generations that she had known there hopes and fears and disappointments akin to her own at rest as hers would be and how sedately the old trees stood telling her of it and waving their arms in grave and gentle commenting on the folly of anxieties that came and went with the wind Fleda agreed to it all she heard all they said and her own spirit was as sober and quiet as their quaint moralizing She felt as if it would never dance again The wind had greatly abated of its violence as if satisfied with the shew of strength it had given in the morning it seemed willing to make no more commotion that day The sun was far on his way to the horizon and many a broad hill side slope was in shadow the snow had blown or melted from off the stones and rocks leaving all their roughness and bareness unveiled and the white crust of snow that lay between them looked a cheerless waste in the shade of the wood and the hill But there were other spots where the sunbeams struck and bright streams of light ran between the trees smiling and making them smile And as Fleda s eye rested there another voice seemed to say At evening time it shall be light and Sorrow may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning She could have cried but spirits were too absolutely at an ebb She knew this was partly physical because she was tired and faint but it could not the better be overcome Yet those streaks of sunlight were pleasant company and Fleda watched them thinking how bright they used to be once till the oxen and sled came out from the woods and she could see the evening colours on the hill tops beyond the village lighting up the whole landscape with promise of the morrow She thought her day had seen its brightest but she thought too that if she must know sorrows it was a very great blessing to know them at Queechy The smoke of the chimney tops came in sight and fancy went home a few minutes before her I wonder what you ll take and do to yourself next said Barby in extreme vexation when she saw her come in You re as white as the wall and as cold ain t you I d ha let Philetus cut all the trees and drink all the sap afterwards I wonder which you think is the worst the want o you or the want o sugar A day s headache was pretty sure to visit Fleda after any over exertion or exhaustion and the next day justified Barby s fears She was the quiet prisoner of pain But Earl Douglass and mister Skillcorn could now do without her in the woods and her own part of the trouble Fleda always took with speechless patience She had the mixed comfort that love could bestow Hugh s sorrowful kiss and look before setting off for the mill missus Rossitur s caressing care and Barby s softened voice and sympathizing hand on her brow and hearty heart speaking kiss and poor little King lay all day with his head in her lap casting grave wistful glances up at his mistress s face and licking her hand with intense affection when even in her distress it stole to his head to reward and comfort him He never would budge from her side or her feet till she could move herself and he knew that she was well As sure as King came trotting into the kitchen Barby used to look into the other room and say So you re better ain t you Fleda I knowed it After hours of suffering the fit was at last over and in the evening though looking and feeling racked Fleda would go out to see the sap boilers Earl Douglass and Philetus had had a very good day of it and now were in full blast with the evening part of the work The weather was mild and having the stay of Hugh s arm Fleda grew too amused to leave them It was a very pretty scene The sap boilers had planted themselves near the cellar door on the other side of the house from the kitchen door and the wood yard the casks and tubs for syrup being under cover there and there they had made a most picturesque work place Two strong crotched sticks were stuck in the ground some six or eight feet apart and a pole laid upon them to which by the help of some very rustic hooks two enormous iron kettles were slung Under them a fine fire of smallish split sticks was doing duty kept in order by a couple of huge logs which walled it in on the one side and on the other It was a dark night and the fire painted all this in strong lights and shadows threw a faint fading Aurora like light over the snow beyond the shade of its log barriers glimmered by turns upon the paling of the garden fence whenever the dark figures that were passing and repassing between gave it a chance and invested the cellar opening and the outstanding corner of the house with striking and unwonted dignity in a light that revealed nothing except to the imagination Nothing was more fancifully dignified or more quaintly travestied by that light than the figures around it busy and flitting about and shewing themselves in every novel variety of grouping and colouring There was Earl Douglass not a hair different from what he was every day in reality but with his dark skin and eyes and a hat that like its master had concluded to abjure all fashions and perhaps for the same reason he looked now like any bandit and now in a more pacific view could pass for nothing less than a Spanish shepherd at least with an iron ladle in lieu of crook There was doctor Quackenboss who had come too determined as Earl said to keep his eend up excessively bland and busy and important the fire would throw his one sidedness of feature into such aspects of gravity or sternness that Fleda could make nothing of him but a poor clergyman or a poor schoolmaster alternately Philetus who was kept handing about a bucket of sap or trudging off for wood defied all comparison he was Philetus still but when Barby came once or twice and peered into the kettle her strong features with the handkerchief she always wore about her head were lit up into a very handsome gypsy Fleda stood some time unseen in the shadow of the house to enjoy the sight and then went forward on the same principle that a sovereign princess shews herself to her army to grace and reward the labours of her servants The doctor was profuse in enquiries after her health and Earl informed her of the success of the day We ve had first rate weather he said I don t want to see no better weather for sugar makin it s as good kind o weather as you need to have It friz everythin up tight in the night and it thew in the sun this mornin as soon as the sun was anywhere the trees couldn t do no better than they have done I guess we ha n t got much this side o two hundred gallon I ain t sure about it but that s what I think and there s nigh two hundred gallon we ve fetched down I ll qualify to better than a hundred and fifty or a hundred and sixty either We should ha had more yet if mister Skillcorn hadn t managed to spill over one cask of it I reckon he wanted it for sass for his chicken Now mister Douglass said Philetus in a comical tone of deprecation It is an uncommonly fine lot of sugar trees said the doctor and they stand so on the ground as to give great felicities to the oxen Now Fleda Earl went on busy all the while with his iron ladle in dipping the boiling sap from one kettle into the other you know how this is fixed when we ve done all we ve got to do with it it must be strained out o this biler into a cask or a tub or somethin nother anythin that ll hold it and stand a day or so you may strain it through a cotton cloth or through a woollen cloth or through any kind of a cloth and let it stand to settle and then when it s biled down Barby knows about bilin down you can tell when it s comin to the sugar when the yellow blobbers rises thick to the top and puffs off and then it s time to try it in cold water it s best to be a leetle the right side o the sugar and stop afore it s done too much for the molasses will dreen off afterwards It must be clarified in the commencement put in the doctor O course it must be clarified said Earl Barby knows about clarifyin that s when you first put it on you had ought to throw in a teeny drop o milk fur to clear it milk s as good as a most anything or if you can get it calf s blood s better Eggs would be a more preferable ingredient on the present occasion I presume said the doctor Miss Ringgan s delicacy would be a would shrink from a and the albumen of eggs will answer all the same purpose Well anyhow you like to fix it said Earl eggs or calf s blood I won t quarrel with you about the eggs though I never heerd o blue ones afore cept the robin s and bluebird s and I ve heerd say the swamp black bird lays a handsome blue egg but I never happened to see the nest myself and there s the chippin sparrow but you d want to rob all the birds nests in creation to get enough of em and they ain t here in sugar time nother but anyhow any eggs ll do I s pose if you can get em or milk ll do if you ha n t nothin else and after it is turned out into the barrel you just let it stand still a spell till it begins to grain and look clean on top May I suggest an improvement said the doctor Many persons are of the opinion that if you take and stir it up well from the bottom for a length of time it will help the coagulation of the particles I believe that is the practice of mister Plumfield and others Tain t the practice of as good men as him and as good sugar bilers besides said Earl though I don t mean to say nothin agin Seth Plumfield nor agin his sugar for the both is as good as you d need to have he s a good man and he s a good farmer there ain t no better man in town than Seth Plumfield nor no better farmer nor no better sugar nother but I hope there s as good and I ve seen as handsome sugar that wa n t stirred as I d want to see or eat either It would lame a man s arms the worst kind said Philetus Fleda stood listening to the discussion and smiling when Hugh suddenly wheeling about brought her face to face with mister Olmney I have been sitting some time with missus Rossitur he said and she rewarded me with permission to come and look at you I mean not that I wanted a reward for I certainly did not Ah mister Olmney said Fleda laughing you are served right You see how dangerous it is to meddle with such equivocal things as compliments But we are worth looking at aren t we I have been standing here this half hour He did not say this time what he thought Pretty isn t it said Fleda Stand a little further back mister Olmney isn t it quite a wild looking scene in that peculiar light and with the snowy background Look at Philetus now with that bundle of sticks Hugh isn t he exactly like some of the figures in the old pictures of the martyrdoms bringing billets to feed the fire that old martyrdom of saint Lawrence whose was it Spagnoletto at missus Decatur s don t you recollect It is fine isn t it mister Olmney I am afraid said he shaking his head a little my eye wants training I have not been once in your company I believe without your shewing me something I could not see That young lady sir said doctor Quackenboss from the far side of the fire where he was busy giving it more wood that young lady sir is a pattron to her a to all young ladies A patron said mister Olmney Passively not actively the doctor means said Fleda softly Well I won t say but she s a good girl said mister Douglass in an abstracted manner busy with his iron ladle she means to be a good girl she s as clever a girl as you need to have Nobody s gravity stood this excepting Philetus in whom the principle of fun seemed not to be developed Miss Ringgan sir doctor Quackenboss went on with a most benign expression of countenance Miss Ringgan sir mister Olmney sets an example to all ladies who a have had elegant advantages She gives her patronage to the agricultural interest in society Not exclusively I hope said mister Olmney smiling and making the question with his eye of Fleda But she did not meet it You know she said rather quickly and drawing back from the fire I am of an agricultural turn perforce in uncle Rolf s absence I am going to be a farmer myself So I have heard so missus Rossitur told me but I fear pardon me you do not look fit to grapple with such a burden of care Hugh sighed and Fleda s eyes gave mister Olmney a hint to be silent I am not going to grapple with any thing sir I intend to take things easily I wish I could take an agricultural turn too said he smiling and be of some service to you O I shall have no lack of service said Fleda gayly I am not going unprovided into the business There is my cousin Seth Plumfield who has engaged himself to be my counsellor and instructor in general I could not have a better and mister Douglass is to be my right hand I occupying only the quiet and unassuming post of the will to convey the orders of the head to the hand And for the rest sir there is Philetus mister Olmney looked half laughing at mister Skillcorn who was at that moment standing with his hands on his sides eying with concentrated gravity the movements of Earl Douglass and the doctor Don t shake your head at him said Fleda I wish you had come an hour earlier mister Olmney Why I was just thinking of coming out here said Fleda her eyes flashing with hidden fun and Hugh and I were both standing in the kitchen when we heard a tremendous shout from the woodyard Don t laugh or I can t go on We all ran out towards the lantern which we saw standing there and so soon as we got near we heard Philetus singing out Ho Miss Elster I m dreadfully on t Why he called upon Barby I don t know unless from some notion of her general efficiency though to be sure he was nearer her than the sap boilers and perhaps thought her aid would come quickest And he was in a hurry for the cries came thick Miss Elster here I m dreadfully on t I don t understand No said Fleda whose amusement seemed to be increased by the gentleman s want of understanding and neither did we till we came up to him The silly fellow had been sent up for more wood and splitting a log he had put his hand in to keep the cleft instead of a wedge and when he took out the axe the wood pinched him and he had the fate of Milo before his eyes I suppose and could do nothing but roar You should have seen the supreme indignation with which Barby took the axe and released him with You re a smart man mister Skillcorn What was the fate of Milo said mister Olmney presently Don t you remember the famous wrestler that in his old age trying to break open a tree found himself not strong enough and the wood closing upon his hands held him fast till the wild beasts came and made an end of him The figure of our unfortunate wood cutter though was hardly so dignified as that of the old athlete in the statue doctor Quackenboss and mister Douglass you will come in and see us when this troublesome business is done It ll be a pretty spell yet said Earl but the doctor he can go in he ha n t nothin to do It don t take more n half a dozen men to keep one pot a bilin Ain t there ten on em mister Douglass said Philetus Chapter XXVIII He that has light within his own clear breast May sit i the centre and enjoy bright day Milton The farming plan succeeded beyond Fleda s hopes thanks not more to her wisdom than to the nice tact with which the wisdom was brought into play The one was eked out with Seth Plumfield s the other was all her own Seth was indefatigably kind and faithful After his own day s work was done he used to walk down to see Fleda go with her often to view the particular field or work just then in question and give her the best counsel dictated by great sagacity and great experience It was given too with equal frankness and intelligence so that Fleda knew the steps she took and could maintain them against the prejudice or the ignorance of her subordinates But Fleda s delicate handling stood her yet more in stead than her strength Earl Douglass was sometimes unmanageable and held out in favour of an old custom or a prevailing opinion in spite of all the weight of testimony and light of discovery that could be brought to bear upon him Fleda would let the thing go But seizing her opportunity another time she would ask him to try the experiment on a piece of the ground so pleasantly and skilfully that Earl could do nothing but shut his mouth and obey like an animal fairly stroked into good humour And as Fleda always forgot to remind him that she had been right and he wrong he forgot it too and presently took to the new way kindly In other matters he could be depended on and the seed time and harvest prospered well There was hope of making a good payment to doctor Gregory in the course of a few months As the spring came forward Fleda took care that her garden should both gardens indeed There she and Philetus had the game in their own hands and beautifully it was managed Hugh had full occupation at the mill Many a dollar this summer was earned by the loads of fine fruit and vegetables which Philetus carried to Montepoole and accident opened a new source of revenue When the courtyard was in the full blaze of its beauty one day an admiring passer by modestly inquired if a few of those exquisite flowers might be had for money They were given him most cheerfully that time but the demand returned accompanied by the offer and Fleda obliged herself not to decline it A trial it was to cut her roses and jessamines for anything but her own or her friends pleasure but according to custom she bore it without hesitation The place became a resort for all the flower lovers who happened to be staying at the Pool and rose leaves were changed into silver pennies as fast as in a fairy tale But the delicate mainspring that kept all this machinery in order suffered from too severe a strain There was too much running too much considering too much watchfulness In the garden pulling peas and seeing that Philetus weeded the carrots right in the field or the woodyard consulting and arranging or maybe debating with Earl Douglass who acquired by degrees an unwonted and concentrated respect for womankind in her proper person breakfast waiting for her often before she came in in the house her old housewifery concerns her share in Barby s cares or difficulties her sweet countenancing and cheering of her aunt her dinner her work then when evening came budding her roses or tying her carnations or weeding or raking the ground between them where Philetus could do nothing or training her multiflora and sweet briar branches and then often after all walking up to the mill to give Hugh a little earlier a home smile and make his way down pleasant No wonder if the energies which owed much of their strength to love s nerving should at last give out and Fleda s evening be passed in wearied slumbers No wonder if many a day was given up to the forced quietude of a headache the more grievous to Fleda because she knew that her aunt and Hugh always found the day dark that was not lightened by her sunbeam How brightly it shone out the moment the cloud of pain was removed winning the shadow from their faces and a smile to their lips though solitude always saw her own settle into a gravity as fixed as it was soft You have been doing too much Fleda said missus Rossitur one morning when she came in from the garden I didn t know it would take me so long said Fleda drawing a long breath but I couldn t help it I had those celery plants to prick out and then I was helping Philetus to plant another patch of corn He might have done that without help I should think But it must be put in to day and he had other things to do And then you were at your flowers O well budding a few roses that s only play It was time they were done But I am tired and I am going up to see Hugh it will rest me and him too The gardening frock and gloves were exchanged for those of ordinary wear and Fleda set off slowly to go up to the saw mill She stopped a moment when she came upon the bridge to look off to the right where the waters of the little run came hurrying along through a narrow wooded chasm in the hill murmuring to her of the time when a little child s feet had paused there and a child s heart danced to its music The freshness of its song was unchanged the glad rush of its waters was as joyous as ever but the spirits were quieted that used to answer it with sweeter freshness and lighter joyousness Its faint echo of the old time laugh was blended now in Fleda s ear with a gentle wail for the rushing days and swifter fleeing delights of human life gentle faint but clear she could hear it very well Taking up her walk again with a step yet slower and a brow yet more quiet she went on till she came in sight of the little mill and presently above the noise of the brook could hear the saw going To her childish ears what a signal of pleasure that had always been and now she sighed and stopping at a little distance looked for Hugh He was there she saw him in a moment going forward to stop the machinery the piece of timber in hand having walked its utmost length up to the saw she saw him throwing aside the new cut board and adjusting what was left till it was ready for another march up to headquarters When it stopped the second time Fleda went forward Hugh must have been busy in his own thoughts for he did not see her until he had again adjusted the log and set the noisy works in motion She stood still Several huge timbers lay close by ready for the saw and on one of them where he had been sitting Fleda saw his Bible lying open As her eye went from it to him it struck her heart with a pang that he looked tired and that there was a something of delicacy even of fragility in the air of face and figure both He came to meet her and welcomed her with a smile that coming upon this feeling set Fleda s heart a quivering Hugh s smile was always one of very great sweetness though never unshadowed there was often something ethereal in its pure gentleness This time it seemed even sweeter than usual but though not sadder perhaps less sad Fleda could hardly command herself to reply to it She could not at the moment speak her eye glanced at his open book Yes it rests me he said answering her Rests you dear Hugh He smiled again Here is somebody else that wants resting I am afraid said he placing her gently on the log and before she had found anything to say he went off again to his machinery Fleda sat looking at him and trying to clear her bosom of its thick breathing What has brought you up here through the hot sun said he coming back after he had stopped the saw and sitting down beside her Fleda s lip moved nervously and her eye shunned meeting his Softly pushing back the wet hair from his temples she said I had one of my fits of doing nothing at home I didn t feel very bright and thought perhaps you didn t so on the principle that two negatives make an affirmative I feel bright said Hugh gently Fleda s eye came down to his which was steady and clear as the reflection of the sky in Deepwater lake and then hers fell lower Why don t you dear Fleda I believe I am a little tired Fleda said trying but in vain to command herself and look up and there are states of body when anything almost is enough to depress one And what depresses you now said he very steadily and quietly O I was feeling a little down about things in general said Fleda in a choked voice trying to throw off her load with a long breath it s because I am tired I suppose I felt so too a little while ago said Hugh But I have concluded to give all that up Fleda Fleda looked at him Her eyes were swimming full but his were clear and gentle as ever only glistening a little in sympathy with hers I thought all was going wrong with us he went on But I found it was only I that was wrong and since that I have been quite happy Fleda Fleda could not speak to him his words made her pain worse I told you this rested me said he reaching across her for his book and now I am never weary long Shall I rest you with it What have you been troubling yourself about to day She did not answer while he was turning over the leaves and he then said Do you remember this Fleda Truly God is good to Israel even to them that are of a clean heart Fleda bent her head down upon her hands I was moody and restless the other day said Hugh desponding of everything and I came upon this psalm and it made me ashamed of myself I had been disbelieving it and because I could not see how things were going to work good I thought they were going to work evil I thought we were wearing out our lives alone here in a wearisome way and I forgot that it must be the very straightest way that we could get home I am sure we shall not want anything that will do us good and the rest I am willing to want and so are you Fleda Fleda squeezed his hand that was all For a minute he was silent and then went on without any change of tone I had a notion awhile ago that I should like it if it were possible for me to go to college but I am quite satisfied now I have good time and opportunity to furnish myself with a better kind of knowledge that I shall want where college learning wouldn t be of much use to me and I can do it I dare say better here in this mill than if we had stayed in New York and I had lived in our favourite library But dear Hugh said Fleda who did not like this speech in any sense of it the two things do not clash The better man the better Christian always other things being equal The more precious kind of knowledge should not make one undervalue the less No he said but the extreme quietness and simplicity of his reply smote Fleda s fears it answered her words and waived her thought she dared not press him further She sat looking over the road with an aching heart You haven t taken enough of my medicine said Hugh smiling Listen Fleda All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies But that made Fleda cry again All his paths Fleda then whatever may happen to you and whatever may happen to me or to any of us I can trust him I am willing any one should have the world if I may have what Abraham had Fear not I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and I believe I shall Fleda for it is not the hungry that he has threatened to send empty away Fleda could say nothing and Hugh just then said no more For a little while near and busy as thoughts might be tongues were silent Fleda was crying quietly the utmost she could do being to keep it quiet Hugh more quietly was considering again the strong pillars on which he had laid his hope and trying their strength and beauty till all other things were to him as the mist rolling off from the valley is to the man planted on a watch tower His meditations were interrupted by the tramp of horse and a party of riders male and female came past them up the hill Hugh looked on as they went by Fleda s head was not raised There are some people enjoying themselves said Hugh After all dear Fleda we should be very sorry to change places with those gay riders I would not for a thousand worlds give my hope and treasure for all other they can possibly have in possession or prospect No indeed said Fleda energetically and trying to rouse herself and besides that Hugh we have as it is a great deal more to enjoy than most other people We are so happy In each other she was going to say but the words choked her Those people looked very hard at us or at one of us said Hugh It must have been you I think Fleda They are welcome said Fleda they couldn t have made much out of the back of my sun bonnet Well dear Fleda I must content myself with little more than looking at you now for mister Winegar is in a hurry for his timber to be sawn and I must set this noisy concern a going again Fleda sat and watched him with rising and falling hopes and fears forcing her lips to a smile when he came near her and hiding her tears at other times till the shadows stretching well to the east of the meridian admonished her she had been there long enough and she left him still going backward and forward tending the saw As she went down the hill she pressed involuntarily her hands upon her heart for the dull heavy pain there But that was no plaster for it and when she got to the bridge the soft singing of the little brook was just enough to shake her spirits from the doubtful poise they had kept Giving one hasty glance along the road and up the hill to make sure that no one was near she sat down on a stone in the edge of the woods and indulged in such weeping as her gentle eyes rarely knew for the habit of patience so cultivated for others sake constantly rewarded her own life with its sweet fruits But deep and bitter in proportion was the flow of the fountain once broken up She struggled to remind herself that Providence runneth not on broken wheels she struggled to repeat to herself what she did not doubt that all the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth to his people in vain The slight check for a moment to the torrent of grief but gave it greater head to sweep over the barrier and the self reproach that blamed its violence and needlessness only made the flood more bitter Nature fought against patience for awhile but when the loaded heart had partly relieved itself patience came in again and she rose up to go home It startled her exceedingly to find mister Olmney standing before her and looking so sorrowful that Fleda s eyes could not bear it My dear Miss Ringgan forgive me I hope you will forgive me but I could not leave you in such distress I knew that in you it could only be from some very serious cause of grief I cannot say it is from anything new mister Olmney except to my apprehensions You are all well he said inquiringly after they had walked a few steps in silence Well yes sir said Fleda hesitatingly but I do not think that Hugh looks very well The trembling of her voice told him her thought But he remained silent You have noticed it she said hastily looking up I think you have told me he always was delicate And you have noticed him looking so lately mister Olmney I have thought so but you say he always was that If you will permit me to say so I have thought the same of you Miss Fleda Fleda was silent her heart ached again We would gladly save each other from every threatening trouble said mister Olmney again after a pause but it ought to content us that we do not know how Hugh is in good hands my dear Miss Ringgan I know it sir said Fleda unable quite to keep back her tears and I know very well this thread of our life will not bear the strain always and I know that the strands must in all probability part unevenly and I know it is in the power of no blind fate but that Does not lessen our clinging to each other Oh no it grows but the tenderer and the stronger for the knowledge Fleda could but cry And yet said he very kindly we who are Christians may and ought to learn to take troubles hopefully for tribulation worketh patience and patience that is quiet waiting on God works experience of his goodness and faithfulness and experience worketh hope and that hope we know maketh not ashamed I know it said Fleda but mister Olmney how easily the brunt of a new affliction breaks down all that chain of reasoning Yes he said sadly and thoughtfully but my dear Miss Fleda you know the way to build it up again I would be very glad to bear all need for it away from you They had reached the gate Fleda could not look up to thank him the hand she held out was grasped more than kindly and he turned away Fleda s tears came hot again as she went up the walk she held her head down to hide them and went round the back way Chapter XXIX Now the melancholy god protect thee and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta for thy mind is a very opal Twelfth Night Well what did you come home for was Barby s salutation here s company been waiting for you till they re tired and I am sure I be Company said Fleda Yes and it s ungrateful in you to say so said Barby for she s been in a wonderful hurry to see you or to get somethin to eat I don t know which a little o both I hope in charity Why didn t you give her something to eat Who is it I don t know who it is It s one of your highfliers that s all I can make out She a n t a hat a bit better than a man s beaver one ud think she had stole her little brother s for a spree if the rest of her was like common folks but she s got a tail to her dress as long as from here to Queechy Run and she s been tiddling in and out here with it puckered up under her arm sixty times I guess she belongs to some company of female militie for the body of it is all thick with braid and buttons I believe she ha n t sot still five minutes since she come into the house till I don t know whether I am on my head or my heels But why didn t you give her something to eat said Fleda who was hastily throwing off her gloves and smoothing her disordered hair with her hands into something of composure Did said Barby I give her some o them cold biscuit and butter and cheese and a pitcher of milk sot a good enough meal for anybody but she didn t take but a crumb and she turned up her nose at that Come go you ve slicked up enough you re handsome enough to shew yourself to her any time o day for all her jig em bobs Where is aunt Lucy She s up stairs there s been nobody to see to her but me She s had the hull lower part of the house to herself kitchen and all and she s done nothing but go out of one room into another ever since she come She ll be in here again directly if you ain t spry Fleda went in round to the west room and there found herself in the arms of the second Miss Evelyn who jumped to meet her and half stifled her with caresses You wicked little creature what have you been doing Here have I been growing melancholy over the tokens of your absence and watching the decline of the sun with distracted feelings these six hours Six hours said Fleda smiling My dear little Fleda it s so delicious to see you again said Miss Evelyn with another prolonged hug and kiss My dear Constance I am very glad But where are the rest It s unkind of you to ask after anybody but me when I came here this morning on purpose to talk the whole day to you Now dear little Fleda said Miss Constance executing an impatient little persuasive caper round her won t you go out and order dinner for I m raging Your woman did give me something but I found the want of you had taken away all my appetite and now the delight of seeing you has exhausted me and I feel that nature is sinking The stimulus of gratified affection is too much for me You absurd child said Fleda you haven t mended a bit But I told Barby to put on the tea kettle and I will administer a composing draught as soon as it can be got ready we don t indulge in dinners here in the wilderness Meanwhile suppose that exhausted nature try the support of this easy chair She put her visitor gently into it and seating herself upon the arm held her hand and looked at her with a smiling face and yet with eyes that were almost too gentle in their welcoming My dear little Fleda you re as lovely as you can be Are you glad to see me Very Why don t you ask after somebody else I was afraid of overtasking your exhausted energies Come and sit down here upon my lap you shall or I won t say another word to you Fleda you ve grown thin what have you been doing to yourself Nothing with that particular purpose I don t care you ve done something You have been insanely imagining that it is necessary for you to be in three or four places at the same time and in the distracted effort after ubiquity you are in imminent danger of being nowhere there s nothing left of you I don t wonder you were overcome at the sight of me said Fleda But you are looking charmingly for all that Constance went on so charmingly that I feel a morbid sensation creeping all over me while I sit regarding you Really when you come to us next winter if you persist in being by way of shewing your superiority to ordinary human nature a rose without a thorn the rest of the flowers may all shut up at once And the rose reddens in my very face to spite me Is ordinary human nature typified by a thorn You give it rather a poor character I never heard of a Thorn that didn t bear an excellent character said Constance gravely Hush said Fleda laughing I don t want to hear about mister Thorn Tell me of somebody else I haven t said a word about mister Thorn said Constance ecstatically but since you ask about him I will tell you He has not acted like himself since you disappeared from our horizon that is he has ceased to be at all pointed in his attentions to me his conversation has lost all the acuteness for which I remember you admired it he has walked Broadway in a moody state of mind all winter and grown as dull as is consistent with the essential sharpness of his nature I ought to except our last interview though for his entreaties to mamma that she would bring you home with her were piercing Fleda was unable in spite of herself to keep from laughing but entreated that Constance would tell her of somebody else My respected parents are at Montepoole with all their offspring that is Florence and Edith I am at present anxiously enquired after being nobody knows where and to be fetched by mamma this evening Wasn t I good little Fleda to run away from mister Carleton to come and spend a whole day in social converse with you Carleton said Fleda Yes O you don t know who he is he s a new attraction there s been nothing like him this great while and all New York is topsy turvy about him the mothers are dying with anxiety and the daughters with admiration and it s too delightful to see the cool superiority with which he takes it all like a new star that all the people are pointing their telescopes at as Thorn said spitefully the other day O he has turned my head I have looked till I cannot look at anything else I can just manage to see a rose but my dazzled powers of vision are equal to nothing more My dear Constance It s perfectly true Why as soon as we knew he was coming to Montepoole I wouldn t let mamma rest till we all made a rush after him and when we got here first and I was afraid he wasn t coming nothing can express the state of my feelings But he appeared the next morning and then I was quite happy said Constance rising and falling in her chair on what must have been ecstatic springs for wire ones it had none Constance said Fleda with a miserable attempt at rebuke how can you talk so And so we were all riding round here this morning and I had the self denial to stop to see you and leave Florence and the Marlboroughs to monopolize him all the way home You ought to love me for ever for it My dear Fleda said Constance clasping her hands and elevating her eyes in mock ecstasy if you had ever seen mister Carleton I I dare say I have seen somebody as good said Fleda quietly My dear Fleda said Constance a little scornfully this time you haven t the least idea what you are talking about I tell you he is an Englishman he s of one of the best families in England not such as you ever see here but once in an age he s rich enough to count mister Thorn over I don t know how many times I don t like anybody the better for being an Englishman said Fleda and it must be a small man whose purse will hold his measure Constance made an impatient gesture But I tell you it isn t We knew him when we were abroad and we know what he is and we know his mother very well When we were in England we were a week with them down at their beautiful place in shire the loveliest time You see she was over here with mister Carleton once before a good while ago and mamma and papa were polite to them and so they shewed us a great deal of attention when we were in England We had the loveliest time down there you can possibly conceive And my dear Fleda he wears such a fur cloak lined with the most exquisite black fox But Constance said Fleda a little vexed though laughing any man may wear a fur cloak the thing is what is inside of it It is perfectly indifferent to me what is inside of it said Constance ecstatically I can see nothing but the edges of the black fox especially when it is worn so very gracefully But in some cases there might be a white fox within There is nothing of the fox about mister Carleton said Constance impatiently If it had been anybody else I should have said he was a bear two or three times but he wears everything as he does his cloak and makes you take what he pleases from him what I wouldn t take from anybody else I know With a fox lining said Fleda laughing Then foxes haven t got their true character that s all Now I ll just tell you an instance it was at a party somewhere it was at that tiresome missus Swinburne s where the evenings are always so stupid and there was nothing worth going or staying for but the supper except mister Carleton and he never stays five minutes except at two or three places and it drives me crazy because they are places I don t go to very often Suppose you keep your wits and tell me your story Well don t interrupt me he was there and he had taken me into the supper room when mamma came along and took it into her head to tell me not to take something I forget what punch I believe because I had not been well in the morning Now you know it was absurd I was perfectly well then and I told her I shouldn t mind her but do you believe mister Carleton wouldn t give it to me absolutely told me he wouldn t and told me why as coolly as possible and gave me a glass of water and made me drink it and if it had been anybody else I do assure you I would have flung it in his face and never spoken to him again and I have been in love with him ever since Now is that tea going to be ready Presently How long have you been here O a day or two and it has poured with rain every single day since we came till this one and just think said Constance with a ludicrously scared face I must make haste and be back again You see I came away on principle that I may strike with the effect of novelty when I appear again but if I stay too long you know there is a point On the principle of the ice boats said Fleda that back a little to give a better blow to the ice where they find it tough Tough said Constance Does Florence like this paragon of yours as well as you do I don t know she don t talk so much about him but that proves nothing she s too happy to talk to him I expect our family concord will be shattered by and by said Constance shaking her head You seem to take the prospect philosophically said Fleda looking amused How long are you going to stay at the Pool Constance gave an expressive shrug intimating that the deciding of that question did not rest with her That is to say you are here to watch the transit of this star over the meridian of Queechy Of Queechy of Montepoole Very well of Montepoole I don t wonder that nature is exhausted I will go and see after this refection The prettiest little meal in the world was presently set forth for the two Fleda knew her aunt would not come down and Hugh was yet at the mill so she led her visitor into the breakfast room alone Constance by the way again fondly embracing her and repeating My dear little Fleda how glad I am to see you The lady was apparently hungry for there was a minute of silence while the refection begun and then Constance exclaimed perhaps with a sudden appreciation of the delicious bread and butter and cream and strawberries What a lovely old room this is and what lovely times you have here don t you Fleda Yes sometimes Fleda said with a sigh But I shall tell mamma you are growing thin and the first minute we get home I shall send for you to come to us missus Thorn will be amazingly glad to see you Has she got back from Europe said Fleda Ages and she s been entertaining the world as hard as she could ever since I have no doubt Lewis has confided to the maternal bosom all his distresses and there never was anything like the rush that I expect will be made to our greenhouse next winter O Fleda you should see mister Carleton s greenhouses Should I said Fleda Dear me I hope mamma will come said Constance with a comical fidgety shake of herself when I think of those greenhouses I lose my self command And the park Fleda it s the loveliest thing you ever saw in your life and it s all that delightful man s doing only he won t have a geometric flower garden as I did everything I could think of to persuade him I pity the woman that will be his wife she won t have her own way in a single thing but then he will fascinate her into thinking that his way is the best so it will do just as well I suppose Do you know I can t conceive what he has come over here for He has been here before you know and he don t seem to me to know exactly what he means to do at least I can t find out and I have tried How long has he been here O a month or two since the beginning of April I believe He came over with some friends of his a Sir George Egerton and his family he is going to Canada to be established in some post there I forget what and they are spending part of the summer here before they fix themselves at the North It is easy to see what they are here for they are strangers and amusing themselves but mister Carleton is at home and not amusing himself at least he don t seem to be He goes about with the Egertons but that is just for his friendship for them and he puzzles me He don t snow whether he is going to Niagara he has been once already and perhaps he may go to Canada and possibly he will make a journey to the West and I can t find out that he wants anything in particular Perhaps he don t mean that you shall said Fleda Perhaps he don t but you see that aggravates my state of mind to a distressing degree And then I m afraid he will go somewhere where I can t keep watch of him Fleda could not help laughing Perhaps he was tired of home and came for mere weariness Weariness it s my opinion he has no idea there is such a word in the language I am certain if he heard it he would call for a dictionary the next minute Why at Carleton it seems to me he was half the time on horseback flying about from one end of the country to the other and when he is in the house he is always at work at something it s a piece of condescension to get him to attend to you at all only when he does my dear Fleda he is so enchanting that you live in a state of delight till next time And yet I never could get him to pay me a compliment to this minute I tried two or three times and he rewarded me with some very rude speeches Rude said Fleda Yes that is they were the most graceful and fascinating things possible but they would have been rudeness in anybody else Where is mamma said Constance with another comic counterfeit of distress My dear Fleda it s the most captivating thing to breakfast at Carleton I have no idea the bread and butter is sweeter there than in some other parts of the world said Fleda I don t know about the bread and butter said Constance but those exquisite little sugar dishes My dear Fleda every one has his own sugar dish and cream ewer the loveliest little things I have heard of such things before said Fleda I don t care about the bread and butter said Constance eating is immaterial with those perfect little things right opposite to me They weren t like any you ever saw Fleda the sugar bowl was just a little plain oval box with the lid on a hinge and not a bit of chasing only the arms on the cover like nothing I ever saw but an old fashioned silver tea caddy and the cream jug a little straight up and down thing to match Mamma said they were clumsy but they bewitched me I think everything bewitched you said Fleda smiling Can t your head stand a sugar dish and milk cup My dear Fleda I never had your superiority to the ordinary weaknesses of human nature I can stand one sugar bowl but I confess myself overcome by a dozen How we have all wanted to see you Fleda and papa you have captivated papa and he says Never mind don t tell me what he says said Fleda There that s your modesty that everybody raves about I wish I could catch it Fleda where did you get that little Bible while I was waiting for you I tried to soothe my restless anticipations with examining all the things in all the rooms where did you get it It was given me a long while ago said Fleda But it is real gold on the outside the clasps and all do you know it it is not washed I know it said Fleda smiling and it is better than gold inside Wasn t that mamma s favourite mister Olmney that parted from you at the gate said Constance after a minute s silence Yes Is he a favourite of yours too You must define what you mean by a favourite said Fleda gravely Well how do you like him I believe everybody likes him said Fleda colouring and vexed at herself that she could not help it The bright eyes opposite her took note of the fact with a sufficiently wide awake glance He s very good said Constance hugging herself and taking a fresh supply of butter but don t let him know I have been to see you or he ll tell you all sorts of evil things about me for fear you should innocently be contaminated Don t you like to be taken care of Very much said Fleda smiling by people that know how I can t bear it said Constance apparently with great sincerity I think it is the most impertinent thing in the world people can do I can t endure it except from Oh my dear Fleda it is perfect luxury to have him put a shawl round your shoulders Fleda said Earl Douglass putting his head in from the kitchen and before he said any more bobbing it frankly at Miss Evelyn half in acknowledgment of her presence and half as it seemed in apology for his own Fleda will you let Barby pack up somethin nother for the men s lunch my wife would ha done it as she had ought to if she wa n t down with the teeth ache and Catherine s away on a jig to Kenton and the men won t do so much work on nothin and I can t say nothin to em if they don t and I d like to get that ere clover field down afore night it s goin to be a fine spell o weather I was a goin to try to get along without it but I believe we can t Very well said Fleda But mister Douglass you ll try the experiment of curing it in cocks Well I don t know said Earl in a tone of very discontented acquiescence I don t see how anythin should be as sweet as the sun for dryin hay I know folks says it is and I ve heerd em say it is and they ll stand to it and you can t beat em off the notion it is but somehow or nother I can t seem to come into it I know the sun makes sweet hay and I think the sun was meant to make hay and I don t want to see no sweeter hay than the sun makes it s as good hay as you need to have But you wouldn t mind trying it for once mister Douglass just for me I ll do just what you please said he with a little exculpatory shake of his head tain t my concern it s no concern of mine the gain or the loss ll be your n and it s fair you should have the gain or the loss which ever on em you choose to have I ll put it in cocks how much heft should be in em About a hundred pounds and you don t want to cut any more than you can put up to night mister Douglass We ll try it Very good And you ll send along somethin for the men Barby knows said Earl bobbing his head again intelligently at Fleda there s four on em and it takes somethin to feed em workin men ll put away a good deal o meat He withdrew his head and closed the door happily for Constance who went off into a succession of ecstatic convulsions What time of day do your eccentric hay makers prefer for the rest of their meals if they lunch at three o clock I never heard anything so original in my life This is lunch number two said Fleda smiling lunch number one is about ten in the morning and dinner at twelve And do they gladden their families with their presence at the other ordinary convivial occasions Certainly And what do they have for lunch Varieties Bread and cheese and pies and Quirlcakes at every other meal they have meat Horrid creatures It is only during haying and harvesting And you have to see to all this poor little Fleda I declare if I was you I d do something No said Fleda quietly missus Douglass and Barby manage the lunch between them I am not at all desperate But to have to talk to these people Earl Douglass is not a very polished specimen said Fleda smiling but I assure you in some of these people there is an amount of goodness and wit and shrewd practical sense and judgment that would utterly distance many of those that would call them bears Constance looked a good deal more than she said My dear little Fleda you re too sensible for anything but as I don t like sense from anybody but mister Carleton I would rather look at you in the capacity of a rose smiling a gentle rebuke upon me while I talk nonsense And she did talk and Fleda did smile and laugh in spite of herself till missus Evelyn and her other daughters made their appearance Then Barby said she thought they d have talked the house down and she expected there d be nothing left of Fleda after all the kissing she got But it was not too much for Fleda s pleasure missus Evelyn was so tenderly kind and Miss Evelyn as caressing as her sister had been and Edith who was but a child so joyously delighted that Fleda s eyes were swimming in happiness as she looked from one to the other and she could hardly answer kisses and questions fast enough Them is good looking enough girls said Barby as Fleda came back to the house after seeing them to their carriage if they knowed how to dress themselves I never see this fly away one afore I knowed the old one as soon as I clapped my eyes onto her Be they stopping at the Pool again Yes Well when are you going up there to see em I don t know said Fleda quietly And then sighing as the thought of her aunt came into her head she went off to find her and bring her down Fleda s brow was sobered and her spirits were in a flutter that was not all of happiness and that threatened not to settle down quietly But as she went slowly up the stairs faith s hand was laid even as her own grasped the balusters on the promise All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies She set faith s foot down on those sure stepping stones and she opened her aunt s door and looked in with a face that was neither troubled nor afraid

7495_102612_000038_000001	train-clean-360	does he leave it all to his cousin 
7495_102612_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 He s to the mill 
none	none	And Miss Ringgan manages farm and garden and all said missus Evelyn
7495_102612_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 She doos said Philetus 
7495_102612_000042_000000	train-clean-360	And receiving a gratuity which he accepted without demonstration of any kind whatever the basket bearer at length released moved off 
none	none	Poor Fleda said Miss Evelyn as he disappeared with his load
7495_102612_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 She s a very clever girl said missus Evelyn dismissing the subject 
7495_102612_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 She s too lovely for anything said Constance 
7495_102612_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 mister Carleton if you will just imagine we are in China and introduct a pair of familiar chop sticks into this basket I shall be repaid for the loss of a strawberry by the expression of ecstasy which will immediately spread itself over your features 
none	none	I intend to patronize the natural mode of eating in future I find the ends of my fingers decidedly odoriferous 
7495_102612_000046_000000	train-clean-360	He smiled a little as he complied with the young lady s invitation but the expression of ecstasy did not come 
7495_102612_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Are mister Rossitur s circumstances so much reduced he said drawing nearer to missus Evelyn 
none	none	Do you know them exclaimed both the daughters at once I knew missus Rossitur very well some years ago when she was in Paris
7495_102612_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 They are all broken to pieces said missus Evelyn as mister Carleton s eye went back to her for his answer mister 
7495_102612_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Rossitur failed and lost everything bankrupt a year or two after they came home 
none	none	And what has he been doing since I don t know trying to farm it here but I am afraid he has not succeeded well I am afraid not 
7495_102612_000052_000001	train-clean-360	They don t look like it 
none	none	missus Rossitur will not see anybody and I don t believe they have done any more than struggle for a living since they came here Where is mister Rossitur now He is at the West somewhere Fleda tells me he is engaged in some agencies there but I doubt said missus Evelyn shaking her head compassionately there is more in the name of it than anything else 
7495_102612_000054_000001	train-clean-360	He has gone down hill sadly since his misfortunes 
7495_102612_000054_000002	train-clean-360	I am very sorry for them 
7495_102612_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 And his niece takes care of his farm in the meantime 
7495_102612_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you know her asked both the Miss Evelyns again 
7495_102612_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 I can hardly say that he replied 
7495_102612_000057_000001	train-clean-360	 I had such a pleasure formerly 
none	none	Do I understand that she is the person to fill mister Rossitur s place when he is away
7495_102612_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 So she says 
7495_102612_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 And so she acts said Constance 
7495_102612_000059_000001	train-clean-360	 I wish you had heard her yesterday 
7495_102612_000059_000002	train-clean-360	It was beyond everything 
none	none	We were conversing very amicably regarding each other through a friendly vista formed by the sugar bowl and tea pot when a horrid man that looked as if he had slept all his life in a hay cock and only waked up to turn it over stuck his head in and immediately introduced a clover field and Fleda and he went to tumbling about the cocks till I do assure you I was deluded into a momentary belief that hay making was the principal end of human nature and looked upon myself as a burden to society and after I had recovered my locality and ventured upon a sentence of gentle commiseration for her sufferings Fleda went off into a eulogium upon the intelligence of hay makers in general and the strength of mind barbarians are universally known to possess 
7495_102612_000060_000000	train-clean-360	The manner still more than the matter of this speech was beyond the withstanding of any good natured muscles though the gentleman s smile was a grave one and quickly lost in gravity 
none	none	missus Evelyn laughed and reproved in a breath but the laugh was admiring and the reproof was stimulative The bright eye of Constance danced in return with the mischievous delight of a horse that has slipped his bridle and knows you can t catch him
7495_102612_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 And this has been her life ever since mister Rossitur lost his property 
7495_102612_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Entirely sacrificed said missus Evelyn with a compassionately resigned air education advantages and everything given up and set down here where she has seen nobody from year s end to year s end but the country people about very good people but not the kind of people she ought to have been brought up among 
7495_102612_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh mamma said the eldest Miss Evelyn in a deprecatory tone you shouldn t talk so it isn t right I am sure she is very nice nicer now than anybody else I know and clever too 
7495_102612_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Nice said Edith 
none	none	I wish I had such a sister She is a good girl a very good girl said missus Evelyn in a tone which would have deterred any one from wishing to make her acquaintance
7495_102612_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 And happy mamma Fleda don t look miserable she seems perfectly happy and contented 
none	none	Yes said missus Evelyn she has got accustomed to this state of things it s her life she makes delicious bread and puddings for her aunt and raises vegetables for market and oversees her uncle s farmers and it isn t a hardship to her she finds her happiness in it 
7495_102612_000067_000001	train-clean-360	She is a very good girl but she might have been made something much better than a farmer s wife 
7495_102612_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 You may set your mind at rest on that subject mamma said Constance still using her chop sticks with great complacency it s my opinion that the farmer is not in existence who is blessed with such a conjugal futurity 
7495_102612_000068_000001	train-clean-360	I think Fleda s strong pastoral tastes are likely to develope themselves in a new direction 
none	none	missus Evelyn looked with a partial smile at the pretty features which the business of eating the strawberries displayed in sundry novel and picturesque points of view and asked what she meant
7495_102612_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know said Constance intent upon her basket I feel a friend s distress for mister Thorn it s all your doing mamma you won t be able to look him in the face when we have Fleda next fall I am sure I shall not want to look at his 
7495_102612_000070_000001	train-clean-360	He ll be too savage for anything 
none	none	mister 
7495_102612_000071_000001	train-clean-360	Thorn said mister Carleton 
7495_102612_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said missus Evelyn in an indulgent tone he was very attentive to her last winter when she was with us but she went away before anything was decided 
7495_102612_000072_000001	train-clean-360	I don t think he has forgotten her 
7495_102612_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 I shouldn t think anybody could forget her said Edith 
7495_102612_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 I am confident he would be here at this moment said Constance if he wasn t in London 
7495_102612_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 But what is all mamma s doing Constance inquired her sister 
7495_102612_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 The destruction of the peace of the whole family of Thorns shouldn t sleep sound in my bed if I were she with such a reflection 
7495_102612_000076_000001	train-clean-360	I look forward to heart rending scenes with a very disturbed state of mind 
7495_102612_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 But what have I done my child said missus Evelyn 
7495_102612_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Didn t you introduce your favourite mister Olmney to Miss Ringgan last summer 
none	none	I don t know her native delicacy shrunk from making any disclosures and of course the tongue of friendship is silent but they were out ages yesterday while I was waiting for her and their parting at the gate was I feel myself unequal to the task of describing it said Constance ecstatically and she was in the most elevated tone of mind during our whole interview afterwards and took all my brilliant remarks with as much coolness as if they had been drops of rain more I presume considering that it was hay time
7495_102612_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you see him said missus Evelyn 
7495_102612_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Only at that impracticable distance mamma but I introduced his name afterwards in my usual happy manner and I found that Miss Ringgan s cheeks were by no means indifferent to it 
7495_102612_000080_000001	train-clean-360	I didn t dare go any further 
7495_102612_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 I am very glad of it 
none	none	I hope it is so said missus Evelyn energetically It would be a most excellent match 
7495_102612_000081_000002	train-clean-360	He is a charming young man and would make her very happy 
none	none	You are exciting gloomy feelings in mister Carleton s mind mamma by your felicitous suggestions 
7495_102612_000082_000001	train-clean-360	mister Carleton did your ears receive a faint announcement of ham and eggs which went quite through and through mine just now 
7495_102612_000083_000000	train-clean-360	He bowed and handed the young lady in but Constance declared that though he sat beside her and took care of her at breakfast he had on one of his intangible fits which drove her to the last extreme of impatience and captivation 
7495_102612_000084_000000	train-clean-360	The sun was not much more than two hours high the next morning when a rider was slowly approaching mister Rossitur s house from the bridge walking his horse like a man who wished to look well at all he was passing 
7495_102612_000084_000001	train-clean-360	He paused behind a clump of locusts and rose acacias in the corner of the courtyard as a figure bonneted and gloved came out of the house and began to be busy among the rose bushes 
7495_102612_000084_000002	train-clean-360	Another figure presently appeared at the hall door and called out 
none	none	Fleda Well Barby 
7495_102612_000087_000000	train-clean-360	This second voice was hardly raised but it came from so much nearer that the words could be distinctly heard 
7495_102612_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Skillcorn wants to know if you re going to fix the flowers for him to carry 
none	none	They re not ready and it won t do for him to vait mister 
7495_102612_000089_000001	train-clean-360	Sweet must send for them if he wants them 
7495_102612_000089_000002	train-clean-360	Philetus must make haste back for you know mister Douglass wants him to help in the barn meadow 
7495_102612_000089_000003	train-clean-360	Lucas won t be here and now the weather is so fine I want to make haste with the hay 
7495_102612_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 Well will you have the samp for breakfast 
7495_102612_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 No we ll keep that for dinner 
none	none	I ll come in and poach some eggs Barby if you ll make me some thin pieces of toast and call me when it s time 
7495_102612_000091_000002	train-clean-360	Thin Barby 
7495_102612_000092_000000	train-clean-360	The gentleman turned his horse and galloped back to Montepoole 
none	none	Some disappointment was created among a portion of mister Sweet s guests that afternoon by the intelligence that mister Carleton purposed setting off the next morning to join his English friends at Saratoga on their way to the falls and Canada Which purpose was duly carried into effect Chapter XXXI With your leave sir an there were no more men living upon the face of the earth I should not fancy him by saint George Every Man Out of His Humour October had come and a fair season and a fine harvest had enabled Fleda to ease her mind by sending a good remittance to doctor Gregory The family were still living upon her and Hugh s energies mister Rossitur talked of coming home that was all It sometimes happened that a pause in the urgency of business permitted Hugh to take a day s holiday One of these falling soon after the frosts had opened the burrs of the chestnut trees and the shells of the hickories Fleda seized upon it for a nutting frolic They took Philetus and went up to the fine group of trees on the mountain the most difficult to reach and the best worth reaching of all their nut wood The sport was very fine and after spoiling the trees Philetus was left to shuck and bring home a load of the fruit while Fleda and Hugh took their way slowly down the mountain She stopped him as usual on the old lookout place The leaves were just then in their richest colouring and the October sky in its strong vitality seemed to fill all inanimate nature with the breath of lile If ever then on that day to the fancy the little hills rejoiced on every side The woods stood thick with honours and earth lay smiling under the tokens of the summer s harvest and the promise for the coming year and the wind came in gusts over the lower country and up the hill side with a hearty good will that blew away all vapours physical and mental from its path bidding everything follow its example and be up and doing Fleda drew a long breath or two that seemed to recognize its freshening power Illustration Philetus was left to shuck and bring home a load of the fruit How long it seems she said how very long since I was here with mister Carleton just nine years ago How changed everything is I was a little child then It seems such an age ago It is very odd he didn t come to see us said Hugh He did don t you know the very next day after we heard he was here when most unluckily I was up at aunt Miriam s I should think he might have come again considering what friends you used to be I dare say he would if he had not left Montepoole so soon But dear Hugh I was a mere child how could he remember me much You remember him said Hugh Ah but I have good reason Besides I never forget anything I would have given a great deal to see him if I had it I wish the Evelyns had staid longer said Hugh I think you have wanted something to brighten you up They did you a great deal of good last year I am afraid all this taking care of Philetus and Earl Douglass is too much for you Fleda gave him a very bright smile half affection half fun Don t you admire my management said she Because I do Philetus is firmly persuaded that he is an invaluable assistant to me in the mystery of gardening and the origin of Earl Douglass s new ideas is so enveloped in mist that he does not himself know where they come from It was rich to hear him the other day descanting to Lucas upon the evil effects of earthing up corn and the advantages of curing hay in cocks as to both which matters Lucas is a thorough unbeliever and Earl was a year ago But that doesn t hinder your looking pale and thin and a great deal soberer than I like to see you said Hugh You want a change I know I don t know how you are to get it I wish they would send for you to New York again I don t know that I should want to go if they did said Fleda They don t raise my spirits Hugh I am amused sometimes I can t help that but such excessive gayety rather makes me shrink within myself I am too out of tone with it I never feel more absolutely quiet than sometimes when I am laughing at Constance Evelyn s mad sallies and sometimes I cannot laugh at them I do not know what they must think of me it is what they can have no means of understanding I wish you didn t understand it either Fleda But you shouldn t say that I am happier than they are now Hugh now that you are better with all their means of happiness They know nothing of our quiet enjoyments they must live in a whirl or they would think they are not living at all and I do not believe that all New York can give them the real pleasure that I have in such a day as this They would see almost nothing in all this beauty that my eyes drink in as Cowper says and they would be certain to quarrel with the wind that to me is like the shake of an old friend s hand Delicious said Fleda at the wind rewarded this eulogium with a very hearty shake indeed I believe you would make friends with everything Fleda said Hugh laughing The wind is always that to me said Fleda not always in such a cheerful mood as to day though It talks to me often of a thousand old time things and sighs over them with me a most sympathizing friend but to day he invites me to a waltz Come And pulling Hugh after her away she went down the rocky path with a step too light to care for the stones the little feet capering down the mountain with a disdain of the ground that made Hugh smile to see her and eyes dancing for company till they reached the lower woodland A most spirited waltz said Hugh And a most slack partner Why didn t you keep me company I never was made for waltzing said Hugh shaking his head Not to the tune of the North wind That has done me good Hugh So I should judge by your cheeks Poverty need not always make people poor said Fleda taking breath and his arm together You and I are rich Hugh And our riches cannot take to themselves wings and flyaway said Hugh No but besides those riches there are the pleasures of the eye and the mind that one may enjoy everywhere everywhere in the country at least unless poverty bear one down very hard and they are some of the purest and most satisfying of any O the blessing of a good education how it makes one independent of circumstances And circumstances are education too said Hugh smiling I dare say we should not appreciate our mountains and woods so well if we had had our old plenty of everything else I always loved them said Fleda But what good company they have been to us for years past Hugh to me especially I have more reason to love them They walked on quietly and soberly to the brow of the tableland where they parted Hugh being obliged to go home and Fleda wishing to pay a visit to her aunt Miriam She turned off alone to take the way to the high road and went softly on no longer certainly in the momentary spirits with which she had shaken hands with the wind and skipped down the mountain but feeling and thankful that she felt a cheerful patience to tread the dusty highway of life The old lady had been rather ailing and from one or two expressions she had let fall Fleda could not help thinking that she looked upon her ailments with a much more serious eye than anybody else thought was called for It did not however appear to day She was not worse and Fleda s slight anxious feeling could find nothing to justify it if it were not the very calm and quietly happy face and manner of the old lady and that if it had something to alarm did much more to sooth Fleda had sat with her a long time patience and cheerfulness all the while unconsciously growing in her company when catching up her bonnet with a sudden haste very unlike her usual collectedness of manner Fleda kissed her aunt and was rushing away But stop where are you going Fleda Home aunt Miriam I must don t keep me But what are you going that way for you can t go home that way Yes I can How I can cross the blackberry hill behind the barn and then over the east hill and then there s nothing but the water cress meadow I sha n t let you go that way alone sit down and tell me what you mean what is this desperate hurry But with equal precipitation Fleda had cast her bonnet out of sight behind the table and the next moment turned with the utmost possible quietness to shake hands with mister Olmney Aunt Miriam had presence of mind enough to make no remark and receive the young gentleman with her usual dignity and kindness He staid some time but Fleda s hurry seemed to have forsaken her She had seized upon an interminable long grey stocking her aunt was knitting and sat in the corner working at it most diligently without raising her eyes unless spoken to Do you give yourself no rest at home or abroad Miss Fleda said the gentleman Put that stocking down Fleda said her aunt it is in no hurry I like to do it aunt Miriam But she felt with warming cheeks that she did not like to do it with two people sitting still and looking at her The gentleman presently rose Don t go till we have had tea mister Olmney said missus Plumfield Thank you ma am I cannot stay I believe unless Miss Fleda will let me take care of her down the hill by and by Thank you mister Olmney said Fleda but I am not going home before night unless they send for me I am afraid said he looking at her that the agricultural turn has proved an over match for your energies The farm don t complain of me does it said Fleda looking up at him with a comic grave expression of countenance No said he laughing certainly not but if you will forgive me for saying so I think you complain of it tacitly and that will raise a good many complaints in other quarters if you do not take care of yourself He shook hands and left them and missus Plumfield sat silently looking at Fleda who on her part looked at nothing but the grey stocking What is all this Fleda What is what aunt Miriam said Fleda picking up a stitch with desperate diligence Why did you want to run away from mister Olmney I didn t wish to be delayed I wanted to get home Then why wouldn t you let him go home with you I liked better to go alone aunt Miriam Don t you like him Fleda Certainly aunt Miriam very much I think he likes you Fleda said her aunt smiling I am very sorry for it said Fleda with great gravity missus Plumfield looked at her for a few minutes in silence and then said Fleda love come over here and sit by me and tell me what you mean Why are you sorry It has given me a great deal of pleasure to think of it But Fleda did not budge from her seat or her stocking and seemed tongue tied missus Plumfield pressed for an answer Because aunt Miriam said Fleda with the prettiest red cheeks in the world but speaking very clearly and steadily my liking only goes to a point which I am afraid will not satisfy either him or you But why it will go further No ma am Why not why do you say so Because I must if you ask me But what can be more excellent and estimable Fleda who could be more worth liking I should have thought he would just please you He is one of the most lovely young men I have ever seen Dear aunt Miriam said Fleda looking up beseechingly why should we talk about it Because I want to understand you Fleda and to be sure that you understand yourself I do said Fleda quietly and with a quivering lip What is there that you dislike about mister Olmney Nothing in the world aunt Miriam Then what is the reason you cannot like him enough Because aunt Miriam said Fleda speaking in desperation there isn t enough of him He is very good and excellent in every way nobody feels that more than I do I don t want to say a word against him but I do not think he has a very strong mind and he isn t cultivated enough But you cannot have everything Fleda No ma am I don t expect it I am afraid you have set up too high a standard for yourself said missus Plumfield looking rather troubled I don t think that is possible aunt Miriam But I am afraid it will prevent your ever liking anybody It will not prevent my liking the friends I have already it may prevent my leaving them for somebody else said Fleda with a gravity that was touching in its expression But mister Olmney is sensible and well educated Yes but his tastes are not He could not at all enter into a great many things that give me the most pleasure I do not think he quite understands above half of what I say to him Are you sure I know he admires you Fleda Ah but that is only half enough you see aunt Miriam unless I could admire him too missus Plumfield looked at her in some difficulty mister Olmney was not the only one clearly whose powers of comprehension were not equal to the subject Fleda said her aunt inquiringly is there anybody else that has put mister Olmney out of your head Nobody in the world exclaimed Fleda with a frank look and tone of astonishment at the question and cheeks colouring as promptly How could you ask But he never was in my head aunt Miriam mister Thorn said missus Plumfield mister Thorn said Fleda indignantly Don t you know me better than that aunt Miriam But you do not know him I believe I know you dear Fleda but I heard he had paid you a great deal of attention last year and you would not have been the first unsuspecting nature that has been mistaken Fleda was silent flushed and disturbed and missus Plumfield was silent and meditating when Hugh came in He came to fetch Fleda home doctor Gregory had arrived In haste again Fleda sought her bonnet and exchanging a more than usually wistful and affectionate kiss and embrace with her aunt set off with Hugh down the hill Hugh had a great deal to say to her all the way home of which Fleda s ears alone took the benefit for her understanding received none of it and when she at last came into the breakfast room where the doctor was sitting the fact of his being there was the only one which had entered her mind Here she is I declare said the doctor holding her back to look at her after the first greetings had passed I ll be hanged if you ain t handsome Now what s the use of pinking your cheeks any more at that as if you didn t know it before eh I will always do my best to deserve your good opinion sir said Fleda laughing Well sit down now said he shaking his head and pour me out a cup of tea your mother can t make it right And sipping his tea for some time the old doctor sat listening to missus Rossitur and eating bread and butter saying little but casting a very frequent glance at the figure opposite him behind the tea board I am afraid said he after a while that your care for my good opinion won t outlast an occasion Is that the way you look for every day The colour came with the smile but the old doctor looked at her in a way that made the tears come too He turned his eyes to missus Rossitur for an explanation She is well said missus Rossitur fondly she has been very well except her old headaches now and then I think she has grown rather thin lately Thin said the old doctor etherealized to a mere abstract of herself only that is a very bad figure for an abstract should have all the bone and muscle of the subject and I should say you had little left but pure spirit You are the best proof I ever saw of the principle of the homoeopaths I see now that though a little corn may fatten a man a great deal may be the death of him But I have tried it both ways uncle Orrin said Fleda laughing I ought to be a happy medium between plethora and starvation I am pretty substantial what there is of me Substantial said the doctor you look as substantial a personage as your old friend the faire Una just about Well prepare yourself gentle Saxon to ride home with me the day after to morrow I ll try a little humanizing regimen with you I don t think that is possible uncle Orrin said Fleda gently We ll talk about the possibility afterwards at present all you have to do is to get ready If you raise difficulties you will find me a very Hercules to clear them away I m substantial enough I can tell you so it s just as well to spare yourself and me the trouble There are no difficulties missus Rossitur and Hugh said both at once I knew there weren t Put a pair or two of clean stockings in your trunk that s all you want missus Pritchard and I will find the rest There s the people in Fourteenth street wants you the first of November and I want you all the time till then and longer too Stop I ve got a missive of some sort here for you He foisted out of his breast pocket a little package of notes one from missus Evelyn and one from Florence begging Fleda to come to them at the time the doctor had named the third from Constance My darling little Fleda I am dying to see you so pack up and come down with doctor Gregory if the least spark of regard for me is slumbering in your breast Mamma and Florence are writing to beg you but though an insignificant member of the family considering that instead of being next to head only little Edith prevents my being at the less dignified end of this branch of the social system I could not prevail upon myself to let the representations of my respected elders go unsupported by mine especially as I felt persuaded of the superior efficacy of the motives I had it in my power to present to your truly philanthropical mind I am in a state of mind that baffles description mister Carleton is going home I have not worn earrings in my ears for a fortnight my personal appearance is become a matter of indifference to me any description of mental exertion is excruciating I sit constantly listening for the ringing of the door bell and when it sounds I rush frantically to the head of the staircase and look over to see who it is the mere sight of pen and ink excites delirious ideas judge what I suffer in writing to you To make the matter worse if it could be I have been informed privately that he is going home to crown at the altar of Hymen an old attachment to one of the loveliest of all England s daughters Conceive the complication of my feelings Nothing is left me but the resources of friendship so come darling Fleda before a barrier of ice interposes itself between my chilled heart and your sympathy mister Thorn s state would move my pity if I were capable of being moved by anything by this you will comprehend he is returned He has been informed by somebody that there is a wolf in sheep s clothing prowling about Queechy and his head is filled with the idea that you have fallen a victim of which in my calmer moments I have in vain endeavoured to dispossess him Every morning we are wakened up at an unseasonable hour by a furious ringing at the door bell Joe Manton pulls off his nightcap and slowly descending the stairs opens the door and finds mister Thorn who enquires distractedly whether Miss Ringgan has arrived and being answered in the negative gloomily walks off towards the East river The state of anxiety in which his mother is thereby kept is rapidly depriving her of all her flesh but we have directed Joe lately to reply no sir but she is expected upon which mister Thorn regularly smiles faintly and rewards the fowling piece with a quarter dollar So make haste dear Fleda or I shall feel that we are acting the part of innocent swindlers C E There was but one voice at home on the point whether Fleda should go So she went Chapter XXXII Host Now my young guest methinks you re allycholy I pray you why is it Jul Marry mine host because I cannot be merry Two Gentlemen of Verona Some nights after their arrival the doctor and Fleda were seated at tea in the little snug old fashioned back parlour where the doctor s nicest of housekeepers missus Pritchard had made it ready for them In general missus Pritchard herself poured it out for the doctor but she descended most cheerfully from her post of elevation whenever Fleda was there to fill it The doctor and Fleda sat cosily looking at each other across the toast and chipped beef their glances grazing the tea urn which was just on one side of their range of vision A comfortable Liverpool coal fire in a state of repletion burned away indolently and gave everything else in the room somewhat of its own look of sousy independence Except perhaps the delicate creature at whom the doctor between sips of his tea took rather wistful observations When are you going to missus Evelyn he said breaking the silence They say next week sir I shall be glad of it said the doctor Glad of it said Fleda smiling Do you want to get rid of me uncle Orrin Yes said he This isn t the right place for you You are too much alone No indeed sir I have been reading voraciously and enjoying myself as much as possible I would quite as lieve be here as there putting you out of the question I wouldn t as lieve have you said he shaking his head What were you musing about before tea your face gave me the heart ache My face said Fleda smiling while an instant flush of the eyes answered him what was the matter with my face That is the very thing I want to know Before tea I was only thinking said Fleda her look going back to the fire from association thinking of different things not disagreeably taking a kind of bird s eye view of things as one does sometimes I don t believe you ever take other than a bird s eye view of anything said her uncle But what were you viewing just then my little Saxon I was thinking of them at home said Fleda smiling thoughtfully and I somehow had perched myself on a point of observation and was taking one of those wider views which are always rather sobering Views of what Of life sir As how said the doctor How near the end is to the beginning and how short the space between and how little the ups and downs of it will matter if we take the right road and get home Pshaw said the doctor But Fleda knew him too well to take his interjection otherwise than most kindly And indeed though he whirled round and eat his toast at the fire discontentedly his look came back to her after a little with even more than its usual gentle appreciation What do you suppose you have come to New York for said he To see you sir in the first place and the Evelyns in the second And who in the third I am afraid the third place is vacant said Fleda smiling You are eh Well I don t know but I know that I have been inquired of by two several and distinct people as to your coming Ah you needn t open your bright eyes at me because I shall not tell you Only let me ask you have no notion of fencing off my Queechy rose with a hedge of blackthorn or anything of that kind have you I have no notion of any fences at all except invisible ones sir said Fleda laughing and colouring very prettily Well those are not American fences said the doctor so I suppose I am safe enough Whom did I see you out riding with yesterday I was with missus Evelyn said Fleda I didn t want to go but I couldn t very well help myself missus Evelyn missus Evelyn wasn t driving was she No sir mister Thorn was driving I thought so Have you seen your old friend mister Carleton yet Do you know him uncle Orrin Why shouldn t I What s the difficulty of knowing people Have you seen him But how did you know that he was an old friend of mine Question said the doctor Hum well I won t tell you so there s the answer Now will you answer me I have not seen him sir Haven t met him in all the times you have been to missus Evelyn s No sir I have been there but once in the evening uncle Orrin He is just about sailing for England Well you re going there to night aren t you Run and bundle yourself up and I ll take you there before I begin my work There was a small party that evening at missus Evelyn s Fleda was very early She ran up to the first floor rooms lighted and open but nobody there Fleda Ringgan called out the voice of Constance from over the stairs is that you Yes said Fleda Well just wait till I come down to you My darling little Fleda it s delicious of you to come so early Now just tell me am I captivating Well I retain self possession said Fleda I cannot tell about the strength of head of other people You wretched little creature Fleda don t you admire my hair it s new style my dear just come out the Delancys brought it out with them Eloise Delancy taught it us isn t it graceful Nobody in New York has it yet except the Delancys and we How do you know but they have taught somebody else said Fleda I won t talk to you Don t you like it I am not sure that I do not like you in your ordinary way better Constance made a gesture of impatience and then pulled Fleda after her into the drawing rooms Come in here I won t waste the elegancies of my toilet upon your dull perceptions come here and let me shew you some flowers aren t those lovely This bunch came to day for Miss Evelyn so Florence will have it it is hers and it s very mean of her for I am perfectly certain it is mine it s come from somebody who wasn t enlightened on the subject of my family circle and has innocently imagined that two Miss Evelyns could not belong to the same one I know the floral representatives of all Florence s dear friends and admirers and this isn t from any of them I have been distractedly endeavouring all day to find who it came from for if I don t I can t take the least comfort in it But you might enjoy the flowers for their own sake I should think said Fleda breathing the sweetness of myrtle and heliotrope No I can t for I have all the time the association of some horrid creature they might have come from you know but it will do just as well to humbug people I shall make Cornelia Schenck believe that this came from my dear mister Carleton No you won t Constance said Fleda gently My dear little Fleda I shock you don t I but I sha n t tell any lies I shall merely expressively indicate a particular specimen and say My dear Cornelia do you perceive that this is an English rose and then it s none of my business you know what she believes and she will be dying with curiosity and despair all the rest of the evening I shouldn t think there would be much pleasure in that I confess said Fleda gravely How very ungracefully and stiffly those are made up My dear little Queechy rose said Constance impatiently you are pardon me as fresh as possible They can t cut the flowers with long stems you know the gardeners would be ruined That is perfectly elegant it must have cost at least ten dollars My dear little Fleda said Constance capering off before the long pier glass I am afraid I am not captivating Do you think it would be an improvement if I put drops in my ears or one curl behind them I don t know which mister Carleton likes best And with her head first on one side and then on the other she stood before the glass looking at herself and Fleda by turns with such a comic expression of mock doubt and anxiety that no gravity but her own could stand it She is a silly girl Fleda isn t she said missus Evelyn coming up behind them Mamma am I captivating cried Constance wheeling round The mother s smile said Very Fleda is wishing she were out of the sphere of my influence mamma Wasn t mister Olmney afraid of my corrupting you she said with a sudden pull up in front of Fleda My blessed stars there s somebody s voice I know Well I believe it is true that a rose without thorns is a desideratum Mamma is missus Thorn s turban to be an invariable pendant to your coiffure all the while Miss Ringgan is here Hush With the entrance of company came Constance s return from extravaganzas to a sufficiently graceful every day manner only enough touched with high spirits and lawlessness to free it from the charge of commonplace But the contrast of these high spirits with her own rather made Fleda s mood more quiet and it needed no quieting Of the sundry people that she knew among those presently assembled there were none that she wanted to talk to the rooms were hot and she felt nervous and fluttered partly from encounters already sustained and partly from a little anxious expecting of mister Carleton s appearance The Evelyns had not said he was to be there but she had rather gathered it and the remembrance of old times was strong enough to make her very earnestly wish to see him and dread to be disappointed She swung clear of mister Thorn with some difficulty and ensconced herself under the shadow of a large cabinet between that and a young lady who was very good society for she wanted no help in carrying on the business of it All Fleda had to do was to sit still and listen or not listen which she generally preferred Miss Tomlinson discoursed upon varieties with great sociableness and satisfaction while poor Fleda s mind letting all her sense and nonsense go was again taking a somewhat bird s eye view of things and from the little centre of her post in missus Evelyn s drawing room casting curious glances over the panorama of her life England France New York and Queechy half coming to the conclusion that her place henceforth was only at the last and that the world and she had nothing to do with each other The tide of life and gayety seemed to have thrown her on one side as something that could not swim with it and to be rushing past too strongly and swiftly for her slight bark ever to launch upon it again Perhaps the shore might be the safest and happiest place but it was sober in the comparison and as a stranded bark might look upon the white sails flying by Fleda saw the gay faces and heard the light tones with which her own could so little keep company But as little they with her Their enjoyment was not more foreign to her than the causes which moved it were strange Merry she might like to be merry but she could sooner laugh with the North wind than with one of those vapid faces or with any face that she could not trust Conversation might be pleasant but it must be something different from the noisy cross fire of nonsense that was going on in one quarter or the profitless barter of nothings that was kept up on the other side of her Rather Queechy and silence by far than New York and this And through it all Miss Tomlinson talked on and was happy My dear Fleda what are you back here for said Florence coming up to her I was glad to be at a safe distance from the fire Take a screen here Miss Tomlinson your conversation is too exciting for Miss Ringgan look at her cheeks I must carry you off I want to shew you a delightful contrivance for transparencies that I learned the other day The seat beside her was vacated and not casting so much as a look towards any quarter whence a possible successor to Miss Tomlinson might be arriving Fleda sprang up and took a place in the far corner of the room by missus Thorn happily not another vacant chair in the neighbourhood missus Thorn had shewn a very great fancy for her and was almost as good company as Miss Tomlinson not quite for it was necessary sometimes to answer and therefore necessary always to hear But Fleda liked her she was thoroughly amiable sensible and good hearted And missus Thorn very much gratified at Fleda s choice of a seat talked to her with a benignity which Fleda could not help answering with grateful pleasure Little Queechy what has driven you into the corner said Constance pausing a moment before her It must have been a retiring spirit said Fleda missus Thorn isn t she lovely missus Thorn s smile at Fleda might almost have been called that it was so full of benevolent pleasure But she spoiled it by her answer I don t believe I am the first one to find it out But what are you looking so sober for Constance went on taking Fleda s screen from her hand and fanning her diligently with it you don t talk The gravity of Miss Ringgan s face casts a gloom over the brightness of the evening I couldn t conceive what made me feel chilly in the other room till I looked about and found that the shade came from this corner and mister Thorn s teeth I saw were chattering Constance said Fleda laughing and vexed and making the reproof more strongly with her eyes how can you talk so missus Thorn isn t it true missus Thorn s look at Fleda was the essence of good humour Will you let Lewis come and take you a good long ride to morrow No missus Thorn I believe not I intend to stay perseveringly at home to morrow and see if it is possible to be quiet a day in New York But you will go with me to the concert to morrow night both of you and hear Truffi come to my house and take tea and go from there will you Constance My dear missus Thorn said Constance I shall be in ecstacies and Miss Ringgan was privately imploring me last night to find some way of getting her to it We regard such material pleasures as tea and muffins with great indifference but when you look up after swallowing your last cup you will see Miss Ringgan and Miss Evelyn cloaked and hooded anxiously awaiting your next movement My dear Fleda there is a ring And giving her the benefit of a most comic and expressive arching of her eyebrows Constance flung back the screen into Fleda s lap and skimmed away Fleda was too vexed for a few minutes to understand more of missus Thorn s talk than that she was first enlarging upon the concert and afterwards detailing to her a long shopping expedition in search of something which had been a morning s annoyance She almost thought Constance was unkind because she wanted to go to the concert herself to lug her in so unceremoniously and wished herself back in her uncle s snug little quiet parlour unless mister Carleton would come And there he is said a quick beat of her heart as his entrance explained Constance s ring Such a rush of associations came over Fleda that she was in imminent danger of losing missus Thorn altogether She managed however by some sort of instinct to disprove the assertion that the mind cannot attend to two things at once and carried on a double conversation with herself and with missus Thorn for some time very vigorously Just the same he has not altered a jot she said to herself as he came forward to missus Evelyn it is himself his very self he doesn t look a day older I m very glad Yes ma am it s extremely tiresome How exactly as when he left me in Paris and how much pleasanter than anybody else more pleasant than ever it seems to me but that is because I have not seen him in so long he only wanted one thing That same grave eye but quieter isn t it than it used to be I think so It s the best store in town I think missus Thorn by far yes ma am Those eyes are certainly the finest I ever saw How I have seen him stand and look just so when he was talking to his workmen without that air of consciousness that all these people have comparatively what a difference I know very little about it ma am I am not learned in laces I never bought any I wish he would look this way I wonder if missus Evelyn does not mean to bring him to see me she must remember now there is that curious old smile and looking down how much better I know what it means than missus Evelyn does Yes ma am I understand I mean it is very convenient I never go anywhere else to get anything at least I should not if I lived here She does not know whom she is talking to She is going to walk him off into the other room How very much more gracefully he does everything than anybody else it comes from that entire high mindedness and frankness I think not altogether a fine person must aid the effect and that complete independence of other people I wonder if missus Evelyn has forgotten my existence he has not I am sure I think she is a little odd Yes ma am my face is flushed the room is very warm But the fire has gone down it will be cooler now said missus Thorn Which were the first words that fairly entered Fleda s understanding She was glad to use the screen to hide her face now not the fire Apparently the gentleman and lady found nothing to detain them in the other room for after sauntering off to it they sauntered back again and placed themselves to talk just opposite her Fleda had an additional screen now in the person of Miss Tomlinson who had sought her corner and was earnestly talking across her to missus Thorn so that she was sure even if mister Carleton s eyes should chance to wander that way they would see nothing but the unremarkable skirt of her green silk dress most unlikely to detain them The trade in nothings going on over the said green silk was very brisk indeed but disregarding the buzz of tongues near at hand Fleda s quick ears were able to free the barrier and catch every one of the quiet tones beyond And you leave us the day after to morrow said missus Evelyn No missus Evelyn I shall wait another steamer The lady s brow instantly revealed to Fleda a trap setting beneath to catch his reason I m very glad exclaimed little Edith who in defiance of conventionalities and proprieties made good her claim to be in the drawing room on all occasions then you will take me another ride won t you mister Carleton You do not flatter us with a very long stay pursued missus Evelyn Quite as long as I expected longer than I meant it to be he answered rather thoughtfully mister Carleton said Constance sidling up in front of him I have been in distress to ask you a question and I am afraid Of what are you afraid Miss Constance That you would reward me with one of your severe looks which would petrify me and then I am afraid I should feel uncomfortable I hope he will said missus Evelyn settling herself back in the corner of the sofa and with a look at her daughter which was complacency itself I hope mister Carleton will if you are guilty of any impertinence What is the question Miss Constance I want to know what brought you out here Fie Constance said her mother I am ashamed of you Do not answer her mister Carleton mister Carleton will answer me mamma he looks benevolently upon my faults which are entirely those of education What was it mister Carleton I suppose said he smiling it might be traced more or less remotely to the restlessness incident to human nature But you are not restless mister Carleton said Florence with a glance which might be taken as complimentary And knowing that I am said Constance in comic impatience you are maliciously prolonging my agonies It is not what I expected of you mister Carleton My dear said her father mister Carleton I am sure will fulfil all reasonable expectations What is the matter I asked him where a certain tribe of Indians was to be found papa and he told me they were supposed originally to have come across Behring s Straits one cold winter mister Evelyn looked a little doubtfully and Constance with so unhesitating gravity that the gravity of nobody else was worth talking about But it is so uncommon said missus Evelyn when they had done laughing to see an Englishman of your class here at all that when he comes a second time we may be forgiven for wondering what has procured us such an honour Women may always be forgiven for wondering my dear said mister Evelyn or the rest of mankind must live at odds with them Your principal object was to visit our western prairies wasn t it mister Carleton said Florence No he replied quietly I cannot say that I should choose to give a less romantic explanation of my movements From some knowledge growing out of my former visit to this country I thought there were certain negotiations I might enter into here with advantage and it was for the purpose of attending to these Miss Constance that I came And have you succeeded said missus Evelyn with an expression of benevolent interest No ma am my information had not been sufficient Very likely said mister Evelyn There isn t one man in a hundred whose representations on such a matter are to be trusted at a distance On such a matter repeated his wife funnily you don t know what the matter was mister Evelyn you don t know what you are talking about Business my dear business I take only what mister Carleton said it doesn t signify a straw what business A man must always see with his own eyes Whether mister Carleton had seen or had not seen or whether even he had his faculty of hearing in present exercise a glance at his face was incompetent to discover I never should have imagined said Constance eying him keenly that mister Carleton s errand to this country was one of business and not of romance I believe it s a humbug For an instant this was answered by one of those looks of absolute composure in every muscle and feature which put an effectual bar to all further attempts from without or revelations from within a look Fleda remembered well and felt even in her corner But it presently relaxed and he said with his usual manner You cannot understand then Miss Constance that there should be any romance about business I cannot understand said missus Evelyn why romance should not come after business mister Carleton sir you have seen American scenery this summer isn t American beauty worth staying a little while longer for My dear said mister Evelyn mister Carleton is too much of a philosopher to care about beauty every man of sense is I am sure he is not said missus Evelyn smoothly mister Carleton you are an admirer of beauty are you not sir I hope so missus Evelyn he said smiling but perhaps I shall shock you by adding not of beauties That sounds very odd said Florence But let us understand said missus Evelyn with the air of a person solving a problem I suppose we are to infer that your taste in beauty is of a peculiar kind That may be a fair inference he said What is it then said Constance eagerly Yes what is it you look for in a face said missus Evelyn Let us hear whether America has any chance said mister Thorn who had joined the group and placed himself precisely so as to hinder Fleda s view My fancy has no stamp of nationality in this at least he said pleasantly Now for instance the Miss Delancys don t you call them handsome mister Carleton said Florence Yes he said half smiling But not beautiful Now what is it they want I do not wish if I could to make the want visible to other eyes than my own Well Cornelia Schenck how do you like her face It is very pretty featured Pretty featured Why she is called beautiful She has a beautiful smile mister Carleton She has only one Only one and how many smiles ought the same person to have cried Florence impatiently But that which instantly answered her said forcibly that a plurality of them was possible I have seen one face he said gravely and his eye seeking the floor that had I think a thousand Different smiles said missus Evelyn in a constrained voice If they were not all absolutely that they had so much of freshness and variety that they all seemed new Was the mouth so beautiful said Florence Perhaps it would not have been remarked for beauty when it was perfectly at rest but it could not move with the least play of feeling grave or gay that it did not become so in a very high degree I think there was no touch or shade of sentiment in the mind that the lips did not give with singular nicety and the mind was one of the most finely wrought I have ever known And what other features went with this mouth said Florence The usual complement I suppose said Thorn Item two lips indifferent red item two grey eyes with lids to them item one neck one chin and so forth mister Carleton sir said missus Evelyn blandly as mister Evelyn says women may be forgiven for wondering won t you answer Florence s question mister Thorn has done it missus Evelyn for me But I have great doubts of the correctness of mister Thorn s description sir won t you indulge us with yours Word painting is a difficult matter missus Evelyn in some instances if I must do it I will borrow my colours In general that which made her fairness much the fairer was that it was but an ambassador of a most fair mind A most exquisite picture said Thorn and the original don t stand so thick that one is in any danger of mistaking them Is the painter Shakspeare I don t recollect I think Sidney sir I am not sure But still mister Carleton said missus Evelyn this is only in general I want very much to know the particulars what style of features belonged to this face The fairest I think I have ever known said mister Carleton You asked me Miss Evelyn what was my notion of beauty this face was a good illustration of it Not perfection of outline though it had that too in very uncommon degree but the loveliness of mind and character to which these features were only an index the thoughts were invariably telegraphed through eye and mouth more faithfully than words could give them What kind of eyes said Florence His own grew dark as he answered Clear and pure as one might imagine an angel s through which I am sure my good angel many a time looked at me Good angels were at a premium among the eyes that were exchanging glances just then And mister Carleton said missus Evelyn is it fair to ask this paragon is she living still I hope so he answered with his old light smile dismissing the subject You spoke so much in the past tense said missus Evelyn apologetically Yes I have not seen it since it was a child s A child s face Oh said Florence I think you see a great many children s faces with that kind of look I never saw but the one said mister Carleton dryly So far Fleda listened with cheeks that would certainly have excited missus Thorn s alarm if she had not been happily engrossed with Miss Tomlinson s affairs though up to the last two minutes the idea of herself had not entered Fleda s head in connection with the subject of conversation But then feeling it impossible to make her appearance in public that evening she quietly slipped out of the open window close by which led into a little greenhouse on the piazza and by another door gained the hall and the dressing room When doctor Gregory came to missus Evelyn s an hour or two after a figure all cloaked and hooded ran down the stairs and met him in the hall Ready said the doctor in surprise I have been ready some time sir said Fleda Well said he then we ll go straight home for I ve not done my work yet Dear uncle Orrin said Fleda if I had known you had work to do I wouldn t have come Yes you would said he decidedly She clasped her uncle s arm and walked with him briskly home through the frosty air looking at the silent lights and shadows on the walls of the street and feeling a great desire to cry Did you have a pleasant evening said the doctor when they were about half way Not particularly sir said Fleda hesitating He said not another word till they got home and Fleda went up to her room But the habit of patience overcame the wish to cry and though the outside of her little gold clasped Bible awoke it again a few words of the inside were enough to lay it quietly to sleep Well said the doctor as they sat at breakfast the next morning where are you going next To the concert I must to night said Fleda I couldn t help myself Why should you want to help yourself said the doctor And to missus Thorn s to morrow night No sir I believe not I believe you will said he looking at her I am sure I should enjoy myself more at home uncle Orrin There is very little rational pleasure to be had in these assemblages Rational pleasure said he Didn t you have any rational pleasure last night I didn t hear a single word spoken sir that was worth listening to at least that was spoken to me and the hollow kind of rattle that one hears from every tongue makes me more tired than anything else I believe I am out of tune with it somehow Out of tune said the old doctor giving her a look made up of humourous vexation and real sadness I wish I knew the right tuning key to take hold of you I become harmonious rapidly uncle Orrin when I am in this pleasant little room alone with you That won t do said he shaking his head at the smile with which this was said there is too much tension upon the strings So that was the reason you were all ready waiting for me last night Well you must tune up my little piece of discordance and go with me to missus Thorn s to morrow night I won t let you off With you sir said Fleda Yes he said I ll go along and take care of you lest you get drawn into something else you don t like But dear uncle Orrin there is another difficulty it is to be a large party and I have not a dress exactly fit What have you got said he with a comic kind of fierceness I have silks but they are none of them proper for this occasion they are ever so little old fashioned What do you want Nothing sir said Fleda for I don t want to go You mend a pair of stockings to put on said he nodding at her and I ll see to the rest Apparently you place great importance in stockings said Fleda laughing for you always mention them first But please don t get anything for me uncle Orrin please don t I have plenty for common occasions and I don t care to go to missus Thorn s I don t care either said the doctor working himself into his great coat By the by do you want to invoke the aid of saint Crispin He went off and Fleda did not know whether to cry or to laugh at the vigorous way in which he trod through the hall and slammed the front door after him Her spirits just kept the medium and did neither But they were in the same doubtful mood still an hour after when he came back with a paper parcel he had brought home under his arm and unrolled a fine embroidered muslin her eyes were very unsteady in carrying their brief messages of thankfulness as if they feared saying too much The doctor however was in the mood for doing not talking by looks or otherwise missus Pritchard was called into consultation and with great pride and delight engaged to have the dress and all things else in due order by the following night her eyes saying all manner of gratulatory things as they went from the muslin to Fleda and from Fleda to doctor Gregory The rest of the day was not books but needlefuls of thread and from the confusion of laces and draperies Fleda was almost glad to escape and go to the concert but for one item that spoiled it They were in their seats early Fleda managed successfully to place the two Evelyns between her and mister Thorn and then prepared herself to wear out the evening with patience My dear Fleda whispered Constance after some time spent in restless reconnoitring of everybody and everything I don t see my English rose anywhere Hush said Fleda smiling That happened not to be an English rose Constance What was it American unfortunately it was a Noisette the variety I think that they call Conque de Venus My dear little Fleda you re too wise for anything said Constance with a rather significant arching of her eyebrows You mustn t expect other people to be as rural in their acquirements as yourself I don t pretend to know any rose by sight but the Queechy she said with a change of expression meant to cover the former one Fleda s face however did not call for any apology It was perfectly quiet But what has become of him said Constance with her comic impatience My dear Fleda if my eyes cannot rest upon that development of elegance the parterre is become a wilderness to me Hush Constance Fleda whispered earnestly you are not safe he may be near you Safe ejaculated Constance but a half backward hasty glance of her eye brought home so strong an impression that the person in question was seated a little behind her that she dared not venture another look and became straightway extremely well behaved He was there and being presently convinced that he was in the neighbourhood of his little friend of former days he resolved with his own excellent eyes to test the truth of the opinion he had formed as to the natural and inevitable effect of circumstances upon her character whether it could by possibility have retained its great delicacy and refinement under the rough handling and unkindly bearing of things seemingly foreign to both He had thought not Truffi did not sing and the entertainment was of a very secondary quality This seemed to give no uneasiness to the Miss Evelyns for if they pouted they laughed and talked in the same breath and that incessantly It was nothing to mister Carleton for his mind was bent on something else And with a little surprise he saw that it was nothing to the subject of his thoughts either because her own were elsewhere too or because they were in league with a nice taste that permitted them to take no interest in what was going on Even her eyes trained as they had been to recluse habits were far less busy than those of her companions indeed they were not busy at all for the greater part of the time one hand was upon the brow shielding them from the glare of the gas lights Ostensibly but the very quiet air of the face led him to guess that the mind was glad of a shield too It relaxed sometimes Constance and Florence and mister Thorn and mister Thorn s mother were every now and then making demands upon her and they were met always with an intelligent well bred eye and often with a smile of equal gentleness and character but her observer noticed that though the smile came readily it went as readily and the lines of the face quickly settled again into what seemed to be an habitual composure There were the same outlines the same characters he remembered very well yet there was a difference not grief had changed them but life had The brow had all its fine chiselling and high purity of expression but now there sat there a hopelessness or rather a want of hopefulness that a child s face never knows The mouth was sweet and pliable as ever but now often patience and endurance did not quit their seat upon the lip even when it smiled The eye with all its old clearness and truthfulness had a shade upon it that nine years ago only fell at the bidding of sorrow and in every line of the face there was a quiet gravity that went to the heart of the person who was studying it Whatever causes had been at work he was very sure had done no harm to the character its old simplicity had suffered no change as every look and movement proved the very unstudied careless position of the fingers over the eyes shewed that the thoughts had nothing to do there On one half of his doubt mister Carleton s mind was entirely made up but education the training and storing of the mind how had that fared He would know Perhaps he would have made some attempt that very evening towards satisfying himself but noticing that in coming out Thorn permitted the Evelyns to pass him and attached himself determinately to Fleda he drew back and resolved to make his observations indirectly and on more than one point before he should seem to make them at all Chapter XXXIII Hark I hear the sound of coaches The hour of attack approaches Gay missus Pritchard had arrayed Fleda in the white muslin with an amount of satisfaction and admiration that all the lines of her face were insufficient to express Now she said you must just run down and let the doctor see you afore you take the shine off or he won t be able to look at anything else when you get to the place That would be unfortunate said Fleda and she ran down laughing into the room where the doctor was waiting for her but her astonished eyes encountering the figure of doctor Quackenboss she stopped short with an air that no woman of the world could have bettered The physician of Queechy on his part was at least equally taken aback doctor Quackenboss said Fleda I I was going to say Miss Ringgan said the doctor with a most unaffected obeisance but a I am afraid sir it is a deceptive influence I hope not said doctor Gregory smiling one corner of his mouth for his guest and the other for his niece Real enough to do real execution or I am mistaken sir Upon my word sir said doctor Quackenboss bowing again I hope a Miss Ringgan will remember the acts of her executive power at home and return in time to prevent an unfortunate termination doctor Gregory laughed heartily now while Fleda s cheeks relieved her dress to admiration Who will complain of her if she don t said the doctor Who will complain of her if she don t But Fleda put in her question How are you all at home doctor Quackenboss All Queechy sir answered the doctor politely on the principle of first come first served and individuals I shouldn t like to specify How are you all in Queechy doctor Quackenboss said Fleda I have the pleasure to say we are coming along as usual replied the doctor who seemed to have lost his power of standing up straight My sister Flora enjoys but poor health lately they are all holding their heads up at your house mister Rossitur has come home Uncle Rolf Has he exclaimed Fleda the colour of joy quite supplanting the other O I m very glad Yes said the doctor he s been home now I guess going on four days I am very glad repeated Fleda But won t you come and see me another time doctor Quackenboss I am obliged to go out The doctor professed his great willingness adding that he had only come down to the city to do two or three chores and thought she might perhaps like to take the opportunity which would afford him such very great gratification No indeed faire Una said doctor Gregory when they were on their way to missus Thorn s they ve got your uncle at home now and we ve got you and I mean to keep you till I m satisfied So you may bring home that eye that has been squinting at Queechy ever since you have been here and make up your mind to enjoy yourself I sha n t let you go till you do I ought to enjoy myself uncle Orrin said Fleda squeezing his arm gratefully See you do said he The pleasant news from home had given Fleda s spirits the needed spur which the quick walk to missus Thorn s did not take off Did you ever see Fleda look so well mamma said Florence as the former entered the drawing room That is the loveliest and best face in the room said mister Evelyn and she looks like herself to night There is a matchless simplicity about her said a gentleman standing by Her dress is becoming said missus Evelyn Why where did you ever see her mister Stackpole except at our house said Constance At missus Decatur s I have had that pleasure and once at her uncle s I didn t know you ever noticed ladies faces mister Stackpole said Florence How missus Thorn does look at her said Constance under her breath It is too much It was almost too much for Fleda s equanimity for the colour began to come And there goes mister Carleton said Constance I expect momentarily to hear the company strike up Sparkling and Bright Illustration And there goes mister Carleton said Constance They should have done that some time ago Miss Constance said the gentleman Which compliment however Constance received with hardly disguised scorn and turned her attention again to mister Carleton I trust I do not need presentation said his voice and his smile at once as he presented himself to Fleda How little he needed it the flash of feeling which met his eyes said sufficiently well But apparently the feeling was a little too deep for the colour mounted and the eyes fell and the smile suddenly died on the lips mister Thorn came up to them and releasing her hand mister Carleton stepped back and permitted him to lead her away What do think of that face said Constance finding herself a few minutes after at his side That must define itself said he or I can hardly give a safe answer What face Why I mean of course the one mister Thorn carried off just now You are her friend Miss Constance he said coolly May I ask for your judgment upon it before I give mine Mine why I expected every minute that mister Thorn would make the musicians play Sparkling and Bright and tell Miss Ringgan that to save trouble he had directed them to express what he was sure were the sentiments of the whole company in one burst He smiled a little but in a way that Constance could not understand and did not like Those are common epithets he said Must I use uncommon said Constance significantly No but these may say one thing or another I have said one thing said Constance and now you may say the other Pardon me you have said nothing These epithets are deserved by a great many faces but on very different grounds and the praise is a different thing accordingly Well what is the difference said Constance On what do you think this lady s title to it rests On what why on that bewitching little air of the eyes and mouth I suppose Bewitching is a very vague term said he smiling again more quietly But you have had an opportunity of knowing it much better of late than I to which class of bright faces would you refer this one Where does the light come from I never studied faces in a class said Constance a little scornfully Come from a region of mist and clouds I should say for it is sometimes pretty well covered up There are some eyes whose sparkling is nothing more than the play of light upon a bright bead of glass It is not that said Constance answering in spite of herself after delaying as long as she dared There is the brightness that is only the reflection of outward circumstances and passes away with them It isn t that in Fleda Ringgan said Constance for her outward circumstances have no brightness I should think that reflection would not utterly absorb She would fain have turned the conversation but the questions were put so lightly and quietly that it could not be gracefully done She longed to cut it short but her hand was upon mister Carleton s arm and they were slowly sauntering down the rooms too pleasant a state of things to be relinquished for a trifle There is the broad day light of mere animal spirits he went on seeming rather to be suggesting these things for her consideration than eager to set forth any opinions of his own there is the sparkling of mischief and the fire of hidden passions there is the passing brilliance of wit as satisfactory and resting as these gas lights and there is now and then the light of refined affections out of a heart unspotted from the world as pure and abiding as the stars and like them throwing its soft ray especially upon the shadows of life I have always understood said Constance that cats eyes are brightest in the dark They do not love the light I believe said mister Carleton calmly Well said Constance not relishing the expression of her companion s eye which from glowing had suddenly become cool and bright where would you put me mister Carleton among all these illuminators of the social system You may put yourself where you please Miss Constance he said again turning upon her an eye so deep and full in its meaning that her own and her humour fell before it for a moment she looked most unlike the gay scene around her Is not that the best brightness he said speaking low that will last forever and is not that lightness of heart best worth having which does not depend on circumstances and will find its perfection just when all other kinds of happiness fail utterly I can t conceive said Constance presently rallying or trying to rally herself what you and I have to do in a place where people are enjoying themselves at this moment mister Carleton He smiled at that and led her out of it into the conservatory close to which they found themselves It was a large and fine one terminating the suite of rooms in this direction Few people were there but at the far end stood a group among whom Fleda and mister Thorn were conspicuous He was busying himself in putting together a quantity of flowers for her and missus Evelyn and old mister Thorn stood looking on with mister Stackpole mister Stackpole was an Englishman of certainly not very prepossessing exterior but somewhat noted as an author and a good deal sought after in consequence At present he was engaged by missus Evelyn mister Carleton and Constance sauntered up towards them and paused at a little distance to look at some curious plants Don t try for that mister Thorn said Fleda as the gentleman was making rather ticklish efforts to reach a superb Fuchsia that hung high You are endangering sundry things besides yourself I have learned Miss Fleda said Thorn as with much ado he grasped the beautiful cluster that what we take the most pains for is apt to be reckoned the best prize a truth I should never think of putting into a lady s head if I believed it possible that a single one of them was ignorant of its practical value I have this same rose in my garden at home said Fleda You are a great gardener Miss Fleda I hear said the old gentleman My son says you are an adept in it I am very fond of it sir said Fleda answering him with an entirely different face I thought the delicacy of American ladies was beyond such a masculine employment as gardening said mister Stackpole edging away from missus Evelyn I guess this young lady is an exception to the rule said old mister Thorn I guess she is an exception to most rules that you have got in your note book mister Stackpole said the younger man But there is no guessing about the garden for I have with my own eyes seen these gentle hands at one end of a spade and her foot at the other a sight that I declare I don t know whether I was most filled with astonishment or admiration Yes said Fleda half laughing and colouring and he ingenuously confessed in his surprise that he didn t know whether politeness ought to oblige him to stop and shake hands or to pass by without seeing me evidently shewing that he thought I was about something equivocal The laugh was now turned against mister Thorn but he went on cutting his geraniums with a grave face Well said he at length I think it is something of very equivocal utility Why should such gentle hands and feet spend their strength in clod breaking when rough ones are at command There was nothing equivocal about Fleda s merriment this time I have learned mister Thorn by sad experience that the rough hands break more than the clods One day I set Philetus to work among my flowers and the first thing I knew he had pulled up a fine passion flower which didn t make much shew above ground and was displaying it to me with the grave commentary Well that root did grow to a great haigth Some mental clod breaking to be done up there isn t there said Thorn in a kind of aside I cannot express my admiration at the idea of your dealing with those boors as it has been described to me They do not deserve the name mister Thorn said Fleda They are many of them most sensible and excellent people and friends that I value very highly Ah your goodness would made friends of everything Not of boors I hope said Fleda coolly Besides what do you mean by the name Anybody incapable of appreciating that of which you alone should be unconscious he said softly Fleda stood impatiently tapping her flowers against her left hand I doubt their power of appreciation reaches a point that would surprise you sir It does indeed if I am mistaken in my supposition he said with a glance which Fleda refused to acknowledge What proportion do you suppose she went on of all these roomfuls of people behind us without saying anything uncharitable what proportion of them if compelled to amuse themselves for two hours at a bookcase would pitch upon Macaulay s Essays or anything like them to spend the time Hum really Miss Fleda said Thorn I should want to brush up my Algebra considerably before I could hope to find x y and z in such a confusion of the alphabet Or extract the small sensible root of such a quantity of light matter said mister Stackpole Will you bear with my vindication of my country friends Hugh and I sent for a carpenter to make some new arrangement of shelves in a cupboard where we kept our books he was one of these boors mister Thorn in no respect above the rest The right stuff for his work was wanting and while it was sent for he took up one of the volumes that were lying about and read perseveringly until the messenger returned It was a volume of Macaulay s Miscellanies and afterwards he borrowed the book of me And you lent it to him said Constance Most assuredly and with a great deal of pleasure And is this no more than a common instance Miss Ringgan said mister Carleton No I think not said Fleda the quick blood in her cheeks again answering the familiar voice and old associations I know several of the farmers daughters around us that have studied Latin and Greek and philosophy is a common thing and I am sure there is more sense She suddenly checked herself and her eye which had been sparkling grew quiet It is very absurd said mister Stackpole Why sir O these people have nothing to do with such things do them nothing but harm May I ask again what harm said Fleda gently Unfit them for the duties of their station and make them discontented with it By making it pleasanter No no not by making it pleasanter By what then mister Stackpole said Thorn to draw him on and to draw her out Fleda was sure By lifting them out of it And what objection to lifting them out of it said Thorn You can t lift everybody out of it said the gentleman with a little irritation in his manner that station must be filled there must always be poor people And what degree of poverty ought to debar a man from the pleasures of education and a cultivated taste such as he can attain No no not that said mister Stackpole but it all goes to fill them with absurd notions about their place in society inconsistent with proper subordination Fleda looked at him but shook her head slightly and was silent Things are in very different order on our side the water said mister Stackpole hugging himself Are they said Fleda Yes we understand how to keep things in their places a little better I did not know said Fleda quietly that it was by design of the rulers of England that so many of her lower class are in the intellectual condition of our slaves mister Carleton said missus Evelyn laughing what do you say to that sir Fleda s face turned suddenly to him with a quick look of apology which she immediately knew was not needed But this kind of thing don t make the people any happier pursued mister Stackpole only serves to give them uppish and dissatisfied longings that cannot be gratified Somebody says observed Thorn that under a despotism all are contented because none can get on and in a republic none are contented because all can get on Precisely said mister Stackpole That might do very well if the world were in a state of perfection said Fleda As it is commend me to discontent and getting on And the uppishness I am afraid is a national fault sir you know our state motto is Excelsior We are at liberty to suppose said Thorn that Miss Ringgan has followed the example of her friends the farmers daughters or led them in it It is dangerous to make surmises said Fleda colouring It is a pleasant way of running into danger said mister Thorn who was leisurely pruning the prickles from the stem of a rose I was talking to a gentleman once said Fleda about the birds and flowers we find in our wilds and he told me afterwards gravely that he was afraid I was studying too many things at once when I was innocent of all ornithology but what my eyes and ears had picked up in the woods except some childish reminiscences of Audubon That is just the right sort of learning for a lady said mister Stackpole smiling at her however women have nothing to do with books What do you say to that Miss Fleda said Thorn Nothing sir it is one of those positions that are unanswerable But mister Stackpole said missus Evelyn I don t like that doctrine sir I do not believe in it at all That is unfortunate for my doctrine said the gentleman But I do not believe it is yours Why must women have nothing to do with books what harm do they do mister Stackpole Not needed ma am a woman as somebody says knows intuitively all that is really worth knowing Of what use is a mine that is never worked said mister Carleton It is worked said mister Stackpole Domestic life is the true training for the female mind One woman will learn more wisdom from the child on her breast than another will learn from ten thousand volumes It is very doubtful how much wisdom the child will ever learn from her said mister Carleton smiling A woman who never saw a book pursued mister Stackpole unconsciously quoting his author may be infinitely superior even in all those matters of which books treat to the woman who has read and read intelligently a whole library Unquestionably and it is likewise beyond question that a silver sixpence may be worth more than a washed guinea But a woman s true sphere is in her family in her home duties which furnish the best and most appropriate training for her faculties pointed out by nature itself Yes said mister Carleton and for those duties some of the very highest and noblest that are entrusted to human agency the fine machinery that is to perform them should be wrought to its last point of perfectness The wealth of a woman s mind instead of lying in the rough should be richly brought out and fashioned for its various ends while yet those ends are in the future or it will never meet the demand And for her own happiness all the more because her sphere is at home her home stores should be exhaustless the stores she cannot go abroad to seek I would add to strength beauty and to beauty grace in the intellectual proportions so far as possible It were ungenerous in man to condemn the best half of human intellect to insignificance merely because it is not his own missus Evelyn wore a smile of admiration that nobody saw but Fleda s face was a study while mister Carleton was saying this Her look was fixed upon him with such intent satisfaction and eagerness that it was not till he had finished that she became aware that those dark eyes were going very deep into hers and suddenly put a stop to the inquisition Very pleasant doctrine to the ears that have an interest in it said mister Stackpole rather discontentedly The man knows little of his own interest said mister Carleton who would leave that ground waste or would cultivate it only in the narrow spirit of a utilitarian He needs an influence in his family not more refreshing than rectifying and no man will seek that in one greatly his inferior He is to be pitied who cannot fall back upon his home with the assurance that he has there something better than himself Why mister Carleton sir said missus Evelyn with every line of her mouth saying funny things I am afraid you have sadly neglected your own interest have you anything at Carleton better than yourself Suddenly cool again he laughed and said You were there missus Evelyn But mister Carleton pursued the lady with a mixture of insinuation and fun why were you never married Circumstances have always forbade it he answered with a smile which Constance declared was the most fascinating thing she ever saw in her life Fleda was arranging her flowers with the help of some very unnecessary suggestions from the donor mister Lewis said Constance with a kind of insinuation very different from her mother s made up of fun and daring mister Carleton has been giving me a long lecture on botany while my attention was distracted by listening to your spirituel conversation Well Miss Constance And I am morally certain I sha n t recollect a word of it if I don t carry away some specimens to refresh my memory and in that case he would never give me another It was impossible to help laughing at the distressful position of the young lady s eyebrows and with at least some measure of outward grace mister Thorn set about complying with her request Fleda again stood tapping her left hand with her flowers wondering a little that somebody else did not come and speak to her but he was talking to missus Evelyn and mister Stackpole Fleda did not wish to join them and nothing better occurred to her than to arrange her flowers over again so throwing them all down before her on a marble slab she began to pick them up one by one and put them together with it must be confessed a very indistinct realization of the difference between myrtle and lemon blossoms and as she seemed to be laying acacia to rose and disposing some sprigs of beautiful heath behind them in reality she was laying kindness alongside of kindness and looking at the years beyond years where their place had been It was with a little start that she suddenly found the person of her thoughts standing at her elbow and talking to her in bodily presence But while he spoke with all the ease and simplicity of old times almost making Fleda think it was but last week they had been strolling through the Place de la Concorde together there was a constraint upon her that she could not get rid of and that bound eye and tongue It might have worn off but his attention was presently claimed again by missus Evelyn and Fleda thought best while yet Constance s bouquet was unfinished to join another party and make her escape into the drawing rooms Chapter XXXIV Have you observed a sitting hare List ning and fearful of the storm Of horns and hounds clap back her ear Afraid to keep or leave her form Prior By the Evelyns own desire Fleda s going to them was delayed for a week because they said a furnace was to be brought into the house and they would be all topsy turvy till that fuss was over Fleda kept herself very quiet in the mean time seeing almost nobody but the person whom it was her especial object to shun Do her best she could not quite escape him and was even drawn into two or three walks and rides in spite of denying herself utterly to gentlemen at home and losing in consequence a visit from her old friend She was glad at last to go to the Evelyns and see company again hoping that mister Thorn would be merged in a crowd But she could not merge him and sometimes was almost inclined to suspect that his constant prominence in the picture must be owing to some mysterious and wilful conjuration going on in the background She was at a loss to conceive how else it happened that despite her utmost endeavours to the contrary she was so often thrown upon his care and obliged to take up with his company It was very disagreeable mister Carleton she saw almost as constantly but though frequently near she had never much to do with him There seemed to be a dividing atmosphere always in the way and whenever he did speak to her she felt miserably constrained and unable to appear like herself Why was it she asked herself in a very vexed state of mind No doubt partly from the remembrance of that overheard conversation which she could not help applying but much more from an indefinable sense that at these times there were always eyes upon her She tried to charge the feeling upon her consciousness of their having heard that same talk but it would not the more go off And it had no chance to wear off for somehow the occasions never lasted long something was sure to break them up while an unfortunate combination of circumstances or of connivers seemed to give mister Thorn unlimited facilities in the same kind Fleda was quick witted and skilful enough to work herself out of them once in a while more often the combination was too much for her simplicity and straight forwardness She was a little disappointed and a little surprised at mister Carleton s coolness He was quite equal to withstand or out general the schemes of any set of manoeuvrers therefore it was plain he did not care for the society of his little friend and companion of old time Fleda felt it especially as she now and then heard him in delightful talk with somebody else making himself so interesting that when Fleda could get a chance to listen she was quite ready to forgive his not talking to her for the pleasure of hearing him talk at all But at other times she said sorrowfully to herself He will be going home presently and I shall not have seen him One day she had successfully defended herself against taking a drive which mister Thorn came to propose though the proposition had been laughingly backed by missus Evelyn Raillery was much harder to withstand than persuasion but Fleda s quiet resolution had proved a match for both The better to cover her ground she declined to go out at all and remained at home the only one of the family that fine day In the afternoon mister Carleton was there Fleda sat a little apart from the rest industriously bending over a complicated piece of embroidery belonging to Constance and in which that young lady had made a great blunder which she declared her patience unequal to the task of rectifying The conversation went gayly forward among the others Fleda taking no part in it beyond an involuntary one mister Carleton s part was rather reserved and grave according to his manner in ordinary society What do you keep bothering yourself with that for said Edith coming to Fleda s side One must be doing something you know said Fleda lightly No you mustn t not when you re tired and I know you are I d let Constance pick out her own work I promised her I would do it said Fleda Well you didn t promise her when Come everybody s been out but you and you have sat here over this the whole day Why don t you come over there and talk with the rest I know you want to for I ve watched your mouth going Going how Going off at the corners I ve seen it Come But Fleda said she could listen and work at once and would not budge Edith stood looking at her a little while in a kind of admiring sympathy and then went back to the group mister Carleton said the young lady who was treading with laudable success in the steps of her sister Constance what has become of that ride you promised to give me I do not know Miss Edith said mister Carleton smiling for my conscience never had the keeping of it Hush Edith said her mother do you think mister Carleton has nothing to do but to take you riding I don t believe he has much to do said Edith securely But mister Carleton you did promise for I asked you and you said nothing and I always have been told that silence gives consent so what is to become of it Will you go now Miss Edith Now O yes And will you go out to Manhattanville mister Carleton along by the river If you like But Miss Edith the carriage will hold another cannot you persuade one of these ladies to go with us Fleda said Edith springing off to her with extravagant capers of joy Fleda you shall go you haven t been out to day And I cannot go out to day said Fleda gently The air is very fine said mister Carleton approaching her table with no want of alacrity in step or tone her ears knew and this weather makes everything beautiful has that piece of canvas any claims upon you that cannot be put aside for a little No sir said Fleda but I am sorry I have a stronger reason that must keep me at home She knows how the weather looks said Edith mister Thorn takes her out every other day It s no use to talk to her mister Carleton when she says she won t she won t Every other day said Fleda No no said missus Evelyn coming up and with that smile which Fleda had never liked so little as at that minute not every other day Edith what are you talking of Go and don t keep mister Carleton waiting Fleda worked on feeling a little aggrieved mister Carleton stood still by her table watching her while his companions were getting themselves ready but he said no more and Fleda did not raise her head till the party were off Florence had taken her resigned place I dare say the weather will be quite as fine to morrow dear Fleda said missus Evelyn softly I hope it will said Fleda in a tone of resolute simplicity I only hope it will not bring too great a throng of carriages to the door missus Evelyn went on in a tone of great internal amusement I never used to mind it but I have lately a nervous fear of collisions To morrow is not your reception day said Fleda No not mine said missus Evelyn softly but that doesn t signify it may be one of my neighbours Fleda pulled away at her threads of worsted and wouldn t know anything else I have read of the servants of Lot and the servants of Abraham quarrelling missus Evelyn went on in the same undertone of delight because the land was too strait for them I should be very sorry to have anything of the sort happen again for I cannot imagine where Lot would go to find a plain that would suit him Lot and Abraham mamma said Constance from the sofa what on earth are you talking about None of your business said missus Evelyn I was talking of some country friends of mine that you don t know Constance knew her mother s laugh very well but missus Evelyn was impenetrable The next day Fleda ran away and spent a good part of the morning with her uncle in the library looking over new books among which she found herself quite a stranger so many had made their appearance since the time when she had much to do with libraries or bookstores Living friends male and female were happily forgotten in the delighted acquaintance making with those quiet companions which whatever their deficiencies in other respects are at least never importunate nor unfaithful Fleda had come home rather late and was dressing for dinner with Constance s company and help when missus Evelyn came into her room My dear Fleda said the lady her face and voice as full as possible of fun mister Carleton wants to know if you will ride with him this afternoon I told him I believed you were in general shy of gentlemen that drove their own horses that I thought I had noticed you were but I would come up and see missus Evelyn you did not tell him that He said he was sorry to see you looked pale yesterday when he was asking you and he was afraid that embroidery is not good for you He thinks you are a very charming girl And missus Evelyn went off into little fits of laughter which unstrung all Fleda s nerves She stood absolutely trembling Mamma don t plague her said Constance He didn t say so He did upon my word said missus Evelyn speaking with great difficulty he said she was very charming and it might be dangerous to see too much of her You made him say that missus Evelyn said Fleda reproachfully Well I did ask him if you were not very charming but he answered without hesitation said the lady I am only so afraid that Lot will make his appearance Fleda turned round to the glass and went on arranging her hair with a quivering lip Lot mamma said Constance somewhat indignantly Yes said missus Evelyn in ecstacies because the land will not bear both of them But mister Carleton is very much in earnest for his answer Fleda my dear what shall I tell him You need be under no apprehensions about going he will perhaps tell you that you are charming but I don t think he will say anything more You know he is a kind of patriarch And when I asked him if he didn t think it might be dangerous to see too much of you he said he thought it might to some people so you see you are safe missus Evelyn how could you use my name so said Fleda with a voice that carried a good deal of reproach My dear Fleda shall I tell him you will go You need not be afraid to go riding only you must not let yourself be seen walking with him I shall not go ma am said Fleda quietly I wanted to send Edith with you thinking it would be pleasanter but I knew mister Carleton s carriage would hold but two to day So what shall I tell him I am not going ma am repeated Fleda But what shall I tell him I must give him some reason Shall I say that you think a sea breeze is blowing and you don t like it or shall I say that prospects are a matter of indifference to you Fleda was quite silent and went on dressing herself with trembling fingers My dear Fleda said the lady bringing her face a little into order won t you go I am very sorry So am I sorry said Fleda I can t go missus Evelyn I will tell mister Carleton you are very sorry said missus Evelyn every line of her face drawing again that will console him and let him hope that you will not mind sea breezes by and by after you have been a little longer in the neighbourhood of them I will tell him you are a good republican and have an objection at present to an English equipage but I have no doubt that it is a prejudice which will wear off She stopped to laugh while Fleda had the greatest difficulty not to cry The lady did not seem to see her disturbed brow but recovering herself after a little though not readily she bent forward and touched her lips to it in kind fashion Fleda did not look up and saying again I will tell him dear Fleda missus Evelyn left the room Constance after a little laughing and condoling neither of which Fleda attempted to answer ran off too to dress herself and Fleda after finishing her own toilette locked her door sat down and cried heartily She thought missus Evelyn had been perhaps unconsciously very unkind and to say that unkindness has not been meant is but to shift the charge from one to another vital point in the character of a friend and one perhaps sometimes not less grave A moment s passionate wrong may consist with the endurance of a friendship worth having better than the thoughtlessness of obtuse wits that can never know how to be kind Fleda s whole frame was still in a tremor from disagreeable excitement and she had serious causes of sorrow to cry for She was sorry she had lost what would have been a great pleasure in the ride and her great pleasures were not often but nothing would have been more impossible than for her to go after what missus Evelyn had said she was sorry mister Carleton should have asked her twice in vain what must he think she was exceeding sorry that a thought should have been put into her head that never before had visited the most distant dreams of her imagination so needlessly so gratuitously she was very sorry for she could not be free of it again and she felt it would make her miserably hampered and constrained in mind and manner both in any future intercourse with the person in question And then again what would he think of that Poor Fleda came to the conclusion that her best place was at home and made up her mind to take the first good opportunity of getting there She went down to dinner with no traces of either tears or unkindness on her sweet face but her nerves were quivering all the afternoon she could not tell whether missus Evelyn and her daughters found it out And it was impossible for her to get back even her old degree of freedom of manner before either mister Carleton or mister Thorn All the more because missus Evelyn was every now and then bringing out some sly allusion which afforded herself intense delight and wrought Fleda to the last degree of quietness Unkind Fleda thought now it was but half from ignorance of the mischief she was doing and the other half from the mere desire of selfish gratification The times and ways in which Lot and Abraham were walked into the conversation were incalculable and unintelligible except to the person who understood it only too well On one occasion missus Evelyn went on with a long rigmarole to mister Thorn about sea breezes with a face of most exquisite delight at his mystification and her own hidden fun till Fleda was absolutely trembling Fleda shunned both the gentlemen at length with a kind of nervous horror One steamer had left New York and another and still mister Carleton did not leave it Why he staid Constance was as much in a puzzle as ever for no mortal could guess Clearly she said he did not delight in New York society for he honoured it as slightly and partially as might be and it was equally clear if he had a particular reason for staying he didn t mean anybody should know it If he don t mean it you won t find it out Constance said Fleda But it is that very consideration you see which inflames my impatience to a most dreadful degree I think our house is distinguished with his regards though I am sure I can t imagine why for he never condescends to anything beyond general benevolence when he is here and not always to that He has no taste for embroidery or Miss Ringgan s crewels would receive more of his notice he listens to my spirited conversation with a self possession which invariably deprives me of mine and his ear is evidently dull to musical sensibilities or Florence s harp would have greater charms I hope there is a web weaving somewhere that will catch him at present he stands in an attitude of provoking independence of all the rest of the world It is curious said Constance with an indescribable face I feel that the independence of another is rapidly making a slave of me What do you mean Constance said Edith indignantly But the others could do nothing but laugh Fleda did not wonder that mister Carleton made no more efforts to get her to ride for the very next day after his last failure he had met her driving with mister Thorn Fleda had been asked by mister Thorn s mother in such a way as made it impossible to get off but it caused her to set a fresh seal of unkindness to missus Evelyn s behaviour One evening when there was no other company at missus Evelyn s mister Stackpole was entertaining himself with a long dissertation upon the affairs of America past present and future It was a favourite subject mister Stackpole always seemed to have more complacent enjoyment of his easy chair when he could succeed in making every American in the room sit uncomfortably And this time without any one to thwart him he went on to his heart s content disposing of the subject as one would strip a rose of its petals with as much seeming nonchalance and ease and with precisely the same design to make a rose no rose Leaf after leaf fell under mister Stackpole s touch as if it had been a black frost The American government was a rickety experiment go to pieces presently American institutions an alternative between fallacy and absurdity the fruit of raw minds and precocious theories American liberty a contradiction American character a compound of quackery and pretension American society except at missus Evelyn s an anomaly American destiny the same with that of a Cactus or a volcano a period of rest followed by a period of excitement not however like the former making successive shoots towards perfection but like the latter grounding every new face of things upon the demolition of that which went before Smoothly and pleasantly mister Stackpole went on compounding this cup of entertainment for himself and his hearers smacking his lips over it and all the more Fleda thought when they made wry faces throwing in a little truth a good deal of fallacy a great deal of perversion and misrepresentation while missus Evelyn listened and smiled and half parried and half assented to his positions and Fleda sat impatiently drumming upon her elbow with the fingers of her other hand in the sheer necessity of giving some expression to her feelings mister Stackpole at last got his finger upon the sore spot of American slavery and pressed it hard This is the land of the stars and the stripes said the gentleman in a little fit of virtuous indignation This is the land where all are brothers where All men are born free and equal mister Stackpole said Fleda in a tone that called his attention are you well acquainted with the popular proverbs of your country Not particularly he said he had never made it a branch of study I am a great admirer of them He bowed and begged to be excused for remarking that he didn t see the point yet Do you remember this one sir said Fleda colouring a little Those that live in glass houses shouldn t throw stones I have heard it but pardon me though your remark seems to imply the contrary I am in the dark yet What unfortunate points of vitrification have I laid open to your fire I thought they were probably forgotten by you sir I shall be exceedingly obliged to you if you will put me in condition to defend myself I think nothing could do that mister Stackpole Under whose auspices and fostering care was this curse of slavery laid upon America Why of course but you will observe Miss Ringgan that at that day the world was unenlightened on a great many points since then we have cast off the wrong which we then shared with the rest of mankind Ay sir but not until we had first repudiated it and Englishmen had desired to force it back upon us at the point of the sword Four times But my dear Fleda interrupted missus Evelyn the English nation have no slaves nor slave trade they have put an end to slavery entirely everywhere under their flag They were very slow about it said Fleda Four times the government of Massachusetts abolished the slave trade under their control and four times the English government thrust it back upon them Do you remember what Burke says about that in his speech on Conciliation with America It don t signify what Burke says about it said mister Stackpole rubbing his chin Burke is not the first authority but Miss Ringgan it is undeniable that slavery and the slave trade too does at this moment exist in the interior of your own country I will never excuse what is wrong sir but I think it becomes an Englishman to be very moderate in putting forth that charge Why said he hastily we have done away with it entirely in our own dominions wiped that stain clean off Not a slave can touch British ground but he breathes free air from that minute Yes sir but candour will allow that we are not in a condition in this country to decide the question by a tour de force What is to decide it then said he a little arrogantly The progress of truth in public opinion And why not the government as well as our government It has not the power you know sir Not the power well that speaks for itself Nothing against us on a fair construction said Fleda patiently It is well known to those who understand the subject Where did you learn so much about it Fleda said missus Evelyn humourously As the birds pick up their supplies ma am here and there It is well known mister Stackpole that our constitution never could have been agreed upon if that question of slavery had not been by common consent left where it was with the separate state governments The separate state governments well why do not they put an end to it The disgrace is only shifted Of course they must first have the consent of the public mind of those states Ah their consent and why is their consent wanting We cannot defend ourselves there said missus Evelyn I wish we could The disgrace at least is shifted from the whole to a part But will you permit me said Fleda to give another quotation from my despised authority and remind you of an Englishman s testimony that beyond a doubt that point of emancipation would never have been carried in parliament had the interests of even a part of the electors been concerned in it It was done however and done at the expense of twenty millions of money And I am sure that was very noble said Florence It was what no nation but the English would ever have done said missus Evelyn I do not wish to dispute it said Fleda but still it was doing what did not touch the sensitive point of their own well being We think there is a little national honour concerned in it said mister Stackpole dryly stroking his chin again So does every right minded person said missus Evelyn I am sure I do And I am sure so do I said Fleda but I think the honour of a piece of generosity is considerably lessened by the fact that it is done at the expense of another Generosity said mister Stackpole it was not generosity it was justice there was no generosity about it Then it deserves no honour at all said Fleda if it was merely that the tardy execution of justice is but the removal of a reproach We Englishmen are of opinion however said mister Stackpole contentedly that the removers of a reproach are entitled to some honour which those who persist in retaining it cannot claim Yes said Fleda drawing rather a long breath I acknowledge that but I think that while some of these same Englishmen have shewn themselves so unwilling to have the condition of their own factory slaves ameliorated they should be very gentle in speaking of wrongs which we have far less ability to rectify Ah I like consistency said mister Stackpole America shouldn t dress up poles with liberty caps till all who walk under are free to wear them She cannot boast that the breath of her air and the breath of freedom are one Can England said Fleda gently when her own citizens are not free from the horrors of impressment Pshaw said mister Stackpole half in a pet and half laughing why where did you get such a fury against England you are the first fair antagonist I have met on this side of the water I wish I was a better one sir said Fleda laughing Miss Ringgan has been prejudiced by an acquaintance with one or two unfortunate specimens said missus Evelyn Ay said mister Stackpole a little bitterly America is the natural birthplace of prejudice always was Displayed first in maintaining the rights against the swords of Englishmen latterly how mister Stackpole It isn t necessary to enlighten you on any part of the subject said he a little pointedly Fleda my dear you are answered said missus Evelyn apparently with great internal amusement Yet you will indulge me so far as to indicate what part of the subject you are upon said Fleda quietly You must grant so much as that to so gentle a requisition mister Stackpole said the older lady I venture to assume that you do not say that on your own account missus Evelyn Not at all I agree with you that Americans are prejudiced but I think it will pass off mister Stackpole as they learn to know themselves and other countries better But how do they deserve such a charge and such a defence or how have they deserved it said Fleda Tell her mister Stackpole said missus Evelyn Why said mister Stackpole in their absurd opposition to all the old and tried forms of things and rancorous dislike of those who uphold them and in their pertinacity on every point where they might be set right and impatience of hearing the truth Are they singular in that last item said Fleda Now said mister Stackpole not heeding her there s your treatment of the aborigines of this country what do you call that for a free people A powder magazine communicating with a great one of your own somewhere else so if you are a good subject sir you will not carry a lighted candle into it One of our own where said he In India said Fleda with a glance and there are I don t know how many trains leading to it so better hands off sir Where did you pick up such a spite against us said mister Stackpole drawing a little back and eying her as one would a belligerent mouse or cricket Will you tell me now that Americans are not prejudiced What do you call prejudice said Fleda smiling O there is a great deal of it no doubt here mister Stackpole said missus Evelyn blandly but we shall grow out of it in time it is only the premature wisdom of a young people And young people never like to hear their wisdom rebuked said mister Stackpole bowing Fleda my dear what for is that little significant shake of your head said missus Evelyn in her amused voice A trifle ma am Covers a hidden rebuke missus Evelyn I have no doubt for both our last remarks What is it Miss Fleda I dare say we can bear it I was thinking sir that none would trouble themselves much about our foolscap if we had not once made them wear it mister Stackpole you are worsted I only wish mister Carleton had been here said missus Evelyn with a face of excessive delight I wish he had said Fleda for then I need not have spoken a word Why said mister Stackpole a little irritated you suppose he would have fought for you against me I suppose he would have fought for truth against anybody sir said Fleda Even against his own interests If I am not mistaken in him said Fleda he reckons his own and those of truth identical The shout that was raised at this by all the ladies of the family made her look up in wonderment mister Carleton said missus Evelyn what do you say to that sir The direction of the lady s eye made Fleda spring up and face about The gentleman in question was standing quietly at the back of her chair too quietly she saw to leave any doubt of his having been there some time mister Stackpole uttered an ejaculation but Fleda stood absolutely motionless and nothing could be prettier than her colour What do you say to what you have heard mister Carleton said missus Evelyn Fleda s eyes were on the floor but she thoroughly appreciated the tone of the question I hardly know whether I have listened with most pleasure or pain missus Evelyn Pleasure said Constance Pain said mister Stackpole I am certain Miss Ringgan was pure from any intention of giving pain said missus Evelyn with her voice of contained fun She has no national antipathies I am sure unless in the case of the Jews she is too charming a girl for that Miss Ringgan cannot regret less than I a word that she has spoken said mister Carleton looking keenly at her as she drew back and took a seat a little off from the rest Then why was the pain said mister Stackpole That there should have been any occasion for them sir Well I wasn t sensible of the occasion so I didn t feel the pain said mister Stackpole dryly for the other gentleman s tone was almost haughtily significant But if I had the pleasure of such sparkling eyes would have made me forget it Good evening missus Evelyn good evening my gentle antagonist it seems to me you have learned if it is permissible to alter one of your favorite proverbs that it is possible to break two windows with one stone However I don t feel that I go away with any of mine shattered Fleda my dear said missus Evelyn laughing what do you say to that As he is not here I will say nothing to it missus Evelyn said Fleda quietly drawing off to the table with her work and again in a tremor from head to foot Why didn t you see mister Carleton come in said Edith following her I did he came in long before you had done talking and mamma held up her finger and made him stop and he stood at the back of your chair the whole time listening mister Stackpole didn t know he was there either But what s the matter with you Nothing said Fleda but she made her escape out of the room the next instant Mamma said Edith what ails Fleda I don t know my love said missus Evelyn Nothing I hope There does though said Edith decidedly Come here Edith said Constance and don t meddle with matters above your comprehension Miss Ringgan has probably hurt her hand with throwing stones Hurt her hand said Edith But she was taken possession of by her eldest sister That is a lovely girl mister Carleton said missus Evelyn with an indescribable look outwardly benign but beneath that most keen in its scrutiny He bowed rather abstractedly She will make a charming little farmer s wife don t you think so Is that her lot missus Evelyn he said with a somewhat incredulous smile Why no not precisely said the lady you know in the country or you do not know the ministers are half farmers but I suppose not more than half just such a mixture as will suit Fleda I should think She has not told me in so many words but it is easy to read so ingenuous a nature as hers and I have discovered that there is a most deserving young friend of mine settled at Queechy that she is by no means indifferent to I take it for granted that will be the end of it said missus Evelyn pinching her sofa cushion in a great many successive places with a most composed and satisfied air But mister Carleton did not seem at all interested in the subject and presently introduced another Chapter XXXV It is a hard matter for friends to meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter As You Like It What have we to do to night said Florence at breakfast the next morning You have no engagement have you said her mother No mamma said Constance arching her eyebrows we are to taste the sweets of domestic life you as head of the family will go to sleep in the dormeuse and Florence and I shall take turns in yawning by your side And what will Fleda do said missus Evelyn laughing Fleda mamma will be wrapped in remorseful recollections of having enacted a mob last evening and have enough occupation in considering how she shall repair damages Fleda my dear she is very saucy said missus Evelyn sipping her tea with great comfort Why should we yawn to night any more than last night said Fleda a question which Edith would certainly have asked if she had not been away at school The breakfast was too late for both her and her father Last night my dear your fractious disposition kept us upon half breath there wasn t time to yawn I meant to have eased my breast by laughing afterwards but that expectation was stifled What stifled it I was afraid said Constance with a little flutter of her person up and down in her chair Afraid of what And besides you know we can t have our drawing rooms filled with distinguished foreigners every evening we are not at home I shall direct the fowling piece to be severe in his execution of orders to night and let nobody in I forgot exclaimed Constance with another flutter it is mister Thorn s night My dearest mamma will you consent to have the dormeuse wheeled round with its back to the fire and Florence and I will take the opportunity to hear little Edith s lessons in the next room unless mister Decatur comes I must endeavour to make the Manton comprehend what he has to do But what is to become of mister Evelyn said Fleda you make missus Evelyn the head of the family very unceremoniously mister Evelyn my dear said Constance gravely makes a futile attempt semi weekly to beat his brains out with a club and every successive failure encourages him to try again the only effect being a temporary decapitation of his family and I believe this is the night on which he periodically turns a frigid eye upon their destitution You are too absurd said Florence reaching over for a sausage Dear Constance said Fleda half laughing why do you talk so Constance behave yourself said her mother Mamma said the young lady I am actuated by a benevolent desire to effect a diversion of Miss Ringgan s mind from its gloomy meditations by presenting to her some more real subjects of distress I wonder if you ever looked at such a thing said Fleda What such a thing As a real subject of distress Yes I have one incessantly before me in your serious countenance Why in the world Fleda don t you look like other people I suppose because I don t feel like them And why don t you I am sure you ought to be as happy as most people I think I am a great deal happier said Fleda Than I am said the young lady with arched eyebrows But they went down and her look softened in spite of herself at the eye and smile which answered her I should be very glad dear Constance to know you were as happy as I Why do you think I am not said the young lady a little tartly Because no happiness would satisfy me that cannot last And why can t it last It is not built upon lasting things Pshaw said Constance I wouldn t have such a dismal kind of happiness as yours Fleda for anything Dismal said Fleda smiling because it can never disappoint me or because it isn t noisy My dear little Fleda said Constance in her usual manner you have lived up there among the solitudes till you have got morbid ideas of life which it makes me melancholy to observe I am very much afraid they verge towards stagnation No indeed said Fleda laughing but if you please with me the stream of life has flowed so quietly that I have looked quite to the bottom and know how shallow it is and growing shallower I could not venture my bark of happiness there but with you it is like a spring torrent the foam and the roar hinder your looking deep into it Constance gave her a significant glance a strong contrast to the earnest simplicity of Fleda s face and presently inquired if she ever wrote poetry Shall I have the pleasure some day of discovering your uncommon signature in the secular corner of some religious newspaper I hope not said Fleda quietly Joe Manton just then brought in a bouquet for Miss Evelyn a very common enlivener of the breakfast table all the more when as in the present case the sisters could not divine where it came from It moved Fleda s wonder to see how very little the flowers were valued for their own sake the probable cost the probable giver the probable eclat were points enthusiastically discussed and thoroughly appreciated but the sweet messengers themselves were carelessly set by for other eyes and seemed to have no attraction for those they were destined to Fleda enjoyed them at a distance and could not help thinking that Heaven sends almonds to those that have no teeth This Camellia will just do for my hair to morrow night said Florence just what I want with my white muslin I think I will go with you to morrow Florence said Fleda missus Decatur has asked me so often Well my dear I shall be made happy by your company said Florence abstractedly examining her bouquet I am afraid it hasn t stem enough Constance never mind I ll fix it where is the end of this myrtle I shall be very glad of course Fleda my dear but picking her bouquet to pieces I think it right to tell you privately I am afraid you will find it very stupid O I dare say she will not said missus Evelyn she can go and try at any rate she would find it very stupid with me here alone and Constance at the concert I dare say she will find some there whom she knows But the thing is mamma you see at these conversaziones they never talk anything but French and German I don t know of course I should be delighted to have Fleda with me and I have no doubt missus Decatur would be very glad to have her but I am afraid she won t enjoy herself I do not want to go where I shall not enjoy myself said Fleda quietly that is certain Of course you know dear I would a great deal rather have you than not I only speak for what I think would be for your pleasure I would do just as I felt inclined Fleda said missus Evelyn I shall let her encounter the dullness alone ma am said Fleda lightly But it was not in a light mood that she put on her bonnet after dinner and set out to pay a visit to her uncle at the library she had resolved that she would not be near the dormeuse in whatsoever relative position that evening Very very quiet she was her grave little face walked through the crowd of busy bustling anxious people as if she had nothing in common with them and Fleda felt that she had very little Half unconsciously as she passed along the streets her eye scanned the countenances of that moving panorama and the report it brought back made her draw closer within herself She wondered that her feet had ever tripped lightly up those library stairs Ha my fair Saxon said the doctor what has brought you down here to day I felt in want of something fresh uncle Orrin so I thought I would come and see you Fresh said he Ah you are pining for green fields I know But you little piece of simplicity there are no green fields now at Queechy they are two feet deep with snow by this time Well I am sure that is fresh said Fleda smiling The doctor was turning over great volumes one after another in a delightful confusion of business When do you think you shall go north uncle Orrin North said he what do you want to know about the north You said you know sir that you would go a little out of your way to leave me at home I won t go out of my way for anybody If I leave you there it will be in my way Why you are not getting homesick No sir not exactly but I think I will go with you when you go That won t be yet awhile I thought those people wanted you to stay till January Ay but suppose I want to do something else He looked at her with a comical kind of indecision and said You don t know what you want I thought when you came in you needn t go further than the glass to see something fresh but I believe the sea breezes haven t had enough of you yet Which part of you wants freshening he said in his mock fierce way Fleda laughed and said she didn t know Out of humour I guess said the doctor I ll talk to you Take this and amuse yourself awhile with something that isn t fresh till I get through and then you shall go home with me Fleda carried the large volume into one of the reading rooms where there was nobody and sat down at the baize covered table But the book was not of the right kind or her mood was notfor it failed to interest her She sat nonchalantly turning over the leaves but mentally she was busy turning over other leaves which had by far the most of her attention The pages that memory read the record of the old times passed in that very room and the old childish light hearted feelings that were she thought as much beyond recall Those pleasant times when the world was all bright and friends all fair and the light heart had never been borne down by the pressure of care nor sobered by disappointment nor chilled by experience The spirit will not spring elastic again from under that weight and the flower that has closed upon its own sweetness will not open a second time to the world s breath Thoughtfully softly she was touching and feeling of the bands that years had fastened about her heart they would not be undone though so quietly and almost stealthily they had been bound there She was remembering the shadows that one after another had been cast upon her life till now one soft veil of a cloud covered the whole no storm cloud certainly but also there was nothing left of the glad sunlight that her young eyes rejoiced in At Queechy the first shadow had fallen it was a good while before the next one but then they came thick There was the loss of some old comforts and advantages that could have been borne then consequent upon that the annoyances and difficulties that had wrought such a change in her uncle till Fleda could hardly look back and believe that he was the same person Once manly frank busy happy and making his family so now reserved gloomy irritable unfaithful to his duty and selfishly throwing down the burden they must take up but were far less able to bear And so Hugh was changed too not in loveliness of character and demeanour nor even much in the always gentle and tender expression of countenance but the animal spirits and frame that should have had all the strong cherishing and bracing that affection and wisdom together could have applied had been left to wear themselves out under trials his father had shrunk from and other trials his father had made And missus Rossitur it was hard for Fleda to remember the face she wore at Paris the bright eye and joyous corners of the mouth that now were so utterly changed All by his fault that made it so hard to bear Fleda had thought all this a hundred times she went over it now as one looks at a thing one is well accustomed to not with new sorrow only in a subdued mood of mind just fit to make the most of it The familiar place took her back to the time when it became familiar she compared herself sitting there and feeling the whole world a blank except for the two or three at home with the child who had sat there years before in that happy time when the feelings were young and the world was new Then the Evelyns why should they trouble one so inoffensive and so easily troubled as her poor little self They did not know all they were doing but if they had eyes they must see a little of it Why could she not have been allowed to keep her old free simple feeling with everybody instead of being hampered and constrained and miserable from this pertinacious putting of thoughts in her head that ought not to be there It had made her unlike herself she knew in the company of several people And perhaps they might be sharp sighted enough to read it but even if not how it had hindered her enjoyment She had taken so much pleasure in the Evelyns last year and in her visit well she would go home and forget it and maybe they would come to their right minds by the next time she saw them Illustration Fleda saw with a start that it was mister Carleton What pleasant times we used to have here once uncle Orrin she said with half a sigh the other half quite made up by the tone in which she spoke But it was not as she thought uncle Orrin that was standing by her side and looking up as she finished speaking Fleda saw with a start that it was mister Carleton There was such a degree of life and pleasantness in his eyes that in spite of the start her own quite brightened That is a pleasure one may always command he said answering part of her speech Ay provided one has one s mind always under command said Fleda It is possible to sit down to a feast with a want of appetite In such a case what is the best tonic His manner even in those two minutes had put Fleda perfectly at her ease ill bred eyes and ears being absent She looked up and answered with such entire trust in him as made her forget that she had ever had any cause to distrust herself For me she said as a general rule nothing is better than to go out of doors into the woods or the garden they are the best fresheners I know of I can do myself good there at times when books are a nuisance You are not changed from your old self he said The wish was strong upon Fleda to know whether he was but it was not till she saw the answer in his face that she knew how plainly hers had asked the question And then she was so confused that she did not know what the answer had been I find it so too he said The influences of pure nature are the best thing I know for some moods after the company of a good horse And you on his back I suppose That was my meaning What is the doubt thereupon said he laughing Did I express any doubt Or my eyes were mistaken I remember they never used to be that said Fleda What was it Why said Fleda thinking that mister Carleton had probably retained more than one of his old habits for she was answering with her old obedience I was doubting what the influence is in that case worth analyzing I think I am afraid the good horse s company has little to do with it What then do you suppose said he smiling Why said Fleda it might be but I beg your pardon mister Carleton I am astonished at my own presumption Go on and let me know why he said with that happiness of manner which was never resisted Fleda went on reassuring her courage now and then with a glance The relief might spring sir from the gratification of a proud feeling of independence or from a dignified sense of isolation or an imaginary riding down of opposition or the consciousness of being master of what you have in hand She would have added to the general category the running away from oneself but the eye and bearing of the person before her forbade even such a thought as connected with him He laughed but shook his head Perhaps then said Fleda it may be nothing worse than the working off of a surplus of energy or impatience that leaves behind no more than can be managed You have learned something of human nature since I had the pleasure of knowing you he said with a look at once amused and penetrating I wish I hadn t said Fleda Her countenance absolutely fell I sometimes think said he turning over the leaves of her book that these are the best companionship one can have the world at large is very unsatisfactory O how much said Fleda with a long breath The only pleasant thing that my eyes rested upon as I came through the streets this afternoon was a huge bunch of violets that somebody was carrying I walked behind them as long as I could Is your old love for Queechy in full force said mister Carleton still turning over the leaves and smiling I believe so I should be very sorry to live here long at home I can always go out and find society that refreshes me You have set yourself a high standard he said with no displeased expression of the lips I have been charged with that said Fleda but is it possible to set too high a standard mister Carleton One may leave oneself almost alone in the world Well even then said Fleda I would rather have only the image of excellence than be contented with inferiority Isn t it possible to do both said he smiling again I don t know said Fleda perhaps I am too easily dissatisfied I believe I have grown fastidious living alone I have sometimes almost a disgust at the world and everything in it I have often felt so he said but I am not sure that it is a mood to be indulged in likely to further our own good or that of others I am sure it is not said Fleda I often feel vexed with myself for it but what can one do mister Carleton Don t your friends the flowers help you in this Not a bit said Fleda they draw the other way their society is so very pure and satisfying that one is all the less inclined to take up with the other She could not quite tell what to make of the smile with which he began to speak it half abashed her When I spoke a little while ago said he of the best cure for an ill mood I was speaking of secondary means simply the only really humanizing rectifying peace giving thing I ever tried was looking at time in the light of eternity and shaming or melting my coldness away in the rays of the Sun of righteousness Fleda s eyes which had fallen on her book were raised again with such a flash of feeling that it quite prevented her seeing what was in his But the feeling was a little too strong the eyes went down lower than ever and the features shewed that the utmost efforts of self command were needed to control them There is no other cure he went on in the same tone but disgust and weariness and selfishness shrink away and hide themselves before a word or a look of the Redeemer of men When we hear him say I have bought thee thou art mine it is like one of those old words of healing Thou art loosed from thine infirmity Be thou clean and the mind takes sweetly the grace and the command together That he who loveth God love his brother also Only the preparation of the gospel of peace can make our feet go softly over the roughness of the way Fleda did not move unless her twinkling eyelashes might seem to contradict that I need not tell you mister Carleton went on a little lower where this medicine is to be sought It is strange said Fleda presently how well one may know and how well one may forget But I think the body has a great deal to do with it sometimes these states of feeling I mean No doubt it has and in these cases the cure is a more complicated matter I should think the roses would be useful there Fleda s mind was crossed by an indistinct vision of peas asparagus and sweet corn she said nothing An indirect remedy is sometimes the very best that can be employed However it is always true that the more our eyes are fixed upon the source of light the less we notice the shadows that things we are passing fling across our way Fleda did not know how to talk for a little while she was too happy Whatever kept mister Carleton from talking he was silent also Perhaps it was the understanding of her mood mister Carleton said Fleda after a little time did you ever carry out that plan of a rose garden that you were talking of a long while ago You remember it said he with a pleased look Yes that was one of the first things I set about after I went home but I did not follow the regular fashion of arrangement that one of your friends is so fond of I should not like that for anything said Fleda and least of all for roses Do you remember the little shrubbery path that opened just in front of the library windows leading at the distance of half a mile to a long narrow winding glen Perfectly well said Fleda through the wood of evergreens I remember the glen very well About half way from the house said he smiling at her eyes a glade opens which merges at last in the head of the glen I planted my roses there the circumstances of the ground were very happy for disposing them according to my wish And how far The roses O all the way and some distance down the glen Not a continuous thicket of them he added smiling again I wished each kind to stand so that its peculiar beauty should be fully relieved and appreciated and that would have been lost in a crowd Yes I know it said Fleda one s eye rests upon the chief objects of attraction and the others are hardly seen they do not even serve as foils And they must shew beautifully against that dark background of firs and larches Yes and the windings of the ground gave me every sort of situation and exposure I wanted room too for the different effects of masses of the same kind growing together and of fine individuals or groups standing alone where they could shew the full graceful development of their nature What a pleasure What a beauty it must be The ground is very happy many varieties of soil and exposure were needed for the plants of different habits and I found or made them all The rocky beginnings of the glen even furnished me with south walls for the little tea roses and the Macartneys and Musk roses the Banksias I kept nearer home Do you know them all mister Carleton Not quite said he smiling at her I have seen one Banksia the Macartney is a name that tells me nothing They are evergreens with large white flowers very abundant and late in the season but they need the shelter of a wall with us I should think you would say with me said Fleda I cannot conceive that the head quarters of the Rose tribe should be anywhere else One of the queens of the tribe is there in the neighbourhood of the Macartneys the difficult Rosa sulphurea it finds itself so well accommodated that it condescends to play its part to perfection Do you know that Not at all It is one of the most beautiful of all though not my favourite it has large double yellow flowers shaped like the Provence very superb but as wilful as any queen of them all Which is your favourite mister Carleton Not that which shews itself most splendid to the eye but which offers fairest indications to the fancy Fleda looked a little wistfully for there was a smile rather of the eye than of the lips which said there was a hidden thought beneath Don t you assign characters to your flowers said he gravely Always That Rosa sulphurea is a haughty high bred beauty that disdains even to shew herself beautiful unless she is pleased I love better what comes nearer home to the charities and wants of everyday life He had not answered her Fleda knew she thought of what he had said to missus Evelyn about liking beauty but not beauties Then said he smiling again in that hidden way the head of the glen gave me the soil I needed for the Bourbons and French roses Bourbons said Fleda Those are exceeding fine a hybrid between the Chinese and the Rose a quatre saisons I have not confined them all to the head of the glen many of them are in richer soil grafted on standards I like standard roses said Fleda better than any Not better than climbers Better than any climbers I ever saw except the Banksia There is hardly a more elegant variety than that though it is not strictly a climber and indeed when I spoke I was thinking as much of the training roses Many of the Noisettes are very fine But I have the climbers all over in some parts nothing else where the wood closes in upon the path there the evergreen roses or the Ayrshire cover the ground under the trees or are trained up the trunks and allowed to find their own way through the branches down again the Multiflora in the same manner I have made the Boursault cover some unsightly rocks that were in my way Then in wider parts of the glade nearer home are your favourite standards the Damask and Provence and Moss which you know are varieties of the Centifolia and the Noisette standards some of them are very fine and the Chinese roses and countless hybrids and varieties of all these with many Bourbons and your beautiful American yellow rose and the Austrian briar and Eglantine and the Scotch and white and Dog roses in their innumerable varieties change admirably well with the others and relieve the eye very happily Relieve the eye said Fleda my imagination wants relieving Isn t there I have a fancy that there is a view of the sea from some parts of that walk mister Carleton Yes you have a good memory said he smiling On one side the wood is rather dense and in some parts of the other side but elsewhere the trees are thinned off towards the south west and in one or two points the descent of the ground and some cutting have given free access to the air and free range to the eye bounded only by the sea line in the distance if indeed that can be said to bound anything I haven t seen it since I was a child said Fleda And for how long a time in the year is this literally a garden of roses mister Carleton The perpetual roses are in bloom for eight months the Damask and the Chinese and some of their varieties the Provence roses are in blossom all the summer Ah we can do nothing like that in this country said Fleda shaking her head our winters are unmanageable She was silent a minute turning over the leaves of her book in an abstracted manner You have struck out upon a grave path of reflection said mister Carleton gently and left me bewildered among the roses I was thinking said Fleda looking up and laughing I was moralizing to myself upon the curious equalization of happiness in the world I just sheered off from a feeling of envy and comfortably reflected that one measures happiness by what one knows not by what one does not know and so that in all probability I have had near as much enjoyment in the little number of plants that I have brought up and cherished and know intimately as you sir in your superb walk through fairyland Do you suppose said he laughing that I leave the whole care of fairyland to my gardener No you are mistaken when the roses are to act as my correctors I find I must become theirs I seldom go among them without a pruning knife and never without wishing for one And you are certainly right so far that the plants on which I bestow most pains give me the most pleasure There are some that no hand but mine ever touches and those are by far the best loved of my eye A discussion followed partly natural partly moral on the manner of pruning various roses and on the curious connection between care and complacency and the philosophy of the same The rules of the library are to shut up at sundown sir said one of the bookmen who had come into the room Sundown exclaimed Fleda jumping up is my uncle not here mister Frost He has been gone half an hour ma am And I was to have gone home with him I have forgotten myself If that is at all the fault of my roses said mister Carleton smiling I will do my best to repair it I am not disposed to call it a fault said Fleda tying her bonnet strings it is rather an agreeable thing once in a while I shall dream of those roses mister Carleton That would be doing them too much honour Very happily she had forgotten herself and during all the walk home her mind was too full of one great piece of joy and indeed too much engaged with conversation to take up her own subject again Her only wish was that they might not meet any of the Evelyns mister Thorn whom they did meet was a matter of entire indifference The door was opened by doctor Gregory himself To Fleda s utter astonishment mister Carleton accepted his invitation to come in She went up stairs to take off her things in a kind of maze I thought he would go away without my seeing him and now what a nice time I have had in spite of missus Evelyn That thought slipped in without Fleda s knowledge but she could not get it out again I don t know how much it has been her fault either but one thing is certain I never could have had it at her house How very glad I am How very glad I am that I have seen him and heard all this from his own lips But how very funny that he will be here to tea Well said the doctor when she came down you do look freshened up I declare Here is this girl sir was coming to me a little while ago complaining that she wanted something fresh and begging me to take her back to Queechy forsooth to find it with two feet of snow on the ground Who wants to see you at Queechy he said facing round upon her with a look half fierce half quizzical Fleda laughed but was vexed to feel that she could not help colouring and colouring exceedingly partly from the consciousness of his meaning and partly from a vague notion that somebody else was conscious of it too doctor Gregory however dashed right off into the thick of conversation with his guest and kept him busily engaged till tea time Fleda sat still on the sofa looking and listening with simple pleasure memory served her up a rich entertainment enough Yet she thought her uncle was the most heartily interested of the two in the conversation there was a shade more upon mister Carleton not than he often wore but than he had worn a little while ago doctor Gregory was a great bibliopole and in the course of the hour hauled out and made his guest overhaul no less than several musty old folios and Fleda could not help fancying that he did it with an access of gravity greater even than the occasion called for The grace of his manner however was unaltered and at tea she did not know whether she had been right or not Demurely as she sat there behind the tea urn for doctor Gregory still engrossed all the attention of his guest as far as talking was concerned Fleda was again inwardly smiling to herself at the oddity and the pleasantness of the chance that had brought those three together in such a quiet way after all the weeks she had been seeing mister Carleton at a distance And she enjoyed the conversation too for though doctor Gregory was a little fond of his hobby it was still conversation worthy the name I have been so unfortunate in the matter of the drives mister Carleton said when he was about to take leave and standing before Fleda that I am half afraid to mention it again I could not help it both those time mister Carleton said Fleda earnestly Both the last or both the first said he smiling The last said Fleda I have had the honour of making such an attempt twice within the last ten days to my disappointment It was not by my fault then either sir Fleda said quietly But he knew very well from the expression of her face a moment before where to put the emphasis her tongue would not make Dare I ask you to go with me to morrow I don t know said Fleda with the old childish sparkle of her eye but if you ask me sir I will go He sat down beside her immediately and Fleda knew by his change of eye that her former thought had been right Shall I see you at missus Decatur s to morrow No sir I thought I understood said he in an explanatory tone from your friends the Miss Evelyns that they were going I believe they are and I did think of it but I have changed my mind and shall stay at home with missus Evelyn After some further conversation the hour for the drive was appointed and mister Carleton took leave Come for me twice and missus Evelyn refused without consulting me thought Fleda What could make her do so How very rude he must have thought me And how glad I am I have had an opportunity of setting that right So quitting missus Evelyn her thoughts went off upon a long train of wandering over the afternoon s talk Wake up said the doctor laying his hand kindly upon her shoulder you ll want something fresh again presently What mine of profundity are you digging into now Fleda looked up and came back from her profundity with a glance and smile as simple as a child s Dear uncle Orrin how came you to leave me alone in the library Was that what you were trying to discover Oh no sir But why did you uncle Orrin I might have been left utterly alone Why said the doctor I was going out and a friend that I thought I could confide in promised to take care of you A friend Nobody came near me said Fleda Then I ll never trust anybody again said the doctor But what were you hammering at mentally just now come you shall tell me O nothing uncle Orrin said Fleda looking grave again however I was thinking that I had been talking too much to day Talking too much why whom have you been talking to O nobody but mister Carleton mister Carleton why you didn t say six and a quarter words while he was here No but I mean in the library and walking home Talking too much I guess you did said the doctor your tongue is like the music of the spheres So loud it deafens human ears How came you to talk too much I thought you were too shy to talk at all in company No sir I am not I am not at all shy unless people frighten me It takes almost nothing to do that but I am very bold if I am not frightened Were you frightened this afternoon No sir Well if you weren t frightened I guess nobody else was said the doctor Chapter XXXVI Whence came this This is some token from a newer friend Shakspeare The snow flakes were falling softly and thick when Fleda got up the next morning No ride for me to day but how very glad I am that I had a chance of setting that matter right What could missus Evelyn have been thinking of Very false kindness if I had disliked to go ever so much she ought to have made me for my own sake rather than let me seem so rude it is true she didn t know how rude O snow flakes how much purer and prettier you are than most things in this place No one was in the breakfast parlour when Fleda came down so she took her book and the dormeuse and had an hour of luxurious quiet before anybody appeared Not a foot fall in the house nor even one outside to be heard for the soft carpeting of snow which was laid over the streets The gentle breathing of the fire the only sound in the room while the very light came subdued through the falling snow and the thin muslin curtains and gave an air of softer luxury to the apartment Money is pleasant thought Fleda as she took a little complacent review of all this before opening her book And yet how unspeakably happier one may be without it than another with it Happiness never was locked up in a purse yet I am sure Hugh and I They must want me at home There was a little sober consideration of the lumps of coal and the contented looking blaze in the grate a most essentially home like thing and then Fleda went to her book and for the space of an hour turned over her pages without interruption At the end of the hour the fowling piece certainly the noiseliest of his kind put his head in but seeing none of his ladies took it and himself away again and left Fleda in peace for another half hour Then appeared missus Evelyn in her morning wrapper and only stopping at the bell handle came up to the dormeuse and stooping down kissed Fleda s forehead with so much tenderness that it won a look of most affectionate gratitude in reply Fleda my dear we set you a sad example But you won t copy it Joe breakfast Has mister Evelyn gone down town Yes ma am two hours ago Did it ever occur to you Fleda my dear said missus Evelyn breaking the lumps of coal with the poker in a very leisurely satisfied kind of a way Did it ever occur to you to rejoice that you were not born a business man What a life I wonder how it compares with that of a business woman said Fleda laughing There is an uncompromising old proverb which says Man s work is from sun to sun But a woman s work is never done A saying which she instantly reflected was entirely beyond the comprehension of the person to whose consideration she had offered it And then came in Florence rubbing her hands and knitting her eyebrows Why don t you look as bright as the rest of the world this morning said Fleda What a wretched storm Wretched This beautiful snow Here have I been enjoying it for this hour But Florence rubbed her hands and looked as if Fleda were no rule for other people How horrid it will make the going out to night if it snows all day Then you can stay at home said her mother composedly Indeed I shall not mamma Mamma said Constance now coming in with Edith isn t breakfast ready It strikes me that the fowling piece wants polishing up I have an indistinct impression that the sun would be upon the meridian if he was anywhere Not quite so bad as that said Fleda smiling it is only an hour and a half since I came down stairs You horrid little creature Mamma I consider it an act of inhospitality to permit studious habits on the part of your guests And I am surprised your ordinary sagacity has not discovered that it is the greatest impolicy towards the objects of your maternal care We are labouring under growing disadvantages for when we have brought the enemy to at long shot there is a mean little craft that comes in and unmans him in a close fight before we can get our speaking trumpets up Constance Do hush said her sister You are too absurd Fact said Constance gravely captain Lewiston was telling me the other night how the thing is managed and I recognized it immediately and told him I had often seen it done Hold your tongue Constance said her mother smiling and come to breakfast Half and but half of the mandate the young lady had any idea of obeying I can t imagine what you are talking about Constance said Edith And then being a friend you see pursued Constance we can do nothing but fire a salute instead of demolishing her Can t you said Fleda I am sure many a time I have felt as if you had left me nothing but my colours Except your prizes my dear I am sure I don t know about your being a friend either for I have observed that you engage English and American alike She is getting up her colours now said missus Evelyn in mock gravity you can tell what she is Blood red said Constance A pirate I thought so she exclaimed with an ecstatic gesture I shall make it my business to warn everybody Oh Constance said Fleda burying her face in her hands But they all laughed Fleda my dear I would box her ears said missus Evelyn commanding herself It is a mere envious insinuation I have always understood those were the most successful colours carried Dear missus Evelyn My dear Fleda that is not a hot roll you sha n t eat it Take this Florence give her a piece of the bacon Fleda my dear it is good for the digestion you must try it Constance was quite mistaken in supposing yours were those obnoxious colours there is too much white with the red it is more like a very different flag Like what then mamma said Constance a good American would have blue in it You may keep the American yourself said her mother Only said Fleda trying to recover herself there is a slight irregularity with you the stars are blue and the ground white My dear little Fleda exclaimed Constance jumping up and capering round the table to kiss her you are too delicious for anything and in future I will be blind to your colours which is a piece of self denial I am sure nobody else will practise Mamma said Edith what are you all talking about Can t Constance sit down and let Fleda eat her breakfast Sit down Constance and eat your breakfast I will do it mamma out of consideration for the bacon Nothing else would move me Are you going to missus Decatur s to night Fleda No Edith I believe not I m very glad then there ll be somebody at home But why don t you I think on the whole I had rather not Mamma said Constance you have done very wrong in permitting such a thing I know just how it will be mister Thorn and mister Stackpole will make indefinite voyages of discovery round missus Decatur s rooms and then having a glimmering perception that the light of Miss Ringgan s eyes is in another direction they will sheer off and you will presently see them come sailing blandly in one after the other and cast anchor for the evening when to your extreme delight mister Stackpole and Miss Ringgan will immediately commence fighting I shall stay at home to see exclaimed Constance with little bounds of delight up and down upon her chair which this time afforded her the additional elasticity of springs I will not go I am persuaded how it will be and I would not miss it for anything Dear Constance said Fleda unable to help laughing through all her vexation please do not talk so You know very well mister Stackpole only comes to see your mother He was here last night said Constance in an extreme state of delight with all the rest of your admirers ranged in the hall with their hats in a pile at the foot of the staircase as a token of their determination not to go till you came home and as they could not be induced to come up to the drawing room mister Evelyn was obliged to go down and with some difficulty persuaded them to disperse Fleda was by this time in a state of indecision betwixt crying and laughing assiduously attentive to her breakfast mister Carleton asked me if you would go to ride with him again the other day Fleda said missus Evelyn with her face of delighted mischief and I excused you for I thought you would thank me for it Mamma said Constance the mention of that name rouses all the bitter feelings I am capable of My dear Fleda we have been friends but if I see you abstracting my English rose Look at those roses behind you said Fleda The young lady turned and sprang at the word followed by both her sisters and for some moments nothing but a hubbub of exclamations filled the air Joe you are enchanting But did you ever see such flowers Oh those rose buds And these Camellias said Edith look Florence how they are cut with such splendid long stems And the roses too all of them see mamma just cut from the bushes with the buds all left on and immensely long stems Mamma these must have cost an immensity That is what I call a bouquet said Fleda fain to leave the table too and draw near the tempting shew in Florence s hand This is the handsomest you have had all winter Florence said Edith Handsomest I never saw anything like it I shall wear some of these to night mamma You are in a great hurry to appropriate it said Constance how do you know but it is mine Which of us is it for Joe Say it is mine Joe and I will vote you the best article of your kind said Constance with an inexpressible glance at Fleda Who brought it Joe said missus Evelyn Yes Joe who brought it where did it come from Joe Joe had hardly a chance to answer I really couldn t say Miss Florence the man wasn t known to me But did he say it was for Florence or for me No ma am he Which did he say it was for He didn t say it was either for Miss Florence or for you Miss Constance he But didn t he say who sent it No ma am It s Mamma here is a white moss that is beyond everything with two of the most lovely buds Oh said Constance clasping her hands and whirling about the room in comic ecstasy I sha n t survive if I cannot find out where it is from How delicious the scent of these tea roses is said Fleda You ought not to mind the snow storm to day after this Florence I should think you would be perfectly happy I shall be if I can contrive to keep them fresh to wear to night Mamma how sweetly they would dress me They re a great deal too good to be wasted so said missus Evelyn I sha n t let you do it Mamma it wouldn t take any of them at all for my hair and the bouquet de corsage too there d be thousands left Well Joe what are you waiting for I didn t say said Joe looking a good deal blank and a little afraid I should have said that the bouquet is What is it It is I believe ma am the man said it was for Miss Ringgan For me exclaimed Fleda her cheeks forming instantly the most exquisite commentary on the gift that the giver could have desired She took in her hand the superb bunch of flowers from which the fingers of Florence unclosed as if it had been an icicle Why didn t you say so before she inquired sharply but the fowling piece had wisely disappeared I am very glad exclaimed Edith They have had plenty all winter and you haven t had one I am very glad it is yours Fleda But such a shadow had come upon every other face that Fleda s pleasure was completely overclouded She smelled at her roses just ready to burst into tears and wishing sincerely that they had never come I am afraid my dear Fleda said missus Evelyn quietly going on with her breakfast that there is a thorn somewhere among those flowers Fleda was too sure of it But not by any means the one missus Evelyn intended He never could have got half those from his own greenhouse mamma said Florence if he had cut every rose that was in it and he isn t very free with his knife either I said nothing about anybody s greenhouse said missus Evelyn though I don t suppose there is more than one Lot in the city they could have come from Well said Constance settling herself back in her chair and closing her eyes I feel extinguished Mamma do you suppose it possible that a hot cup of tea might revive me I am suffering from a universal sense of unappreciated merit and nobody can tell what the pain is that hasn t felt it I think you are extremely foolish Constance said Edith Fleda hasn t had a single flower sent her since she has been here and you have had them every other day I think Florence is the only one that has a right to be disappointed Dear Florence said Fleda earnestly you shall have as many of them as you please to dress yourself and welcome Oh no of course not Florence said it s of no sort of consequence I don t want them in the least my dear I wonder what somebody would think to see his flowers in my head Fleda secretly had mooted the same question and was very well pleased not to have it put to the proof She took the flowers up stairs after breakfast resolving that they should not be an eye sore to her friends placed them in water and sat down to enjoy and muse over them in a very sorrowful mood She again thought she would take the first opportunity of going home How strange out of their abundance of tributary flowers to grudge her this one bunch To be sure it was a magnificent one The flowers were mostly roses of the rarer kinds with a very few fine Camellias all of them cut with a freedom that evidently had known no constraint but that of taste and put together with an exquisite skill that Fleda felt sure was never possessed by any gardener She knew that only one hand had had anything to do with them and that the hand that had bought not the one that had sold and How very kind presently quite supplanted How very strange How exactly like him and how singular that missus Evelyn and her daughters should have supposed they could have come from mister Thorn It was a moral impossibility that he should have put such a bunch of flowers together while to Fleda s eye they so bore the impress of another person s character that she had absolutely been glad to get them out of sight for fear they might betray him She hung over their varied loveliness tasted and studied it till the soft breath of the roses had wafted away every cloud of disagreeable feeling and she was drinking in pure and strong pleasure from each leaf and bud What a very apt emblem of kindness and friendship she thought them when their gentle preaching and silent sympathy could alone so nearly do friendship s work for to Fleda there was both counsel and consolation in flowers So she found it this morning An hour s talk with them had done her a great deal of good and when she dressed herself and went down to the drawing room her grave little face was not less placid than the roses she had left she would not wear even one of them down to be a disagreeable reminder And she thought that still snowy day was one of the very pleasantest she had had in New York Florence went to missus Decatur s but Constance according to her avowed determination remained at home to see the fun Fleda hoped most sincerely there would be none for her to see But a good deal to her astonishment early in the evening mister Carleton walked in followed very soon by mister Thorn Constance and missus Evelyn were forthwith in a perfect effervescence of delight which as they could not very well give it full play promised to last the evening and Fleda all her nervous trembling awakened again took her work to the table and endeavoured to bury herself in it But ears could not be fastened as well as eyes and the mere sound of missus Evelyn s voice sometimes sent a thrill over her mister Thorn said the lady in her smoothest manner are you a lover of floriculture sir Can t say that I am missus Evelyn except as practised by others Then you are not a connoisseur in roses Miss Ringgan s happy lot sent her a most exquisite collection this morning and she has been wanting to apply to somebody who could tell her what they are I thought you might know O they are not here said missus Evelyn as she noticed the gentleman s look round the room Miss Ringgan judges them too precious for any eyes but her own Fleda my dear won t you bring down your roses to let mister Thorn tell us their names I am sure mister Thorn will excuse me missus Evelyn I believe he would find it a puzzling task The surest way missus Evelyn would be to apply at the fountain head for information said Thorn dryly If I could get at it said missus Evelyn Fleda knew with quivering lips but it seems to me I might as well try to find the Dead Sea Perhaps mister Carleton might serve your purpose said Thorn That gentleman was at the moment talking to Constance mister Carleton said missus Evelyn are you a judge sir Of what missus Evelyn I beg your pardon The lady s tone somewhat lowered Are you a judge of roses mister Carleton So far as to know a rose when I see it he answered smiling and with an imperturbable coolness that it quieted Fleda to hear Illustration I am sure mister Thorn will excuse me Ay but the thing is said Constance do you know twenty roses when you see them Miss Ringgan mister Carleton said missus Evelyn has received a most beautiful supply this morning but like a true woman she is not satisfied to enjoy unless she can enjoy intelligently they are strangers to us all and she would like to know what name to give them mister Thorn suggested that perhaps you might help us out of our difficulty With great pleasure so far as I am able if my judgment may be exercised by daylight I cannot answer for shades of green in the night time But he spoke with an ease and simplicity that left no mortal able to guess whether he had ever heard of a particular bunch of roses in his life before You give me more of Eve in my character missus Evelyn than I think belongs to me said Fleda from her work at the far centre table which certainly did not get its name from its place in the room My enjoyment to day has not been in the least troubled by curiosity Which none of the rest of the family could have affirmed Do you mean to say mister Carleton said Constance that it is necessary to distinguish between shades of green in judging of roses It is necessary to make shades of distinction in judging of almost anything Miss Constance The difference between varieties of the same flower is often extremely nice I have read of magicians said Thorn softly bending down towards Fleda s work who did not need to see things to answer questions respecting them Fleda thought that was a kind of magic remarkably common in the world but even her displeasure could not give her courage to speak It gave her courage to be silent however and mister Thorn s best efforts in a conversation of some length could gain nothing but very uninterested rejoinders A sudden pinch from Constance then made her look up and almost destroyed her self possession as she saw mister Stackpole make his way into the room I hope I find my fair enemy in a mollified humour he said approaching them I suppose you have repaired damages mister Stackpole said Constance since you venture into the region of broken windows again mister Stackpole declared there were none to repair said missus Evelyn from the sofa More than I knew of said the gentleman laughing there were more than I knew of but you see I court the danger having rashly concluded that I might as well know all my weak points at once Miss Ringgan will break nothing to night mister Stackpole she promised me she would not Not even her silence said the gentleman Is she always so desperately industrious said mister Thorn Miss Ringgan mister Stackpole said Constance is subject to occasional fits of misanthropy in which cases her retreating with her work to the solitude of the centre table is significant of her desire to avoid conversation as mister Thorn has been experiencing I am happy to see that the malady is not catching Miss Constance mister Stackpole said Constance I am in a morose state of mind Miss Ringgan this morning received a magnificent bouquet of roses which in the first place I rashly appropriated to myself and ever since I discovered my mistake I have been meditating the renouncing of society it has excited more bad feelings than I thought had existence in my nature mister Stackpole said missus Evelyn would you ever have supposed that roses could be a cause of discord mister Stackpole looked as if he did not exactly know what the ladies were driving at There have five thousand emigrants arrived at this port within a week said he as if that were something worth talking about Poor creatures where will they all go said missus Evelyn comfortably Country s large enough said Thorn Yes but such a stream of immigration will reach the Pacific and come back again before long and then there will be a meeting of the waters This tide of German and Irish will sweep over everything I suppose if the land will not bear both one party will have to seek other quarters said missus Evelyn with an exquisite satisfaction which Fleda could hear in her voice You remember the story of Lot and Abraham mister Stackpole when a quarrel arose between them not about roses mister Stackpole looked as if women were to say the least incomprehensible Five thousand a week he repeated I wish there was a Dead Sea for them all to sheer off into said Thorn If you had seen the look of grave rebuke that speech called forth mister Thorn said Constance your feelings would have been penetrated if you have any I had forgotten he said looking round with a bland change of manner what gentle charities were so near me Mamma said Constance with a most comic shew of indignation mister Thorn thought that with Miss Ringgan he had forgotten all the gentle charities in the room I am of no further use to society I will trouble you to ring that bell mister Thorn if you please I shall request candles and retire to the privacy of my own apartment Not till you have permitted me to expiate my fault said mister Thorn laughing It cannot be expiated My worth will be known at some future day mister Carleton will you have the goodness to summon our domestic attendant If you will permit me to give the order he said smiling with his hand on the bell I am afraid you are hardly fit to be trusted alone Why May I delay obeying you long enough to give my reasons Yes Because said he coming up to her when people turn away from the world in disgust they generally find worse company in themselves mister Carleton I would not sit still another minute if curiosity didn t keep me I thought solitude was said to be such a corrector Like a clear atmosphere an excellent medium if your object is to take an observation of your position worse than lost if you mean to shut up the windows and burn sickly lights of your own Then according to that one shouldn t seek solitude unless one doesn t want it No said mister Carleton with that eye of deep meaning to which Constance always rendered involuntary homage every one wants it if we do not daily take an observation to find where we are we are sailing about wildly and do not know whither we are going An observation said Constance understanding part and impatient of not catching the whole of his meaning Yes he said with a smile of singular fascination I mean consulting the unerring guides of the way to know where we are and if we are sailing safely and happily in the right direction otherwise we are in danger of striking upon some rock or of never making the harbour and in either case all is lost The power of eye and smile was too much for Constance as it had happened more than once before her own eyes fell and for a moment she wore a look of unwonted sadness and sweetness at what from any other person would have roused her mockery mister Carleton said she trying to rally herself but still not daring to look up knowing that would put it out of her power I can t understand how you ever came to be such a grave person What is your idea of gravity said he smiling To have a mind so at rest about the future as to be able to enjoy thoroughly all that is worth enjoying in the present But I can t imagine how you ever came to take up such notions May I ask again why not I O you know you have so much to make you otherwise What degree of present contentment ought to make one satisfied to leave that of the limitless future an uncertain thing Do you think it can be made certain Undoubtedly why not the tickets are free the only thing is to make sure that ours has the true signature Do you think the possession of that ticket makes life a sadder thing The very handwriting of it is more precious to me by far Miss Constance than everything else I have But you are a very uncommon instance said Constance still unable to look up and speaking without any of her usual attempt at jocularity No I hope not he said quietly I mean said Constance that it is very uncommon language to hear from a person like you I suppose I know your meaning he said after a minute s pause but Miss Constance there is hardly a graver thought to me than that power and responsibility go hand in hand It don t generally work so said Constance rather uneasily What are you talking about Constance said missus Evelyn mister Carleton mamma has been making me melancholy mister Carleton said missus Evelyn I am going to petition that you will turn your efforts in another direction I have felt oppressed all the afternoon from the effects of that funeral service I was attending I am only just getting over it The preacher seemed to delight in putting together all the gloomy thoughts he could think of Yes said mister Stackpole putting his hands in his pockets it is the particular enjoyment of some of them I believe to do their best to make other people miserable mister Thorn said nothing being warned by the impatient little hammering of Fleda s worsted needle upon the marble while her eye was no longer considering her work and her face rested anxiously upon her hand There wasn t a thing the lady went on in anything he said in his prayer or his speech there wasn t a single cheering or elevating consideration all he talked and prayed for was that the people there might be filled with a sense of their wickedness It s their trade ma am said mister Stackpole it s their trade I wonder if it ever occurs to them to include themselves in that petition There wasn t the slightest effort made in anything he said or prayed for and one would have thought that would have been so natural there was not the least endeavour to do away with that superstitious fear of death which is so common and one would think it was the very occasion to do it he never once asked that we might be led to look upon it rationally and calmly It s so unreasonable mister Stackpole it is so dissonant with our views of a benevolent Supreme Being as if it could be according to his will that his creatures should live lives of tormenting themselves it so shews a want of trust in his goodness It s a relic of barbarism ma am said mister Stackpole it s a popular delusion and it is like to be till you can get men to embrace wider and more liberal views of things What do you suppose it proceeds from said mister Carleton as if the question had just occurred to him I suppose from false notions received from education sir Hardly said mister Carleton it is too universal You find it everywhere and to ascribe it everywhere to education would be but shifting the question back one generation It is a root of barbarous ages said mister Stackpole a piece of superstition handed down from father to son a set of false ideas which men are bred up and almost born with and that they can hardly get rid of How can that be a root of barbarism which the utmost degree of intelligence and cultivation has no power to do away nor even to lessen however it may afford motive to control Men may often put a brave face upon it and shew none of their thoughts to the world but I think no one capable of reflection has not at times felt the influence of that dread Men have often sought death of purpose and choice said mister Stackpole dryly and rubbing his chin Not from the absence of this feeling but from the greater momentary pressure of some other Of course said mister Stackpole rubbing his chin still there is a natural love of life the world could not get on if there was not If the love of life is natural the fear of death must be so by the same reason Undoubtedly said missus Evelyn it is natural it is part of the constitution of our nature Yes said mister Stackpole settling himself again in his chair with his hands in his pockets it is not unnatural I suppose but then that is the first view of the subject it is the business of reason to correct many impressions and prejudices that are as we say natural And there was where my clergyman of to day failed utterly said missus Evelyn he aimed at strengthening that feeling and driving it down as hard as he could into everybody s mind not a single lisp of anything to do it away or lessen the gloom with which we are naturally as you say disposed to invest the subject I dare say he has held it up as a bugbear till it has become one to himself said mister Stackpole It is nothing more than the mere natural dread of dissolution said mister Carleton I think it is that said missus Evelyn I think that is the principal thing Is there not besides an undefined fear of what lies beyond an uneasy misgiving that there may be issues which the spirit is not prepared to meet I suppose there is said missus Evelyn but sir Why that is the very thing said mister Stackpole that is the mischief of education I was speaking of men are brought up to it You cannot dispose of it so sir for this feeling is quite as universal as the other and so strong that men have not only been willing to render life miserable but even to endure death itself with all the aggravation of torture to smooth their way in that unknown region beyond It is one of the maladies of human nature said mister Stackpole that it remains for the progress of enlightened reason to dispel What is the cure for the malady said mister Carleton quietly Why sir the looking upon death as a necessary step in the course of our existence which simply introduces us from a lower to a higher sphere from a comparatively narrow to a wider and nobler range of feeling and intellect Ay but how shall we be sure that it is so Why mister Carleton sir said missus Evelyn do you doubt that Do you suppose it possible for a moment that a benevolent being would make creatures to be anything but happy You believe the Bible missus Evelyn he said smiling slightly Certainly sir but mister Carleton the Bible I am sure holds out the same views of the goodness and glory of the Creator you cannot open it but you find them on every page If I could take such views of things as some people have said missus Evelyn getting up to punch the fire in her extremity I don t know what I should do mister Carleton I think I would rather never have been born sir Every one runs to the Bible said mister Stackpole It is the general armoury and all parties draw from it to fight each other True said mister Carleton but only while they draw partially No man can fight the battle of truth but in the whole panoply and no man so armed can fight any other What do you mean sir I mean that the Bible is not a riddle neither inconsistent with itself but if you take off one leg of a pair of compasses the measuring power is gone But mister Carleton sir said missus Evelyn do you think that reading the Bible is calculated to give one gloomy ideas of the future By no means he said with one of those meaning fraught smiles but is it safe missus Evelyn in such a matter to venture a single grasp of hope without the direct warrant of God s word Well sir Well ma am that says the soul that sinneth it shall die That disposes of the whole matter comfortably at once said mister Stackpole But sir said missus Evelyn that doesn t stand alone the Bible everywhere speaks of the fulness and freeness of Christ s salvation Full and free as it can possibly be he answered with something of a sad expression of countenance but missus Evelyn never offered but with conditions What conditions said mister Stackpole hastily I recommend you to look for them sir answered mister Carleton gravely they should not be unknown to a wise man Then you would leave mankind ridden by this nightmare of fear or what is your remedy There is a remedy sir said mister Carleton with that dilating and darkening eye which shewed him deeply engaged in what he was thinking about it is not mine When men feel themselves lost and are willing to be saved in God s way then the breach is made up then hope can look across the gap and see its best home and its best friend on the other side then faith lays hold on forgiveness and trembling is done then sin being pardoned the sting of death is taken away and the fear of death is no more for it is swallowed up in victory But men will not apply to a physician while they think themselves well and people will not seek the sweet way of safety by Christ till they know there is no other and so do you see missus Evelyn that when the gentleman you were speaking of sought to day to persuade his hearers that they were poorer than they thought they were he was but taking the surest way to bring them to be made richer than they ever dreamed There was a power of gentle earnestness in his eye that missus Evelyn could not answer her look fell as that of Constance had done and there was a moment s silence Thorn had kept quiet for two reasons that he might not displease Fleda and that he might watch her She had left her work and turning half round from the table had listened intently to the conversation towards the last very forgetful that there might be anybody to observe her with eyes fixed and cheeks flushing and the corners of the mouth just indicating delight till the silence fell and then she turned round to the table and took up her worsted work But the lips were quite grave now and Thorn s keen eyes discerned that upon one or two of the artificial roses there lay two or three very natural drops mister Carleton said Edith what makes you talk such sober things you have set Miss Ringgan to crying mister Carleton could not be better pleased than at such a tribute to his eloquence said mister Thorn with a saturnine expression Smiles are common things said mister Stackpole a little maliciously but any man may be flattered to find his words drop diamonds Fleda my dear said missus Evelyn with that trembling tone of concealed ecstasy which always set every one of Fleda s nerves a jarring you may tell the gentlemen that they do not always know when they are making an unfelicitous compliment I never read what poets say about briny drops and salt tears without imagining the heroine immediately to be something like Lot s wife Nobody said anything about briny drops mamma said Edith Why there s Florence Her entrance made a little bustle which Fleda was very glad of Unkind She was trembling again in every finger She bent down over her canvas and worked away as hard as she could That did not hinder her becoming aware presently that mister Carleton was standing close beside her Are you not trying your eyes said he The words were nothing but the tone was a great deal there was a kind of quiet intelligence in it Fleda looked up and something in the clear steady self reliant eye she met wrought an instant change in her feeling She met it a moment and then looked at her work again with nerves quieted Cannot I persuade them to be of my mind said mister Carleton bending down a little nearer to their sphere of action mister Carleton is unreasonable to require more testimony of that this evening said mister Thorn his own must have been ill employed Fleda did not look up but the absolute quietness of mister Carleton s manner could be felt she felt it almost with sympathetic pain Thorn immediately left them and took leave What are you searching for in the papers mister Carleton said missus Evelyn presently coming up to them I was looking for the steamers missus Evelyn How soon do you think of bidding us good bye I do not know ma am he answered coolly I expect my mother missus Evelyn walked back to her sofa But in the space of two minutes she came over to the centre table again with an open magazine in her hand mister Carleton said the lady you must read this for me and tell me what you think of it will you sir I have been shewing it to mister Stackpole and he can t see any beauty in it and I tell him it is his fault and there is some serious want in his composition Now I want to know what you will say to it An arbiter missus Evelyn should be chosen by both parties Read it and tell me what you think repeated the lady walking away to leave him opportunity mister Carleton looked it over That is something pretty he said putting it before Fleda missus Evelyn was still at a distance What do you think of that print for trying the eyes said Fleda laughing as she took it But he noticed that her colour rose a little How do you like it I like it pretty well said Fleda rather hesitatingly You have seen it before Why Fleda said with a look up at him at once a little startled and a little curious what makes you say so Because pardon me you did not read it Oh said Fleda laughing but colouring at the same time very frankly I can tell how I like some things without reading them very carefully mister Carleton looked at her and then took the magazine again What have you there mister Carleton said Florence A piece of English on which I was asking this lady s opinion Miss Evelyn Now mister Carleton exclaimed Constance jumping up I am going to ask you to decide a quarrel between Fleda and me about a point of English Hush Constance said her mother I want to speak to mister Carleton mister Carleton how do you like it Like what mamma said Florence A piece I gave mister Carleton to read mister Carleton tell how you like it sir But what is it mamma A piece of poetry in an old Excelsior The Spirit of the Fireside mister Carleton won t you read it aloud and let us all hear but tell me first what you think of it It has pleased me particularly missus Evelyn mister Stackpole says he does not understand it sir Fanciful said mister Stackpole it s a little fanciful and I can t quite make out what the fancy is It has been the misfortune of many good things before not to be prized mister Stackpole said the lady funnily True ma am said that gentleman rubbing his chin and the converse is also true unfortunately and with a much wider application There is a peculiarity of mental development or training said mister Carleton which must fail of pleasing many minds because of their wanting the corresponding key of nature or experience Some literature has a hidden freemasonry of its own Very hidden indeed said mister Stackpole the cloud is so thick that I can t see the electricity mister Carleton said missus Evelyn laughing I take that remark as a compliment sir I have always appreciated that writer s pieces I enjoy them very much Well won t you please read it mister Carleton said Florence and let us know what we are talking about mister Carleton obeyed standing where he was by the centre table By the old hearthstone a Spirit dwells The child of bygone years He lieth hid the stones amid And liveth on smiles and tears But when the night is drawing on And the fire burns clear and bright He Cometh out and walketh about In the pleasant grave twilight He goeth round on tiptoe soft And scanneth close each face If one in the room be sunk in gloom By him he taketh his place And then with fingers cool and soft Their touch who does not know With water brought from the well of Thought That was dug long years ago He layeth his hand on the weary eyes They are closed and quiet now And he wipeth away the dust of the day Which had settled on the brow And gently then he walketh away And sits in the corner chair And the closed eyes swim it seemeth to him The form that once sat there And whispered words of comfort and love Fall sweet on the ear of sorrow Why weepest thou thou art troubled now But there cometh a bright to morrow We too have passed over life s wild stream In a frail and shattered boat But the pilot was sure and we sailed secure When we seemed but scarce afloat Though tossed by the rage of waves and wind The bark held together still One arm was strong it bore us along And has saved from every ill The Spirit returns to his hiding place But his words have been like balm The big tears start but the fluttering heart Is soothed and softened and calm I remember that said Florence it is beautiful Who s the writer said mister Stackpole I don t know said missus Evelyn it is signed Hugh there have been a good many of his pieces in the Excelsior for a year past and all of them pretty Hugh exclaimed Edith springing forward that s the one that wrote the Chestnuts Fleda won t you read mister Carleton the Chestnuts Why no Edith I think not Ah do I like it so much and I want him to hear it and you know mamma says they re all pretty Won t you My dear Edith you have heard it once already to day But I want you to read it for me again Let me have it Miss Edith said mister Carleton smiling I will read it for you Ah but it would be twice as good if you could hear her read it said Edith fluttering over the leaves of the magazine she reads it so well It s so funny about the coffee and buckwheat cakes What is that Edith said her mother Something mister Carleton is going to read for me mamma Don t you trouble mister Carleton It won t trouble him mamma he promised of his own accord Let us all have the benefit of it mister Carleton said the lady It is worthy of remark that Fleda s politeness utterly deserted her during the reading of both this piece and the last She as near as possible turned her back upon the reader Merrily sang the crickets forth One fair October night And the stars looked down and the northern crown Gave its strange fantastic light A nipping frost was in the air On flowers and grass it fell And the leaves were still on the eastern hill As if touched by a fairy spell To the very top of the tall nut trees The frost king seemed to ride With his wand he stirs the chestnut burs And straight they are opened wide And squirrels and children together dream Of the coming winter s hoard And many I ween are the chestnuts seen In hole or in garret stored The children are sleeping in feather beds Poor Bun in his mossy nest He courts repose with his tail on his nose On the others warm blankets rest Late in the morning the sun gets up From behind the village spire And the children dream that the first red gleam Is the chestnut trees on fire The squirrel had on when he first awoke All the clothing he could command And his breakfast was light he just took a bite Of an acorn that lay at hand And then he was off to the trees to work While the children some time it takes To dress and to eat what they think meet Of coffee and buckwheat cakes The sparkling frost when they first go out Lies thick upon all around And earth and grass as they onward pass Give a pleasant crackling sound O there is a heap of chestnuts see Cried the youngest of the train For they came to a stone where the squirrel had thrown What he meant to pick up again And two bright eyes from the tree o erhead Looked down at the open bag Where the nuts went in and so to begin Almost made his courage flag Away on the hill outside the wood Three giant trees there stand And the chestnuts bright that hang in sight Are eyed by the youthful band And one of their number climbs the tree And passes from bough to bough And the children run for with pelting fun The nuts fall thickly now Some of the burs are still shut tight Some open with chestnuts three And some nuts fall with no burs at all Smooth shiny as nuts should be O who can tell what fun it was To see the prickly shower To feel what a whack on head or back Was within a chestnut s power To run beneath the shaking tree And then to scamper away And with laughing shout to dance about The grass where the chestnuts lay With flowing dresses and blowing hair And eyes that no shadow knew Like the growing light of a morning bright The dawn of the summer blue The work was ended the trees were stripped The children were tired of play And they forgot but the squirrel did not The wrong they had done that day Whether it was from the reader s enjoyment or good giving of these lines or from Edith s delight in them he was frequently interrupted with bursts of laughter I can understand that said mister Stackpole without any difficulty You are not lost in the mysteries of chestnuting in open daylight said missus Evelyn mister Carleton said Edith wouldn t you have taken the squirrel s chestnuts I believe I should Miss Edith if I had not been hindered But what would have hindered you don t you think it was right Ask your friend Miss Ringgan what she thinks of it said he smiling Now mister Carleton said Constance as he threw down the magazine will you decide that point of English between Miss Ringgan and me I should like to hear the pleadings on both sides Miss Constance Well Fleda will you agree to submit it to mister Carleton I must know by what standards mister Carleton will be guided before I agree to any such thing said Fleda Standards but aren t you going to trust anybody in anything without knowing what standards they go by Would that be a safe rule to follow in general said Fleda smiling You won t be a true woman if you don t follow it sooner or later my dear Fleda said missus Evelyn Every woman must The later the better ma am I cannot help thinking You will change your mind said missus Evelyn complacently Mamma s notions mister Stackpole would satisfy any man s pride when she is expatiating upon the subject of woman s dependence said Florence The dependence of affection said missus Evelyn Of course It s their lot Affection always leads a true woman to merge her separate judgment on anything in the judgment of the beloved object Ay said Fleda laughing suppose her affection is wasted on an object that has none My dear Fleda said missus Evelyn with a funny expression that can never be you know don t you remember what your favourite Longfellow says affection never is wasted Florence my love just hand me Evangeline there I want you to listen to it mister Stackpole here it is Talk not of wasted affection affection never was wasted If it enrich not the heart of another its waters returning Back to their springs shall fill them full of refreshment That which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain How very plain it is that was written by a man said Fleda Why said mister Carleton laughing I always thought it was so exquisite said Florence I was so struck with it said Constance that I have been looking ever since for an object to waste my affections upon Hush Constance said her mother Don t you like it mister Carleton I should like to hear Miss Ringgan s commentary said mister Stackpole I can t anticipate it I should have said the sentiment was quite soft and tender enough for a woman Don t you agree with it mister Carleton repeated missus Evelyn I beg leave to second mister Stackpole s motion he said smiling Fleda my dear you must explain yourself the gentlemen are at a stand I believe missus Evelyn said Fleda smiling and blushing I am of the mind of the old woman who couldn t bear to see anything wasted But the assertion is that it isn t wasted said mister Stackpole That which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain said missus Evelyn Yes to flood and lay waste the fair growth of nature said Fleda with a little energy though her colour rose and rose higher Did it never occur to you missus Evelyn that the streams which fertilize as they flow do but desolate if their course be checked But your objection lies only against the author s figure said mister Stackpole come to the fact I was speaking as he did sir of the fact under the figure I did not mean to separate them Both the gentlemen were smiling though with very different expression Perhaps said mister Carleton the writer was thinking of a gentler and more diffusive flow of kind feeling which however it may meet with barren ground and raise no fruit there is sure in due time to come back heaven refined to refresh and replenish its source Perhaps so said Fleda with a very pleased answering look I do not recollect how it is brought in I may have answered rather missus Evelyn than mister Longfellow But granting that it is an error said mister Stackpole as you understood it what shews it to have been made by a man Its utter ignorance of the subject sir You think they never waste their affections said he By no means but I think they rarely waste so much in any one direction as to leave them quite impoverished mister Carleton how do you bear that sir said missus Evelyn Will you let such an assertion pass unchecked I would not if I could help it missus Evelyn That isn t saying much for yourself said Constance but Fleda my dear where did you get such an experience of waste and desolation Oh man is a microcosm you know said Fleda lightly But you make it out that only one half of mankind can appropriate that axiom said mister Stackpole How can a woman know men s hearts so well On the principle that the whole is greater than a part said mister Carleton smiling I ll sleep upon that before I give my opinion said mister Stackpole missus Evelyn good evening Well mister Carleton said Constance you have said a great deal for women s minds Some women s minds he said with a smile And some men s minds said Fleda I was speaking only in the general Her eye half unconsciously reiterated her meaning as she shook hands with mister Carleton And without speaking a word for other people to hear his look and smile in return were more than an answer Fleda sat for some time after he was gone trying to think what it was in eye and lip which had given her so much pleasure She could not make out anything but approbation the look of loving approbation that one gives to a good child but she thought it had also something of that quiet intelligence a silent communication of sympathy which the others in company could not share She was roused from her reverie by missus Evelyn Fleda my dear I am writing to your aunt Lucy have you any message to send No missus Evelyn I wrote myself to day And she went back to her musings I am writing about you Fleda said missus Evelyn again in a few minutes Giving a good account I hope ma am said Fleda smiling I shall tell her I think sea breezes have an unfavourable effect upon you said missus Evelyn that I am afraid you are growing pale and that you have clearly expressed yourself in favour of a garden at Queechy rather than any lot in the city or anywhere else so she had better send for you home immediately Fleda tried to find out what the lady really meant but missus Evelyn s delighted amusement did not consist with making the matter very plain Fleda s questions did nothing but aggravate the cause of them to her own annoyance so she was fain at last to take her light and go to her own room She looked at her flowers again with a renewal of the first pleasure and of the quieting influence the giver of them had exercised over her that evening thought again how very kind it was of him to send them and to choose them so how strikingly he differed from other people how glad she was to have seen him again and how more than glad that he was so happily changed from his old self And then from that change and the cause of it to those higher more tranquilizing and sweetening influences that own no kindred with earth s dust and descend like the dew of heaven to lay and fertilize it And when she laid herself down to sleep it was with a spirit grave but simply happy every annoyance and unkindness as unfelt now as ever the parching heat of a few hours before when the stars are abroad Chapter XXXVII A snake bedded himself under the threshold of a country house L Estrange To Fleda s very great satisfaction mister Thorn was not seen again for several days It would have been to her very great comfort too if he could have been permitted to die out of mind as well as out of sight but he was brought up before her lots of times till poor Fleda almost felt as if she was really in the moral neighbourhood of the Dead Sea every natural growth of pleasure was so withered under the barren spirit of raillery Sea breezes were never so disagreeable since winds blew and nervous and fidgety again whenever mister Carleton was present Fleda retreated to her work and the table and withdrew herself as much as she could from notice and conversation feeling humbled feeling sorry and vexed and ashamed that such ideas should have been put into her head the absurdity of which she thought was only equalled by their needlessness As much as she could she withdrew but that was not entirely now and then interest made her forget herself and quitting her needle she would give eyes and attention to the principal speaker as frankly as he could have desired Bad weather and bad roads for those days put riding out of the question One morning she was called down to see a gentleman and came eschewing in advance the expected image of mister Thorn It was a very different person Charlton Rossitur My dear Charlton how do you do Where did you come from You had better ask me what I have come for he said laughing as he shook hands with her What have you come for To carry you home Home said Fleda I am going up there for a day or two and mamma wrote me I had better act as your escort which of course I am most willing to do See what mamma says to you When are you going Charlton said Fleda as she broke the seal of the note he gave her To morrow morning That is too sudden a notice captain Rossitur said missus Evelyn Fleda will hurry herself out of her colour and then your mother will say there is something in sea breezes that isn t good for her and then she will never trust her within reach of them again which I am sure Miss Ringgan would be sorry for Fleda took her note to the window half angry with herself that a kind of banter in which certainly there was very little wit should have power enough to disturb her But though the shaft might be a slight one it was winged with a will the intensity of missus Evelyn s enjoyment in her own mischief gave it all the force that was wanting Fleda s head was in confusion she read her aunt s note three times over before she had made up her mind on any point respecting it My Dearest Fleda Charlton is coming home for a day or two hadn t you better take the opportunity to return with him I feel as if you had been long away my dear child don t you feel so too Your uncle is very desirous of seeing you and as for Hugh and me we are but half ourselves I would not still say a word about your coming home if it were for your good to stay but I fancy from something in missus Evelyn s letter that Queechy air will by this time do you good again and opportunities of making the journey are very uncertain My heart has grown lighter since I gave it leave to expect you Yours my darling L R P S I will write to missus E soon What string has pulled these wires that are twitching me home thought Fleda as her eyes went over and over the words which the feeling of the lines of her face would alone have told her were unwelcome And why unwelcome One likes to be moved by fair means and not by foul was the immediate answer And besides it is very disagreeable to be taken by surprise Whenever in any matter of my staying or going did aunt Lucy have any wish but my pleasure Fleda mused a little while and then with a perfect understanding of the machinery that had been at work though an extremely vague and repulsed notion of the spring that had moved it she came quietly out from her window and told Charlton she would go with him But not to morrow said missus Evelyn composedly You will not hurry her off so soon as that captain Rossitur Furloughs are the stubbornest things in the world missus Evelyn there is no spirit of accommodation about them Mine lies between to morrow morning and one other morning some two days thereafter and you might as soon persuade Atlas to change his place Will you be ready coz I will be ready said Fleda and her cousin departed Now my dear Fleda said missus Evelyn but it was with that funny face as she saw Fleda standing thoughtfully before the fire you must be very careful in getting your things together Why missus Evelyn I am afraid you will leave something behind you my love I will take care of that ma am and that I may I will go and see about it at once Very busy till dinner time she would not let herself stop to think about anything At dinner mister Evelyn openly expressed his regrets for her going and his earnest wishes that she would at least stay till the holidays were over Don t you know Fleda better papa said Florence than to try to make her alter her mind When she says a thing is determined upon I know there is nothing to do but to submit with as good a grace as you can I tried to make captain Rossitur leave her a little longer said missus Evelyn but he says furloughs are immovable and his begins to morrow morning so he was immovable too I should keep her notwithstanding though if her aunt Lucy hadn t sent for her Well see what she wants and come back again said mister Evelyn Thank you sir said Fleda smiling gratefully I think not this winter There are two or three of my friends that will be confoundedly taken aback said mister Evelyn carefully helping himself to gravy I expect that an immediate depopulation of New York will commence said Constance and go on till the heights about Queechy are all thickly settled with elegant country seats which is the conventional term for a species of mouse trap Hush you baggage said her father Fleda I wish you could spare her a little of your common sense to go through the world with Papa thinks you see my dear that you have more than enough which is not perhaps precisely the compliment he intended I take the full benefit of his and yours said Fleda smiling After dinner she had just time to run down to the library to bid doctor Gregory good bye her last walk in the city It wasn t a walk she enjoyed much Going to morrow said he Why I am going to Boston in a week you had better stay and go with me I can t now uncle Orrin I am dislodged and you know there is nothing to do then but to go Come and stay with me till next week But Fleda said it was best not and went home to finish her preparations She had no chance till late for several gentlemen spent the evening with them mister Carleton was there part of the time but he was one of the first to go and Fleda could not find an opportunity to say that she should not see him again Her timidity would not allow her to make one But it grieved her At last she escaped to her own room where most of her packing was still to do By the time half the floor and all the bed was strewn with neat looking piles of things the varieties of her modest wardrobe Florence and Constance came in to see and talk with her and sat down on the floor too partly perhaps because the chairs were all bespoken in the service of boxes and baskets and partly to follow what seemed to be the prevailing style of things What do you suppose has become of mister Thorn said Constance I have a presentiment that you will find him cracking nuts sociably with mister Rossitur or drinking one of aunt Lucy s excellent cups of coffee in comfortable expectation of your return If I thought that I should stay here said Fleda My dear those were my cups of coffee I wish I could make you think it then said Constance But you are glad to go home aren t you Fleda said Florence She isn t said her sister She knows mamma contemplates making a grand entertainment of all the Jews as soon as she is gone What does mamma mean by that Fleda I observe you comprehend her with most invariable quickness I should be puzzled to explain all that your mother means said Fleda gently as she went on bestowing her things in the trunk No I am not particularly glad to go home but I fancy it is time I am afraid I have grown too accustomed to your luxury of life and want knocking about to harden me a little Harden you said Constance My dear Fleda you are under a delusion Why should any one go through an indurating process will you inform me I don t say that every one should said Fleda but isn t it well for those whose lot does not lie among soft things There was extreme sweetness and a touching insinuation in her manner and both the young ladies were silent for sometime thereafter watching somewhat wistfully the gentle hands and face that were so quietly busy till the room was cleared again and looked remarkably empty with Fleda s trunk standing in the middle of it And then reminding them that she wanted some sleep to fit her for the hardening process and must therefore send them away she was left alone One thing Fleda had put off till then the care of her bunch of flowers They were beautiful still They had given her a very great deal of pleasure and she was determined they should be left to no servant s hands to be flung into the street If it had been summer she was sure she could have got buds from them as it was perhaps she might strike some cuttings at all events they should go home with her So carefully taking them out of the water and wrapping the ends in some fresh earth she had got that very afternoon from her uncle s garden Fleda bestowed them in the corner of her trunk that she had left for them and went to bed feeling weary in body and in mind to the last degree quiet In the same mind and mood she reached Queechy the next afternoon It was a little before January just the same time that she had come home last year As then it was a bright day and the country was again covered thick with the unspotted snow but Fleda forgot to think how bright and fresh it was Somehow she did not feel this time quite so glad to find herself there It had never occurred to her so strongly before that Queechy could want anything This feeling flew away before the first glimpse of her aunt s smile and for half an hour after Fleda would have certified that Queechy wanted nothing At the end of that time came in mister Rossitur His greeting of Charlton was sufficiently unmarked but eye and lip wakened when he turned to Fleda My dear child he said holding her face in both his hands how lovely you have grown That s only because you have forgotten her father said Hugh laughing Illustration My dear child he said holding her face in both his hands It was a very lovely face just then mister Rossitur gazed into it a moment and again kissed first one cheek and then the other and then suddenly withdrew his hands and turned away with an air Fleda could not tell what to make of it an air that struck her with an immediate feeling of pain somewhat as if for some cause or other he had nothing to do with her or her loveliness And she needed not to see him walk the room for three minutes to know that Michigan agencies had done nothing to lighten his brow or uncloud his character If this had wanted confirmation Fleda would have found it in her aunt s face She soon discovered even in the course of the pleasant talkative hours before supper that it was not brightened as she had expected to find it by her uncle s coming home and her ears now caught painfully the occasional long breath but half smothered which told of a burden upon the heart but half concealed Fleda supposed that mister Rossitur s business affairs at the West must have disappointed him and resolved not to remember that Michigan was in the map of North America Still they talked on through the afternoon and evening all of them except him he was moody and silent Fleda felt the cloud overshadow sadly her own gayety but missus Rossitur and Hugh were accustomed to it and Charlton was much too tall a light to come under any external obscuration whatever He was descanting brilliantly upon the doings and prospects at Fort Hamilton where he was stationed much to the entertainment of his mother and brother Fleda could not listen to him while his father was sitting lost in something not half so pleasant as sleep in the corner of the sofa Her eyes watched him stealthily till she could not bear it any longer She resolved to bring the power of her sunbeam to bear and going round seated herself on the sofa close by him and laid her hand on his arm He felt it immediately The arm was instantly drawn away to be put around her and Fleda was pressed nearer to his side while the other hand took hers and his lips were again on her forehead And how do you like me for a farmer uncle Rolf she said looking up at him laughingly and then fearing immediately that she had chosen her subject ill Not from any change in his countenance however that decidedly brightened up He did not answer at once My child you make me ashamed of mankind Of the dominant half of them sir do you mean said Charlton or is your observation a sweeping one It would sweep the greatest part of the world into the background sir answered his father dryly if its sense were the general rule And what has Fleda done to be such a besom of desolation Fleda s laugh set everybody else a going and there was immediately more life and common feeling in the society than had been all day They all seemed willing to shake off a weight and even Fleda in the endeavour to chase the gloom that hung over others as it had often happened lost half of her own But still I am not answered said Charlton when they were grave again What has Fleda done to put such a libel upon mankind You should call it a label as doctor Quackenboss does said Fleda in a fresh burst he says he never would stand being labelled But come back to the point said Charlton I want to know what is the label in this case that Fleda s doings put upon those of other people Insignificance said his father dryly I should like to know how bestowed said Charlton Don t enlighten him uncle Rolf said Fleda laughing let my doings remain in safe obscurity please I stand as a representative of mankind said Charlton and I demand an explanation Look at what this slight frame and delicate nerves have been found equal to and then tell me if the broad shoulders of all your mess would have borne half the burden or their united heads accomplished a quarter the results He spoke with sufficient depth of meaning though now with no unpleasant expression But Charlton notwithstanding rather gathered himself up O uncle Rolf said Fleda gently nerves and muscles haven t much to do with it after all you know I have just served the place of a mouth piece Seth was the head and good Earl Douglass the hand I am ashamed of myself and of mankind mister Rossitur repeated when I see what mere weakness can do and how proudly valueless strength is contended to be You are looking captain Rossitur but after all a cap and plume really makes a man taller only to the eye When I have flung my plume in anybody s face sir said Charlton rather hotly it will be time enough to throw it back again missus Rossitur put her hand on his arm and looked her remonstrance Are you glad to be home again dear Fleda she said turning to her But Fleda was making some smiling communications to her uncle and did not seem to hear Fleda does it seem pleasant to be here again Very pleasant dear aunt Lucy though I have had a very pleasant visit too On the whole you do not wish you were at this moment driving out of town in mister Thorn s cabriolet said her cousin Not in the least said Fleda coolly How did you know I ever did such a thing I wonder what should bring mister Thorn to Queechy at this time of year said Hugh Fleda started at this confirmation of Constance s words and what was very odd she could not get rid of the impression that mister Rossitur had started too Perhaps it was only her own nerves but he had certainly taken away the arm that was round her I suppose he has followed Miss Ringgan said Charlton gravely No said Hugh he has been here some little time Then he preceded her I suppose to see and get the sleighs in order He did not know I was coming said Fleda Didn t No I have not seen him for several days My dear little cousin said Charlton laughing you are not a witch in your own affairs whatever you may be in those of other people Why Charlton You are no adept in the art of concealment I have nothing to conceal said Fleda How do you know he is here Hugh I was anxiously asked the other day said Hugh with a slight smile whether you had come home and then told that mister Thorn was in Queechy There is no mistake about it for my imformant had actually seen him and given him the direction to mister Plumfield s for which he was inquiring The direction to mister Plumfield s said Fleda What s your old friend mister Carleton doing in New York said Charlton Is he there still said missus Rossitur As large as life answered her son Which though you might not suppose it aunt Lucy is about the height of captain Rossitur with I should judge a trifle less weight Your eyes are observant said Charlton Of a good many things said Fleda lightly He is not my height by half an inch said Charlton I am just six feet without my boots An excellent height said Fleda your six feet was ever the only height Who said that said Charlton Isn t it enough that I say it What s he staying here for I don t know really said Fleda It s very difficult to tell what people do things for Have you seen much of him said missus Rossitur Yes ma am a good deal he was often at missus Evelyn s Is he going to marry one of her daughters Oh no said Fleda smiling he isn t thinking of such a thing not in America I don t know what he may do in England No said Charlton I suppose he would think himself contaminated by matching with any blood in this hemisphere You do him injustice said Fleda colouring you do not know him Charlton You do Much better than that And he is not one of the most touch me not pieces of English birth and wealth that ever stood upon their own dignity Not at all said Fleda how people may be misunderstood he is one of the most gentle and kind persons I ever saw To you To everybody that deserves it Humph And not proud No not as you understand it and she felt it was very difficult to make him understand it as the discovery involved a very offensive implication he is too fine a character to be proud That is arguing in a circle with a vengeance said Charlton I know what you are thinking of said Fleda and I suppose it passes for pride with a great many people who cannot comprehend it he has a singular power of quietly rebuking wrong and keeping impertinence at a distance where captain Rossitur for instance I suppose would throw his cap in a man s face mister Carleton s mere silence would make the offender doff his and ask pardon The manner in which this was said precluded all taking offence Well said Charlton shrugging his shoulders then I don t know what pride is that s all Take care captain Rossitur said Fleda laughing I have heard of such a thing as American pride before now Certainly said Charlton and I m quite willing but it never reaches quite such a towering height on our side the water I am sure I don t know how that may be said Fleda but I know I have heard a lady an enlightened gentle tempered American lady so called I have heard her talk to a poor Irish woman with whom she had nothing in the world to do in a style that moved my indignation it stirred my blood and there was nothing whatever to call it out All the blood of all the Howards I hope would not have disgraced itself so What business have you to hope anything about it None except from the natural desire to find what one has a right to look for But indeed I wouldn t take the blood of all the Howards for any security pride as well as high breeding is a thing of natural not adventitious growth it belongs to character not circumstance Do you know that your favourite mister Carleton is nearly connected with those same Howards and quarters their arms with his own I have a very vague idea of the dignity implied in that expression of quartering arms which comes so roundly out of your mouth Charlton said Fleda laughing No I didn t know it But in general I am apt to think that pride is a thing which reverses the usual rules of architecture and builds highest on the narrowest foundations What do you mean Never mind said Fleda if a meaning isn t plain it isn t worth looking after But it will not do to measure pride by its supposed materials It does not depend on them but on the individual You everywhere see people assert that most of which they feel least sure and then it is easy for them to conclude that where there is so much more of the reality there must be proportionably more of the assertion I wish some of our gentlemen and ladies who talk of pride where they see and can see nothing but the habit of wealth I wish they could see the universal politeness with which mister Carleton returns the salutes of his inferiors Not more respectfully they lift their hats to him than he lifts his to them unless when he speaks You have seen it Often Where In England at his own place among his own servants and dependents I remember very well it struck even my childish eyes Well after all that is nothing still but a refined kind of haughtiness It is a kind that I wish some of our Americans would copy said Fleda But dear Fleda said missus Rossitur all Americans are not like that lady you were talking of it would be very unfair to make her a sample I don t think I ever heard any one speak so in my life you never heard me speak so Dear aunt Lucy no I was only giving instance for instance I have no idea that mister Carleton is a type of Englishmen in general I wish he were But I think it is the very people that cry out against superiority who are the most happy to assert their own where they can the same jealous feeling that repines on the one hand revenges itself on the other Superiority of what kind said Charlton stiffly Of any kind superiority of wealth or refinement or name or standing Now it does not follow that an Englishman is proud because he keeps liveried servants and it by no means follows that an American lacks the essence of haughtiness because he finds fault with him for doing so I dare say some of our neighbours think we are proud said Hugh Because we use silver forks instead of steel Because we re too good for steel forks you ought to say said Fleda I am sure they think so I have been given to understand as much Barby I believe has a good opinion of us and charitably concludes that we mean right but some other of our country friends would think I was far gone in uppishness if they knew that I never touch fish with a steel knife and it wouldn t mend the matter much to tell them that the combination of flavours is disagreeable to me it hardly suits the doctrine of liberty and equality that my palate should be so much nicer than theirs Absurd said Charlton Very said Fleda but on which side in all probability is the pride It wasn t for liveried servants that I charged mister Carleton said her cousin How do the Evelyns like this paragon of yours O everybody likes him said Fleda smiling except you and your friend mister Thorn Thorn don t like him eh I think not What do you suppose is the reason said Charlton gravely I don t think mister Thorn is particularly apt to like anybody said Fleda who knew very well the original cause of both exceptions but did not like to advert to it Apparently you don t like mister Thorn said mister Rossitur speaking for the first time I don t know who does sir much except his mother What is he A man not wanting in parts sir and with considerable force of character but I am afraid more for ill than for good I should be very sorry to trust him with anything dear to me How long were you in forming that opinion said Charlton looking at her curiously It was formed substantially the first evening I saw him and I hare never seen cause to alter it since The several members of the family therewith fell into a general muse with the single exception of Hugh whose eyes and thoughts seemed to be occupied with Fleda s living presence mister Rossitur then requested that breakfast might be ready very early at six o clock Six o clock exclaimed missus Rossitur I have to take a long ride on business which must be done early in the day When will you be back Not before night fall But going on another business journey said missus Rossitur You have but just these few hours come home from one Cannot breakfast be ready Yes uncle Rolf said Fleda bringing her bright face before him ready at half past five if you like now that I am to the fore you know He clasped her to his breast and kissed her again but with a face so very grave that Fleda was glad nobody else saw it Then Charlton went averring that he wanted at least a night and a half of sleep between two such journeys as the one of that day and the one before him on the next especially as he must resign himself to going without anything to eat Him also Fleda laughingly promised that precisely half an hour before the stage time a cup of coffee and a roll should be smoking on the table with whatever substantial appendages might be within the bounds of possibility or the house I will pay you for that beforehand with a kiss said he You will do nothing of the kind said Fleda stepping back a kiss is a favour taken not given and I am entirely ignorant what you have done to deserve it You make a curious difference between me and Hugh said Charlton half in jest half in earnest Hugh is my brother captain Rossitur said Fleda smiling and that is an honour you never made any pretensions to Come you shall not say that any more said he taking the kiss that Fleda had no mind to give him Half laughing but with eyes that were all too ready for something else she turned again to Hugh when his brother had left the room and looked wistfully in his face stroking back the hair from his temples with a caressing hand You are just as you were when I left you she said with lips that seemed too unsteady to say more and remained parted I am afraid so are you he replied not a bit fatter I hoped you would be What have you been smiling at so this evening I was thinking how well you talked Why Hugh You should have helped me I talked too much I would much rather listen said Hugh Dear Fleda what a different thing the house is with you in it Fleda said nothing except an inexplicable little shake of her head which said a great many things and then she and her aunt were left alone missus Rossitur drew her to her bosom with a look so exceeding fond that its sadness was hardly discernible It was mingled however with an expression of some doubt What has made you keep so thin I have been very well aunt Lucy thinness agrees with me Are you glad to be home again dear Fleda I am very glad to be with you dear aunt Lucy But not glad to be home Yes I am said Fleda but somehow I don t know I believe I have got a little spoiled it is time I was at home I am sure I shall be quite glad after a day or two when I have got into the works again I am glad now aunt Lucy missus Rossitur seemed unsatisfied and stroked the hair from Fleda s forehead with an absent look What was there in New York that you were so sorry to leave Nothing ma am in particular said Fleda brightly and I am not sorry aunt Lucy I tell you I am a little spoiled with company and easy living I am glad to be with you again missus Rossitur was silent Don t you get up to uncle Rolf s breakfast to morrow aunt Lucy Nor you I sha n t unless I want to but there ll be nothing for you to do and you must just lie still We will all have our breakfast together when Charlton has his You are the veriest sunbeam that ever came into a house said her aunt kissing her Chapter XXXVIII My flagging soul flies under her own pitch Dryden Fleda mused as she went up stairs whether the sun were a luminous body to himself or no feeling herself at that moment dull enough Bright was she to others nothing seemed bright to her Every old shadow was darker than ever Her uncle s unchanged gloom her aunt s unrested face Hugh s unaltered delicate sweet look which always to her fancy seemed to write upon his face Passing away and the thickening prospects whence sprang the miasm that infected the whole moral atmosphere alas yes Money is a good thing thought Fleda and poverty need not be a bad thing if people can take it right but if they take it wrong With a very drooping heart indeed she went to the window Her old childish habit had never been forgotten whenever the moon or the stars were abroad Fleda rarely failed to have a talk with them from her window She stood there now looking out into the cold still night with eyes just dimmed with tears not that she lacked sadness enough but she did lack spirit enough to cry It was very still after the rattle and confusion of the city streets that extent of snow covered country where the very shadows were motionless the entire absence of soil and of disturbance the rest of nature the breathlessness of the very wind all preached a quaint kind of sermon to Fleda By the force of contrast they told her what should be and there was more yet she thought that by the force of example they shewed what might be Her eyes had not long travelled over the familiar old fields and fences before she came to the conclusion that she was home in good time she thought she had been growing selfish or in danger of it and she made up her mind she was glad to be back again among the rough things of life where she could do so much to smooth them for others and her own spirit might grow to a polish it would never gain in the regions of ease and pleasure To do life s work thought Fleda clasping her hands no matter where and mine is here I am glad I am in my place again I was forgetting I had one It was a face of strange purity and gravity that the moon shone upon with no power to brighten as in past days the shadows of life were upon the child s brow But nothing to brighten it from within One sweet strong ray of other light suddenly found its way through the shadows and entered her heart The Lord reigneth let the earth be glad and then the moonbeams pouring down with equal ray upon all the unevennesses of this little world seemed to say the same thing over and over Even so Not less equally his providence touches all not less impartially his faithfulness guides The Lord reigneth let the earth be glad There was brightness in the moonbeams now that Fleda could read this in them she went to sleep a very child again with these words for her pillow It was not six and darkness yet filled the world when mister Rossitur came down stairs and softly opened the sitting room door But the home fairy had been at work he was greeted with such a blaze of cheerfulness as seemed to say what a dark place the world was everywhere but at home his breakfast table was standing ready well set and well supplied and even as he entered by one door Fleda pushed open the other and came in from the kitchen looking as if she had some strange spirit like kindred with the cheery hearty glow which filled both rooms Fleda you up at this hour Yes uncle Rolf she said coming forward to put her hands upon his you are not sorry to see me I hope But he did not say he was glad and he did not speak at all he busied himself gravely with some little matters of preparation for his journey Evidently the gloom of last night was upon him yet But Fleda had not wrought for praise and could work without encouragement neither step nor hand slackened till all she and Barby had made ready was in nice order on the table and she was pouring out a cup of smoking coffee You are not fit to be up said mister Rossitur looking at her you are pale now Put yourself in that arm chair Fleda and go to sleep I will do this for myself No indeed uncle Rolf she answered brightly I have enjoyed getting breakfast very much at this out of the way hour and now I am going to have the pleasure of seeing you eat it Suppose you were to take a cup of coffee instead of my shoulder He took it and sat down but Fleda found that the pleasure of seeing him was to be a very qualified thing He ate like a business man in unbroken silence and gravity and her cheerful words and looks got no return It became an effort at length to keep either bright mister Rossitur s sole remarks during breakfast were to ask if Charlton was going back that day and if Philetus was getting the horse ready mister Skillcorn had been called in good time by Barby at Fleda s suggestion and coming down stairs had opined discontentedly that a man hadn t no right to be took out of bed in the morning afore he could see himself But this and Barby s spirited reply that there was no chance of his doing that at any time of day so it was no use to wait Fleda did not repeat Her uncle was in no humour to be amused She expected almost that he would go off without speaking to her But he came up kindly to where she stood watching him You must bid me good bye for all the family uncle Rolf as I am the only one here she said laughing But she was sure that the embrace and kiss which followed were very exclusively for her They made her face almost as sober as his own There will be a blessing for you said he if there is a blessing anywhere If uncle Rolf said Fleda her heart swelling to her eyes He turned away without answering her Fleda sat down in the easy chair then and cried But that lasted very few minutes she soon left crying for herself to pray for him that he might have the blessing he did not know That did not stop tears She remembered the poor man sick of the palsy who was brought in by friends to be healed and that Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy Son thy sins be forgiven thee It was a handle that faith took hold of and held fast while love made its petition It was all she could do she thought she never could venture to speak to her uncle on the subject Weary and tired tears and longing at length lost themselves in sleep When she awaked she found the daylight broadly come little King in her lap the fire instead of being burnt out in perfect preservation and Barby standing before it and looking at her You ha n t got one speck o good by this journey to New York was Miss Elster s vexed salutation Do you think so said Fleda rousing herself I wouldn t venture to say as much as that Barby If you have tain t in your cheeks said Barby decidedly You look just as if you was made of anything that wouldn t stand wear and that isn t the way you used to look I have been up a good while without breakfast my cheeks will be a better colour when I have had that Barby they feel pale The second breakfast was a cheerfuller thing But when the second traveller was despatched and the rest fell back upon their old numbers Fleda was very quiet again It vexed her to be so but she could not change her mood She felt as if she had been whirled along in a dream and was now just opening her eyes to daylight and reality And reality she could not help it looked rather dull after dreamland She thought it was very well she was waked up but it cost her some effort to appear so And then she charged herself with ingratitude her aunt and Hugh were so exceedingly happy in her company Earl Douglass is quite delighted with the clover hay Fleda said Hugh as the three sat at an early dinner Is he said Fleda Yes you know he was very unwilling to cure it in your way and he thinks there never was anything like it now Did you ever see finer ham Fleda inquired her aunt mister Plumfield says it could not be better Very good said Fleda whose thoughts had somehow got upon mister Carleton s notions about female education and were very busy with them I expected you would have remarked upon our potatoes before now said Hugh These are the Elephants have you seen anything like them in New York There cannot be more beautiful potatoes said missus Rossitur We had not tried any of them before you went away Fleda had we I don t know aunt Lucy no I think not You needn t talk to Fleda mother said Hugh laughing she is quite beyond attending to all such ordinary matters her thoughts have learned to take a higher flight since she has been in New York It is time they were brought down then said Fleda smiling but they have not learned to fly out of sight of home Hugh Where were they dear Fleda said her aunt I was thinking a minute ago of something I heard talked about in New York aunt Lucy and afterwards I was trying to find out by what possible or imaginable road I had got round to it Could you tell Fleda said no and tried to bear her part in the conversation But she did not know whether to blame the subjects which had been brought forward or herself for her utter want of interest in them She went into the kitchen feeling dissatisfied with both Did you ever see potatoes that would beat them Elephants said Barby Never certainly said Fleda with a most involuntary smile I never did said Barby They beat all for bigness and goodness both I can t keep em together There s thousands of em and I mean to make Philetus eat em for supper such potatoes and milk is good enough for him or anybody The cow has gained on her milk wonderful Fleda since she begun to have them roots fed out to her Which cow said Fleda Which cow why the blue cow there ain t none of the others that s giving any to speak of said Barby looking at her Don t you know the cow you said them carrots should be kept for Fleda half laughed as there began to rise up before her the various magazines of vegetables grain hay and fodder that for many weeks had been deliciously distant from her imagination I made butter for four weeks I guess after you went away Barby went on just come in here and see and the carrots makes it as yellow and sweet as June I churned as long as I had anything to churn and longer and now we live on cream you can make some cheesecakes just as soon as you re a mind to see ain t that doing pretty well and fine it is put your nose down to it Bravely Barby and it is very sweet You ha n t left nothing behind you in New York have you said Barby when they returned to the kitchen Left anything no what do you think I have left I didn t know but you might have forgotten to pack up your memory said Barby dryly Fleda laughed and then in walked mister Douglass How d ye do said he Got back again I heerd you was hum and so I thought I d just step up and see Been getting along pretty well Fleda answered smiling internally at the wide distance between her getting along and his idea of it Well the hay s first rate said Earl taking off his hat and sitting down in the nearest chair I ve been feedin it out now for a good spell and I know what to think about it We ve been feedin it out ever since some time this side o the middle o November I never see nothin sweeter and I don t want to see nothin sweeter than it is and the cattle eats it like May roses they don t know how to thank you enough for it To thank you mister Douglass said Fleda smiling No said he in a decided manner I don t want no thanks for it and I don t deserve none Twa n t thanks to none of my fore sightedness that the clover wa n t served the old way I didn t like new notions and I never did like new notions and I never see much good of em but I suppose there s some on em that ain t moon shine my woman says there is and I suppose there is and after this clover hay I m willin to allow that there is It s as sweet as a posie if you smell to it and all of it s cured alike and I think Fleda there s a quarter more weight of it I ha n t proved it nor weighed it but I ve an eye and a hand as good as most folks and I ll qualify to there being a fourth part more weight of it and it s a beautiful colour The critters is as fond of it as you and I be of strawberries Well that is satisfactory mister Douglass said Fleda How is missus Douglass and Catherine I ha n t heerd em sayin nothin about it he said and if there was anythin the matter I suppose they d let me know There don t much go wrong in a man s house without his hearin tell of it So I think Maybe tain t the same in other men s houses That s the way it is in mine missus Douglass would not thank you said Fleda wholly unable to keep from laughing Earl s mouth gave way a very little and then he went on How be you he said You ha n t gained much as I see I don t see but you re as poor as when you went away I am very well mister Douglass I guess New York ain t the place to grow fat Well Fleda there ha n t been seen in the whole country or by any man in it the like of the crop of corn we took off that ere twenty acre lot they re all beat to hear tell of it they won t believe me Seth Plumfield ha n t shewed as much himself he says you re the best farmer in the state I hope he gives you part of the credit mister Douglass how much was there I ll take my share of credit whenever I can get it said Earl and I think it s right to take it as long as you ha n t nothing to be ashamed of but I won t take no more than my share and I will say I thought we was a goin to choke the corn to death when we seeded the field in that way Well there s better than two thousand bushel more or less and as handsome corn as I want to see there never was handsomer corn Would you let it go for five shillings there s a man I ve heerd of wants the hull of it Is that a good price mister Douglass Why don t you ask mister Rossitur Do you s pose mister Rossitur knows much about it inquired Earl with a curious turn of feature between sly and contemptuous The less he has to do with that heap of corn the bigger it ll be that s my idee I ain t agoin to ask him nothin you may ask him what you like to ask him but I don t think he ll tell you much that ll make you and me wiser in the matter o farmin But now that he is at home mister Douglass I certainly cannot decide without speaking to him Very good said Earl uneasily tain t no affair of mine as you like to have it so you ll have it just as you please But now Fleda there s another thing I want to speak to you about I want you to let me take hold of that ere piece of swamp land and bring it in I knew a man that fixed a piece of land like that and cleared nigh a thousand dollars off it the first year Which piece said Fleda Why you know which tis just the other side of the trees over there between them two little hills There s six or seven acres of it nothin in the world but mud and briars will you let me take hold of it I ll do the hull job if you ll give me half the profits for one year Come over and look at it and I ll tell you come the walk won t hurt you and it ain t fur All Fleda s inclinations said no but she thought it was not best to indulge them She put on her hood and went off with him and was treated to a long and most implicated detail of ways and means from which she at length disentangled the rationale of the matter and gave mister Douglass the consent he asked for promising to gain that of her uncle The day was fair and mild and in spite of weariness of body a certain weariness of mind prompted Fleda when she had got rid of Earl Douglass to go and see her aunt Miriam She went questioning with herself all the way for her want of good will to these matters True they were not pleasant mind work but she tried to school herself into taking them patiently as good life work She had had too much pleasant company and enjoyed too much conversation she said It had unfitted her for home duties missus Plumfield she knew was no better But her eye found no change for the worse The old lady was very glad to see her and very cheerful and kind as usual Well are you glad to be home again said aunt Miriam after a pause in the conversation Everybody asks me that question said Fleda smiling Perhaps for the same reason I did because they thought you didn t look very glad I am glad said Fleda but I believe not so glad as I was last year Why not I suppose I had a pleasanter time I have got a little spoiled I believe aunt Miriam Fleda said with glistening eyes and an altering voice I don t take up my old cares and duties kindly at first I shall be myself again in a few days Aunt Miriam looked at her with that fond wistful benevolent look which made Fleda turn away What has spoiled you love Oh easy living and pleasure I suppose Fleda said but said with difficulty Pleasure said aunt Miriam putting one arm gently round her Fleda struggled with herself It is so pleasant aunt Miriam to forget these money cares to lift one s eyes from the ground and feel free to stretch out one s hand not to be obliged to think about spending sixpences and to have one s mind at liberty for a great many things that I haven t time for here And Hugh and aunt Lucy somehow things seem sad to me Nothing could be more sympathizingly kind than the way in which aunt Miriam brought Fleda closer to her side and wrapped her in her arms I am very foolish Fleda whispered I am very wrong I shall get over it I am afraid dear Fleda missus Plumfield said after a pause it isn t best for us always to be without sad things though I cannot bear to see your dear little face look sad but it wouldn t fit us for the work we have to do it wouldn t fit us to stand where I stand now and look forward happily Where you stand said Fleda raising her head Yes and I would not be without a sorrow I have ever known They are bitter now when they are present but the sweet fruit comes after But what do you mean by where you stand On the edge of life You do not think so aunt Miriam Fleda said with a terrified look You are not worse I don t expect ever to be better said missus Plumfield with a smile Nay my love she said as Fleda s head went down on her bosom again not so I do not wish it either Fleda I do not expect to leave you soon but I would not prolong the time by a day I would not have spoken of it now if I had recollected myself but I am so accustomed to think and speak of it that it came out before I knew it My darling child it is nothing to cry for I know it aunt Miriam Then don t cry whispered aunt Miriam when she had stroked Fleda s head for five minutes I am crying for myself aunt Miriam said Fleda I shall be left alone Alone my dear child Yes there is nobody but you that I feel I can talk to She would have added that she dared not say a word to Hugh for fear of troubling him But that pain at her heart stopped her and pressing her hands together she burst into bitter weeping Nobody to talk to but me said missus Plumfield after again soothing her for some time what do you mean dear O I can t say anything to them at home said Fleda with a forced effort after voice and you are the only one I can look to for help Hugh never says anything almost never anything of that kind he would rather others should counsel him There is one friend to whom you may always tell everything with no fear of wearying him of whom you may at all times ask counsel without any danger of being denied more dear more precious more rejoiced in the more he is sought unto Thou mayest lose friend after friend and gain more than thou losest in that one I know it said Fleda but dear aunt Miriam don t you think human nature longs for some human sympathy and help too My sweet blossom yes said missus Plumfield caressingly stroking her bowed head but let him do what he will he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee I know that too said Fleda weeping How do people bear life that do not know it Or that cannot take the comfort of it Thou art not poor nor alone while thou hast him to go to little Fleda And you are not losing me yet my child you will have time I think to grow as well satisfied as I with the prospect Is that possible for others said Fleda The mother sighed as her son entered the room He looked uncommonly grave Fleda thought That did not surprise her but it seemed that it did his mother for she asked an explanation Which however he did not give So you ve got back from New York said he Just got back yesterday said Fleda Why didn t you stay longer I thought my friends at home would be glad to see me said Fleda Was I mistaken He made no answer for a minute and then said Is your uncle at home No said Fleda he went away this morning on business and we do not expect him home before night fall Do you want to see him No said Seth very decidedly I wish he had staid in Michigan or gone further west anywhere that Queechy d never have heard of him Why what has he done said Fleda looking up half laughing and half amazed at her cousin But his face was disagreeably dark though she could not make out that the expression was one of displeasure It did not encourage her to talk Do you know a man in New York of the name of Thorn he said after standing still a minute or two I know two men of that name said Fleda colouring and wondering Is either on em a friend of your n No He ain t said mister Plumfield giving the forestick on the fire an energetic kick which Fleda could not help thinking was mentally aimed at the said New Yorker No certainly What makes you ask O said Seth dryly folks tongues will find work to do I heerd say something like that I thought you must take to him more than I do Why what do you know of him He s been here a spell lately said Seth poking round more for ill than for good I reckon He turned and quitted the room abruptly and Fleda bethought her that she must go home while she had light enough Chapter XXXIX Nothing could be more obliging and respectful than the lion s letter was in appearance but there was death in the true intent L Estrange The landscape had grown more dark since Fleda came up the hill or else the eyes that looked at it Both probably It was just after sundown and that is a very sober time of day in winter especially in some states of the weather The sun had left no largesses behind him the scenery was deserted to all the coming poverty of night and looked grim and threadbare already Not one of the colours of prosperity left The land was in mourning dress all the ground and even the ice on the little mill ponds a uniform spread of white while the hills were draperied with black stems here just veiling the snow and there on a side view making a thick fold of black Every little unpainted workshop or mill shewed uncompromisingly all its forbidding sharpness of angle and outline darkening against the twilight In better days perhaps some friendly tree had hung over it shielding part of its faults and redeeming the rest Now nothing but the gaunt skeleton of a friend stood there doubtless to bud forth again as fairly as ever should the season smile Still and quiet all was as Fleda s spirit and in too good harmony with it she resolved to choose the morning to go out in future There was as little of the light of spring or summer in her own mind as on the hills and it was desirable to catch at least a cheering reflection She could rouse herself to no bright thoughts try as she would the happy voices of nature that used to speak to her were all hushed or her ear was deaf and her eye met nothing that did not immediately fall in with the train of sad images that were passing through her mind and swell the procession She was fain to fall back and stay herself upon these words the only stand by she could lay hold of To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal life They toned with the scene and with her spirit exactly they suited the darkening sky and the coming night for glory honour and immortality are not now They filled Fleda s mind after they had once entered and then nature s sympathy was again as readily given each barren stern looking hill in its guise of present desolation and calm expectancy seemed to echo softly patient continuance in well doing And the tears trembled then in Fleda s eyes she had set her face as the old Scotchman says in the right airth Footnote quarter direction How sweet is the wind that bloweth out of the airth where Christ is Well said Hugh who entered the kitchen with her you have been late enough Did you have a pleasant walk You are pale Fleda Yes it was pleasant said Fleda with one of her winning smiles a kind of pleasant But have you looked at the hills They are exactly as if they had put on mourning nothing but white and black a crape like dressing of black tree stems upon the snowy face of the ground and on every slope and edge of the hills the crape lies in folds Do look at it when you go out It has a most curious effect Not pleasant I should think said Hugh You ll see it is just as I have described it No not pleasant exactly the landscape wants the sun to light it up just now it is cold and wilderness looking I think I ll take the morning in future Whither are you bound I must go over to Queechy Run for a minute on business I ll be home before supper I should have been back by this time but Philetus has gone to bed with a headache and I had to take care of the cows Three times and out said Barby I won t try again I didn t know as anything would be too powerful for his head but I find as sure as he has apple dumplin for dinner he goes to bed for his supper and leaves the cows without none And then Hugh has to take it It has saved so many Elephants that s one thing Hugh went out by one door and Fleda by another entered the breakfast room the one generally used in winter for all purposes missus Rossitur sat there alone in an easy chair and Fleda no sooner caught the outline of her figure than her heart sank at once to an unknown depth unknown before and unfathomable now She was cowering over the fire her head sunk in her hands so crouching that the line of neck and shoulders instantly conveyed to Fleda the idea of fancied or felt degradation there was no escaping it how whence what was all wild confusion But the language of mere attitude was so unmistakable the expression of crushing pain was so strong that after Fleda had fearfully made her way up beside her she could do no more She stood there tongue tied spell bound present to nothing but a nameless chill of fear and heart sinking She was afraid to speak afraid to touch her aunt and abode motionless in the grasp of that dread for minutes But missus Rossitur did not stir a hair and the terror of that stillness grew to be less endurable than any other Illustration missus Rossitur sat there alone Fleda spoke to her it did not win the shadow of a reply again and again She laid her hand then upon missus Rossitur s shoulder but the very significant answer to that was a shrinking gesture of the shoulder and neck away from the hand Fleda growing desperate then implored an answer in words prayed for an explanation with an intensity of distress in voice and manner that no one whose ears were not stopped with a stronger feeling could have been deaf to but missus Rossitur would not raise her head nor slacken in the least the clasp of the fingers that supported it that of themselves in their relentless tension spoke what no words could Fleda s trembling prayers were in vain in vain Poor nature at last sought a woman s relief in tears but they were heart breaking not heart relieving tears racking both mind and body more than they ought to bear but bringing no cure missus Rossitur seemed as unconscious of her niece s mute agony as she had been of her agony of words and it was from Fleda s own self recollection alone that she fought off pain and roused herself above weakness to do what the time called for Aunt Lucy she said laying her hand upon her shoulder and this time the voice was steady and the hand would not be shaken off Aunt Lucy Hugh will be in presently hadn t you better rouse yourself and go up stairs for awhile till you are better and not let him see you so How the voice was broken and quivering before it got through The answer this time was a low long drawn moan so exceeding plaintive and full of pain that it made Fleda shake like an aspen But after a moment she spoke again bearing more heavily with her hand to mark her words I am afraid he will be in presently he ought not to see you now Aunt Lucy I am afraid it might do him an injury he might not get over She spoke with the strength of desperation her nerves were unstrung by fear and every joint weakened so that she could hardly support herself She had not however spoken in vain one or two convulsive shudders passed over her aunt and then missus Rossitur suddenly rose turning her face from Fleda neither would she permit her to follow her But Fleda thought she had seen that one or two unfolded letters or papers of some kind they looked like letters were in her lap when she raised her head Left alone Fleda sat down on the floor by the easy chair and rested her head there waiting she could do nothing else till her extreme excitement of body and mind should have quieted itself She had a kind of vague hope that time would do something for her before Hugh came in Perhaps it did for though she lay in a kind of stupor and was conscious of no change whatever she was able when she heard him coming to get up and sit in the chair in an ordinary attitude But she looked like the wraith of herself an hour ago Fleda Hugh exclaimed as soon as he looked from the fire to her face what is the matter what is the matter with you I am not very well I don t feel very well said Fleda speaking almost mechanically I shall have a headache to morrow Headache But you look shockingly what has happened to you what is the matter Fleda I am not ill I shall be better by and by There is nothing the matter with me that need trouble you dear Hugh Nothing the matter with you said he and Fleda might see how she looked in the reflection of his face where s mother She is up stairs you mustn t go to her Hugh said Fleda laying a detaining hand upon him with more strength than she thought she had I don t want anything Why mustn t I go to her I don t think she wants to be disturbed I must disturb her You musn t I know she don t she isn t well something has happened to trouble her What I don t know And is that what has troubled you too said Hugh his countenance changing as he gained more light on the subject what is it dear Fleda I don t know repeated Fleda bursting into tears Hugh was quiet enough now and sat down beside her subdued and still without even desiring to ask a question Fleda s tears flowed violently for a minute then she checked them for his sake and they sat motionless without speaking to one another looking into the fire and letting it die out before them into embers and ashes neither stirring to put a hand to it As the fire died the moonlight streamed in how very dismal the room looked What do you think about having tea said Barby opening the door of the kitchen Neither felt it possible to answer her mister Rossitur ain t come home is he No said Fleda shuddering So I thought and so I told Seth Plumfield just now he was asking for him My stars ha n t you no fire here what did you let it go out for Barby came in and began to build it up It s growing cold I can tell you so you may as well have something in the chimney to look at You ll want it shortly if you don t now Was mister Plumfield here did you say Barby Yes Why didn t he come in I s pose he hadn t a mind to said Barby Twa n t for want of being asked I did the civil thing by him if he didn t by me but he said he didn t want to see anybody but mister Rossitur Did not wank to see anybody but mister Rossitur when he had distinctly said he did not wish to see him Fleda felt sick merely from the mysterious dread which could fasten upon nothing and therefore took in everything Well what about tea concluded Barby when the fire was going according to her wishes Will you have it or will you wait longer No we won t wait we will have it now Barby said Fleda forcing herself to make the exertion and she went to the window to put down the hangings The moonlight was very bright and Fleda s eye was caught in the very act of letting down the curtain by a figure in the road slowly passing before the courtyard fence It paused a moment by the horse gate and turning paced slowly back till it was hid behind the rose acacias There was a clump of shrubbery in that corner thick enough even in winter to serve for a screen Fleda stood with the curtain in her hand half let down unable to move and feeling almost as if the very currents of life within her were standing still too She thought she was almost sure she knew the figure it was on her tongue to ask Hugh to come and look but she checked that The form appeared again from behind the acacias moving with the same leisurely pace the other way towards the horse gate Fleda let down the curtain then the other two quietly and then left the room and stole noiselessly out at the front door leaving it open that the sound of it might not warn Hugh what she was about and stepping like a cat down the steps ran breathlessly over the snow to the courtyard gate There waited shivering in the cold but not feeling it for the cold within while the person she was watching stood still a lew moments by the horse gate and came again with leisurely steps towards her Seth Plumfield said Fleda almost as much frightened at the sound of her own voice as he was He stopped immediately with a start and came up to the little gate behind which she was standing But said nothing What are you doing here You oughtn t to be out without anything on said he you re fixing to take your death He had good reason to say so But she gave him no more heed than the wind What are you waiting here for What do you want I have nothing better to do with my time said he I thought I d walk up and down here a little You go in Are you waiting to see uncle Rolf she said with teeth chattering You mustn t stay out here said he earnestly you re like nothing but a spook this minute I d rather see one or a hull army of em Go in go in Tell me if you want to see him Seth No I don t I told you I didn t Then why are you waiting for him I thought I d see if he was coming home to night I had a word to say if I could catch him before he got into the house Is he coming home to night said Fleda I don t know said he looking at her Do you Fleda burst open the gate between them and putting her hands on his implored him to tell her what was the matter He looked singularly disturbed his fine eye twinkled with compassion but his face never a weak one shewed no signs of yielding now The matter is said he pressing hard both her hands that you are fixing to be down sick in your bed by to morrow You mustn t stay another second Come in then No not to night You won t tell me There is nothing I can tell you Maybe there ll be nothing to tell Run in run in and keep quiet Fleda hurried back to the house feeling that she had gone to the limit of risk already Not daring to show herself to Hugh in her chilled state of body and mind she went into the kitchen Why what on earth s come over you was Barby s terrified ejaculation when she saw her I have been out and got myself cold Cold said Barby you re looking dreadful What on earth ails you Fleda Don t ask me Barby said Fleda hiding her face in her hands and shivering I made myself very cold just now Aunt Lucy doesn t feel very well and I got frightened she added presently What s the matter with her I don t know if you ll make me a cup of tea I ll take it up to her Barby You put yourself down there said Barby placing her with gentle force in a chair you ll do no such a thing till I see you look as if there was some blood in you I ll take it up myself But Fleda held her though with a hand much too feeble indeed for any but moral suasion It was enough Barby stood silently and very anxiously watching her till the fire had removed the outward chill at least But even that took long to do and before it was well done Fleda again asked for the cup of tea Barby made it without a word and Fleda went to her aunt with it taking her strength from the sheer emergency Her knees trembled under her as she mounted the stairs and once a glimpse of those words flitted across her mind patient continuance in well doing It was like a lightning flash in a dark night shewing the way one must go She could lay hold of no other stay Her mind was full of one intense purpose to end the suspense She gently tried the door of her aunt s room it was unfastened and she went in missus Rossitur was lying on the bed but her first mood had changed for at Fleda s soft word and touch she half rose up and putting both arms round her waist laid her face against her There were no tears still only a succession of low moans so inexpressibly weak and plaintive that Fleda s nature could hardly bear them without giving way A more fragile support was never clung to Yet her trembling fingers in their agony moved caressingly among her aunt s hair and over her brow as she begged her when she could she was not able at first to let her know the cause that was grieving her The straightened clasp of missus Rossitur s arms and her increased moaning gave only an answer of pain But Fleda repeated the question missus Rossitur still neglecting it then made her sit down upon the bed so that she could lay her head higher on Fleda s bosom where she hid it with a mingling of fondness given and asked a poor seeking for comfort and rest that wrung her niece s heart They sat so for a little time Fleda hoping that her aunt would by degrees come to the point herself The tea stood cooling on the table not even offered not wanted there Wouldn t you feel better if you told me dear aunt Lucy said Fleda when they had been for a little while perfectly still Even the moaning had ceased Is your uncle come home whispered missus Rossitur but so low that Fleda could but half catch the words Not yet What o clock is it I don t know not early it must be near eight Why You have not heard anything of him No nothing There was silence again for a little and then missus Rossitur said in a low fearful whisper Have you seen anybody round the house Fleda s thoughts flew to Seth with that nameless fear to which she could give neither shape nor direction and after a moment s hesitation she said What do you mean Have you said missus Rossitur with more energy Seth Plumfield was here a little while ago Her aunt had the clew that she had not for with a half scream half exclamation she quitted Fleda s arms and fell back upon the pillows turning from her and hiding her face there Fleda prayed again for her confidence as well as the weakness and the strength of fear could do and missus Rossitur presently grasping a paper that lay on the bed held it out to her saying only as Fleda was about quitting the room Bring me a light Fleda left the letter there and went down to fetch one She commanded herself under the excitement and necessity of the moment all but her face that terrified Barby exceedingly But she spoke with a strange degree of calmness told her missus Rossitur was not alarmingly ill that she did not need Barby s services and wished to see nobody but herself and didn t want a fire As she was passing through the hall again Hugh came out of the sitting room to ask after his mother Fleda kept the light from her face She does not want to be disturbed I hope she will be better to morrow What is the matter Fleda I don t know yet And you are ill yourself Fleda you are ill No I shall do very well never mind me Hugh take some tea I will be down by and by He went back and Fieda went up stairs missus Rossitur had not moved Fleda set down the light and herself beside it with the paper her aunt had given her It was a letter Queechy Thursday It gives me great concern my dear madam to be the means of bringing to you a piece of painful information but it cannot be long kept from your knowledge and you may perhaps learn it better from me than by any other channel May I entreat you not to be too much alarmed since I am confident the cause will be of short duration Pardon me for what I am about to say There are proceedings entered into against mister Rossitur there are writs out against him on the charge of having some years ago endorsed my father s name upon a note of his own giving Why it has lain so long I cannot explain There is unhappily no doubt of the fact I was in Queechy some days ago on business of my own when I became aware that this was going on my father had made no mention of it to me I immediately took strict measures I am happy to say I believe with complete success to have the matter kept a profound secret I then made my way as fast as possible to New York to confer on the subject with the original mover of it unfortunately I was disappointed My father had left for a neighbouring city to be absent several days Finding myself too late to prevent as I had hoped to do any open steps from being taken at Queechy I returned hither immediately to enforce secrecy of proceedings and to assure you madam that my utmost exertions shall not be wanting to bring the whole matter to a speedy and satisfactory termination I entertain no doubt of being able to succeed entirely even to the point of having the whole transaction remain unknown and unsuspected by the world It is so entirely as yet with the exception of one or two law officers whose silence I have means of procuring May I confess that I am not entirely disinterested May the selfishness of human nature ask its reward and own its moving spring May I own that my zeal in this cause is quickened by the unspeakable excellencies of mister Rossitur s lovely niece which I have learned to appreciate with my whole heart and be forgiven And may I hope for the kind offices and intercession of the lady I have the honour of addressing with her niece Miss Ringgan that my reward the single word of encouragement I ask for may be given me Having that I will promise anything I will guaranty the success of any enterprise however difficult to which she may impel me and I will undertake that the matter which furnishes the painful theme of this letter shall never more be spoken or thought of by the world or my father or by missus Rossitur s obliged grateful and faithful servant Lewis Thorn Fleda felt as she read as if icicles were gathering about her heart The whirlwind of fear and distress of a little while ago which could take no definite direction seemed to have died away and given place to a dead frost the steady bearing down of disgrace and misery inevitable unmitigable unchangeable no lessening no softening of that blasting power no nor ever any rising up from under it the landscape could never be made to smile again It was the fall of a bright star from their home constellation but alas the star was fallen long ago and the failure of light which they had deplored was all too easily accounted for yet now they knew that no restoration was to be hoped And the mother and son what would become of them And the father what would become of him what further distress was in store Public disgrace and Fleda bowed her head forward on her clasped hands with the mechanical vain endeavour to seek rest or shelter from thought She made nothing of mister Thorn s professions she took only the facts of his letter the rest her eye had glanced over as if she had no concern with it and it hardly occurred to her that she had any But the sense of his words she had taken in and knew better perhaps than her aunt that there was nothing to look for from his kind offices The weight on her heart was too great just then for her to suspect as she did afterwards that he was the sole mover of the whole affair As the first confusion of thought cleared away two images of distress loomed up and filled the view her aunt broken under the news and Hugh still unknowing to them her own separate existence Fleda was hardly conscious of Hugh especially how was he to be told and how could he bear to hear with his most sensitive conformation of both physical and moral nature And if an arrest should take place there that night Fleda shuddered and unable to go on thinking rose up and went to her aunt s bedside It had not entered her mind till the moment she read mister Thorn s letter that Seth Plumfield was sheriff for the county She was shaking again from head to foot with fear She could not say anything the touch of her lips to the throbbing temples soft and tender as sympathy itself was all she ventured Have you heard anything of him missus Rossitur whispered No I doubt if we do at all to night There was a half breathed Oh of indescribable pain and longing and with a restless change of position missus Rossitur gathered herself up on the bed and sat with her head leaning on her knees Fleda brought a large cloak and put it round her I am in no danger she said I wish I were Again Fleda s lips softly tremblingly touched her cheek missus Rossitur put her arm round her and drew her down to her side upon the bed and wrapped half of the big cloak about her and they sat there still in each other s arms without speaking or weeping while quarter after quarter of an hour passed away nobody knew how many And the cold bright moonlight streamed in on the floor mocking them Go whispered missus Rossitur at last go down stairs and take care of yourself and Hugh Won t you come missus Rossitur shook her head Mayn t I bring you something do let me But missus Rossitur s shake of the head was decisive Fleda crawled off the bed feeling as if a month s illness had been making its ravages upon her frame and strength She stood a moment to collect her thoughts but alas thinking was impossible there was a palsy upon her mind She went into her own room and for a minute kneeled down not to form a petition in words she was as much beyond that it was only the mute attitude of appeal the pitiful outward token of the mind s bearing that could not be forborne a silent uttering of the plea she had made her own in happy days There was something of comfort in the mere feeling of doing it and there was more in one or two words that even in that blank came to her mind Like as a father pitieth his children so the Lord pitieth them that fear him and she again recollected that Providence runneth not upon broken wheels Nothing could be darker than the prospect before her and these things did not bring light but they gave her a sure stay to hold on by and keep her feet a bit of strength to preserve from utterly fainting Ah the storehouse must be filled and the mind well familiarized with what is stored in it while yet the days are bright or it will never be able to find what it wants in the dark Fleda first went into the kitchen to tell Barby to fasten the doors and not sit up I don t believe uncle Rolf will be home to night but if he comes I will let him in Barby looked at her with absolutely a face of distress but not daring to ask and not knowing how to propose anything she looked in silence It must be nine o clock now Fleda went on And how long be you going to sit up said Barby I don t know a while yet You look proper for it said Barby half sorrowfully and half indignantly you look as if a straw would knock you down this minute There s sense into everything You catch me a going to bed and leaving you up It won t do me no hurt to sit here the hull night and I m the only one in the house that s fit for it with the exception of Philetus and the little wit he has by day seems to forsake him at night All the light that ever gets into his head I believe comes from the outside as soon as ever that s gone he shuts up his shutters He s been snoozing a ready now this hour and a half Go yourself off to bed Fleda she added with a mixture of reproach and kindness and leave me alone to take care of myself and the house too Fleda did not remonstrate for Barby was as determined in her way as it was possible for anything to be She went into the other room without a particle of notion what she should say or do Hugh was walking up and down the floor a most unusual sign of perturbation with him He met and stopped her as she came in Fleda I cannot bear it What is the matter Do you know he said as her eyes fell Yes What is it She was silent and tried to pass on to the fire But he stayed her What is it he repeated Oh I wish I could keep it from you said Fleda bursting into tears He was still a moment and then bringing her to the arm chair made her sit down and stood himself before her silently waiting perhaps because he could not speak perhaps from the accustomed gentle endurance of his nature But Fleda was speechless too You are keeping me in distress he said at length I cannot end the distress dear Hugh said Fleda She saw him change colour and he stood motionless still Do you remember said Fleda trembling even to her voice what Rutherford says about Providence not running on broken wheels He gave her no answer but the intent look of expectation Its intentness paralyzed Fleda She did not know how to go on She rose from her chair and hung upon his shoulder Believe it now if you can for oh dear Hugh we have something to try it It is strange my father don t come home said he supporting her with tenderness which had very little strength to help it we want him very much Whether or not any unacknowledged feeling prompted this remark some slight involuntary movement of Fleda s made him ask suddenly Is it about him He had grown deadly pale and Fleda answered eagerly Nothing that has happened to day it is not anything that has happened to day he is perfectly well I trust and believe But it is about him Fleda s head sank and she burst into such an agony of tears that Hugh s distress was for a time divided When did it happen Fleda Years ago And what Fleda hesitated still and then said It was something he did Hugh What He put another person s name on the back of a note he gave She did not look up and Hugh was silent for a moment How do you know mister Thorn wrote it to aunt Lucy it was mister Thorn s father Hugh sat down and leaned his head on the table A long long time passed unmeasured by the wild coursing of thought to and fro Then Fleda came and knelt down at the table beside him and put her arm round his neck Dear Hugh she said and if ever love and tenderness and sympathy could be distilled in tones such drops were those that fell upon the mind s ear can t you look up at me He did then but he did not give her a chance to look at him He locked his arms about her bringing her close to his breast and for a few minutes in utter silence they knew what strange sweetness pure affection can mingle even in the communion of sorrow There were tears shed in those minutes that bitter as they seemed at the time Memory knew had been largely qualified with another admixture Dear Hugh said Fleda let us keep what we can won t you go to bed and rest He looked dreadfully as if he needed it But the usual calmness and sweetness of his face was not altered it was only deepened to very great sadness Mentally Fleda thought he had borne the shock better than his mother for the bodily frame she trembled He had not answered and she spoke again You need it worse than I poor Fleda I will go too presently I do not think anybody will be here tonight Is Are there Is this what has taken him away said Hugh Her silence and her look told him and then laying her cheek again alongside of his she whispered how unsteadily We have only one help dear Hugh They were still and quiet again for minutes counting the pulses of pain till Fleda came back to her poor wish to keep what they could She mixed a restorative of wine and water which however little desired she felt was necessary for both of them and Hugh went up stairs She staid a few minutes to prepare another glass with particular care for her aunt It was just finished and taking her candle she had bid Barby good night when there came a loud rap at the front door Fleda set down candle and glass from the quick inability to hold them as well as for other reasons and she and Barby stood and looked at each other in such a confusion of doubt and dread that some little time had passed before either stirred even her eyes Barby then threw down the tongs with which she had begun to make preparations for covering up the fire and set off to the front You mustn t open the door Barby cried Fleda following her Come in here and let us look out of one of the windows Before this could be reached however there was another prolonged repetition of the first thundering burst It went through Fleda s heart because of the two up stairs who must hear it Barby threw up the sash Who s there Is this mister Rossitur s place enquired a gruff voice Yes it is Well will you come round and open the door Who wants it open A lady wants it open A lady what lady Down yonder in the carriage What lady who is she I don t know who she is she wanted to come to mister Rossitur s place will you open the door for her Barby and Fleda both now saw a carriage standing in the road We must see who it is first whispered Fleda When the lady comes I ll open the door was Barby s ultimatum The man withdrew to the carriage and after a few moments of intense watching Fleda and Barby certainly saw something in female apparel enter the little gate of the court yard and come up over the bright moonlit snow towards the house accompanied by a child while the man with whom they had had the interview came behind transformed into an unmistakeable baggage carrier Chapter XL Zeal was the spring whence flowed her hardiment Fairfax Barby undid bolt and lock and Fleda met the traveller in the hall She was a lady her air and dress shewed that though the latter was very plain Does mister Rossitur live here was her first word Fleda answered it and brought her visitor into the sitting room But the light falling upon a form and face that had seen more wear and tear than time gave her no clue as to the who or what of the person before her The stranger s hurried look round the room seemed to expect something Are they all gone to bed All but me said Fleda We have been delayed we took a wrong road we ve been riding for hours to find the place hadn t the right direction Then looking keenly at Fleda from whose vision an electric spark of intelligence had scattered the clouds she said I am Marion Rossitur I knew it said Fleda with lips and eyes that gave her already a sister s welcome and they were folded in each other s arms almost as tenderly and affectionately on the part of one at least as if there had really been the relationship between them But more than surprise and affection struck Fleda s heart And where are they all Fleda Can t I see them You must wait till I have prepared them Hugh and aunt Lucy are not very well I don t know that it will do for you to see them at all to night Marion Not to night They are not ill No only enough to be taken care of not ill But it would be better to wait And my father He is not at home Marion exclaimed in sorrow and Fleda to hide the look that she felt was on her face stooped down to kiss the child He was a remarkably fine looking manly boy That is your cousin Fleda said his mother No aunt Fleda said the person thus introduced don t put me off into cousindom Marion I am uncle Hugh s sister and so I am your aunt Fleda Who are you Rolf Rossitur Schwiden Alas how wide are the ramifications of evil How was what might have been very pure pleasure utterly poisoned and turned into bitterness It went through Fleda s heart with a keen pang when she heard that name and looked on the very fair brow that owned it and thought of the ineffaceable stain that had come upon both She dared look at nobody but the child He already understood the melting eyes that were making acquaintance with his and half felt the pain that gave so much tenderness to her kiss and looked at her with a grave face of awakening wonder and sympathy Fleda was glad to have business to call her into the kitchen Who is it was Barby s immediate question Aunt Lucy s daughter She don t look much like her said Barby intelligently They will want something to eat Barby I ll put the kettle on It ll boil directly I ll go in there and fix up the fire A word or two more and then Fleda ran up to speak to her aunt and Hugh Her aunt she found in a state of agitation that was frightful Even Fleda s assurances with all the soothing arts she could bring to bear were some minutes before they could in any measure tranquillize her Fleda s own nerves were in no condition to stand another shock when she left her and went to Hugh s door But she could get no answer from him though she spoke repeatedly She did not return to her aunt s room She went down stairs and brought up Barby and a light from thence Hugh was lying senseless and white not whiter than his adopted sister as she stood by his side Her eye went to her companion Not a bit of it said Barby he s in nothing but a faint just run down stairs and get the vinegar bottle Fleda the pepper vinegar Is there any water here Fleda obeyed and watched she could do little more the efforts of Barby who indeed needed no help with the cold water the vinegar and rubbing of the limbs They were for sometime unsuccessful the fit was a severe one and Fleda was exceedingly terrified before any signs of returning life came to reassure her Now you go down stairs and keep quiet said Barby when Hugh was fairly restored and had smiled a faint answer to Fleda s kiss and explanations Go Fleda you ain t fit to stand Go and sit down some place and I ll be along directly and see how the fire burns Don t you s pose Mis Rossitur could come in and sit in this easy chair a spell without hurting herself It occurred to Fleda immediately that it might do more good than harm to her aunt if her attention were diverted even by another cause of anxiety She gently summoned her telling her no more than was necessary to fit her for being Hugh s nurse and in a very few minutes she and Barby were at liberty to attend to other claims upon them But it sank into her heart Hugh will not get over this and when she entered the sitting room what mister Carleton years before had said of the wood flower was come true in its fullest extent a storm wind had beaten it to the ground She was able literally to do no more than Barby had said sit down and keep herself quiet Miss Elster was in her briskest mood flew in and out made up the fire in the sitting room and put on the kettle in the kitchen which she had been just about doing when called to see Hugh The much needed supper of the travellers must be still waited for but the fire was burning now the room was cosily warm and bright and Marion drew up her chair with a look of thoughtful contentment Fleda felt as if some conjuror had been at work here for the last few hours the room looked so like and felt so unlike itself Are you going to be ill too Fleda said Marion suddenly You are looking very far from well I shall have a headache to morrow said Fleda quietly I generally know the day beforehand Does it always make you look so Not always I am somewhat tired Where is my father gone I don t know Rolf dear said Fleda bending forward to the little fellow who was giving expression to some very fidgety impatience what is the matter what do you want The child s voice fell a little from its querulousness towards the sweet key in which the questions had been put but he gave utterance to a very decided wish for bread and butter Come here said Fleda reaching out a hand and drawing him certainly with no force but that of attraction towards her easy chair come here and rest yourself in this nice place by me see there is plenty of room for you and you shall have bread and butter and tea and something else too I guess just as soon as Barby can get it ready Who is Barby was the next question in a most uncompromising tone of voice You saw the woman that came in to put wood on the fire that was Barby she is very good and kind and will do anything for you if you behave yourself The child muttered but so low as to shew some unwillingness that his words should reach the ears that were nearest him that he wasn t going to behave himself Fleda did not choose to hear and went on with composing observations till the fair little face she had drawn to her side was as bright as the sun and returned her smile with interest You have an admirable talent at moral suasion Fleda said the mother half smiling I wish I had it You don t need it so much here Why not It may do very well for me but I think not so well for you Why what do you mean I think it is the only way in the world to bring up children the only way fit for rational beings to be guided Fleda smiled though the faintest indication that lips could give and shook her head ever so little Why do you do that tell me Because in my limited experience said Fleda as she passed her fingers through the boy s dark locks of hair in every household where moral suasion has been the law the children have been the administrators of it Where is your husband I have lost him years ago said Marion with a quick expressive glance towards the child I never lost what I at first thought I had for I never had it Do you understand Fleda s eyes gave a sufficient answer I am a widow these five years in all but what the law would require Marion went on I have been alone since then except my child He was two years old then and since then I have lived such a life Fleda Why didn t you come home Couldn t the most absolute reason in the world Think of it Come home It was as much as I could do to stay there Those sympathizing eyes were enough to make her go on I have wanted everything except trouble I have done everything except ask alms I have learned Fleda that death is not the worst form in which distress can come Fleda felt stung and bent down her head to touch her lips to the brow of little Rolf Death would have been a trifle said Marion I mean not that I should have wished to leave Rolf alone in the world but if I had been left I mean I would rather wear outside than inside mourning Fleda looked up again and at her O I was so mistaken Fleda she said clasping her hands so mistaken in everything so disappointed in all my hopes And the loss of my fortune was the cause of it all Nay verily thought Fleda but she said nothing she hung her head again and Marion after a pause went on to question her about an endless string of matters concerning themselves and other people past doings and present prospects till little Rolf soothed by the uninteresting soft murmur of voices fairly forgot bread and butter and himself in a sound sleep his head resting upon Fleda Here is one comfort for you Marion she said looking down at the dark eyelashes which lay on a cheek rosy and healthy as ever seven years old knew he is a beautiful child and I am sure a fine one It is thanks to his beauty that I have ever seen home again said his mother Fleda had no heart this evening to speak words that were not necessary her eyes asked Marion to explain herself He was in Hyde Park one day I had a miserable lodging not far from it and I used to let him go in there because he must go somewhere you know I couldn t go with him Why not Couldn t Oh Fleda I have seen changes He was there one afternoon alone and had got into difficulty with some bigger boys a little fellow you know he stood his ground man fully but his strength wasn t equal to his spirit and they were tyrannizing over him after the fashion of boys who are I do think the ugliest creatures in creation said Mme Schwiden not apparently reckoning her own to be of the same gender and a gentleman who was riding by stopped and interfered and took him out of their hands and then asked him his name struck I suppose with his appearance Very kind wasn t it men so seldom bother themselves about what becomes of children I suppose there were thousands of others riding by at the same time Very kind Fleda said When he heard what his name was he gave his horse to his servant and walked home with Rolf and the next day he sent me a note speaking of having known my father and mother and asking permission to call upon me I never was so mortified I think in my life said Marion after a moment s hesitation Why said Fleda not a little at a loss to follow out the chain of her cousin s reasoning Why I was in such a sort of a place you don t know Fleda I was working then for a fancy store keeper to support myself living in a miserable little two rooms If it had been a stranger I wouldn t have cared so much but somebody that had known us in different times I hadn t a thing in the world to answer the note upon but a half sheet of letter paper Fleda s lips sought Rolf s forehead again with a curious rush of tears and smiles at once Perhaps Marion had caught the expression of her countenance for she added with a little energy It is nothing to be surprised at you would have felt just the same for I knew by his note the whole style of it what sort of a person it must be My pride has been a good deal chastened Fleda said gently I never want mine to be beyond minding everything said Marion and I don t believe yours is I don t know why in the world I did not refuse to see him I had fifty minds to but he had won Rolf s heart and I was a little curious and it was something strange to see the face of a friend any better one than my old landlady so I let him come Was she a friend said Fleda If she hadn t been I should not have lived to be here the best soul that ever was but still you know she could do nothing for me but be as kind as she could live this was something different So I let him come and he came the next day Fleda was silent a little wondering that Marion should be so frank with her beyond what she had ever been in former years but as she guessed Mme Schwiden s heart was a little opened by the joy of finding herself at home and the absolute necessity of talking to somebody and there was a further reason which Fleda could not judge of in her own face and manner Marion needed no questions and went on again after stopping a moment I was so glad in five minutes I can t tell you Fleda that I had let him come I forget entirely about how I looked and the wretched place I was in He was all that I had supposed and a great deal more but somehow he hadn t been in the room three minutes before I didn t care at all for all the things I had thought would trouble me Isn t it strange what a witchery some people have to make you forget everything but themselves The reason is I think because that is the only thing they forget said Fleda whose imagination however was entirely busy with the singular number I shall never forget him said Marion He was very kind to me I cannot tell how kind though I never realized it till afterwards at the time it always seemed only a sort of elegant politeness which he could not help I never saw so elegant a person He came two or three times to see me and he took Rolf out with him I don t know how often to drive and he sent me fruit such fruit and game and flowers and I had not had anything of the kind not even seen it for so long I can t tell you what it was to me He said he had known my father and mother well when they were abroad What was his name said Fleda quickly I don t know he never told me and I never could ask him Don t you know there are some people you can t do anything with but just what they please There wasn t the least thing like stiffness you never saw anybody less stiff but I never dreamed of asking him questions except when he was out of sight Why do you know him she said suddenly When you tell me who he was I ll tell you said Fleda smiling Have you ever heard this story before Certainly not He is somebody that knows us very well said Marion for he asked after every one of the family in particular But what had all this to do with your getting home I don t wonder you ask The day after his last visit came a note saying that he owed a debt in my family which it had never been in his power to repay that he could not give the enclosure to my father who would not recognize the obligation and that if I would permit him to place it in my hands I should confer a singular favour upon him And what was the enclosure Five hundred pounds Fleda s head went down again and tears dropped fast upon little Rolf s shoulder I suppose my pride has been a little broken too Marion went on or I shouldn t have kept it But then if you saw the person and the whole manner of it I don t know how I could ever have sent it back Literally I couldn t though for I hadn t the least clue I never saw or heard from him afterwards When was this Marion Last spring Last spring then what kept you so long Because of the arrival of eyes that I was afraid of I dared not make the least move that would show I could move I came off the very first packet after I was free How glad you must be said Fleda Glad Glad of what mamma said Rolf whose dreams the entrance of Barby had probably disturbed Glad of bread and butter said his mother wake up here it is The young gentleman declared rubbing his eyes that he did not want it now but however Fleda contrived to dispel that illusion and bread and butter was found to have the same dulcifying properties at Queechy that it owns in all the rest of the world Little Rolf was completely mollified after a hearty meal and was put with his mother to enjoy most unbroken slumbers in Fleda s room Fleda herself after a look at Hugh crept to her aunt s bed whither Barby very soon despatched missus Rossitur taking in her place the arm chair and the watch with most invincible good will and determination and sleep at last took the joys and sorrows of that disturbed household into its kind custody Fleda was the first one awake and was thinking how she should break the last news to her aunt when missus Rossitur put her arms round her and after a most affectionate look and kiss spoke to what she supposed had been her niece s purpose You want taking care of more than I do poor Fleda It was not for that I came said Fleda I had to give up my room to the travellers Travellers A very few words more brought out the whole and missus Rossitur sprang out of bed and rushed to her daughter s room Fleda hid her face in the bed to cry for a moment s passionate indulgence in weeping while no one could see But a moment was all There was work to do and she must not disable herself She slowly got up feeling thankful that her headache did not announce itself with the dawn and that she would be able to attend to the morning affairs and the breakfast which was something more of a circumstance now with the new additions to the family More than that she knew from sure signs she would not be able to accomplish It was all done and done well though with what secret flagging of mind and body nobody knew or suspected The business of the day was arranged Barby s course made clear Hugh visited and smiled upon and then Fleda set herself down in the breakfast room to wear out the rest of the day in patient suffering Her little spaniel who seemed to understand her languid step and faint tones and know what was coming crept into her lap and looked up at her with a face of equal truth and affection and after a few gentle acknowledging touches from the loved hand laid his head on her knees and silently avowed his determination of abiding her fortunes for the remainder of the day They had been there for some hours missus Rossitur and her daughter were gathered in Hugh s room whither Rolf also after sundry expressions of sympathy for Fleda s headache finding it a dull companion had departed Pain of body rising above pain of mind had obliged as far as possible even thought to be still when a loud rap at the front door brought the blood in a sudden flush of pain to Fleda s face She knew instinctively what it meant She heard Barby s distinct accents saying that somebody was not well The other voice was more smothered But in a moment the door of the breakfast room opened and mister Thorn walked in The intensity of the pain she was suffering effectually precluded Fleda from discovering emotion of any kind She could not move Only King lifted up his head and looked at the intruder who seemed shocked and well he might Fleda was in her old headache position bolt upright on the sofa her feet on the rung of a chair while her hands supported her by their grasp upon the back of it The flush had passed away leaving the deadly paleness of pain which the dark rings under her eyes shewed to be well seated Miss Ringgan said the gentleman coming up softly as to something that frightened him my dear Miss Fleda I am distressed You are very ill can nothing be done to relieve you Fleda s lips rather than her voice said Nothing I would not have come in on any account to disturb you if I had known I did not understand you were more than a trifle ill Fleda wished he would mend his mistake as his understanding certainly by this time was mended But that did not seem to be his conclusion of the best thing to do Since I am here can you bear to hear me say three words without too much pain I do not ask you to speak A faint whispered yes gave him leave to go on She had never looked at him She sat like a statue to answer by a motion of her head was more than could be risked He drew up a chair and sat down while King looked at him with eyes of suspicious indignation I am not surprised he said gently to find you suffering I knew how your sensibilities must feel the shock of yesterday I would fain have spared it you I will spare you all further pain on the same score if possible Dear Miss Ringgan since I am here and time is precious may I say one word before I cease troubling you take it for granted that you were made acquainted with the contents of my letter to missus Rossitur with all the contents were you Again Fleda s lips almost voicelessly gave the answer Will you give me what I ventured to ask for said he gently the permission to work for you Do not trouble those precious lips to speak the answer of these fingers will be as sure a warrant to me as all words that could be spoken that you do not deny my request He had taken one of her hands in his own But the fingers lay with unanswering coldness and lifelessness for a second in his clasp and then were drawn away and took determinate hold of the chair back Again the flush came to Fleda s cheeks brought by a sharp pain oh bodily and mental too and after a moment s pause with a distinctness of utterance that let him know every word she said A generous man would not ask it sir Thorn sprang up and several times paced the length of the room up and down before he said anything more He looked at Fleda but the flush was gone again and nothing could seem less conscious of his presence Pain and patience were in every line of her face but he could read nothing more except a calmness as unmistakably written Thorn gave that face repeated glances as he walked then stood still and read it at leisure Then he came to her side again and spoke in a different voice You are so unlike anybody else he said that you shall make me unlike myself I will do freely what I hoped to do with the light of your smile before me You shall hear no more of this affair neither you nor the world I have the matter perfectly in my own hands it shall never raise a whisper again I will move heaven and earth rather than fail but there is no danger of my failing I will try to prove myself worthy of your esteem even where a man is most excusable for being selfish Illustration Barby s energies and fainting remedies were again put in use He took one of her cold hands again Fleda could not help it without more force than she cared to use and indeed pain would by this time almost have swallowed up other sensation if every word and touch had not sent it in a stronger throb to her very finger ends Thorn bent his lips to her hand twice kissed it fervently and then left her much to King s satisfaction who thereupon resigned himself to quiet slumbers His mistress knew no such relief Excitement had dreadfully aggravated her disorder at a time when it was needful to banish even thought as far as possible Pain effectually banished it now and Barby coming in a little after mister Thorn had gone found her quite unable to speak and scarce able to breathe from agony Barby s energies and fainting remedies were again put in use but pain reigned triumphant for hours and when its hard rule was at last abated Fleda was able to do nothing but sleep like a child for hours more Towards a late tea time she was at last awake and carrying on a very one sided conversation with Rolf her own lips being called upon for little more than a smile now and then King not able to be in her lap had curled himself up upon a piece of his mistress s dress and as close within the circle of her arms as possible where Fleda s hand and his head were on terms of mutual satisfaction I thought you wouldn t permit a dog to lie in your lap said Marion Do you remember that said Fleda with a smile Ah I have grown tender hearted Marion since I have known what it was to want comfort myself I have come to the conclusion that it is best to let everything have all the enjoyment it can in the circumstances King crawled into my lap one day when I had not spirits enough to turn him out and he has kept the place ever since Little King In answer to which word of intelligence King looked in her face and wagged his tail and then earnestly endeavoured to lick all her fingers Which however was a piece of comfort she would not give him Fleda said Barby putting her head in I wish you d just step out here and tell me which cheese you d like to have cut What a fool said Marion Let her cut them all if she likes She is no fool said Fleda She thought Barby s punctiliousness however a little ill timed as she rose from her sofa and went into the kitchen Well you do look as if you wa n t good for nothing but to be taken care of said Barby I wouldn t have riz you up if it hadn t been just tea time and I knowed you couldn t stay quiet much longer and with a look which explained her tactics she put into Fleda s hand a letter directed to her aunt Philetus gave it to me she said without a glance at Fleda s face he said it was give to him by a spry little shaver who wa n t a mind to tell nothin about himself Thank you Barby was Fleda s most grateful return and summoning her aunt up stairs she took her into her own room and locked the door before she gave her the letter which Barby s shrewdness and delicacy had taken such care should not reach its owner in a wrong way Fleda watched her as her eye ran over the paper and caught it as it fell from her fingers My Dear Wife That villain Thorn has got a handle of me which he will not fail to use you know it all I suppose by this time It is true that in an evil hour long ago when greatly pressed I did what I thought I should surely undo in a few days The time never came I don t know why he has let it lie so long but he has taken it up now and he will push it to the extreme There is but one thing left for me I shall not see you again The rascal would never let me rest I know in any spot that calls itself American ground You will do better without me than with me R R Fleda mused over the letter for several minutes and then touched her aunt who had fallen on a chair with her head sunk in her hands What does he mean said missus Rossitur looking up with a perfectly colourless face To leave the country Are you sure is that it said missus Rossitur rising and looking over the words again He would do anything Fleda That is what he means aunt Lucy don t you see he says he could not be safe anywhere in America missus Rossitur stood eying with intense eagerness for a minute or two the note in her niece s hand Then he is gone now that it is all settled And we don t know where and we can t get word to him Her cheek which had a little brightened became perfectly white again He isn t gone yet he can t be he cannot have left Queechy till to day he will be in New York for several days yet probably New York it may be Boston No he would be more likely to go to New York I am sure he would he is accustomed to it We might write to both places said poor missus Rossitur I will do it and send them off at once But he might not get the letters said Fleda thoughtfully he might not dare to ask at the post office His wife looked at that possibility and then wrung her hands Oh why didn t he give us a clew Fleda put an arm round her affectionately and stood thinking stood trembling might as well be said for she was too weak to be standing at all What can we do dear Fleda said missus Rossitur in great distress Once out of New York and we can get nothing to him If he only knew that there is no need and that it is all over We must do everything aunt Lucy said Fleda thoughtfully and I hope we shall succeed yet We will write but I think the most hopeful other thing we could do would be to put advertisements in the newspapers he would be very likely to see them Advertisements But you couldn t what would you put in Something that would catch his eye and nobody s else that is easy aunt Lucy But there is nobody to put them in Fleda you said uncle Orrin was going to Boston He wasn t going there till next week but he was to be in Philadelphia a few days before that the letter might miss him mister Plumfield Couldn t he But Fleda shook her head Wouldn t do aunt Lucy he would do all he could but he don t know New York nor the papers he wouldn t know how to manage it he don t know uncle Rolf shouldn t like to trust it to him Who then there isn t a creature we could ask Fleda laid her cheek to her poor aunt s and said I ll do it But you must be in New York to do it dear Fleda you can t do it here I will go to New York When To morrow morning But dear Fleda you can t go alone I can t let you and you re not fit to go at all my poor child and between conflicting feelings missus Rossitur sat down and wept without measure Listen aunt Lucy said Fleda pressing a hand on her shoulder listen and don t cry so I ll go and make all right if efforts can do it I am not going alone I ll get Seth to go with me and I can sleep in the cars and rest nicely in the steamboat I shall feel happy and well when I know that I am leaving you easier and doing all that can be done to bring uncle Rolf home Leave me to manage and don t say anything to Marion it is one blessed thing that she need not know anything about all this I shall feel better than if I were at home and had trusted this business to any other hands You are the blessing of my life said missus Rossitur Cheer up and come down and let us have some tea said Fleda kissing her I feel as if that would make me up a little and then I ll write the letters I sha n t want but very little baggage there ll be nothing to pack up Philetus was sent up the hill with a note to Seth Plumfield and brought home a favorable answer Fleda thought as she went to rest that it was well the mind s strength could sometimes act independently of its servant the body hers felt so very shattered and unsubstantial Chapter XLI I thank you for your company but good faith I had as lief have been myself alone As You Like It The first thing next morning Seth Plumfield came down to say that he had seen doctor Quackenboss the night before and had chanced to find out that he was going to New York too this very day and knowing that the doctor would be just as safe an escort as himself Seth had made over the charge of his cousin to him calculating he said that it would make no difference to Fleda and that he had better stay at home with his mother Fleda said nothing and looked as little as possible of her disappointment and her cousin went away wholly unsuspecting of it Seth Plumfield ha n t done a smarter thing than that in a good while Barby remarked satirically as he was shutting the door I should think he d ha hurt himself I dare say the doctor will take good care of me said Fleda as good as he knows how Men beat all said Barby impatiently The little sense there is into them Fleda s sinking heart was almost ready to echo the sentiment but nobody knew it Coffee was swallowed her little travelling bag and bonnet on the sofa all ready Then came the doctor My dear Miss Ringgan I am most happy of this delightful opportunity I had supposed you were located at home for the winter This is a sudden start Is it sudden to you doctor Quackenboss said Fleda Why a not disagreeably so said the doctor smiling nothing could be that in the present circumstances but I a I hadn t calculated upon it for much of a spell beforehand Fleda was vexed and looked only unconversable I suppose said the doctor after a pause that we have not much time to waste a in idle moments Which route do you intend to travel I was thinking to go by the North River sir But the ice has collected I am afraid At Albany I know but when I came up there was a boat every other day and we could get there in time by the stage this is her day But we have had some pretty tight weather since if you remember said the doctor and the boats have ceased to connect with the stage We shall have to go to Greenfield to take the Housatonic which will land us at Bridgeport on the Sound Have we time to reach Greenfield this morning Oceans of time said the doctor delightedly I ve got my team here and they re jumping out of their skins with having nothing to do and the weather they ll carry us there as spry as grasshoppers now if you re ready my dear Miss Ringgan There was nothing more but to give and receive those speechless lip messages that are out of the reach of words and missus Rossitur s half spoken last charge to take care of herself and with these seals upon her mission Fleda set forth and joined the doctor thankful for one foil to curiosity in the shape of a veil and only wishing that there were any invented screen that she could place between her and hearing I hope your attire is of a very warm description said the doctor as he helped her into the wagon it friz pretty hard last night and I don t think it has got out of the notion yet If I had been consulted in any other a form than that of a friend I should have disapprobated if you ll excuse me Miss Ringgan s travelling again before her Rose of Cassius there was in blow I hope you have heard no evil tidings doctor a Gregory I hope is not taken ill I hope not sir said Fleda He didn t look like it A very hearty old gentleman Not very old either I should judge Was he the brother of your mother or your father Neither sir Ah I misunderstood I thought but of course I was mistaken I thought I heard you speak to him under the title of uncle But that is a title we sometimes give to elderly people as a term of familiarity there is an old fellow that works for me he has been a long time in our family and we always call him uncle Jenk Fleda was ready to laugh cry and be angry in a breath She looked straight before her and was mum That Rose of Cassius is a most exquisite thing said the doctor recurring to the cluster of bare bushy stems in the corner of the garden Did mister Rossitur bring it with him when he came to his present residence Yes sir Where is mister Rossitur now Fleda replied with a jump of her heart that business affairs had obliged him to be away for a few days And when does he expect to return said the doctor I hope he will be home as soon as I am said Fleda Then you do not expect to remain long in the city this time I shall not have much of a winter at home if I do said Fleda We are almost at January Because said the doctor in that case I should have no higher gratification than in attending upon your motions I a beg you to believe my dear Miss Ringgan that it would afford me the a most particular it would be most particularly grateful to me to wait upon you to a the confines of the world Fleda hastened to assure her officious friend that the time of her return was altogether uncertain resolving rather to abide a guest with missus Pritchard than to have doctor Quackenboss hanging upon her motions every day of her being there But in the mean time the doctor got upon captain Rossitur s subject then came to mister Thorn and then wanted to know the exact nature of mister Rossitur s business affairs in Michigan through all which matters poor Fleda had to run the gauntlet of questions interspersed with gracious speeches which she could bear even less well She was extremely glad to reach the cars and take refuge in seeming sleep from the mongrel attentions which if for the most part prompted by admiration owned so large a share of curiosity Her weary head and heart would fain have courted the reality of sleep as a refuge from more painful thoughts and a feeling of exhaustion that could scarcely support itself but the restless roar and jumble of the rail cars put it beyond her power How long the hours were how hard to wear out with no possibility of a change of position that would give rest Fleda would not even raise her head when they stopped for fear of being talked to how trying that endless noise to her racked nerves It came to an end at last though Fleda would not move for fear they might be only taking in wood and water Miss Ringgan said the doctor in her ear my dear Miss Ringgan we are here Are we said Fleda looking up what other name has the place doctor Why Bridgeport said the doctor we re at Bridgeport now we have leave to exchange conveyances A man feels constrained after a prolonged length of time in a place How have you enjoyed the ride Not very well it has seemed long I am glad we are at the end of it But as she rose and threw back her veil the doctor looked startled My dear Miss Ringgan are you faint No sir You are not well indeed I am very sorry the ride has been Take my arm Ma am said the doctor touching a black satin cloak which filled the passage way will you have the goodness to give this lady a passport But the black satin cloak preferred a straightforward manner of doing this so their egress was somewhat delayed Happily faintness was not the matter My dear Miss Ringgan said the doctor as they reached the ground and the outer air what was it the stove too powerful You are looking you are of a dreadfully delicate appearance I had a headache yesterday said Fleda it always leaves me with a disagreeable reminder the next day I am not ill But he looked frightened and hurried her as fast as he dared to the steamboat and there proposed half a dozen restoratives the simplest of which Fleda took and then sought delicious rest from him and from herself on the cushions of a settee Delicious though she was alone in the cabin of a steamboat with strange forms and noisy tongues around her the closed eyelids shut it out all and she had time but for one resting thought of patient continuance in well doing and one happy heart look up to him who has said that he cares for his children a look that laid her anxieties down there when past misery and future difficulty faded away before a sleep that lasted till the vessel reached her moorings and was made fast She was too weary and faint even to think during the long drive up to Bleecker saint She was fain to let it all go the work she had to do and the way she must set about it and rest in the assurance that nothing could be done that night She did not so much as hear doctor Quackenboss s observations though she answered a few of them till at the door she was conscious of his promising to see her to morrow and of her instant conclusion to take measures to see nobody How strange everything seemed She walked through the familiar hall feeling as if her acquaintance with every old thing was broken There was no light in the back parlour but a comfortable fire Is my is doctor Gregory at home she asked of the girl who had let her in No ma am he hasn t got back from Philadelphia Tell missus Pritchard a lady wants to see her Good missus Pritchard was much more frightened than doctor Quackenboss had been when she came into the back parlour to see a lady and found Fleda in the great arm chair taking off her things She poured out questions wonderings and lamentings not in a breath but in a great many quite forgot to be glad to see her she looked so dreadfully and what had been the matter Fleda answered her told of yesterday s illness and to day s journey and met all her shocked enquiries with so composed a face and such a calm smile and bearing that missus Pritchard was almost persuaded not to believe her eyes My uncle is not at home O no Miss Fleda I suppose he s in Philadelphy but his motions is so little to be depended on that I never know when I have him maybe he ll stop going through to Boston and maybe no and I don t know when so anyhow I had to have a fire made and this room all ready and ain t it lucky it was ready for you to night and now he ain t here you can have the great chair all to yourself and make yourself comfortable we can keep warmer here I guess than you can in the country said the good housekeeper giving some skilful admonishing touches to the fire and you must just sit there and read and rest and see if you can t get back your old looks again If I thought it was that you came for I d be happy I never did see such a change in any one in five days She stood looking down at her guest with a face of very serious concern evidently thinking much more than she chose to give utterance to I am tired missus Pritchard said Fleda smiling up at her I wish you had somebody to take care of you Miss Fleda that wouldn t let you tire yourself It s a sin to throw your strength away so and you don t care for looks nor nothing else when it s for other people You re looking just as handsome too for all she said her mouth giving way a little as she stooped down to take off Fleda s overshoes but that s only because you can t help it Now what is there you d like to have for supper just say and you shall have it whatever would seem best because I mightn t hit the right thing Fleda declared her indifference to everything but a cup of tea and her hostess bustled away to get that and tax her own ingenuity and kindness for the rest And leaning her weary head back in the lounge Fleda tried to think but it was not time yet she could only feel feel what a sad change had come over her since she had sat there last shut her eyes and wish she could sleep again But missus Pritchard s hospitality must be gone through with first The nicest of suppers was served in the bright little parlour and her hostess was a compound of care and good will nothing was wanting to the feast but a merry heart Fleda could not bring that so her performance was unsatisfactory and missus Pritchard was distressed Fleda went to her own room promising better doings to morrow She awoke in the morning to the full burden of care and sorrow which sheer weakness and weariness the day before had in part laid down to a quicker sense of the state of things than she had had yet The blasting evil that had fallen upon them Fleda writhed on her bed when she thought of it The sternest cruellest most inflexible grasp of distress Poverty may be borne death may be sweetened even to the survivors but disgrace Fleda hid her head as if she would shut the idea out with the light And the ruin it had wrought Affection killed at the root her aunt s happiness withered for this world Hugh s life threatened the fair name of his family gone the wear and weariness of her own spirit but that had hardly a thought Himself oh no one could tell what a possible wreck now that self respect and the esteem of others those two safe guards of character were lost to him So much security has any woman in a man without religion she remembered those words of her aunt Miriam now and she thought if mister Thorn had sought an ill wind to blow upon his pretensions he could not have pitched them better What fairer promise without religion could be than her uncle had given Reproach had never breathed against his name and no one less than those who knew him best could fancy that he had ever given it occasion And who could have more at stake and the stake was lost that was the summing up thought No it was not for Fleda s mind presently sprang beyond to the remedy and after a little swift and earnest flitting about of thought over feasibilities and contingencies she jumped up and dressed herself with a prompt energy which shewed a mind made up to its course And yet when she came down to the parlour though bending herself with nervous intentness to the work she had to do her fingers and her heart were only stayed in their trembling by some of the happy assurances she had been fleeing to Commit thy works unto the Lord and all thy thoughts shall be established In all thy ways acknowledge Him He shall direct they paths Assurances not indeed that her plans should meet with success but that they should have the issue best for them She was early but the room was warm and in order and the servant had left it Fleda sought out paper and pencil and sat down to fashion the form of an advertisement the first thing to be done She had no notion how difficult a thing till she came to do it R R is entreated to communicate with his niece at the old place in Bleecker street on business of the greatest importance It will not do said Fleda to herself as she sat and looked at it there is not enough to catch his eye and there is too much if it caught anybody else s eye R R and his niece and Bleecker street that would tell plain enough Dear uncle F has followed you here on business of the greatest importance Pray let her see you she is at the old place It will not do thought Fleda again there is still less to catch his eye I cannot trust it And if I were to put Queechy over it that would give the clue to the Evelyns and everybody But I had better risk anything rather than his seeing it The miserable needlessness of the whole thing the pitiful weighing of sorrow against sorrow and shame against shame overcame her for a little and then dashing away the tears she had no time for and locking up the strong box of her heart she took her pencil again Queechy Let me see you at the old place I have come here on urgent business for you Do not deny me for H s sake With a trifle of alteration she thought this would do and went on to make a number of fair copies of it for so many papers This was done and all traces of it out of the way before missus Pritchard came in and the breakfast and after bracing herself with coffee though the good housekeeper was still sadly dissatisfied with her indifference to some more substantial brace in the shape of chickens and ham Fleda prepared herself inwardly and outwardly to brave the wind and the newspaper offices and set forth It was a bright keen day she was sorry she would it had been cloudy It seemed as if she could not hope to escape some eyes in such an atmosphere She went to the library first and there requested the librarian whom she knew to bring her from the reading room the files of morning and evening papers They were many more than she had supposed she had not near advertisements enough Paper and ink were at hand however and making carefully her list of the various offices morning and evening separate she wrote out a copy of the notice for each of them The morning was well on by the time she could leave the library It was yet far from the fashionable hour however and sedulously shunning the recognition of anybody in hopes that it would be one step towards her escaping theirs she made her way down the bright thoroughfare as far as the City Hall and then crossed over the Park and plunged into a region where it was very little likely she would see a face that she knew She saw nothing else either that she knew in spite of having studied the map of the city in the library she was forced several times to ask her way as she visited office after office of the evening papers first till she had placed her notice with each one of them Her courage almost failed her her heart did quite after two or three It was a trial from which her whole nature shrank to go among the people to face the eyes to exchange talk with the lips that were at home in those purlieus look at them she did not Making her slow way through the choked narrow streets where the mere confusion of business was bewildering very to any one come from Queechy among crowds of what mixed and doubtful character hurrying along and brushing with little ceremony past her edging by loitering groups that filled the whole sidewalk or perhaps edging through them groups whose general type of character was sufficiently plain and unmixed entering into parley with clerk after clerk who looked at such a visiter as an anomaly poor Fleda almost thought so too and shrank within herself venturing hardly her eyes beyond her thick veil and shutting her ears resolutely as far as possible to all the dissonant rough voices that helped to assure her she was where she ought not to be Sometimes she felt that it was impossible to go on and finish her task but a thought or two nerved her again to plunge into another untried quarter or make good her entrance to some new office through a host of loungers and waiting news boys collected round the door Sometimes in utter discouragement she went on and walked to a distance and came back in the hope of a better opportunity It was a long business and she often had to wait The end of her list was reached at last and the paper was thrown away but she did not draw free breath till she had got to the west side of Broadway again and turned her back upon them all It was late then and the street was thinned of a part of its gay throng Completely worn in body as well as mind with slow faltering steps Fleda moved on among those still left looking upon them with a curious eye as if they and she belonged to different classes of beings so very far her sobered and saddened spirit seemed to herself from their stir of business and gayety if they had been a train of lady flies or black ants Fleda would hardly have felt that she had less in common with them It was a weary long way up to Bleecker street as she was forced to travel it The relief was unspeakable to find herself within her uncle s door with the sense that her dreaded duty was done and well and thoroughly Now her part was to be still and wait But with the relief came also a reaction from the strain of the morning Before her weary feet had well mounted the stairs her heart gave up its control and she locked herself in her room to yield to a helpless outpouring of tears which she was utterly unable to restrain though conscious that long time could not pass before she would be called to dinner Dinner had to wait Miss Fleda said the housekeeper in a vexed tone when the meal was half over I didn t know you ever did any thing wrong You are sadly mistaken missus Pritchard said Fleda half lightly half sadly You re looking not a bit better than last night and if anything rather worse missus Pritchard went on It isn t right Miss Fleda You oughtn t to ha set the first step out of doors I know you oughtn t this blessed day and you ve been on your feet these seven hours and you shew it You re just ready to drop I will rest to morrow said Fleda or try to You are fit for nothing but bed said the housekeeper and you ve been using yourself Miss Fleda as if you had the strength of an elephant Now do you think you ve been doing right Fleda would have made some cheerful answer but she was not equal to it she had lost all command of herself and she dropped knife and fork to burst into a flood of exceeding tears missus Pritchard equally astonished and mystified hurried questions apologies and consolations one upon another and made up her mind that there was something mysterious on foot about which she had better ask no questions Neither did she from that time She sealed up her mouth and contented herself with taking the best care of her guest that she possibly could Needed enough but all of little avail The reaction did not cease with that day The next Sunday was spent on the sofa in a state of utter prostration With the necessity for exertion the power had died Fleda could only lie upon the cushions and sleep helplessly while missus Pritchard sat by anxiously watching her curiosity really swallowed up in kind feeling Monday was little better but towards the after part of the day the stimulant of anxiety began to work again and Fleda sat up to watch for a word from her uncle But none came and Tuesday morning distressed missus Pritchard with its want of amendment It was not to be hoped for Fleda knew while this fearful watching lasted Her uncle might not have seen the advertisement he might not have got her letter he might be even then setting sail to quit home forever And she could do nothing but wait Her nerves were alive to every stir every touch of the bell made her tremble it was impossible to read to lie down to be quiet or still anywhere She had set the glass of expectancy for one thing in the distance and all things else were a blur or a blank They had sat down to dinner that Tuesday when a ring at the door which had made her heart jump was followed yes it was by the entrance of the maid servant holding a folded bit of paper in her hand Fleda did not wait to ask whose it was she seized it and saw and sprang away up stairs It was a sealed scrap of paper that had been the back of a letter containing two lines without signature I will meet you at Dinah s if you come there alone about sundown Enough Dinah was an old black woman who once had been a very attached servant in mister Rossitur s family and having married and become a widow years ago had set up for herself in the trade of a washerwoman occupying an obscure little tenement out towards Chelsea Fleda had rather a shadowy idea of the locality though remembering very well sundry journeys of kindness she and Hugh had made to it in days gone by But she recollected it was in Sloman street and she knew she could find it and dropping upon her knees poured out thanks too deep to be uttered and too strong to be even thought without a convulsion of tears Her dinner after that was but a mental thanksgiving she was hardly conscious of anything beside and a thankful rejoicing for all her weary labours Their weariness was sweet to her now Let her but see him the rest was sure Chapter XLII How well appaid she was her bird to find Sidney Fleda counted the minutes till it wanted an hour of sundown and then avoiding missus Pritchard made her escape out of the house A long walk was before her and the latter part of it through a region which she wished to pass while the light was good And she was utterly unable to travel at any but a very gentle rate So she gave herself plenty of time It was a very bright afternoon and all the world was astir Fleda shielded herself with a thick veil and went up one of the narrow streets not daring to venture into Broadway and passing Waverly Place which was almost as bright turned down Eighth street A few blocks now and she would be out of all danger of meeting any one that knew her She drew her veil close and hurried on But the proverb saith a miss is as good as a mile and with reason for if fate wills the chances make nothing As Fleda set her foot down to cross Fifth Avenue she saw mister Carleton on the other side coming up from Waverly Place She went as slowly as she dared hoping that he would pass without looking her way or be unable to recognize her through her thick wrapper In vain she soon saw that she was known he was waiting for her and she must put up her veil and speak to him Why I thought you had left New York said he I was told so I had left it I have left it sir said Fleda I have only come back for a day or two Have you been ill he said with a sudden change of tone the light in his eye and smile giving place to a very marked gravity Fleda would have answered with a half smile but such a sickness of heart came over her that speech failed and she was very near bursting into tears mister Carleton looked at her earnestly a moment and then put the hand which Fleda had forgotten he still held upon his arm and began to walk forward gently with her Something in the grave tenderness with which this was done reminded Fleda irresistibly of the times when she had been a child under his care and somehow her thoughts went off on a tangent back to the further days of her mother and father and grandfather the other friends from whom she had had the same gentle protection which now there was no one in the world to give her And their images did never seem more winning fair than just then when their place was left most especially empty Her uncle she had never looked up to in the same way and whatever stay he had been was cut down Her aunt leaned upon her and Hugh had always been more of a younger than an elder brother The quick contrast of those old happy childish days was too strong the glance back at what she had had made her feel the want Fleda blamed herself reasoned and fought with herself but she was weak in mind and body her nerves were unsteady yet her spirits unprepared for any encounter or reminder of pleasure and though vexed and ashamed she could not hold her head up and she could not prevent tear after tear from falling as they went along she could only hope that nobody saw them Nobody spoke of them But then nobody said anything and the silence at last frightened her into rousing herself She checked her tears and raised her head she ventured no more she dared not turn her face towards her companion He looked at her once or twice as if in doubt whether to speak or not Are you not going beyond your strength he said at length gently Fleda said no although in a tone that half confessed his suspicion He was silent again however and she cast about in vain for something to speak of it seemed to her that all subjects of conversation in general had been packed up for exportation neither eye nor memory could light upon a single one Block after block was passed the pace at which he walked and the manner of his care for her alone shewing that he knew what a very light hand was resting upon his arm How pretty the curl of blue smoke is from that chimney he said It was said with a tone so carelessly easy that Fleda s heart jumped for one instant in the persuasion that he had seen and noticed nothing peculiar about her I know it she said eagerly I have often thought of it especially here in the city Why is it what is it Fleda s eye gave one of its exploratory looks at his such as he remembered from years ago before she spoke Isn t it contrast or at least I think that helps the effect here What do you make the contrast he said quietly Isn t it said Fleda with another glance the contrast of something pure and free and upward tending with what is below it I did not mean the mere painter s contrast In the country smoke is more picturesque but in the city I think it has more character To how many people do you suppose it ever occurred that smoke had a character said he smiling You are laughing at me mister Carleton perhaps I deserve it You do not think that said he with a look that forbade her to think it But I see you are of Lavater s mind that everything has a physiognomy I think he was perfectly right said Fleda Don t you mister Carleton To some people yes But the expression is so subtle that only very nice sensibilities with fine training can hope to catch it therefore to the mass of the world Lavater would talk nonsense That is a gentle hint to me But if I talk nonsense I wish you would set me right mister Carleton I am very apt to amuse myself with tracing out fancied analogies in almost everything and I may carry it too far too far to be spoken of wisely I think it enlarges one s field of pleasure very much Where one eye is stopped another is but invited on So said mister Carleton while that puff of smoke would lead one person s imagination only down the chimney to the kitchen fire it would take another s where did yours go said he suddenly turning round upon her Fleda met his eye again without speaking but her look had perhaps more than half revealed her thought for she was answered with a smile so intelligent and sympathetic that she was abashed How very much religion heightens the enjoyments of life mister Carleton said after a while Fieda s heart throbbed an answer she did not speak Both in its direct and indirect action The mind is set free from influences that narrowed its range and dimmed its vision and refined to a keener sensibility a juster perception a higher power of appreciation by far than it had before And then to say nothing of religion s own peculiar sphere of enjoyment technically religious what a field of pleasure it opens to its possessor in the world of moral beauty most partially known to any other and the fine but exquisite analogies of things material with things spiritual those harmonies of Nature to which talk as they will all other ears are deaf You know said Fleda with full eyes that she dared not shew how Henry Martyn said that he found he enjoyed painting and music so much more after he became a Christian I remember It is the substituting a just medium for a false one it is putting nature within and nature without in tune with each other so that the chords are perfect now which were jarring before And yet how far people would be from believing you mister Carleton Yes they are possessed with the contrary notion But in all the creation nothing has a one sided usefulness what a reflection it would be upon the wisdom of its author if godliness alone were the exception if it were not profitable for the life that now is as well as for that which is to come They make that work the other way don t they said Fleda Not being able to see how thorough religion should be for anybody s happiness they make use of your argument to conclude that it is not what the Bible requires How I have heard that urged that God intended his creatures to be happy as a reason why they should disobey him They lay hold on the wrong end of the argument and work backwards Precisely God intended his creatures to be happy Strict obedience would make them unhappy Therefore he does not intend them to obey They never put it before them quite so clearly said Fleda They would startle at it a little But so they would at the right stating of the case And how would that be mister Carleton It might be somewhat after this fashion God requires nothing that is not for the happiness of his people He requires perfect obedience Therefore perfect obedience is for their happiness But unbelief will not understand that Did it ever strike you how much there is in those words Come and see All that argument can do after all is but to persuade to that Only faith will submit to terms and enter the narrrow gate and only obedience knows what the prospect is on the other side But isn t it true mister Carleton that the world have some cause for their opinion judging as they do by the outside The peculiar pleasures of religion as you say are out of sight and they do not always find in religious people that enlargement and refinement of which you were speaking Because they make unequal comparisons Recollect that as God has declared the ranks of religion are not for the most part filled from the wise and the great In making your estimate you must measure things equal in other respects Compare the same man with himself before he was a Christian or with his unchristianized fellows and you will find invariably the refining dignifying ennobling influence of true religion the enlarged intelligence and the greater power of enjoyment And besides those causes of pleasure giving that you mentioned said Fleda there is a mind at ease and how much that is alone If I may judge others by myself the mere fact of being unpoised unresting disables the mind from a thousand things that are joyfully relished by one entirely at ease Yes said he do you remember that word The stones of the field shall be at peace with thee I am afraid people would understand you as little as they would me mister Carleton said Fleda laughing He smiled rather a prolonged smile the expression of which Fleda could not make out she felt that she did not quite understand him I have thought said he after a pause that much of the beauty we find in many things is owing to a hidden analogy the harmony they make with some unknown string of the mind s harp which they have set a vibrating But the music of that is so low and soft that one must listen very closely to find out what it is Why that is the very theory of which I gave you a smoky illustration a little while ago said Fleda I thought I was on safe ground after what you said about the characters of flowers for that was a little Fanciful said he smiling What you please said Fleda colouring a little I am sure it is true The theory I mean I have many a time felt it though I never put it in words I shall think of that Did you ever happen to see the very early dawn of a winter s morning said he But he laughed the next instant at the comical expression of Fleda s face as it was turned to him Forgive me for supposing you as ignorant as myself I have seen it once Appreciated it I hope that time said Fleda I shall never forget it And it never wrought in you a desire to see it again I might see many a dawn said he smiling without what I saw then It was very early and a cloudy morning so that night had still almost undisturbed possession of earth and sky but in the south eastern quarter between two clouds there was a space of fair white promise hardly making any impression upon the darkness but only set off by it And upon this one bright spot in earth or heaven rode the planet of the morning the sun s forerunner bright upon the brightness All else was dusky except where overhead the clouds had parted again and shewed a faint old moon glimmering down upon the night it could no longer be said to rule Beautiful said Fleda There is hardly any time I like so well as the dawn of a winter morning with an old moon in the sky Summer weather has no beauty like it in some things Once continued mister Carleton I should have seen no more than I have told you the beauty that every cultivated eye must take in But now methought I saw the dayspring that has come upon a longer night and from out of the midst of it there was the fair face of the morning star looking at me with its sweet reminder and invitation looking over the world with its aspect of triumphant expectancy there was its calm assurance of the coming day its promise that the star of hope which now there were only a few watching eyes to see should presently be followed by the full beams of the Sun of righteousness making the kingdoms of the world his own Your memory may bring to you the words that came to mine the promise to him that overcometh and the beauty of the lips that made it the encouragement to patient continuance in well doing till the day break and the shadows flee away And there on the other hand was the substituted light of earth s wisdom and inventions dominant yet but waning and soon to be put out for ever Fleda was crying again and perhaps that was the reason why mister Carleton was silent for some time She was very sorry to shew herself so weak but she could not help it part of his words had come too close And when she had recovered again she was absolutely silent too for they were nearing Sloman street and she could not take him there with her She did not know what to say nor what he would think and she said not another word till they came to the corner There she must stop and speak I am very much obliged to you mister Carleton she said drawing her hand from his arm for taking care of me all this disagreeable way I will not give you any more trouble You are not going to dismiss me said he looking at her with a countenance of serious anxiety I must said Fleda ingenuously I have business to attend to here But you will let me have the pleasure of waiting for you O no said Fleda hesitating and flushing thank you mister Carleton but pray do not I don t know at all how long I may be detained He bowed she thought gravely and turned away and she entered the little wretched street with a strange feeling of pain that she could not analyze She did not know where it came from but she thought if there only had been a hiding place for her she could have sat down and wept a whole heartful The feeling must be kept back now and it was soon forgotten in the throbbing of her heart at another thought which took entire possession The sun was not down there was time enough but it was with a step and eye of hurried anxiety that Fleda passed along the little street for fear of missing her quest or lest Dinah should have changed her domicil Yet would her uncle have named it for their meeting if he had not been sure of it It was very odd he should have appointed that place at all and Fleda was inclined to think he must have seen Dinah by some chance or it never would have come into his head Still her eye passed unheeding over all the varieties of dinginess and misery in her way intent only upon finding that particular dingy cellar way which used to admit her to Dinah s premises It was found at last and she went in The old woman herself most unchanged did not know the young lady but well remembered the little girl whom Fleda brought to her mind And then she was overjoyed to see her and asked a multitude of questions and told a long story of her having met mister Rossitur in the street the other day in the last place where she d have looked to see him and how old he had grown and how surprised she had been to see the grey hairs in his head Fleda at last gave her to understand that she expected him to meet her there and would like to see him alone and the good woman immediately took her work into another apartment made up the fire and set up the chairs and leaving her assured Fleda she would lock up the doors and not let no one come through It was sundown and later Fleda thought and she felt as if every pulse was doing double duty No matter if she were shattered and the work done But what work Oh the needlessness the cruelty the folly of it And how much of the ill consequences she might be unable after all to ward off She took off her hat to relieve a nervous smothered feeling and walked and sat down and then sat still from trembling inability to do anything else Dinah s poor little room clean though it was looked to her the most dismal place in the world from its association with her errand she hid her face on her knees that she might have no disagreeableness to contend with but that which could not be shut out It had lain there some time till a sudden felling of terror at the growing lateness made her raise it to look at the window mister Rossitur was standing still before her he must have come in very softly and looking oh Fleda had not imagined him looking so changed All was forgotten the wrong and the needlessness and the indignation with which she had sometimes thought of it Fleda remembered nothing but love and pity and threw herself upon his neck with such tears of tenderness and sympathy such kisses of forgiveness and comfort speaking as might have broken a stouter heart than mister Rossitur s He held her in his arms for a few minutes passively suffering her caresses and then gently unloosing her hold placed her on a seat sat down a little way off covered his face and groaned aloud Fleda could not recover herself at once Then shaking off her agitation she came and knelt down by his side and putting one arm over his shoulder laid her cheek against his forehead Words were beyond reach but his forehead was wet with her tears and kisses of soft entreaty of winning assurance said all she could say What did you come here for Fleda said mister Rossitur at length without changing his position To bring you home uncle Rolf Home said he with an accent between bitterness and despair Yes for it s all over it s all forgotten there is no more to be said about it at all said Fleda getting her words out she didn t know how What is forgotten said he harshly All that you would wish sir replied Fleda softly and gently there is no more to be done about it and I came to tell you if possible before it was too late Oh I m so glad and her arms and her cheek pressed closer as fresh tears stopped her voice How do you know Fleda said mister Rossitur raising his head and bringing hers to his shoulder while his arms in turn enclosed her Fleda whispered He told me so himself Who mister Thorn The words were but just spoken above her breath mister Rossitur was silent for some time Are you sure you understood him Yes sir it could not have been spoken plainer Are you quite sure he meant what he said Fleda Perfectly sure uncle Rolf I know he did What stipulation did he make beforehand He did it without any stipulation sir What was his inducement then If I know him he is not a man to act without any Fleda s cheek was dyed but except that she gave no other answer Why has it been left so long said her uncle presently I don t know sir he said nothing about that He promised that neither we nor the world should hear anything more of it The world said mister Rossitur No sir he said that only one or two persons had any notion of it and that their secrecy he had the means of securing Did he tell you anything more Only that he had the matter entirely under his control and that never a whisper of it should be heard again No promise could be given more fully and absolutely mister Rossitur drew a long breath speaking to Fleda s ear very great relief and was silent And what reward is he to have for this Fleda he said after some musing All that my hearty thanks and gratitude can give as far as I am concerned sir Is that what he expects Fleda I cannot help what he expects said Fleda in some distress What have you engaged yourself to my child Nothing in the world uncle Rolf said Fleda earnestly nothing in the world I haven t engaged myself to anything The promise was made freely without any sort of stipulation mister Rossitur looked thoughtful and disquieted Fleda s tears were pouring again I will not trust him he said I will not stay in the country But you will come home uncle said Fleda terrified Yes my dear child yes my dear child he said tenderly putting his arms round Fleda again and kissing with an earnestness of acknowledgment that went to her heart her lips and brow you shall do what you will with me and when I go we will all go together From Queechy From America But she had no time for that thought now You said for Hugh s sake mister Rossitur observed after a pause and with some apparent difficulty what of him He is not well uncle Rolf said Fleda and I think the best medicine will be the sight of you again mister Rossitur looked pale and was silent a moment And my wife he said His face and the thought of those faces at home were too much for Fleda she could not help it Oh uncle Rolf she said hiding her face they only want to see you again now mister Rossitur leaned his head in his hands and groaned and Fleda could but cry she felt there was nothing to say It was for Marion he said at length it was when I was hard pressed and I was fearful if it were known that it might ruin her prospects I wanted that miserable sum only four thousand dollars that fellow Schwiden asked to borrow it of me for a few days and to refuse would have been to confess all I dared not try my credit and I just madly took that step that proved irretrievable I counted at the moment upon funds that were coming to me only the next week sure I thought as possible but the man cheated me and our embarrassments thickened from that time that thing has been a weight oh a weight of deadening power round my neck ever since I have died a living death these six years I know it dear uncle I know it all said Fleda bringing the sympathizing touch of her cheek to his again The good that it did has been unspeakably overbalanced by the evil even long ago I knew that The good that it did It was no time then to moralize but he must know that Marion was at home or he might incautiously reveal to her what happily there was no necessity for her ever knowing And the story must give him great and fresh pain Dear uncle Rolf said Fleda pressing closer to him we may be happier than we have been in a long time if you will only take it so The cloud upon you has been a cloud upon us I know it he exclaimed a cloud that served to shew me that my jewels were diamonds You have an accession to your jewels uncle Rolf What do you mean I mean said Fleda trembling that there are two more at home He held her back to look at her Can t you guess who No said he What do you mean I must tell you because they know nothing and needn t know of all this matter What are you talking about Marion is there Marion exclaimed mister Rossitur with quick changes of expression Marion At Queechy and her husband No sir a dear little child Marion and her husband where is he Fleda hesitated I don t know I don t know whether she knows Is he dead No sir mister Rossitur put her away and got up and walked or strode up and down up and down the little apartment Fleda dared not look at him even by the faint glimmer that came from the chimney But abroad it was perfectly dark the stars were shining the only lamps that illumined the poor little street and for a long time there had been no light in the room but that of the tiny wood fire Dinah never could be persuaded of the superior cheapness of coal Fleda came at last to her uncle s side and putting her arm within his said How soon will you set off for home uncle Rolf To morrow morning You must take the boat to Bridgeport now you know the river is fast Yes I know Then I will meet you at the wharf uncle Rolf at what o clock My dear child said he stopping and passing his hand tenderly over her cheek are you fit for it to morrow You had better stay where you are quietly for a few days you want rest No I will go home with you said Fleda and rest there But hadn t we better let Dinah in and bid her good bye for I ought to be somewhere else to get ready Dinah was called and a few kind words spoken and with a more substantial remembrance or reward from Fleda s hand they left her Fleda had the support of her uncle s arm till they came within sight of the house and then he stood and watched her while she went the rest of the way alone Illustration Then he stood and watched her Anything more white and spirit looking and more spirit like in its purity and peacefulness surely did not walk that night There was music in her ear and abroad in the star light more ethereal than Ariel s but she knew where it came from it was the chimes of her heart that were ringing and never a happier peal nor never had the mental atmosphere been more clear for their sounding Thankfulness that was the oftenest note swelling thankfulness for her success joy for herself and for the dear ones at home generous delight at having been the instrument of their relief the harmonies of pure affections without any grating now the hope well grounded she thought of improvement in her uncle and better times for them all a childlike peace that was at rest with itself and the world these were mingling and interchanging their music and again and again in the midst of it all faith rang the last chime in heaven Chapter XLIII As some lone bird at day s departing hour Sings in the sunbeam of the transient shower Forgetful though its wings are wet the while Bowles Happily possessed with the notion that there was some hidden mystery in Fleda s movements missus Pritchard said not a word about her having gone out and only spoke in looks her pain at the imprudence of which she had been guilty But when Fleda asked to have a carriage ordered to take her to the boat in the morning the good housekeeper could not hold any longer Miss Fleda said she with a look of very serious remonstrance I don t know what you re thinking of but I know you re fixing to kill yourself You are no more fit to go to Queechy to morrow than you were to be out till seven o clock this evening and if you saw yourself you wouldn t want me to say any more There is not the least morsel of colour in your face and you look as if you had a mind to get rid of your body altogether as fast as you can You want to be in bed for two days running now this minute Thank you dear missus Pritchard said Fleda smiling you are very careful of me but I must go home to morrow and go to bed afterwards The housekeeper looked at her a minute in silence and then said Don t dear Miss Fleda with an energy of entreaty which brought the tears into Fleda s eyes But she persisted in desiring the carriage and missus Pritchard was silenced observing however that she shouldn t wonder if she wasn t able to go after all Fleda herself was not without a doubt on the subject before the evening was over The reaction complete now began to make itself felt and morning settled the question She was not able even to rise from her bed The housekeeper was in a sort delighted and Fleda was in too passive a mood of body and mind to have any care on the subject The agitation of the past days had given way to an absolute quiet that seemed as if nothing could ever ruffle it again and this feeling was seconded by the extreme prostration of body She was a mere child in the hands of her nurse and had missus Pritchard said if she wouldn t mind her telling the sweetest baby face that ever had so much sense belonging to it The morning was half spent in dozing slumbers when Fleda heard a rush of footsteps much lighter and sprightlier than good missus Pritchard s coming up the stairs and pattering along the entry to her room and with little ceremony in rushed Florence and Constance Evelyn They almost smothered Fleda with their delighted caresses and ran so hard their questions about her looks and her illness that she was well nigh spared the trouble of answering You horrid little creature said Constance why didn t you come straight to our house just think of the injurious suspicions you have exposed us to to say nothing of the extent of fiction we have found ourselves obliged to execute I didn t expect it of you little Queechy Fleda kept her pale face quiet on the pillow and only smiled her incredulous curiosity But when did you come back Fleda said Miss Evelyn We should never have known a breath about your being here Constance went on We were sitting last night in peaceful unconsciousness of there being any neglected calls upon our friendship in the vicinity when mister Carleton came in and asked for you Imagine our horror we said you had gone out early in the afternoon and had not returned You didn t say that said Fleda colouring And he remarked at some length said Constance upon the importance of young ladies having some attendance when they are out late in the evening and that you in particular were one of those persons he didn t say but he intimated of a slightly volatile disposition whom their friends ought not to lose sight of But what brought you to town again Fleda said the elder sister What makes you talk so Constance said Fleda I haven t told you the half said Constance demurely And then mamma excused herself as well as she could and mister Carleton said very seriously that he knew there was a great element of head strongness in your character he had remarked it he said when you were arguing with mister Stackpole Constance be quiet said her sister Will you tell me Fleda what you have come to town for I am dying with curiosity Then it s inordinate curiosity and ought to be checked my dear said Fleda smiling Tell me I came to take care of some business that could not very well be attended to at a distance Who did you come with One of our Queechy neighbours that I heard was coming to New York Wasn t your uncle at home Of course not If he had been there would have been no need of my stirring But was there nobody else to do it but you Uncle Orrin away you know and Charlton down at his post Fort Hamilton is it I forget which fort he is fast there He is not so very fast said Constance for I see him every now and then in Broadway shouldering mister Thorn instead of a musket and he has taken up the distressing idea that it is part of his duty to oversee the progress of Florence s worsted work I ve made over that horrid thing to her Fleda or else his precision has been struck with the anomaly of blue stars on a white ground and he is studying that I don t know which and so every few nights he rushes over from Governor s Island or somewhere to prosecute enquiries Mamma is quite concerned about him she says he is wearing himself out The mixture of amusement admiration and affection with which the other sister looked at her and laughed with her was a pretty thing to see But where is your other cousin Hugh said Florence He was not well Where is your uncle He will be at home to day I expect and so should I have been I meant to be there as soon as he was but I found this morning that I was not well enough to my sorrow You were not going alone O no a friend of ours was going to day I never saw anybody with so many friends said Florence But you are coming to us now Fleda How soon are you going to get up O by to morrow said Fleda smiling but I had better stay where I am the little while I shall be here I must go home the first minute I can find an opportunity But you sha n t find an opportunity till we ve had you said Constance I m going to bring a carriage for you this afternoon I could bear the loss of your friendship my dear but not the peril of my own reputation mister Carleton is under the impression that you are suffering from a momentary succession of fainting fits and if we were to leave you here in an empty house to come out of them at your leisure what would he think of us What would he think Oh world Is this it But Fleda was not able to be moved in the afternoon and it soon appeared that nature would take more revenge than a day s sleep for the rough handling she had had the past week Fleda could not rise from her bed the next morning and instead of that a kind of nondescript nervous fever set in nowise dangerous but very wearying She was nevertheless extremely glad of it for it would serve to explain to all her friends the change of look which had astonished them They would make it now the token of coming not of past evil The rest she took with her accustomed patience and quietness thankful for everything after the anxiety and the relief she had just before known doctor Gregory came home from Philadelphia in the height of her attack and aggravated it for a day or two with the fear of his questioning But Fleda was surprised at his want of curiosity He asked her indeed what she had come to town for but her whispered answer of Business seemed to satisfy him for he did not inquire what the business was He did ask her furthermore what had made her get sick but this time he was satisfied more easily still with a very curious sweet smile which was the utmost reply Fleda s wits at the moment could frame Well get well said he kissing her heartily once or twice and I won t quarrel with you about it The getting well however promised to be a leisurely affair doctor Gregory staid two or three days and then went on to Boston leaving Fleda in no want of him missus Pritchard was the tenderest and carefullest of nurres The Evelyns did everything but nurse her They sat by her talked to her made her laugh and not seldom made her look sober too with their wild tales of the world and the world s doings But they were indeed very affectionate and kind and Fleda loved them for it If they wearied her sometimes with their talk it was a change from the weariness of fever and silence that on the whole was useful She was quieting herself one morning as well as she could in the midst of both lying with shut eyes against her pillow and trying to fix her mind on pleasant things when she heard missus Pritchard open the door and come in She knew it was missus Pritchard so she didn t move nor look But in a moment the knowledge that missus Pritchard s feet had stopped just by the bed and a strange sensation of something delicious saluting her made her open her eyes when they lighted upon a huge bunch of violets just before them and in most friendly neighbourhood to her nose Fleda started up and her Oh fairly made the housekeeper laugh it was the very quintessence of gratification Where did you get them I didn t get them indeed Miss Fleda said the housekeeper gravely with an immense amount of delighted satisfaction Delicious Where did they come from Well they must have come from a greenhouse or hot house or something of that kind Miss Fleda these things don t grow nowhere out o doors at this time missus Pritchard guessed Fleda had got the clue from her quick change of colour and falling eye There was a quick little smile too and How kind was upon the end of Fleda s tongue but it never got any further Her energies so far as expression was concerned seemed to be concentrated in the act of smelling missus Pritchard stood by They must be put in water said Fleda I must have a dish for them Dear missus Pritchard will you get me one The housekeeper went smiling to herself The dish was brought the violets placed in it and a little table at Fleda s request was set by the side of the bed close to her pillow for them to stand upon And Fleda lay on her pillow and looked at them There never were purer breathed flowers than those All the pleasant associations of Fleda s life seemed to hang about them from the time when her childish eyes had first made acquaintance with violets to the conversation in the library a few days ago and painful things stood aloof they had no part The freshness of youth and the sweetness of spring time and all the kindly influences which had ever joined with both to bless her came back with their blessing in the violets reminding breath Fleda shut her eyes and she felt it she opened her eyes and the little double blue things smiled at her good humouredly and said Here we are you may shut them again And it was curious how often Fleda gave them a smile back as she did so missus Pritchard thought Fleda lived upon the violets that day rather than upon food and medicine or at least she said they agreed remarkably well together And the next day it was much the same What will you do when they are withered she said that evening I shall have to see and get some more for you Oh they will last a great while said Fleda smiling But the next morning missus Pritchard came into her room with a great bunch of roses the very like of the one Fleda had had at the Evelyns She delivered them with a sort of silent triumph and then as before stood by to enjoy Fleda and the flowers together But the degree of Fleda s wonderment pleasure and gratitude made her reception of them outwardly at least this time rather grave You may throw the others away now Miss Fleda said the housekeeper smiling Indeed I shall not The violets I suppose is all gone missus Pritchard went on but I never did see such a bunch of roses as that since I lived anywhere They have made a rose of you Miss Fleda How beautiful was Fleda s answer Somebody he didn t say who desired to know particularly how Miss Ringgan was to day Somebody is very kind said Fleda from the bottom of her heart But dear missus Pritchard I shall want another dish Somebody was kind she thought more and more for there came every day or two the most delicious bouquets every day different They were at least equal in their soothing and refreshing influences to all the efforts of all the Evelyns and missus Pritchard put together There never came any name with them and there never was any need Those bunches of flowers certainly had a physiognomy and to Fleda were not the flowers but the choosing cutting and putting of them together the embodiment of an amount of grace refined feeling generosity and kindness that her imagination never thought of in connection with but one person And his kindness was answered perhaps missus Pritchard better than Fleda guessed how well from the delighted colour and sparkle of the eye with which every fresh arrival was greeted as it walked into her room By Fleda s order the bouquets were invariably put out of sight before the Evelyns made their first visit in the morning and not brought out again till all danger of seeing them any more for the day was past The regular coming of these floral messengers confirmed missus Pritchard in her mysterious surmises about Fleda which were still further strengthened by this incomprehensible order and at last she got so into the spirit of the thing that if she heard an untimely ring at the door she would catch up a glass of flowers and run as if they had been contraband without a word from anybody The Evelyns wrote to missus Rossitur by Fleda s desire so as not to alarm her merely saying that Fleda was not quite well and that they meant to keep her a little while to recruit herself and that missus Rossitur must send her some clothes This last clause was tha particular addition of Constance The fever lasted a fortnight and then went off by degrees leaving her with a very small portion of her ordinary strength Fleda was to go to the Evelyns as soon as she could bear it at present she was only able to come down to the little back parlour and sit in the doctor s arm chair and eat jelly and sleep and look at Constance and when Constance was not there look at her flowers She could hardly bear a book as yet She hadn t a bit of colour in her face missus Pritchard said but she looked better than when she came to town and to herself the good housekeeper added that she looked happier too No doubt that was true Fleda s principal feeling ever since she lay down in her bed had been thankfulness and now that the ease of returning health was joined to this feeling her face with all its subdued gravity was as untroubled in its expression as the faces of her flowers She was disagreeably surprised one day after she had been two or three days down stairs by a visit from missus Thorn In her well grounded dread of seeing one person Fleda had given strict orders that no gentleman should be admitted she had not counted upon this invasion missus Thorn had always been extremely kind to her but though Fleda gave her credit for thorough good heartedness and a true liking for herself she could not disconnect her attentions from another thought and therefore always wished them away and never had her kind face been more thoroughly disagreeable to Fleda than when it made its appearance in the doctor s little back parlour on this occasion With even more than her usual fondness or Pleda s excited imagination fancied so missus Thorn lavished caresses upon her and finally besought her to go out and take the air in her carriage Fleda tried most earnestly to get rid of this invitation and was gently unpersuadable till the lady at last was brought to promise that she should see no creature during the drive but herself An ominous promise but Fleda did not know any longer how to refuse without hurting a person for whom she had really a grateful regard So she went And doubted afterwards exceedingly whether she had done well She took special good care to see nobody again till she went to the Evelyns But then precautions were at an end It was no longer possible to keep herself shut up She had cause poor child the very first night of her coming to wish herself back again This first evening she would fain have pleaded weakness as her excuse and gone to her room but Constance laid violent hands on her and insisted that she should stay at least a little while with them And she seemed fated to see all her friends in a bevy First came Charlton then followed the Decaturs whom she knew and liked very well and engrossed her happily before her cousin had time to make any enquiries then came mister Carleton then mister Stackpole Then mister Thorn in expectation of whom Fleda s breath had been coming and going painfully all the evening She could not meet him without a strange mixture of embarrassment and confusion with the gratitude she wished to express an embarrassment not at all lessened by the air of happy confidence with which he came forward to her It carried an intimation that almost took away the little strength she had And if anything could have made his presence more intolerable it was the feeling she could not get rid of that it was the cause why mister Carleton did not come near her again though she prolonged her stay in the drawing room in the hope that he would It proved to be for mister Thorn s benefit alone Well you staid all the evening after all said Constance as they were going up stairs Yes I wish I hadn t said Fleda I wonder when I shall be likely to find a chance of getting back to Queechy You re not fit yet so you needn t trouble yourself about it said Constance We ll find you plenty of chances Fleda could not think of mister Thorn without trembling His manner meant so much more than it had any right or than she had counted upon He seemed she pressed her hands upon her face to get rid of the impression he seemed to take for granted precisely that which she had refused to admit he seemed to reckon as paid for that which she had declined to set a price upon Her uncle s words and manner came up in her memory She could see nothing best to do but to get home as fast as possible She had no one here to fall back upon Again that vision of father and mother and grandfather flitted across her fancy and though Fleda s heart ended by resting down on that foundation to which it always recurred it rested with a great many tears For several days she denied herself absolutely to morning visitors of every kind But she could not entirely absent herself from the drawing room in the evening and whenever the family were at home there was a regular levee mister Thorn could not be avoided then He was always there and always with that same look and manner of satisfied confidence Fleda was as grave as silent as reserved as she could possibly be and not be rude but he seemed to take it in excellent good part as being half indisposition and half timidity Fleda set her face earnestly towards home and pressed missus Evelyn to find her an opportunity weak or strong of going there but for those days as yet none presented itself mister Carleton was at the house almost as often as mister Thorn seldom staying so long however and never having any more to do with Fleda than he had that first evening Whenever he did come in contact with her he was she thought as grave as he was graceful That was to be sure his common manner in company yet she could not help thinking there was some difference since the walk they had taken together and it grieved her Chapter XLIV The beat laid schemes o mice and men Gang aft agley Burns After a few days Charlton verified what Constance had said about his not being very fast at Fort Hamilton by coming again to see them one morning Fleda asked him if he could not get another furlough to go with her home but he declared he was just spending one which was near out and he could not hope for a third in some time he must be back at his post by the day after to morrow When do you want to go coz I would to morrow if I had anybody to go with me said Fleda sighing No you wouldn t said Constance you are well enough to go out now and you forget we are all to make missus Thorn happy to morrow night I am not said Fleda Not you can t help yourself you must you said you would I did not indeed Well then I said it for you and that will do just as well Why my dear if you don t just think the Thorns will be in a state I should prefer to go through a hedge of any description rather than meet the trying demonstrations which will encounter me on every side I am going to missus Decatur s said Fleda she invited me first and I owe it to her she has asked me so often and so kindly I shouldn t think you d enjoy yourself there said Florence they don t talk a bit of English these nights If I was going my dear I would act as your interpreter but my destiny lies in another direction If I cannot make anybody understand my French I will get somebody to condescend to my English said Fleda Why do you talk French was the instant question from both mouths Unless she has forgotten herself strangely said Charlton Talk she will talk to anybody s satisfaction that happens to differ from her and I think her tongue cares very little which language it wags in There is no danger about Fleda s enjoying herself where people are talking Fleda laughed at him and the Evelyns rather stared at them both But we are all going to missus Thorn s you can t go alone I will make Charlton take me said Fleda or rather I will take him if he will let me Will you Charlton will you take care of me to missus Decatur s to morrow night With the greatest pleasure my dear coz but I have another engagement in the course of the evening Oh that is nothing said Fleda if you will only go with me that is all I care for You needn t stay but ten minutes And you can call for me she added turning to the Evelyns as you come back from missus Thorn s To this no objection could be made and the ensuing raillery Fleda bore with steadiness at least if not with coolness for Charlton heard it and she was distressed She went to missus Decatur s the next evening in greater elation of spirits than she had known since she left her uncle s delighted to be missing from the party at missus Thorn s and hoping that mister Lewis would be satisfied with this very plain hint of her mind A little pleased too to feel quite free alone from too friendly eyes and ears that had too lively a concern in her sayings and doings She did not in the least care about going to missus Decatur s her joy was that she was not at the other place But there never was elation so outwardly quiet Nobody would have suspected its existence The evening was near half over when mister Carleton came in Fleda had half hoped he would be there and now immediately hoped she might have a chance to see him alone and to thank him for his flowers she had not been able to do that yet He presently came up to speak to her just as Charlton who had found attraction enough to keep him so long came to tell he was going You are looking better said the former as gravely as ever but with an eye of serious interest that made the word something I am better said Fleda gratefully So much better that she is in a hurry to make herself worse said her cousin mister Carleton you are a professor of medicine I believe I have an indistinct impression of your having once prescribed a ride on horseback for somebody wouldn t you recommend some measure of prudence to her consideration In general mister Carleton answered gravely but in the present case I could not venture upon any special prescription captain Rossitur As for instance that she should remain in New York till she is fit to leave it By the way what brought you here again in such a hurry Fleda I haven t heard that yet The question was rather sudden Fleda was a little taken by surprise her face shewed some pain and confusion both mister Carleton prevented her answer she could not tell whether with design What imprudence do you charge your cousin with captain Rossitur Why she is in a great hurry to get back to Queechy before she is able to go anywhere begging me to find an escort for her It is lucky I can t I didn t know I ever should be glad to be posted up in this fashion but I am You have not sought very far captain Rossitur said the voice of Thorn behind him Here is one that will be very happy to attend Miss Fleda whenever she pleases Fleda s shocked start and change of countenance was seen by more eyes than one pair Thorn s fell and a shade crossed his countenance too for an instant that Fleda s vision was too dazzled to see mister Carleton moved away Why are you going to Queechy said Charlton astonished His friend was silent a moment perhaps for want of power to speak Fleda dared not look at him It is not impossible unless this lady forbid me I am not a fixture But what brought you here man to offer your services said Charlton most ungallantly leaving so many pairs of bright eyes to shine upon your absence mister Thorn will not find himself in darkness here captain Rossitur said missus Decatur It s my opinion he ought ma am said Charlton It is my opinion every man ought who makes his dependance on gleams of sunshine said mister Thorn rather cynically I cannot say I was thinking of brightness before or behind me I should think not said Charlton you don t look as if you had seen any in a good while A light goes out every now and then said Thorn and it takes one s eyes some time to get accustomed to it What a singular world we live in missus Decatur That is so new an idea said the lady laughing that I must request an explanation What new experience of its singularity has your wisdom made sid his friend I thought you and the world knew each other s faces pretty well before Then you have not heard the news What news Hum I suppose it is not about yet said Thorn composedly No you haven t heard it But what man said Charlton let s hear your news for I must be off Why but it is no more than rumour yet but it is said that strange things are coming to light about a name that used to be held in very high respect In this city In this city yes it is said proceedings are afoot against one of our oldest citizens on charge of a very grave offence Who and what offence what do you mean Is it a secret mister Thorn said missus Decatur If you have not heard perhaps it is as well not to mention names too soon if it comes out it will be all over directly possibly the family may hush it up and in that case the less said the better but those have it in hand that will not let it slip through their fingers missus Decatur turned away saying how shocking such things were and Thorn with a smile which did not however light up his face said You may be off Charlton with no concern for the bright eyes you leave behind you I will endeavour to atone for my negligence elsewhere by my mindfulness of them Don t excuse you said Charlton but his eye catching at the moment another attraction opposite in the form of man or woman instead of quitting the room he leisurely crossed it to speak to the new comer and Thorn with an entire change of look and manner pressed forward and offered his arm to Fleda who was looking perfectly white If his words had needed any commentary it was given by his eye as it met hers in speaking the last sentence to missus Decatur No one was near whom she knew and mister Thorn led her out to a little back room where the gentlemen had thrown off their cloaks where the air was fresher and placing her on a seat stood waiting before her till she could speak to him What do you mean mister Thorn Fleda looked as much as said when she could meet his face I may rather ask you what you mean Miss Fleda he answered gravely Fleda drew breath painfully I mean nothing she said lowering her head again I have done nothing Did you think I meant nothing when I agreed to do all you wished I thought you said you would do it freely she said with a tone of voice that might have touched anybody there was such a sinking of heart in it Didn t you understand me And is it all over now said Fleda after a pause Not yet but it soon may be A weak hand may stop it now it will soon be beyond the power of the strongest And what becomes of your promise that it should no more be heard of said Fleda looking up at him with a colourless face but eyes that put the question forcibly nevertheless Is any promise bound to stand without its conditions I made no conditions said Fleda quickly Forgive me but did you not permit me to understand them No or if I did I could not help it Did you say that you wished to help it said he gently I must say so now then mister Thorn said Fleda withdrawing the hand he had taken I did not mean or wish you to think so but I was too ill to speak almost to know what I did It was not my fault You do not make it mine that I chose such a time selfishly I grant to draw from your lips the words that are more to me than life Cannot you be generous for once she was very near saying Where you are concerned I do not know how Fleda was silent a moment and then bowed her face in her hands May I not ask that question of you said he bending down and endeavouring to remove them will you not say or look that word that will make others happy beside me I cannot sir Not for their sakes he said calmly Can you ask me to do for theirs what I would not for my own Yes for mine he said with a meaning deliberateness Fleda was silent with a face of white determination It will be beyond eluding as beyond recall the second time I may seem selfish I am selfish but dear Miss Ringgan you do not see all you who make me so can make me anything else with a touch of your hand it is selfishness that would be bound to your happiness if you did but entrust it to me Fleda neither spoke nor looked at him and rose up from her chair Is this your generosity he said pointedly though gently That is not the question now sir said Fleda who was trembling painfully I cannot do evil that good may come But evil said he detaining her what evil do I ask of you to remove evil I do Fleda clasped her hands but answered calmly I cannot make any pretences sir I cannot promise to give what is not in my power In whose power then said he quickly A feeling of indignation came to Fleda s aid and she turned away But he stopped her still Do you think I do not understand he said with a covert sneer that had the keenness and hardness and the brightness of steel I do not sir said Fleda Do you think I do not know whom you came here to meet Fleda s glance of reproach was a most innocent one but it did not check him Has that fellow renewed his old admiration of you he went on in the same tone Do not make me desire his old protection said Fleda her gentle face roused to a flush of displeasure Protection said Charlton coming in who wants protection here it is protection from what my old friend Lewis what the deuce does this lady want of protection mister Thorn It was plain enough that Fleda wanted it from the way she was drooping upon his arm You may ask the lady herself said Thorn in the same tone he had before used I have not the honour to be her spokesman She don t need one said Charlton I addressed myself to you speak for yourself man I am not sure that it would be her pleasure I should said Thorn Shall I tell this gentleman Miss Ringgan who needs protection and from what Fleda raised her head and putting her hand on his arm looked a concentration of entreaty lips were sealed Will you give me said he gently taking the hand in his own your sign manual for captain Rossitur s security It is not too late Ask it of her sir What does this mean said Charlton looking from his cousin to his friend You shall have the pleasure of knowing sir just so soon as I find it convenient I will have a few words with you on this subject my fine fellow said captain Rossitur as the other was preparing to leave the room You had better speak to somebody else said Thorn But I am ready Charlton muttered an imprecation upon his absurdity and turned his attention to Fleda who needed it And yet desired anything else For a moment she had an excuse for not answering his questions in her inability and then opportunely missus Decatur came in to look after her and she was followed by her daughter Fleda roused all her powers to conceal and command her feelings rallied herself said she had been a little weak and faint drank water and declared herself able to go back into the drawing room To go home would have been her utmost desire but at the instant her energies were all bent to the one point of putting back thought and keeping off suspicion And in the first hurry and bewilderment of distress the dread of finding herself alone with Charlton till she had had time to collect her thoughts would of itself have been enough to prevent her accepting the proposal She entered the drawing room again on missus Decatur s arm and had stood a few minutes talking or listening with that same concentration of all her faculties upon the effort to bear up outwardly when Charlton came up to ask if he should leave her Fleda made no objection and he was out of her sight far enough to be beyond reach or recall when it suddenly struck her that she ought not to have let him go without speaking to him without entreating him to see her in the morning before he saw Thorn The sickness of this new apprehension was too much for poor Fleda s power of keeping up She quietly drew her arm from missus Decatur s saying that she would sit down and sought out a place for herself apart from the rest by an engraving stand where for a little while not to seem unoccupied she turned over print after print that she did not see Even that effort failed at last and she sat gazing at one of Sir Thomas Lawrence s bright faced children and feeling as if in herself the tides of life were setting back upon their fountain preparatory to being still forever She became sensible that some one was standing beside the engravings and looked up at mister Carleton Are you ill he said very gently and tenderly The answer was a quick motion of Fleda s hand to her head speaking sudden pain and perhaps sudden difficulty of self command She did not speak Will you have anything A whispered no Would you like to return to missus Evelyn s I have a carriage here With a look of relief that seemed to welcome him as her good angel Pleda instantly rose up and took the arm he offered her She would have hastened from the room then but he gently checked her pace and Fleda was immediately grateful for the quiet and perfect shielding from observation that his manner secured her He went with her up the stairs and to the very door of the dressing room There Fleda hurried on her shoes and mufflers in trembling fear that some one might come and find her gained mister Carleton s arm again and was placed in the carriage The drive was in perfect silence and Fleda s agony deepened and strengthened with every minute She had freedom to think and thought did but carry a torch into chamber after chamber of misery There seemed nothing to be done She could not get hold of Charlton and if she could Nothing could be less amenable than his passions to her gentle restraints mister Thorn was still less approachable or manageable except in one way that she did not even think of His insinuations about mister Carleton did not leave even a tinge of embarrassment upon her mind they were cast from her as insulting absurdities which she could not think of a second time without shame The carriage rolled on with them a long time without a word being said mister Carleton knew that she was not weeping nor faint But as the light of the lamps was now and then cast within the carriage he saw that her face looked ghastly and he saw too that its expression was not of a quiet sinking under sorrow nor of an endeavour to bear up against it but a wild searching gaze into the darkness of possibilities They had near reached missus Evelyn s I cannot see you so he said gently touching the hand which lay listlessly beside him You are ill Again the same motion of the other hand to her face the quick token of great pain suddenly stirred For the sake of old times let me ask said he can nothing be done Those very gentle and delicate tones of sympathy and kindness Were too much to bear The hand was snatched away to be pressed to her face Oh that those old times were back again and she a child that could ask his protection No one to give it now He was silent a moment Fleda s head bowed beneath the mental pressure Has doctor Gregory returned The negative answer was followed by a half uttered exclamation of longing checked midway but sufficiently expressive of her want Do you trust me he said after another second of pausing Perfectly said Fleda amidst her tears too much excited to know what she was saying and in her simplicity half forgetting that she was not a child still more than any one in the world The few words he had spoken and the manner of them had curiously borne her back years in a minute she seemed to be under his care more than for the drive home He did not speak again for a minute when he did his tone was very quiet and lower than before Give me what a friend can have in charge to do for you and it shall be done Fleda raised her head and looked out of the window in a silence of doubt The carriage stopped at missus Evelyn s Not now said mister Carleton as the servant was about to open the door drive round the square till I speak to you Fleda was motionless and almost breathless with uncertainty If Charlton could be hindered from meeting mister Thorn But how could mister Carleton effect it But there was that in him or in his manner which invariably created confidence in his ability or fear of it even in strangers and how much more in her who had a childish but very clear recollection of several points in his character which confirmed the feeling And might not something be done through his means to facilitate her uncle s escape of whom she seemed to herself now the betrayer But to tell him the story I a person of his high nice notions of character what a distance it would put even between his friendship and her but that thought was banished instantly with one glance at mister Thorn s imputation of ungenerousness To sacrifice herself to him would not have been generosity to lower herself in the esteem of a different character she felt called for it There was time even then too for one swift thought of the needlessness and bitter fruits of wrong doing But here they were should she make them known and trouble mister Carleton friend though he were with these miserable matters in which he had no concern She sat with a beating heart and a very troubled brow but a brow as easy to read as a child s It was the trouble of anxious questioning mister Carleton watched it for a little while undecided as ever and more pained You said you trusted me he said quietly taking her hand again But I don t know what you could do mister Carleton Fleda said with a trembling voice Will you let me be the judge of that I cannot bear to trouble you with these miserable things You cannot said he with that same quiet tone but by thinking and saying so I can have no greater pleasure than to take pains for you Fleda heard these words precisely and with the same simplicity as a child would have heard them and answered with a very frank burst of tears soon as soon as possible according to her custom driven back though even in the act of quieting herself they broke forth again as uncontrollably as at first But mister Carleton had not long to wait She raised her head again after a short struggle with the wonted look of patience sitting upon her brow and wiping away her tears paused merely for breath and voice He was perfectly silent mister Carleton I will tell you she began I hardly know whether I ought or ought not and her hand went to her forehead for a moment but I cannot think to night and I have not a friend to apply to She hesitated and then went on with a voice that trembled and quavered sadly mister Thorn has a secret of my uncle s in his power which he promised without conditions to keep faithfully and now insists that he will not but upon conditions And cannot the conditions be met No and O I may as well tell you at once said Fleda in bitter sorrow it is a crime that he committed mister Thorn No oh no said Fleda weeping bitterly not he Her agitation was excessive for a moment then she threw it off and spoke more collectedly though with exceeding depression of manner It was long ago when he was in trouble he put mister Thorn s name to a note and never was able to take it up and nothing was ever heard about it till lately and last week he was going to leave the country and mister Thorn promised that the proceedings should be entirely given up and that was why I came to town to find uncle Rolf and bring him home and I did and he is gone and now mister Thorn says it is all going on again and that he will not escape this time and I have done it Fleda writhed again in distress Thorn promised without conditions Certainly he promised freely and now he insists upon them and you see uncle Rolf would have been safe out of the country now if it hadn t been for me I think I can undo this snarl said mister Carleton calmly But that is not all said Fleda a little quieted Charlton came in this evening when we were talking and he was surprised to find me so and mister Thorn was in a very ill humour and some words passed between them and Charlton threatened to see him again and Oh if he does said poor Fleda that will finish our difficulties for Charlton is very hot and I know how it will end how it must end Where is your cousin to be found I don t know where he lodges when he is in town You did not leave him at missus Decatur s Do you know where he is this evening Yes said Fleda wondering that she should have heard and remembered he said he was going to meet a party of his brother officers at Mme Fouche s a sister in law of his Colonel I believe I know her This note was it the name of the young mister Thorn or of his father that was used Of his father Has he appeared at all in this business No said Fleda feeling for the first time that there was something notable about it What sort of person do you take him to be Very kind very pleasant always he has been to me and I should think to everybody very unlike the son mister Carleton had ordered the coachman back to missus Evelyn s Do you know the amount of the note It may be desirable that I should not appear uninformed It was for four thousand dollars Fleda said in the low voice of shame And when given I don t know exactly but six years ago some time in the winter of forty three it must have been He said no more till the carriage stopped and then before handing her out of it lifted her hand to his lips That carried all the promise Fleda wanted from him How oddly how curiously her hand kept the feeling of that kiss upon it all night Chapter XLV Heat not a furnace for your friend so hot That it may singe yourself Shakspeare mister Carleton went to Mme Fouche s who received most graciously as any lady would his apology for introducing himself unlooked for and begged that he would commit the same fault often As soon as practicable he made his way to Charlton and invited him to breakfast with him the next morning missus Carleton always said it never was known that Guy was refused anything he had a mind to ask Charlton though taken by surprise and certainly not too much prepossessed in his favour was won by an influence that where its owner chose to exert it was generally found irresistible and not only accepted the invitation but was conscious to himself of doing it with a good deal of pleasure Even when mister Carleton made the further request that captain Rossitur would in the mean time see no one on business of any kind intimating that the reason would then be given Charlton though startling a little at this restraint upon his freedom of motion could do no other than give the desired promise and with the utmost readiness Guy then went to mister Thorn s It was by this time not early mister Lewis Thorn is he at home He is sir said the servant admitting him rather hesitatingly I wish to see him a few moments on business It is no hour for business said the voice of mister Lewis from over the balusters I can t see anybody to night I ask but a few minutes said mister Carleton It is important It may be any thing said Thorn I won t do business after twelve o clock mister Carleton desired the servant to carry his card with the same request to mister Thorn the elder What s that said Thorn as the man came up stairs my father Pshaw he can t attend to it Well walk up sir if you please may as well have it over and done with it mister Carleton mounted the stairs and followed the young gentleman into an apartment to which he rapidly led the way You ve no objections to this I suppose Thorn remarked as he locked the door behind them Certainly not said mister Carleton coolly taking out the key and putting it in his pocket my business is private it needs no witnesses Especially as it so nearly concerns yourself said Thorn sneeringly Which part of it sir said mister Carleton with admirable breeding It vexed at the same time that it constrained Thorn I ll let you know presently he said hurriedly proceeding to the lower end of the room where some cabinets stood and unlocking door after door in mad haste The place had somewhat the air of a study perhaps Thorn s private room A long table stood in the middle of the floor with materials for writing and a good many books were about the room in cases and on the tables with maps and engravings and portfolios and a nameless collection of articles the miscellaneous gathering of a man of leisure and some literary taste Their owner presently came back from the cabinets with tokens of a very different kind about him There sir he said offering to his guest a brace of most inhospitable looking pistols take one and take your stand as soon as you please nothing like coming to the point at once He was heated and excited even more than his manner indicated mister Carleton glanced at him and stood quietly examining the pistol he had taken It was all ready loaded This is a business that comes upon me by surprise he said calmly I don t know what I have to do with this mister Thorn Well I do said Thorn and that s enough Take your place sir You escaped me once but and he gave his words dreadful emphasis you won t do it the second time You do not mean said the other that your recollection of such an offence has lived out so many years No sir no sir said Thorn it is not that I despise it as I do the offender You have touched me more nearly Let me know in what said mister Carleton turning his pistol s mouth down upon the table and leaning on it You know already what do you ask me for said Thorn who was foaming if you say you don t you lie heartily I ll tell you nothing but out of this I have not knowingly injured you sir in a whit Then a Carleton may be a liar said Thorn and you are one dare say not the first Put yourself there sir will you Well said Guy carelessly if it is decreed that I am to fight of course there s no help for it but as I have business on hand that might not be so well done afterwards I must beg your attention to that in the first place No sir said Thorn I ll attend to nothing I ll hear nothing from you I know you I ll not hear a word I ll see to the business Take your stand I will not have anything to do with pistols said mister Carleton coolly laying his out of his hand they make too much noise Who cares for the noise said Thorn It won t hurt you and the door is locked But people s ears are not said Guy Neither tone nor attitude nor look had changed in the least its calm gracefulness It began to act upon Thorn Well in the devil s name have your own way said he throwing down his pistol too and going back to the cabinets at the lower end of the room there are rapiers here if you like them better I don t the shortest the best for me but here they are take your choice Guy examined them carefully for a few minutes and then laid them both with a firm hand upon them on the table I will choose neither mister Thorn till you have heard me I came here to see you on the part of others I should be a recreant to my charge if I allowed you or myself to draw me into anything that might prevent my fulfilling it That must be done first Thorn looked with a lowering brow on the indications of his opponent s eye and attitude they left him plainly but one course to take Well speak and have done he said as in spite of himself but I know it already I am here as a friend of mister Rossitur Why don t you say a friend of somebody else and come nearer the truth said Thorn There was an intensity of expression in his sneer but pain was there as well as anger and it was with even a feeling of pity that mister Carleton answered The truth will be best reached sir if I am allowed to choose my own words There was no haughtiness in the steady gravity of this speech whatever there was in the quiet silence he permitted to follow Thorn did not break it I am informed of the particulars concerning this prosecution of mister Rossitur I am come here to know if no terms can be obtained No said Thorn no terms I won t speak of terms The matter will be followed up now till the fellow is lodged in jail where he deserves to be Are you aware sir that this if done will be the cause of very great distress to a family who have not deserved it That can t be helped said Thorn Of course it must cause distress but you can t act upon that Of course when a man turns rogue he ruins his family that s part of his punishment and a just one The law is just said mister Carleton but a friend may be merciful I don t pretend to be a friend said Thorn viciously and I have no cause to be merciful I like to bring a man to public shame when he has forfeited his title to anything else and I intend that mister Rossitur shall become intimately acquainted with the interior of the State s Prison Did it ever occur to you that public shame might fall upon other than mister Rossitur and without the State Prison Thorn fixed a somewhat startled look upon the steady powerful eye of his opponent and did not like its meaning You must explain yourself sir he said haughtily I am acquainted with all the particulars of this proceeding mister Thorn If it goes abroad so surely will they She told you did she said Thorn in a sudden flash of fury mister Carleton was silent with his air of imperturbable reserve telling and expressing nothing but a cool independence that put the world at a distance Ha said Thorn it is easy to see why our brave Englishman comes here to solicit terms for his honest friend Rossitur he would not like the scandal of franking letters to Sing Sing Come sir he said snatching up the pistol our business is ended come I say or I won t wait for you But the pistol was struck from his baud Not yet said mister Carleton calmly you shall have your turn at these mind I promise you but my business must be done first till then let them alone Well what is it said Thorn impatiently Rossitur will be a convict I tell you so you ll have to give up all thoughts of his niece or pocket her shame along with her What more have you got to say that s all your business I take it You are mistaken mister Thorn said mister Carleton gravely Am I In what In every position of your last speech It don t affect your plans and views I suppose personally whether this prosecution is continued or not It does not in the least It is indifferent to you I suppose what sort of a Queen consort you carry to your little throne of a provinciality down yonder I will reply to you sir when you come back to the subject said mister Carleton coldly You mean to say that your pretensions have not been in the way of mine I have made none sir Doesn t she like you I have never asked her Then what possessed her to tell you all this to night Simply because I was an old friend and the only one at hand I presume And you do not look for any reward of your services of course I wish for none sir but her relief Well it don t signify said Thorn with a mixture of expressions in his face if I believed you which I don t it don t signify a hair what you do when once this matter is known I should never think of advancing my pretensions into a felon s family You know that the lady in whose welfare you take so much interest will in that case suffer aggravated distress as having been the means of hindering mister Rossitur s escape Can t help it said Thorn beating the table with a ruler so she has she must suffer for it It isn t my fault You are willing then to abide the consequences of a full disclosure of all the circumstances for part will not come out without the whole There is happily nobody to tell them said Thorn with a sneer Pardon me they will not only be told but known thoroughly in all the circles in this country that know mister Thorn s name The lady said Thorn in the same tone would hardly relish such a publication of her name her welfare would be scantily advantaged by it I will take the risk of that upon myself said mister Carleton quietly and the charge of the other You dare not said Thorn You shall not go alive out of this room to do it Let me have it sir you said you would His passion was at a fearful height for the family pride which had been appealed to felt a touch of fear and his other thoughts were confirmed again besides the dim vision of a possible thwarting of all his plans Desire almost concentrated itself upon revenge against the object that threatened them He had thrown himself again towards the weapons which lay beyond his reach but was met and forcibly withheld from them Stand back said mister Carleton I said I would but I am not ready finish this business first What is there to finish said Thorn furiously you will never live to do anything out of these doors again you are mocking yourself My life is not in your hands sir and I will settle this matter before I put it in peril If not with you with mister Thorn your father to whom it more properly belongs You cannot leave the room to see him said Thorn sneeringly That is at my pleasure said the other unless hindered by means I do not think you will use Thorn was silent Will you yield anything of justice once more in favour of this distressed family That is yield the whole and let the guilty go free When the punishment of the offender would involve that of so many unoffending who in this case would feel it with peculiar severity He deserves it if it was only for the money he has kept me out of he ought to be made to refund what he has stolen if it took the skin off his back That part of his obligation said mister Carleton I am authorized to discharge on condition of having the note given up I have a cheque with me which I am commissioned to fill up from one of the best names here I need only the date of the note which the giver of the cheque did not know Thorn hesitated again tapping the table with the ruler in a troubled manner He knew by the calm erect figure before him and the steady eye he did not care to meet that the threat of disclosure would be kept He was not prepared to brave it in case his revenge should fail and if it did not It is deuced folly he said at length with a half laugh for I shall have it back again in five minutes if my eye don t play me a trick however if you will have it so I don t care There are chances in all things He went again to the cabinets and presently brought the endorsed note mister Carleton gave it a cool and careful examination to satisfy himself of its being the true one and then delivered him the cheque the blank duly filled up There are chances in nothing sir he said as he proceeded to burn the note effectually in the candle What do you mean I mean that there is a Supreme Disposer of all things who among the rest has our lives in his hand And now sir I will give you that chance at my life for which you have been so eagerly wishing Illustration Well take your place said Thorn Well take your place said Thorn seizing his pistol and take your arms put yourself at the end of the table I shall stand here said mister Carleton quietly folding his arms you may take your place where you please But you are not armed said Thorn impatiently why don t you get ready what are you waiting for I have nothing to do with arms said mister Carleton smiling I have no wish to hurt you mister Thorn I bear you no ill will But you may do what you please with me But you promised said Thorn in desperation I abide by my promise sir Thorn s pistol hand fell he looked dreadfully There was a silence of several minutes Well said mister Carleton looking up and smiling I can do nothing unless you will said Thorn hoarsely and looking hurriedly away I am at your pleasure sir But on my own part I have none to gratify There was silence again during which Thorn s face was pitiable in its darkness He did not stir I did not come here in enmity mister Thorn said Guy after a little approaching him I have none now If you believe me you will throw away the remains of yours and take my hand in pledge of it Thorn was ashamed and confounded in the midst of passions that made him at the moment a mere wreck of himself He inwardly drew back exceedingly from the proposal But the grace with which the words were said wrought upon all the gentlemanly character that belonged to him and made it impossible not to comply The pistol was exchanged for mister Carleton s hand I need not assure you said the latter that nothing of what we have talked of to night shall ever be known or suspected in any quarter unless by your means Thorn s answer was merely a bow and mister Carleton withdrew his quondam antagonist lighting him ceremoniously to the door It was easy for mister Carleton the next morning to deal with his guest at the break fast table The appointments of the service were such as of themselves to put Charlton in a good humour if he had not come already provided with that happy qualification and the powers of manner and conversation which his entertainer brought into play not only put them into the background of captain Rossitur s perceptions but even made him merge certain other things in fascination and lose all thought of what probably had called him there Once before he had known mister Carleton come out in a like manner but this time he forgot to be surprised The meal was two thirds over before the business that had drawn them together was alluded to I made an odd request of you last night captain Rossitur said his host you haven t asked for an explanation I had forgotten all about it said Rossitur candidly I am inconsequent enough myself not to think everything odd that requires an explanation Then I hope you will pardon me if mine seem to touch upon what is not my concern You had some cause to be displeased with mister Thorn s behaviour last night Who told you as much was in Rossitur s open eyes and upon his tongue but few ever asked naughty questions of mister Carleton Charlton s eyes came back not indeed to their former dimensions but to his plate in silence He was incomprehensible he said after a minute and didn t act like himself I don t know what was the matter I shall call him to account for it captain Rossitur I am going to ask you a favour I will grant it with the greatest pleasure said Charlton if it lie within my power A wise man s addition said mister Carleton but I trust you will not think me extravagant I will hold myself much obliged to you if you will let mister Thorn s folly or impertinence go this time without notice Charlton absolutely laid down his knife in astonishment while at the same moment this slight let to the assertion of his dignity roused it to uncommon pugnaciousness Sir mister Carleton he stammered I would be very happy to grant anything in my power but this sir really goes beyond it Permit me to say said mister Carleton that I have myself seen Thorn upon the business that occasioned his discomposure and that it has been satisfactorily arranged so that nothing more is to be gained or desired from a second interview Who gave you authority to do any such thing was again in Charlton s eyes and an odd twinge crossed his mind but as before his thoughts were silent My part of the business cannot have been arranged he said for it lies in a question or two that I must put to the gentleman myself What will that question or two probably end in said mister Carleton significantly I can t tell said Rossitur depends on himself it will end according to his answers Is his offence so great that it cannot be forgiven upon my entreaty mister Carleton said Rossitur I would gladly pleasure you sir but you see this is a thing a man owes to himself What thing sir Why not to suffer impertinence to be offered him with impunity Even though the punishment extend to hearts at home that must feel it far more heavily than the offender Would you suffer yourself to be insulted mister Carleton said Rossitur by way of a mouth stopper Not if I could help it said mister Carleton smiling but if such a misfortune happened I don t know how it would be repaired by being made a matter of life and death But honour might said Rossitur Honour is not reached captain Rossitur Honour dwells in a strong citadel and a squib against the walls does in no wise affect their security But also it is not consistent with honour to sit still and suffer it Question The firing of a cracker I think hardly warrants a sally It calls for chastisement though said Rossitur a little shortly I don t know that said mister Carleton gravely We have it on the highest authority that it is the glory of man to pass by a transgression But you can t go by that said Charlton a little fidgeted the world wouldn t get along so men must take care of themselves Certainly But what part of themselves is cared for in this resenting of injuries Why their good name As how affected pardon me By the world s opinion said Rossitur which stamps every man with something worse than infamy who cannot protect his own standing That is to say said mister Carleton seriously that captain Rossitur will punish a fool s words with death or visit the last extremity of distress upon those who are dearest to him rather than leave the world in any doubt of his prowess mister Carleton said Rossitur colouring What do you mean by speaking so sir Not to displease you captain Rossitur Then you count the world s opinion for nothing For less than nothing compared with the regards I have named You would brave it without scruple I do not call him a brave man who would not sir I remember said Charlton half laughing you did it yourself once and I must confess I believe nobody thought you lost anything by it But forgive me for asking said mister Carleton is this terrible world a party to this matter In the request which I made and which I have not given up sir do I presume upon any more than the sacrifice of a little private feeling Why yes said Charlton looking somewhat puzzled for I promised the fellow I would see to it and I must keep my word And you know how that will of necessity issue I can t consider that sir that is a secondary matter I must do what I told him I would At all hazards said mister Carleton What hazards Not hazard but certainty of incurring a reckoning far less easy to deal with What do you mean with yourself said Rossitur No sir said mister Carleton a shade of even sorrowful expression crossing his face I mean with one whose displeasure is a more weighty matter one who has declared very distinctly Thou shalt not kill I am sorry for it said Rossitur after a disturbed pause of some minutes I wish you had asked me anything else but we can t take this thing in the light you do sir I wish Thorn had been in any spot of the world but at missus Decatur s last night or that Fleda hadn t taken me there but since he was there is no help for it I must make him account for his behaviour to her as well as to me I really don t know how to help it sir Let me beg you to reconsider that mister Carleton said with a smile which disarmed offence for if you will not help it I must Charlton looked in doubt for a moment and then asked how he would help it In that case I shall think it my duty to have you bound over to keep the peace He spoke gravely now and with that quiet tone which always carries conviction Charlton stared unmistakably and in silence You are not in earnest he then said I trust you will permit me to leave you forever in doubt on that point said mister Carleton with again a slight giving way of the muscles of his face I cannot indeed said Rossitur Do you mean what you said just now Entirely But mister Carleton said Rossitur flushing and not knowing exactly how to take him up is this the manner of one gentleman towards another He had not chosen right for he received no answer but an absolute quietness which needed no interpretation Charlton was vexed and confused but somehow it did not come into his head to pick a quarrel with his host in spite of his irritation That was perhaps because he felt it to be impossible I beg your pardon he said most unconsciously verifying Fleda s words in his own person but mister Carleton do me the favour to say that I have misunderstood your words They are incomprehensible to me sir I must abide by them nevertheless captain Rossitur mister Carleton answered with a smile I will not permit this thing to be done while as I believe I have the power to prevent it You see he said smiling again I put in practice my own theory Charlton looked exceedingly disturbed and maintained a vexed and irresolute silence for several minutes realizing the extreme disagreeableness of having more than his match to deal with Come captain Kossitur said the other turning suddenly round upon him say that you forgive me what you know was meant in no disrespect to you I certainly should not said Rossitur yielding however with a half laugh if it were not for the truth of the proverb that it takes two to make a quarrel Give me your hand upon that And now that the question of honour is taken out of your hands grant not to me but to those for whom I ask it your promise to forgive this man Charlton hesitated but it was difficult to resist the request backed as it was with weight of character and grace of manner along with its intrinsic reasonableness and he saw no other way so expedient of getting out of his dilemma I ought to be angry with somebody he said half laughing and a little ashamed if you will point out any substitute for Thorn I will let him go since I cannot help myself with pleasure I will bear it said mister Carleton lightly Give me your promise for Thorn and hold me your debtor in what amount you please Very well I forgive him said Rossitur and now mister Carleton I shall have a reckoning with you some day for this I will meet it When you are next in England you shall come down to shire and I will give you any satisfaction you please They parted in high good humour but Charlton looked grave as he went down the staircase and very oddly all the way down to Whitehall his head was running upon the various excellencies and perfections of his cousin Fleda Chapter XLVI There is a fortune coming Towards you dainty that will take thee thus And set thee aloft Ben Jonson That day was spent by Fleda in the never failing headache which was sure to visit her after any extraordinary nervous agitation or too great mental or bodily trial It was severe this time not only from the anxiety of the preceding night but from the uncertainty that weighed upon her all day long The person who could have removed the uncertainty came indeed to the house but she was too ill to see anybody The extremity of pain wore itself off with the day and at evening she was able to leave her room and come down stairs But she was ill yet and could do nothing but sit in the corner of the sofa with her hair unbound and Florence gently bathing her head with cologne Anxiety as well as pain had in some measure given place to exhaustion and she looked a white embodiment of endurance which gave a shock to her friends sympathy Visitors were denied and Constance and Edith devoted their eyes and tongues at least to her service if they could do no more It happened that Joe Manton was out of the way holding an important conference with a brother usher next door a conference that he had no notion would be so important when he began it when a ring on his own premises summoned one of the maid servants to the door She knew nothing about not at home and unceremoniously desired the gentleman to walk up the ladies were in the drawing room The door had been set wide open for the heat and Fleda was close in the corner behind it gratefully permitting Florence s efforts with the cologne which yet she knew could avail nothing but the kind feelings of the operator for herself patiently waiting her enemy s time Constance was sitting on the floor looking at her I can t conceive how you can bear so much she said at length Fleda thought how little she knew what was borne Why you could bear it I suppose if you had to said Edith philosophically She knows she looks most beautiful said Florence softly passing her cologned hands down over the smooth hair she knows Il faut souffrir pour etre belle La migraine ne se guerit avec les douceurs said mister Carleton entering try something sharp Miss Evelyn Where are we to get it said Constance springing up and adding in a most lack a daisical aside to her mother Mamma the fowling piece Our last vinegar hardly comes under the appellation and you don t expect to find anything volatile in this house mister Carleton He smiled Have you none for grave occasions Miss Constance I won t retort the question about something sharp said Constance arching her eyebrows because it is against my principles to make people uncomfortable but you have certainly brought in some medicine with you for Miss Ringgan s cheeks a little while ago were as pure as her mind from a tinge of any sort and now you see My dear Constance said her mother Miss Ringgan s cheeks will stand a much better chance if you come away and leave her in peace How can she get well with such a chatter in her ears mister Carleton and I mamma are conferring upon measures of relief and Miss Ringgan gives token of improvement already For which I am very little to be thanked said mister Carleton But I am not a bringer of bad news that she should look pale at the sight of me Are you a bringer of any news said Constance O do let us have them mister Carleton I am dying for news I haven t heard a bit to day What is the news mister Carleton said her mother s voice from the more distant region of the fire I believe there are no general news missus Evelyn Are there any particular news said Constance I like particular news infinitely the best I am sorry Miss Constance I have none for you But will this headache yield to nothing Fleda prophesied that it would to time said Florence she Would not let us try much beside And I must confess there has been no volatile agency employed at all said Constance I never knew time have less of it and Fleda seemed to prefer him for her physician He hasn t been a good one to day said Edith nestling affectionately to her side Isn t it better Fleda for she had covered her eyes with her hand Not just now said Fleda softly It is fair to change physicians if the first fails said mister Carleton I have had a slight experience in headache curing if you will permit me Miss Constance I will supersede time and try a different prescription He went out to seek it and Fleda leaned her head in her hand and tried to quiet the throbbing heart every pulsation of which was felt so keenly at the seat of pain She knew from mister Carleton s voice and manner she thought she knew that he had exceeding good tidings for her once assured of that she would soon be better but she was worse now Where is mister Carleton gone said missus Evelyn I haven t the least idea mamma he has ventured upon an extraordinary undertaking and has gone off to qualify himself I suppose I can t conceive why he didn t ask Miss Ringgan s permission to change her physician instead of mine I suppose he knew there was no doubt about that said Edith hitting the precise answer of Fleda s thoughts And what should make him think there was any doubt about mine said Constance tartly O you know said her sister you are so odd nobody can tell what you will take a fancy to You are extremely liberal in your expressions at least Miss Evelyn I must say said Constance with a glance of no doubtful meaning Joe did you let mister Carleton in No ma am Well let him in next time and don t let in anybody else Whereafter the party relapsed into silent expectation It was not many minutes before mister Carleton returned Tell your friend Miss Constance he said putting an exquisite little vinaigrette into her hand that I have nothing worse for her than that Worse than this said Constance examining it mister Carleton I doubt exceedingly whether smelling this will afford Miss Ringgan any benefit Why Miss Constance Because it has made me sick only to look at it There will be no danger for her he said smiling Won t there Well Fleda my dear here take it said the young lady I hope you are differently constituted from me for I feel a sudden pain since I saw it but as you keep your eyes shut and so escape the sight of this lovely gold chasing perhaps it will do you no mischief It will do her all the more good for that said missus Evelyn The only ears that took the benefit of this speech were Edith s and mister Carleton s Fleda s were deafened by the rush of feeling She very little knew what she was holding mister Carleton stood with rather significant gravity watching the effect of his prescription while Edith beset her mother to know why the outside of the vinaigrette being of gold should make it do Fleda any more good the disposing of which question effectually occupied missus Evelyn s attention for some time And pray how long is it since you took up the trade of a physician mister Carleton said Constance It is just about nine years Miss Constance he answered gravely But that little reminder slight as it was overcame the small remnant of Fleda s self command the vinaigrette fell from her hands and her face was hid in them whatever became of pain tears must flow Forgive me said mister Carleton gently bending down towards her for speaking when I should have been silent Miss Evelyn and Miss Constance will you permit me to order that my patient be left in quiet And he took them away to missus Evelyn s quarter and kept them all three engaged in conversation too busily to trouble Fleda with any attention till she had had ample time to try the effect of the quiet and of the vinegar both Then he went himself to look after her Are you better said he bending down and speaking low Fleda opened her eyes and gave him what a look of grateful feeling She did not know the half that was in it but he did That she was better was a very small item Ready for the coffee said he smiling O no whispered Fleda it don t matter about that never mind the coffee But he went back with his usual calmness to missus Evelyn and begged that she would have the goodness to order a cup of rather strong coffee to be made But mister Carleton sir said that lady I am not at all sure that it would be the best thing for Miss Ringgan if she is better I think it would do her far more good to go to rest and let sleep finish her cure before taking something that will make sleep impossible Did you ever hear of a physician missus Evelyn he said smiling that allowed his prescriptions to be interfered with I must beg you will do me this favour I doubt very much whether it will be a favour to Miss Ringgan said missus Evelyn however And she rang the bell and gave the desired order with a somewhat disconcerted face But mister Carleton again left Fleda to herself and devoted his attention to the other ladies with so much success though with his usual absence of effort that good humour was served long before the coffee Then indeed he played the physician s part again made the coffee himself and saw it taken according to his own pleasure skilfully however seeming all the while except to Fleda to be occupied with everything else The group gathered round her anew she was well enough to bear their talk by this time by the time the coffee was drunk quite well Is it quite gone asked Edith The headache yes You will owe your physician a great many thanks my dear Fleda said missus Evelyn Fleda s only answer to this however was by a very slight smile and she presently left the room to go up stairs and arrange her yet disarranged hair That is a very fine girl remarked missus Evelyn preparing half a cup of coffee for herself in a kind of amused abstraction my friend mister Thorn will have an excellent wife of her Provided she marries him said Constance somewhat shortly I am sure I hope she won t said Edith and I don t believe she will What do you think of his chances of success mister Carleton Your manner of speech would seem to imply that they are very good missus Evelyn he answered coolly Well don t you think so said missus Evelyn coming back to her seat with her coffee cup and apparently dividing her attention between it and her subject It s a great chance for her most girls in her circumstances would not refuse it I think he s pretty sure of his ground So I think said Florence It don t prove anything if he is said Constance dryly I hate people who are always sure of their ground What do you think mister Carleton said missus Evelyn taking little satisfied sips of her coffee May I ask first what is meant by the chance and what by the circumstances Why mister Thorn has a fine fortune you know and he is of an excellent family there is not a better family in the city and very few young men of such pretensions would think of a girl that has no name nor standing Unless she had qualities that would command them said mister Carleton But mister Carleton sir said the lady do you think that can be do you think a woman can fill gracefully a high place in society if she has had disadvantages in early life to contend with that were calculated to unfit her for it But mamma said Constance Fleda don t shew any such thing No she don t shew it said missus Evelyn but I am not talking of Fleda I am talking of the effect of early disadvantages What do you think mister Carleton Disadvantages of what kind missus Evelyn Why for instance the strange habits of intercourse on familiar terms with rough and uncultivated people such intercourse for years in all sorts of ways in the field and in the house mingling with them as one of them it seems to me it must leave its traces on the mind and on the habits of acting and thinking There is no doubt it does he answered with an extremely unconcerned face And then there s the actual want of cultivation said missus Evelyn warming time taken up with other things you know usefully and properly but still taken up so as to make much intellectual acquirement and accomplishments impossible it can t be otherwise you know neither opportunity nor instructors and I don t think anything can supply the want in after life it isn t the mere things themselves which may be acquired the mind should grow up in the atmosphere of them don t you think so mister Carleton He bowed Music for instance and languages and converse with society and a great many things are put completely beyond reach Edith my dear you are not to touch the coffee nor Constance either no I will not let you And there could not be even much reading for want of books if for nothing else Perhaps I am wrong but I confess I don t see how it is possible in such a case She checked herself suddenly for Fleda with the slow noiseless step that weakness imposed had come in again and stood by the centre table We are discussing a knotty question Miss Ringgan said mister Carleton with a smile as he brought a bergere for her I should like to have your voice on it There was no seconding of his motion He waited till she had seated herself and then went on What in your opinion is the best preparation for wearing prosperity well A glance at missus Evelyn s face which was opposite her and at one or two others which had undeniably the air of being arrested was enough for Fleda s quick apprehension She knew they had been talking of her Her eyes stopped short of mister Carleton s and she coloured and hesitated No one spoke By prosperity you mean Rank and fortune said Florence without looking up Marrying a rich man for instance said Edith and having one s hands full This peculiar statement of the case occasioned a laugh all round but the silence which followed seemed still to wait upon Fleda s reply Am I expected to give a serious answer to that question she said a little doubtfully Expectations are not stringent things said her first questioner smiling That waits upon your choice They are horridly stringent I think said Constance We shall all be disappointed if you don t Fleda my dear By wearing it well you mean making a good use of it And gracefully said missus Evelyn I think I should say then said Fleda after some little hesitation and speaking with evident difficulty Such an experience as might teach one both the worth and the worthlessness of money mister Carleton s smile was a sufficiently satisfied one but missus Evelyn retorted The worth and the worthlessness Fleda my dear I don t understand And what experience teaches one the worth and what the worthlessness of money said Constance Mamma is morbidly persuaded that I do not understand the first of the second I have an indefinite idea from never being able to do more than half that I want with it Fleda smiled and hesitated again in a way that shewed she would willingly be excused but the silence left her no choice but to speak I think she said modestly that a person can hardly understand the true worth of money the ends it can best subserve that has not been taught it by his own experience of the want and What follows said mister Carleton I was going to say sir that there is danger especially when people have not been accustomed to it that they will greatly overvalue and misplace the real worth of prosperity unless the mind has been steadied by another kind of experience and has learnt to measure things by a higher scale And how when they have been accustomed to it said Florence The same danger without the especially said Fleda with a look that disclaimed any assuming One thing is certain said Constance you hardly ever see les nouveaux riches make a graceful use of anything Fleda my dear I am seconding all of your last speech that I understand Mamma I perceive is at work upon the rest I think we ought all to be at work upon it said missus Evelyn for Miss Ringgan has made it out that there is hardly anybody here that is qualified to wear prosperity well I was just thinking so said Florence Fleda said nothing and perhaps her colour rose a little I will take lessons of her said Constance with eyebrows just raised enough to neutralize the composed gravity of the other features as soon as I have an amount of prosperity that will make it worth while But I don t think said Florence that a graceful use of things is consistent with such a careful valuation and considering of the exact worth of everything it s not my idea of grace Yet propriety is an essential element of gracefulness Miss Evelyn Well said Florence certainly but what then Is it attainable in the use of means without a nice knowledge of their true value But mister Carleton I am sure I have seen improper things things improper in a way gracefully done No doubt but Miss Evelyn said he smiling the impropriety did not in those cases I presume attach itself to the other quality The graceful manner was strictly proper to its ends was it not however the ends might be false I don t know said Florence you have gone too deep for me But do you think that close calculation and all that sort of thing is likely to make people use money or anything else gracefully I never thought it did Not close calculation alone said mister Carleton But do you think it is consistent with gracefulness The largest and grandest views of material things that man has ever taken Miss Evelyn stand upon a basis of the closest calculation Florence worked at her worsted and looked very dissatisfied O mister Carleton said Constance as he was going don t leave your vinaigrette there it is on the table He made no motion to take it up Don t you know Miss Constance that physicians seldom like to have anything to do with their own prescriptions It s very suspicious of them said Constance but you must take it mister Carleton if you please for I shouldn t like the responsibility of its being left here and I am afraid it would be dangerous to our peace of mind besides I shall risk that he said laughing Its work is not done And then mister Carleton said missus Evelyn and Fleda knew with what a look you know physicians are accustomed to be paid when their prescriptions are taken But the answer to this was only a bow so expressive in its air of haughty coldness that any further efforts of missus Evelyn s wit were chilled for some minutes after he had gone Fleda had not seen this She had taken up the vinaigrette and was thinking with acute pleasure that mister Carleton s manner last night and to night had returned to all the familiar kindness of old times Not as it had been during the rest of her stay in the city She could be quite contented now to have him go back to England with this pleasant remembrance left her She sat turning over the vinaigrette which to her fancy was covered with hieroglyphics that no one else could read of her uncle s affair of Charlton s danger of her own distress and the kindness which had wrought its relief more penetrating and pleasant than even the fine aromatic scent which fairly typified it Constance s voice broke in upon her musings Isn t it awkward she said as she saw Fleda handling and looking at the pretty toy Isn t it awkward I sha n t have a bit of rest now for fear something will happen to that I hate to have people do such things Fleda my dear said missus Evelyn I wouldn t handle it my love you may depend there is some charm in it some mischievous hidden influence and if you have much to do with it I am afraid you will find a gradual coldness stealing over you and a strange forgetfulness of Queechy and you will perhaps lose your desire ever to go back there any more The vinaigrette dropped from Fleda s fingers but beyond a heightened colour and a little tremulous gravity about the lip she gave no other sign of emotion Mamma said Florence laughing you are too bad Mamma said Constance I wonder how any tender sentiment for you can continue to exist in Fleda s breast By the way Fleda my dear do you know that we have heard of two escorts for you but I only tell you because I know you ll not be fit to travel this age I should not be able to travel to morrow said Fleda They are not going to morrow said missus Evelyn quietly Who are they Excellent ones said missus Evelyn One of them is your old friend mister Olmney mister Olmney said Fleda What has brought him to New York Really said missus Evelyn laughing I do not know What should keep him away I was very glad to see him for my part Maybe he has come to take you home Who is the other said Fleda That s another old friend of yours missus Renney missus Renney who is she said Fleda Why don t you know missus Renney she used to live with your aunt Lucy in some capacity years ago when she was in New York housekeeper I think don t you remember her Perfectly now said Fleda missus Renney She has been housekeeper for missus Schenck these several years and she is going somewhere out West to some relation her brother I believe to take care of his family and her road leads her your way When do they go missus Evelyn Both the same day and both the day after to morrow mister Olmney takes the morning train he says unless you would prefer some other I told him you were very anxious to go and missus Renney goes in the afternoon So there s a choice for you Mamma said Constance Fleda is not fit to go at all either time I don t think she is said missus Evelyn But she knows best what she likes to do Thoughts and resolutions came swiftly one after another into Fleda s mind and were decided upon in as quick succession First that she must go the day after to morrow at all events Second that it should not be with mister Olmney Third that to prevent that she must not see him in the mean time and therefore yes no help for it must refuse to see any one that called the next day there was to be a party in the evening so then she would be safe No doubt mister Carleton would come to give her a more particular account of what he had done and she wished unspeakably to hear it but it was not possible that she should make an exception in his favour and admit him alone That could not be If friends would only be simple and straightforward and kind one could afford to be straightforward too but as it was she must not do what she longed to do and they would be sure to misunderstand There was indeed the morning of the day following left her if mister Olmney did not take it into his head to stay And it might issue in her not seeing mister Carleton at all to bid good bye and thank him He would not think her ungrateful he knew better than that but still Well so much for kindness What are you looking so grave about said Constance Considering ways and means Fleda said with a slight smile Ways and means of what Going You don t mean to go the day after to morrow Yes It s too absurd for anything You sha n t do it I must indeed Mamma said Constance if you permit such a thing I shall hope that memory will be a fingerboard of remorse to you pointing to Miss Ringgan s pale cheeks I shall charge it entirely upon Miss Ringgan s own fingerboard said missus Evelyn with her complacently amused face Fleda my dear shall I request mister Olmney to delay his journey for a day or two my love till you are stronger Not at all missus Evelyn I shall go then if I am not ready in the morning I will take missus Renney in the afternoon I would quite as lief go with her Then I will make mister Olmney keep to his first purpose said missus Evelyn Poor Fleda though with a very sorrowful heart kept her resolutions and for very forlornness and weariness slept away a great part of the next day Neither would she appear in the evening for fear of more people than one It was impossible to tell whether missus Evelyn s love of mischief would not bring mister Olmney there and the Thorns she knew were invited mister Lewis would probably absent himself but Fleda could not endure even the chance of seeing his mother She wanted to know but dared not ask whether mister Carleton had been to see her What if to morrow morning should pass without her seeing him Fleda pondered this uncertainty a little and then jumped out of bed and wrote him the heartiest little note of thanks and remembrance that tears would let her write sealed it and carried it herself to the nearest branch of the despatch post the first thing next morning She took a long look that same morning at the little vinaigrette which still lay on the centre table wishing very much to take it up stairs and pack it away among her things It was meant for her she knew and she wanted it as a very pleasant relic from the kind hands that had given it and besides he might think it odd if she should slight his intention But how odd it would seem to him if he knew that the Evelyns had half appropriated it And appropriate it anew in another direction she could not She could not without their knowledge and they would put their own absurd construction on what was a simple matter of kindness she could not brave it Illustration I told him O you were not gone yet The morning a long one it was had passed away Fleda had just finished packing her trunk and was sitting with a faint hearted feeling of body and mind trying to rest before being called to her early dinner when Florence came to tell her it was ready mister Carleton was here awhile ago she said and he asked for you but mamma said you were busy she knew you had enough to tire you without coming down stairs to see him He asked when you thought of going What did you tell him I told him O you were not gone yet it s such a plague to be bidding people good bye I always want to get rid of it Was I right Fleda said nothing but in her heart she wondered what possible concern it could be of her friends if mister Carleton wanted to see her before she went away She felt it was unkind they did not know how unkind for they did not understand that he was a very particular friend and an old friend they could not tell what reason there was for her wishing to bid him good bye She thought she should have liked to do it very much Chapter XLVII Methought I was there is no man can tell what Methought I was and methought I had But man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had Midsummer Night s Dream missus Evelyn drove down to the boat with Fleda and did not leave her till she was safely put in charge of missus Renney Fleda immediately retreated to the innermost depths of the ladies cabin hoping to find some rest for the body at least if not forgetfulness for the mind The latter was not to be missus Renney was exceeding glad to see her and bent upon knowing what had become of her since those days when they used to know each other You re just the same Miss Fleda that you used to be you re very little altered I can see that though you re looking a good deal more thin and pale you had very pretty roses in your cheeks in those times Yes I know I understood missus Evelyn to say you had not been well but allowing for that I can see you are just yourself still I m glad of it Do you recollect Miss Fleda what a little thing you was then I recollect very well said Fleda I m sure of another thing you re just as good as you used to be said the housekeeper looking at her complacently Do you remember how you used to come into my room to see me make jelly I see it as well as if it was yesterday and you used to beg me to let you squeeze the lemons and I never could refuse you because you never did anything I didn t want you to and do you mind how I used to tie you up in a big towel for fear you would stain your dress with the acid and I d stand and watch to see you putting all your strength to squeeze em clean and be afraid that missus Rossitur would be angry with me for letting you spoil your hands but you used to look up and smile at me so I couldn t help myself but let you do just whatever you had a mind You don t look quite so light and bright as you did in those times but to be sure you ain t feeling well See here just let me pull some of these things onto this settee and you put yourself down there and rest pillows let s have another pillow there how s that Oh if Fleda might have silenced her She thought it was rather hard that she should have two talkative companions on this journey of all others The housekeeper paused no longer than to arrange her couch and see her comfortably laid down And then mister Hugh would come in to find you and carry you away he never could bear to be long from you How is mister Hugh Miss Fleda he used to be always a very delicate looking child I remember you and him used to be always together he was a very sweet boy I have often said I never saw such another pair of children How does mister Hugh have his health Miss Fleda Not very well just now said Fleda gently and shutting her eyes that they might reveal less There was need for the housekeeper went on to ask particularly after every member of the family and where they had been living and as much as she conveniently could about how they had been living She was very kind through it all or she tried to be but Fleda felt there was a difference since the time when her aunt kept house in State street and missus Renney made jellies for her When her neighbours affairs were exhausted missus Renney fell back upon her own and gave Fleda a very circumstantial account of the occurrences that were drawing her westward how so many years ago her brother had married and removed thither how lately his wife had died what in general was the character of his wife and what in particular the story of her decease how many children were left without care and the state of her brother s business which demanded a great deal and how finally she missus Renney had received and accepted an invitation to go on to Belle Riviere and be housekeeper de son chef And as Fleda s pale worn face had for some time given her no sign of attention the housekeeper then hoped she was asleep and placed herself so as to screen her and have herself a good view of everything that was going on in the cabin But poor Fleda was not asleep much as she rejoiced in being thought so Mind and body could get no repose sadly as the condition of both called for it Too worn to sleep perhaps too down hearted to rest She blamed herself for it and told over to herself the causes the recent causes she had of joy and gratitude but it would not do Grateful she could be and was but tears that were not the distillation of joy came with her gratitude came from under the closed eyelid in spite of her the pillow was wet with them She excused herself or tried to with thinking that she was weak and not very well and that her nerves had gone through so much for a few days past it was no wonder if a reaction left her without her usual strength of mind And she could not help thinking there had been a want of kindness in the Evelyns to let her come away to day to make such a journey at such a season under such guardianship But it was not all that she knew it was not The journey was a small matter only a little piece of disagreeableness that was well in keeping with her other meditations She was going home and home had lost all its fair seeming its honours were withered It would be pleasant indeed to be there again to nurse Hugh but nurse him for what life or death she did not like to think and beyond that she could fix upon nothing at all that looked bright in the prospect she almost thought herself wicked but she could not If she might hope that her uncle would take hold of his farm like a man and redeem his character and his family s happiness on the old place that would have been something but he had declared a different purpose and Fleda knew him too well to hope that he would be better than his word Then they must leave the old homestead where at least the associations of happiness clung and go to a strange land It looked desolate to Fleda wherever it might be Leave Queechy that she loved unspeakably beyond any other place in the world where the very hills had been the friends of her childhood and where she had seen the maples grow green and grow red through as many coloured changes of her own fortunes the woods where the shade of her grandfather walked with her and where the presence even of her father could be brought back by memory where the air was sweeter and the sunlight brighter by far than in any other place for both had some strange kindred with the sunny days of long ago Poor Fleda turned her face from missus Renney and leaving doubtful prospects and withering comforts for a while as it were out of sight she wept the fair outlines and the red maples of Queechy as if they had been all she had to regret They had never disappointed her Their countenance had comforted her many a time under many a sorrow After all it was only fancy choosing at which shrine the whole offering of sorrow should be made She knew that many of the tears that fell were due to some other It was in vain to tell herself they were selfish mind and body were in no condition to struggle with anything It had fallen dark some time and she had wept and sorrowed herself into a half dozing state when a few words spoken near aroused her It is snowing was said by several voices Going very slow ain t we said Fleda s friend in a suppressed voice Yes cause it s so dark you see the Captain dursn t let her run Some poor witticism followed from a third party about the Butterfly s having run herself off her legs the first time she ever ran at all and then missus Renney went on Is the storm so bad Hannah Pretty thick can t see far ahead I hope we ll make out to find our way in that s all I care for How far are we Not half way yet I don t know depends on what headway we make you know there ain t much wind yet that s a good thing There ain t any danger is there This of course the chambermaid denied and a whispered colloquy followed which Fleda did not try to catch A new feeling came upon her weary heart a feeling of fear There was a sad twinge of a wish that she were out of the boat and safe back again with the Evelyns and a fresh sense of the unkindness of letting her come away that afternoon so attended And then with that sickness of heart the forlorn feeling of being alone of wanting some one at hand to depend upon to look to It is true that in case of real danger none such could be a real protection and yet not so neither for strength and decision can live and make live where a moment s faltering will kill and weakness must often falter of necessity All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth to his people she thought of that and yet she feared for his ways are often what we do not like A few moments of sick heartedness and trembling and then Fleda mentally folded her arms about a few other words of the Bible and laid her head down in quiet again The Lord is my refuge and my fortress my God in him will I trust And then what comes after He shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler Fleda lay quiet till she was called to tea Bless me how pale you are said the housekeeper as Fleda raised herself up at this summons do you feel very bad Miss Fleda Fleda said no Are you frighted said the housekeeper there s no need of that Hannah says there s no need we ll be in by and by No missus Renney said Fleda smiling I believe I am not very strong yet The housekeeper and Hannah both looked at her with strangely touched faces and again begged her to try the refreshment of tea But Fleda would not go down so they served her up there with great zeal and tenderness And then she waited patiently and watched the people in the cabin as they sat gossiping in groups or stupefying in solitude and thought how miserable a thing is existence where religion and refinement have not taught the mind to live in somewhat beyond and above its every day concern Late at night the boat arrived safe at Bridgeport missus Renney and Fleda had resolved to stay on board till morning when the former promised to take her to the house of a sister she had living in the town as the cars would not leave the place till near eleven o clock Kest was not to be hoped for meantime in the boat on the miserable couch which was the best the cabin could furnish but Fleda was so thankful to have finished the voyage in safety that she took thankfully everything else even lying awake It was a wild night The wind rose soon after they reached Bridgeport and swept furiously over the boat rattling the tiller chains and making Fleda so nervously alive to possibilities that she got up two or three times to see if the boat were fast to her moorings It was very dark and only by a fortunately placed lantern she could see a bit of the dark wharf and one of the posts belonging to it from which the lantern never budged so at last quieted or tired out nature had her rights and she slept It was not refreshing rest after all and Fleda was very glad that missus Renney s impatience for something comfortable made her willing to be astir as early as there was any chance of finding people up in the town Few were abroad when they left the boat they two Not a foot had printed the deep layer of snow that covered the wharf It had fallen thick during the night Just then it was not snowing the clouds seemed to have taken a recess for they hung threatening yet one uniform leaden canopy was over the whole horizon The snow ain t done yet said missus Renney No but the worst of our journey is over said Fleda I am glad to be on the land I hope we ll get something to eat here said missus Renney as they stepped along over the wharf They ought to be ashamed to give people such a mess when it s just as easy to have things decent My how it has snowed I declare if I d ha known I d ha waited till somebody had tracked a path for us But I guess it s just as well we didn t you look as like a ghost as you can Miss Fleda You ll be better when you get some breakfast You d better catch on to my arm I ll waken up the seven sleepers but what I ll have something to put life into you directly Fleda thanked her but declined the proffered accommodation and followed her companion in the narrow beaten path a few travellers had made in the street feeling enough like a ghost if want of flesh and blood reality were enough It seemed a dream that she was walking through the grey light and the empty streets of the little town everything looked and felt so wild and strange If it was a dream she was soon waked out of it In the house where they were presently received and established in sufficient comfort there was such a little specimen of masculine humanity as never shewed his face in dream land yet a little bit of reality enough to bring any dreamer to his senses He seemed to have been brought up on stove heat for he was ail glowing yet from a very warm bed he had just tumbled out of somewhere and he looked at the pale thin stranger by his mother s fireplace as if she were an anomaly in the comfortable world If he could have contented himself with looking but he planted himself firmly on the rug just two feet from Fleda and with a laudable and most persistent desire to examine into the causes of what he could not understand he commenced inquiring Are you cold say Are you cold say in a tone most provokingly made up of wonder and dulness In vain Fleda answered him that she was not very cold and would soon not be cold at all by that good fire the question came again apparently in all its freshness from the interrogator s mind Are you cold say And silence and words looking grave and laughing were alike thrown away Fleda shut her eyes at length and used the small remnant of her patience to keep herself quiet till she was called to breakfast After breakfast she accepted the offer of her hostess to go up stairs and lie down till the cars were ready and there got some real and much needed refreshment of sleep and rest It lasted longer than she bad counted upon For the cars were not ready at eleven o clock the snow last night had occasioned some perplexing delays It was not till near three o clock that the often despatched messenger to the depot brought back word that they might go as soon as they pleased It pleased missus Renney to be in a great hurry for her baggage was in the cars she said and it would be dreadful if she and it went different ways so Fleda and her companion hastened down to the station house and choose their places some time before anybody else thought of coming They had a long very tiresome waiting to go through and room for some uneasy speculations about being belated and a night journey But Fleda was stronger now and bore it all with her usual patient submission At length by degrees the people dropped in and filled the cars and they get off How early do you suppose we shall reach Greenfield said Fleda Why we ought to get there between nine and ten o clock I should think said her companion I hope the snow will hold up till we get there Fleda thought it a hope very unlikely to be fulfilled There were as yet no snow flakes to be seen near by but at a little distance the low clouds seemed already to enshroud every clump of trees and put a mist about every hill They surely would descend more palpably soon It was pleasant to be moving swiftly on again towards the end of their journey if Fleda could have rid herself of some qualms about the possible storm and the certain darkness they might not reach Greenfield by ten o clock and she disliked travelling in the night at any time But she could do nothing and she resigned herself anew to the comfort and trust she had built upon last night She had the seat next the window and with a very sober kind of pleasure watched the pretty landscape they were flitting by misty as her own prospects darkening as they no she would not allow that thought Surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God and I can trust him And she found a strange sweetness in that naked trust and clinging of faith that faith never tried never knows But the breath of daylight was already gone though the universal spread of snow gave the eye a fair range yet white white as far as the view could reach with that light misty drapery round everything in the distance and merging into the soft grey sky and every now and then as the wind served a thick wreath of white vapour came by from the engine and hid all eddying past the windows and then skimming off away over the snowy ground from which it would not lift a more palpable veil for a moment of the distant things and then broken scattered fragmentary lovely in its frailty and evanishing It was a pretty afternoon but a sober and the bare black solitary trees near hand which the cars flew by looked to Fleda constantly like finger posts of the past and back at their bidding her thoughts and her spirits went back and forward comparing in her own mental view what had once been so gay and genial with its present bleak and chill condition And from this in sudden contrast came a strangely fair and bright image of Heaven its exchange of peace for all this turmoil of rest for all this weary bearing up of mind and body against the ills that beset both of its quiet home for this unstable strange world where nothing is at a stand still of perfect and pure society for the unsatisfactory and wearying friendships that the most are here The thought came to Fleda like one of those unearthly clear Northwestern skies from which a storm cloud has rolled away that seem almost to mock Earth with their distance from its defilement and agitations Truly I know that it shall be well with them that fear God She could remember Hugh she could not think of the words without him and yet say them with the full bounding assurance And in that weary and uneasy afternoon her mind rested and delighted itself with two lines of George Herbert that only a Christian can well understand Thy power and love my love and trust Make one place everywhere But the night fell and Fleda at last could see nothing but the dim rail fences they were flying by and the reflection from some stationary lantern on the engine or one of the forward cars that always threw a bright spot of light on the snow Still she kept her eyes fastened out of the window anything but the view inboard They were going slowly now and frequently stopping for they were out of time and some other trains were to be looked out for Nervous work and whenever they stopped the voices which at other times were happily drowned in the rolling of the car wheels rose and jarred in discords far less endurable Fleda shut her ears to the words but it was easy enough without words to understand the indications of coarse and disagreeable natures in whose neighbourhood she disliked to find herself of whose neighbourhood she exceedingly disliked to be reminded The muttered oath the more than muttered jest the various laughs that tell so much of head or heart emptiness the shadowy but sure tokens of that in human nature which one would not realize and which one strives to forget Fleda shrank within herself and would gladly have stopped her ears did sometimes covertly Oh if home could be but reached and she out of this atmosphere how well she resolved that never another time by any motive of delicacy or otherwise she would be tempted to trust herself in the like again without more than womanly protection The hours rolled wearily on they heard nothing of Greenfield yet They came at length to a more obstinate stop than usual Fleda took her hands from her ears to ask what was the matter I don t know said missus Renney I hope they won t keep us a great while waiting here The door swung open and the red comforter and tarpaulin hat of one of the brakemen shewed itself a moment Presently after Can t get on was repeated by several voices in the various tones of assertion interrogation and impatience The women folks having nobody to ask questions of had nothing for it but to be quiet and use their ears Can t get on said another man coming in there s nothing but snow out o doors track s all foul A number of people instantly rushed out to see Can t get on any further to night asked a quiet old gentleman of the news bringer Not another inch sir worse off than old Dobbs was in the mill pond we ve got half way but we can t turn and go back And what are we going to do said an unhappy wight not quick in drawing conclusions I s pose we ll all be stiff by the morning answered the other gravely unless the wood holds out which ain t likely How much there is in even a cheery tone of voice Fleda was sorry when this man took his away with him There was a most uncheering confusion of tongues for a few minutes among the people he had left and then the car was near deserted everybody went out to bring his own wits to bear upon the obstacles in the way of their progress missus Renney observed that she might as well warm her feet while she could and went to the stove for the purpose Poor Fleda felt as if she had no heart left She sat still in her place and leaned her head upon the back of the deserted chair before her in utter inability to keep it up The night journey was bad enough but this was more than she had counted upon Danger to be sure there might be none in standing still there all night unless perhaps the danger of death from the cold she had heard of such things but to sit there till morning among all those people and obliged to hear their unloosed tongues Fleda felt almost that she could not bear it a most forlorn feeling with which came anew a keen reflection upon the Evelyns for having permitted her to run even the hazard of such trouble And in the morning if well it came who would take care of them in all the subsequent annoyance and difficulty of getting out of the snow It must have taken very little time for these thoughts to run through her head for half a minute had not flown when the vacant seat beside her was occupied and a hand softly touched one of hers which lay in her lap Fleda started up in terror to have the hand taken and her eye met by mister Carleton mister Carleton O sir how glad I am to see you was said by eye and cheek as unmistakably as by word Have you come from the clouds I might rather ask that question of you said he smiling You have been invisible ever since the night when I had the honour of playing the part of your physician I could not help it sir I was sure you would believe it I wanted exceedingly to see you and to thank you as well as I could but I was obliged to leave it She could hardly say so much Her swimming eye gave him more thanks than he wanted But she scolded herself vigorously and after a few minutes was able to look and speak again I hoped you would not think me ungrateful sir but in case you might I wrote to let you know that you were mistaken You wrote to me said he Yes sir yesterday morning at least it was put in the post yesterday morning It was more unnecessary than you are aware off he said with a smile and turning one of his deep looks away from her Are we fast here for all night mister Carleton she said presently I am afraid so I believe so I have been out to examine and the storm is very thick You need not look so about it for me said Fleda I don t care for it at all now And a long drawn breath half told how much she had cared for it and what a burden was gone You look very little like breasting hardships said mister Carleton bending on her so exactly the look of affectionate care that she had often had from him when she was a child that Fleda was very near overcome again O you know she said speaking by dint of great force upon herself You know the will is everything and mine is very good But he looked extremely unconvinced and unsatisfied I am so comforted to see you sitting there sir Fleda went on gratefully that I am sure I can bear patiently all the rest His eye turned away and she did not know what to make of his gravity But a moment after he looked again and spoke with his usual manner That business you entrusted to me he said in a lower tone I believe you will have no more trouble with it So I thought so I gathered the other night said Fleda her heart and her face suddenly full of many things The note was given up I saw it burned Fleda s two hands clasped each other mutely And will he be silent I think he will choose to be so for his own sake The only sake that would avail in that quarter Fleda knew How had mister Carleton ever managed it And Charlton she said after a few minutes tearful musing I had the pleasure of captain Rossitur s company to breakfast the next morning and I am happy to report that there is no danger of any trouble arising there How shall I ever thank you sir said Fleda with trembling lips His smile was so peculiar she almost thought he was going to tell her But just then missus Renney having accomplished the desirable temperature of her feet came back to warm her ears and placed herself on the next seat happily not the one behind but the one before them where her eyes were thrown away and the lines of mister Carleton s mouth came back to their usual quiet expression You were in particular haste to reach home he asked Fleda said no not in the abstract it made no difference whether to day or to morrow You had heard no ill news of your cousin Not at all but it is difficult to find an opportunity of making the journey and I thought I ought to come yesterday He was silent again and the baffled seekers after ways and means who had gone out to try arguments upon the storm began to come pouring back into the car And bringing with them not only their loud and coarse voices with every shade of disagreeableness aggravated by ill humour but also an average amount of snow upon their hats and shoulders the place was soon full of a reeking atmosphere of great coats Fleda was trying to put up her window but mister Carleton gently stopped her and began bargaining with a neighbouring fellow traveller for the opening of his Well sir I ll open it if you wish it said the man civilly but they say we sha n t have nothing to make fires with more than an hour or two longer so maybe you ll think we can t afford to let any too much cold in The gentleman however persisting in his wish and the wish being moreover backed with those arguments to which every grade of human reason is accessible the window was opened At first the rush of fresh air was a great relief but it was not very long before the raw snowy atmosphere which made its way in was felt to be more dangerous if it was more endurable than the close pent up one it displaced mister Carleton ordered the window closed again and Fleda s glance of meek grateful patience was enough to pay any reasonable man for his share of the suffering Her share of it was another matter Perhaps mister Carleton thought so for he immediately bent himself to reward her and to avert the evil and for that purpose brought into play every talent of manner and conversation that could beguile the time and make her forget what she was among If success were his reward he had it He withdrew her attention completely from all that was around her and without tasking it she could not have borne that He did not seem to task himself but without making any exertion he held her eye and ear and guarded both from communication with things disagreeable He knew it There was not a change in her eye s happy interest till in the course of the conversation Fleda happened to mention Hugh and he noticed the saddening of the eye immediately afterwards Is he ill said mister Carleton I don t know said Fleda faltering a little he was not very but a few weeks ago Her eye explained the broken sentences which there in the neighbourhood of other ears she dared not finish He will be better after he has seen you said mister Carleton gently Yes A very sorrowful and uncertain yes with an if in the speaker s mind which she did not bring out Can you sing your old song yet said mister Carleton softly Yet one thing secures us Whatever betide But Fleda burst into tears Forgive me he whispered earnestly for reminding you of that you did not need it and I have only troubled you No sir you have not said Fleda it did not trouble me and Hugh knows it better than I do I cannot bear anything to night I believe So you have remembered that mister Carleton she said a minute after Do you remember that said he putting her old little Bible into her hand Fleda seized it but she could hardly bear the throng of images that started up around it The smooth worn cover brought so back the childish happy days when it had been her constant companion the shadows of the Queechy of old and Cynthia and her grandfather and the very atmosphere of those times when she had led a light hearted strange wild life all alone with them reading the Encyclopaedia and hunting out the wood springs She opened the book and slowly turned over the leaves where her father s hand had drawn those lines of remark and affection round many a passage the very look of them she knew but she could not see it now for her eyes were dim and tears were dropping fast into her lap she hoped mister Carleton did not see them but she could not help it she could only keep the book out of the way of being blotted And there were other and later associations she had with it too how dear how tender how grateful mister Carleton was quite silent for a good while till the tears had ceased then he bent towards her so as to be heard no further off It has been for many years my best friend and companion he said in a low tone Fleda could make no answer even by look At first he went on softly I had a strong association of you with it but the time came when I lost that entirely and itself quite swallowed up the thought of the giver A quick glance and smile told how well Fleda understood how heartily she was pleased with that But she instantly looked away again And now said mister Carleton after a pause for some time past I have got the association again and I do not choose to have it so I have come to the resolution to put the book back into your hands and not receive it again unless the giver go with the gift Fleda looked up a startled look of wonder into his face but the dark eye left no doubt of the meaning of his words and in unbounded confusion she turned her own and her attention ostensibly to the book in her hand though sight and sense were almost equally out of her power For a few minutes poor Fleda felt as if all sensation had retreated to her finger ends She turned the leaves over and over as if willing to cheat herself or her companion into the belief that she had something to think of there while associations and images of the past were gone with a vengeance swallowed up in a tremendous reality of the present and the book which a minute ago was her father s Bible was now what was it something of mister Carleton s which she must give back to him But still she held it and looked at it conscious of no one distinct idea but that and a faint one besides that he might like to be repossessed of his property in some reasonable time time like everything else was in a whirl the only steady thing in creation seemed to be that perfectly still and moveless figure by her side till her trembling fingers admonished her they would not be able to hold anything much longer and gently and slowly without looking her hand put the book back towards mister Carleton That both were detained together she knew but hardly felt the thing was that she had given it There was no other answer and there was no further need that mister Carleton should make any efforts for diverting her from the scene and the circumstances where they were Probably he knew that for he made none He was perfectly silent for a long time and Fleda was deaf to any other voice that could be raised near or far She could not even think missus Renney was happily snoring and most of the other people had descended into their coat collars or figuratively speaking had lowered their blinds by tilting over their hats in some uncomfortable position that signified sleep and comparative quiet had blessed the place for some time as little noticed indeed by Fleda as noise would have been The sole thing that she clearly recognized in connection with the exterior world was that clasp in which one of her hands lay She did not know that the car had grown quiet and that only an occasional grunt of ill humour or waking up colloquy testified that it was the unwonted domicile of a number of human beings who were harbouring there in a disturbed state of mind But this state of things could not last The time came that had been threatened when their last supply of extrinsic warmth was at an end Despite shut windows the darkening of the stove was presently followed by a very sensible and fast increasing change of temperature and this addition to their causes of discomfort roused every one of the company from his temporary lethargy The growl of dissatisfied voices awoke again more gruff than before the spirit of jesting had long languished and now died outright and in its stead came some low and deep and bitter spoken curses Poor missus Renney shook off her somnolency and shook her shoulders a little business shake admonitory to herself to keep cool and Fleda came to the consciousness that some very disagreeable chills were making their way over her Are you warm enough said mister Carleton suddenly turning to her Not quite said Fleda hesitating I feel the cold a little Please don t mister Carleton she added earnestly as she saw him preparing to throw off his cloak the identical black fox which Constance had described with so much vivacity pray do not I am not very cold I can bear a little I am not so tender as you think me I do not need it and you would feel the want very much after wearing it I won t put it on But he smilingly bade her stand up stooping down and taking one of her hands to enforce his words and giving her at the same time the benefit of one of those looks of good humoured wilfulness to which his mother always yielded and to which Fleda yielded instantly though with a colour considerably heightened at the slight touch of peremptoriness in his tone You are not offended with me Elfie he said in another manner when she had sat down again and he was arranging the heavy folds of the cloak Offended A glance answered You shall have everything your own way he whispered gently as he stooped down to bring the cloak under her feet except yourself What good care should be taken of that exception was said in the dark eye at which Fleda hardly ventured half a glance She had much ado to command herself She was shielded again from all the sights and sounds within reach She was in a maze The comfort of the fur cloak was curiously mixed with the feeling of something else of which that was an emblem a surrounding of care and strength which would effectually be exerted for her protection somewhat that Fleda had not known for many a long day the making up of the old want Fleda had it in her heart to cry like a baby Such a dash of sunlight had fallen at her feet that she hardly dared look at it for fear of being dazzled but she could not look anywhere that she did not see the reflection In the mean time the earful of people settled again into sullen quietude The cold was not found propitious to quarrelling Those who could subsided anew into lethargy those who could not gathered in their outposts to make the best defence they might of the citadel Most happily it was not an extreme night cold enough to be very disagreeable and even without a fur cloak dangerous but not enough to put even noses and ears in immediate jeopardy mister Carleton had contrived to procure a comfortable wrapper for missus Renney from a Yankee who for the sake of being a warm man as to his pockets was willing to be cold otherwise for a time The rest of the great coats and cloaks which were so alert and erect a little while ago were doubled up on every side in all sorts of despondent attitudes A dull quiet brooded over the assembly and mister Carleton walked up and down the vacant space Once he caught an anxious glance from Fleda and came immediately to her side You need not be troubled about me he said with a most genial smile I am not suffering never was further from it in my life Fleda could neither answer nor look There are not many hours of the night to wear out he said Can t you follow your neighbour s example She shook her head This watching is too hard for you You will have another headache to morrow No perhaps not she said with a grateful look up You do not feel the cold now Elfie Not at all not in the least I am perfectly comfortable I am doing very well He stood still and the changing lights and shades on Fleda s cheek grew deeper Do you know where we are mister Carleton Somewhere between a town the name of which I have forgotten and a place called Quarrenton I think and Quarrenton they tell me is but a few miles from Greenfield Our difficulties will vanish I hope with the darkness He walked again and Fleda mused and wondered at herself in the black fox She did not venture another look though her eye took in nothing very distinctly but the outlines of that figure passing up and down through the car He walked perseveringly and weariness at last prevailed over everything else with Fleda she lost herself with her head leaning against the bit of wood between the windows The rousing of the great coats and the growing gray light roused her before her uneasy sleep had lasted an hour The lamps were out the car was again spotted with two long rows of window panes through which the light as yet came but dimly The morning had dawned at last and seemed to have brought with it a fresh accession of cold for everybody was on the stir Fleda put up her window to get a breath of fresh air and see how the day looked A change of weather had come with the dawn It was not fine yet The snowing had ceased but the clouds hung overhead still though not with the leaden uniformity of yesterday they were higher and broken into many a soft grey fold that promised to roll away from the sky by and by The snow was deep on the ground every visible thing lapped in a thick white covering a still very grave very pretty winter landscape but somewhat dreary in its aspect to a trainful of people fixed in the midst of it out of sight of human habitation Fleda felt that but only in the abstract to her it did not seem dreary she enjoyed the wild solitary beauty of the scene very much with many a grateful thought of what might have been As it was she left difficulties entirely to others As soon as it was light the various inmates of the strange dormitory gathered themselves up and set out on foot for Quarrenton By one of them mister Carleton sent an order for a sleigh which in as short a time as possible arrived and transported him and Fleda and missus Renney and one other ill bestead woman safely to the little town of Quarrenton Chapter XLVIII Welcome the sour cup of prosperity Affliction may one day smile again and till then Sit thee down sorrow Love s Labour Lost It had been a wild night and the morning looked scared Perhaps it was only the particular locality for if ever a place shewed bleak and winter stricken the little town of Quarrenton was in that condition that morning The snow overlaid and enveloped everything except where the wind had been at work and the wind and the grey clouds seemed the only agencies abroad Nor a ray of sunlight to relieve the uniform sober tints the universal grey and white only varied where a black house roof partially cleared or a blacker bare branched tree gave it a sharp interruption There was not a solitary thing that bore an indication of comfortable life unless the curls of smoke that went up from the chimneys and Fleda was in no condition to study their physiognomy A little square hotel perched alone on a rising ground looked the especial bleak and unpromising spot of the place It bore however the imposing title of the Pocahontas and there the sleigh set them down They were ushered up stairs into a little parlour furnished in the usual style with one or two articles a great deal too showy for the place and a general dearth as to the rest A lumbering mahogany sofa that shewed as much wood and as little promise as possible a marble topped centre table chairs in the minority and curtains minus and the hearth rug providently turned bottom upwards On the centre table lay a pile of Penny Magazines a volume of selections of poetry from various good authors and a sufficient complement of newspapers The room was rather cold but of that the waiter gave a reasonable explanation in the fact that the fire had not been burning long Furs however might be dispensed with or Fleda thought so and taking off her bonnet she endeavoured to rest her weary head against the sharp cut top of the sofa back which seemed contrived expressly to punish and forbid all attempts at ease seeking The mere change of position was still comparative ease But the black fox had not done duty yet Its ample folds were laid over the sofa cushion back and all so as at once to serve for pillow and mattress and Fleda being gently placed upon it laid her face down again upon the soft fur which gave a very kindly welcome not more to the body than to the mind Fleda almost smiled as she felt that The furs were something more than a pillow for her cheek they were the soft image of somewhat for her mind to rest on But entirely exhausted too much for smiles or tears though both were near she resigned herself as helplessly as an infant to the feeling of rest and in five minutes was in a state of dreamy unconsciousness missus Renney who had slept a great part of the night courted sleep anew in the rocking chair till breakfast should be ready the other woman had found quarters in the lower part of the house and mister Carleton stood still with folded arms to read at his leisure the fair face that rested so confidingly upon the black fur of his cloak looking so very fair in the contrast It was the same face he had known in time past the same with only an alteration that had added new graces but had taken away none of the old Not one of the soft outlines had grown hard under Time s discipline not a curve had lost its grace or its sweet mobility and yet the hand of Time had been there for on brow and lip and cheek and eyelid there was that nameless grave composure which said touchingly that hope had long ago clasped hands with submission And perhaps that if hope s anchor had not been well placed ay even where it could not be moved the storms of life might have beaten even hope from her ground and made a clean sweep of desolation over all she had left Not the storms of the last few weeks mister Carleton saw and understood their work in the perfectly colourless and thin cheek But these other finer drawn characters had taken longer to write He did not know the instrument but he read the hand writing and came to his own resolutions therefrom Yet if not untroubled she had remained unspotted by the world that was as clear as the other The slight eyebrow sat with its wonted calm purity of outline just where it used the eyelid fell as quietly the forehead above it was as unruffled and if the mouth had a subdued gravity that it had taken years to teach it had neither lost any of the sweetness nor any of the simplicity of childhood It was a strange picture that mister Carleton was looking at strange for its rareness In this very matter of simplicity that the world will never leave those who belong to it Half sitting and half reclining she had given herself to rest with the abandonment and self forgetfulness of a child her attitude had the very grace of a child s unconsciousness and her face shewed that even in placing herself there she had lost all thought of any other presence or any other eyes than her own even of what her hand and cheek lay upon and what it betokened It meant something to mister Carleton too and if Fleda could have opened her eyes she would have seen in those that were fixed upon her a happy promise for her future life She was beyond making any such observations and missus Renney gave no interruption to his till the breakfast bell rang mister Carleton had desired the meal to be served in a private room But he was met with a speech in which such a confusion of arguments endeavoured to persuade him to be of another mind that he had at last given way It was asserted that the ladies would have their breakfast a great deal quicker and a great deal hotter with the rest of the company and in the same breath that it would be a very great favour to the house if the gentleman would not put them to the inconvenience of setting a separate table the reasons of which inconvenience were set forth in detail or would have been if the gentleman would have heard them and desirous especially of haste on Fleda s account mister Carleton signified his willingness to let the house accommodate itself Following the bell a waiter now came to announce and conduct them to their breakfast Down the stairs through sundry narrow turning passages they went to a long low room at one corner of the house where a table was spread for a very nondescript company as it soon proved many of their last night s companions having found their way thither The two ladies however were given the chief posts at the head as near as possible to a fiery hot stove and served with tea and coffee from a neighbouring table by a young lady in long ringlets who was there probably for their express honour But alas for the breakfast They might as good have had the comfort of a private room for there was none other to be had Of the tea and coffee it might be said as once it was said of two bad roads whichever one you take you will wish you had taken the other the beefsteak was a problem of impracticability and the chickens Fleda could not help thinking that a well to do rooster which she saw flapping his wings in the yard must in all probability be at that very moment endeavouring to account for a sudden breach in his social circle and if the oysters had been some very fine ladies they could hardly have retained less recollection of their original circumstances It was in vain to try to eat or to drink and Fleda returned to her sofa with even an increased appetite for rest the more that her head began to take its revenge for the trials to which it had been put the past day and night She had closed her eyes again in her old position missus Renney was tying her bonnet strings mister Carleton was pacing up and down Aren t you going to get ready Miss Ringgan said the former How soon will the cars be here exclaimed Fleda starting up Presently said mister Carleton but said he coming up to her and taking her hands I am going to prescribe for you again will you let me Fleda s face gave small promise of opposition You are not fit to travel now You need some hours of quiet rest before we go any further But when shall we get home said Fleda In good time not by the railroad there is a nearer way that will take us to Queechy without going through Greenfield I have ordered a room to be made ready for you will you try if it be habitable Fleda submitted and indeed there was in his manner a sort of gentle determination to which few women would have opposed themselves besides that her head threatened to make a journey a miserable business You are ill now said mister Carleton Cannot you induce your companion to stay and attend you I don t want her said Fleda mister Carleton however mooted the question himself with missus Renney but she represented to him though with much deference that the care of her property must oblige her to go where and when it went He rang and ordered the housekeeper to be sent Presently after a young lady in ringlets entered the room and first taking a somewhat leisurely survey of the company walked to the window and stood there looking out A dim recollection of her figure and air made Fleda query whether she were not the person sent for but it was several minutes before it came into mister Carleton s head to ask if she belonged to the house I do sir was the dignified answer Will you shew this lady the room prepared for her And take care that she wants nothing The owner of the ringlets answered not but turning the front view of them full upon Fleda seemed to intimate that she was ready to act as her guide She hinted however that the rooms were very airy in winter and that Fleda would stand a better chance of comfort where she was But this Fleda would not listen to and followed her adviser to the half warmed and certainly very airy apartment which had been got ready for her It was probably more owing to something in her own appearance than to mister Carleton s word of admonition on the subject that her attendant was really assiduous and kind Be you of this country she said abruptly after her good offices as Fleda thought were ended and she had just closed her eyes She opened them again and said yes Well that ain t in the parlour is he What said Fleda One of our folks An American you mean No I thought he wa n t What is he He is English Is he your brother No The young lady gave her a good look out of her large dark eyes and remarking that she thought they didn t look much like left the room The day was spent by poor Fleda between pain and stupor each of which acted in some measure to check the other too much exhausted for nervous pain to reach the height it sometimes did while yet that was sufficient to prevent stupor from sinking into sleep Beyond any power of thought or even fancy with only a dreamy succession of images flitting across her mind the hours passed she knew not how that they did pass she knew from her handmaid in the long curls who was every now and then coming in to look at her and give her fresh water it needed no ice Her handmaid told her that the cars were gone by that it was near noon then that it was past noon There was no help for it she could only lie still and wait it was long past noon before she was able to move and she was looking ill enough yet when she at last opened the door of the parlour and slowly presented herself mister Carleton was there alone missus Renney having long since accompanied her baggage He came forward instantly and led Fleda to the sofa with such gentle grave kindness that she could hardly bear it her nerves had been in an unsteady state all day A table was set and partially spread with evidently much more care than the one of the morning and Fleda sat looking at it afraid to trust herself to look anywhere else For years she had been taking care of others and now there was something so strange in this feeling of being cared for that her heart was full Whatever mister Carleton saw or suspected of this it did not appear On the contrary his manner and his talk on different matters was as cool as quiet as graceful as if neither he nor Fleda had anything particular to think of avoiding even an allusion to whatever might in the least distress her Fleda thought she had a great many reasons to be grateful to him but she never thanked him for anything more than at that moment she thanked him for the delicacy which so regarded her delicacy and put her in a few minutes completely at her ease as she could be The refreshments were presently brought and Fleda was served with them in a way that went as far as possible towards making them satisfactory but though a great improvement upon the morning they furnished still but the substitute for a meal There was a little pause then after the horses were ordered I am afraid you have wanted my former prescription to day said mister Carleton after considering the little improved colour of Fleda s face I have indeed Where is it Fleda hesitated and then in a little confusion said she supposed it was lying on missus Evelyn s centre table How happens that said he smiling Because I could not help it mister Carleton said Fleda with no little difficulty I was foolish I could not bring it away He understood and was silent Are you fit to bear a long ride in the cold he said compassionately a few minutes after Oh yes It will do me good You have had a miserable day have you not My head has been pretty bad said Fleda a little evasively Well what would you have said he lightly doesn t that make a miserable day of it Fleda hesitated and coloured and then conscious that her cheeks were answering for her coloured so exceedingly that she was fain to put both her hands up to hide what they only served the more plainly to shew No advantage was taken mister Carleton said nothing she could not see what answer might be in his face It was only by a peculiar quietness in his tone whenever he spoke to her afterwards that Fleda knew she had been thoroughly understood She dared not lift her eyes They had soon employment enough around her A sleigh and horses better than anything else Quarrenton had been known to furnish were carrying her rapidly towards home the weather had perfectly cleared off and in full brightness and fairness the sun was shining upon a brilliant world It was cold indeed though the only wind was that made by their progress but Fleda had been again unresistingly wrapped in the furs and was for the time beyond the reach of that or any other annoyance She eat silently and quietly enjoying so quietly that a stranger might have questioned there being any enjoyment in the case It was a very picturesque broken country fresh covered with snow and at that hour late in the day the lights and shadows were a constantly varying charm to the eye Clumps of evergreens stood out in full disclosure against the white ground the bare branches of neighbouring trees in all their barrenness had a wild prospective or retrospective beauty peculiar to themselves On the wavy white surface of the meadow land or the steep hill sides lay every variety of shadow in blue and neutral tint where they lay not the snow was too brilliant to be borne And afar off through a heaven bright and cold enough to hold the canopy over Winter s head the ruler of the day was gently preparing to say good bye to the world Fleda s eye seemed to be new set for all forms of beauty and roved from one to the other as grave and bright as nature itself For a little way mister Carleton left her to her musings and was as silent as she But then he gently drew her into a conversation that broke up the settled gravity of her face and obliged her to divide her attention between nature and him and his part of it he knew how to manage But though eye and smile constantly answered him he could win neither to a straightforward bearing They were about a mile from Queechy when Pleda suddenly exclaimed O mister Carleton please stop the sleigh I The horses were stopped It is only Earl Douglass our farmer Fleda said in explanation I want to ask how they are at home In answer to her nod of recognition mister Douglass came to the side of the vehicle but till he was there close gave her no other answer by word or sign when there broke forth his accustomed guttural How d ye do How d ye do mister Douglass said Fleda How are they all at home Well there ain t nothin new among em as I ve heerd on said Earl diligently though stealthily at the same time qualifying himself to make a report of mister Carleton I guess they ll be glad to see you I be Thank you mister Douglass How is Hugh He ain t nothin different from what he s been for a spell back at least I ain t heerd that he was Maybe he is but if he is I han t heerd speak of it and if he was I think I should ha heerd speak of it He was pretty bad a spell ago about when you went away but he s been better sen So they say I ha n t seen him Well Flidda he added with somewhat of a sly gleam in his eye do you think you re going to make up your mind to stay to hum this time I have no immediate intention of running away mister Douglass said Fleda her pale cheeks turning rose as she saw him looking curiously up and down the edges of the black fox His eye came back to hers with a good humoured intelligence that she could hardly stand It s time you was back said he Your uncle s to hum but he don t do me much good whatever he does to other folks nor himself nother as far as the farm goes there s that corn Very well mister Douglass said Fleda I shall be at home now and I ll see about it Very good said Earl as he stepped back Queechy can t get along without you that s no mistake They drove on a few minutes in silence Aren t you thinking mister Carleton said Fleda that my countrymen are a strange mixture I was not thinking of them at all at this moment I believe such a notion has crossed my mind It has crossed mine very often said Fleda How do you read them what is the basis of it Illustration How are they all at home I think the strong self respect which springs from the security and importance that republican institutions give every man But she added colouring I have seen very little of the world and ought not to judge I have no doubt you are quite right said mister Carleton smiling But don t you think an equal degree of self respect may consist with giving honour where honour is due Yes said Fleda a little doubtfully where religion and not republicanism is the spring of it Humility and not pride said he Yes you are right My countrymen do yield honour where they think it is due said Fleda especially where it is not claimed They must give it to reality not to pretension And I confess I would rather see them a little rude in their independence than cringing before mere advantages of external position even for my own personal pleasure I agree with you Elfie putting perhaps the last clause out of the question Now that man said Fleda smiling at his look I suppose his address must have struck you as very strange and yet there was no want of respect under it I am sure he has a true thorough respect and even regard for me and would prove it on any occasion I have no doubt of that But it does not satisfy you Not quite I confess I should require more from any one under my control Oh nobody is under control here said Fleda That is I mean individual control Unless so far as self interest comes in I suppose that is all powerful here as elsewhere And the reason it gives less power to individuals is that the greater freedom of resources makes no man s interest depend so absolutely on one other man That is a reason you cannot regret No your countrymen have the best of it Elfie But do you suppose that this is a fair sample of the whole country I dare not say that said Fleda I am afraid there is not so much intelligence and cultivation everywhere But I am sure there are many parts of the land that will bear a fair comparison with it It is more than I would dare say for my own land I should think Fleda suddenly stopped What said mister Carleton gently I beg your pardon sir I was going to say something very presumptuous You cannot he said in the same tone I was going to say said Fleda blushing that I should think there might be a great deal of pleasure in raising the tone of mind and character among the people as one could who had influence over a large neighbourhood His smile was very bright in answer I have been trying that Elfie for the last eight years Fleda s eye looked now eagerly in pleasure and in curiosity for more But he was silent I was thinking a little while ago he said of the time once before when I rode here with you when you were beginning to lead me to the problem I have been trying to work out ever since When I left you in Paris I went to resolve with myself the question What I had to do in the world Your little Bible was my invaluable help I had read very little of it when I threw aside all other books and my problem was soon solved I saw that the life has no honour nor value which is not spent to the glory of God I saw the end I was made for the happiness I was fitted for the dignity to which even a fallen creature may rise through his dear Redeemer and surety Fleda s eyes were down now mister Carleton was silent a moment watching one or two bright witnesses that fell from them The next conclusion was easy that my work was at home I have wanted my good fairy mister Carleton went on smiling But I hope she will be contented to carry the standard of Christianity without that of republicanism But Christianity tends directly to republicanism mister Carleton said Fleda trying to laugh I know that said he smiling and I am willing to know it But the leaven of truth is one thing and the powder train of the innovator is another Fleda sat thinking that she had very little in common with the layers of powder trains She did not know the sleigh was passing Deepwater Lake till mister Carleton said I am glad my dear Elfie for your sake that we are almost at the end of your journey I should think you might be glad for your own sake mister Carleton No my journey is not ended Not No it will not be ended till I get back to New York or rather till I find myself here again I shall make very little delay there But you will not go any further to night said Fleda her eye this time meeting his fully Yes I must take the first train to New York I have some reason to expect my mother by this steamer Back to New York said Fleda Then taking care of me has just hindered you in your business But even as she spoke she read the truth in his eye and her own fell in confusion My business said he smiling you know it now Elfie I arrived at missus Evelyn s just after you had quitted it intending to ask you to take the long talked of drive and learned to my astonishment that you had left the city and as Edith kindly informed me under no better guardianship than that in which I found you I was just in time to reach the boat And you were in the boat night before last Certainly I should have felt a great deal easier if I had known that said Fleda So should I said he but you were invisible till I discerned you in the midst of a crowd of people before me in the car Fleda was silent till the sleigh stopped and mister Carleton had handed her out What s going to be done I will send somebody down to help you with it said Fleda It is too heavy for one alone Well I reckon it is said he I guess you didn t know I was a cousin did you No said Fleda I believe I be Who are you I am Pierson Barnes I live to Quarrenton for a year back Squire Joshua Springer s your uncle ain t he Yes my father s uncle Well he s mine too His sister s my mother I ll send somebody to help you mister Barnes She took mister Carleton s arm and walked half the way up to the house without daring to look at him Another specimen of your countrymen he said smiling There was nothing but quiet amusement in the tone and there was not the shadow of anything else in his face Fleda looked and thanked him mentally and drew breath easier At the house door he made a pause You are coming in mister Carleton Not now It is a long drive to Greenfield mister Carleton you must not turn away from a country house till we have shewn ourselves unworthy to live in it You will come in and let us give you something more substantial than those Quarrenton oysters Do not say no she said earnestly as she saw a refusal in his eye I know what you are thinking of but they do not know that you have been told anything it makes no difference She laid her gentle detaining hand as irresistible in its way as most things upon his arm and he followed her in Only Hugh was in the sitting room and he was in a great easy chair by the fire It struck to Fleda s heart but there was no time but for a flash of thought He had turned his face and saw her Fleda meant to have controlled herself and presented mister Carleton properly but Hugh started up he saw nothing but herself and one view of the ethereal delicacy of his face made Fleda for a moment forget everything but him They were in each other s arms and then still as death Hugh was unconscious that a stranger was there and though Fleda was very conscious that one was there who was no stranger there was so much in both hearts so much of sorrow and joy and gratitude and tenderness on the one part and on the other so much that even if they had been alone lips could only have said silently that for a little while they kissed each other and wept in a passionate attempt to speak what their hearts were too full of Fleda at last whispered to Hugh that somebody else was there and turned to make as well as she might the introduction But mister Carleton did not need it and made his own with that singular talent which in all circumstances wherever he chose to exert it had absolute power Fleda saw Hugh s countenance change with a kind of pleased surprise and herself stood still under the charm for a minute then she recollected she might be dispensed with She took up her little spaniel who was in an agony of gratulation at her feet and went out into the kitchen Well do you mean to say you are here at last said Barby her grey eyes flashing pleasure as she came forward to take the half hand which owing to King s monopoly was all Fleda had to give her Have you come home to stay Fleda I am tired enough to be quiet said Fleda But dear Barby what have you got in the house I want supper as quickly as it can be had Well you do look dreadful bad said Barby eying her Why there ain t much particular Fleda nobody s had any heart to eat lately I thought I might a most as well save myself the fuss of getting victuals Hugh lives like a bird and Mis Rossitur ain t much better and I think all of em have been keeping their appetites till you came back cept Philetus and me we keep it up pretty well Why you re come home hungry ain t you No not I said Fleda but there s a gentleman here that came with me that must have something before he goes away again What have you Barby Who is he said Barby A friend that took care of me on the way I ll tell you about it but in the mean time supper Barby Is he a New Yorker that one must be curious for As curious as you like said Fleda but he is not a New Yorker Where is he from then said Barby who was busily putting on the tea kettle England England said Barby facing about Oh if he s an Englishman I don t care for him Fleda But you care for me said Fleda laughing and for my sake don t let our hospitality fail to somebody who has been very kind to me if he is an Englishman and he is in haste to be off Well I don t know what we re a going to give him said Barby looking at her There ain t much in the pantry besides cold pork and beans that Philetus and me made our dinner on they wouldn t have it in there and eat nothing but some pickerel the doctor sent down and cold fish ain t good for much None of them left uncooked Yes there s a couple he sent a great lot I guess he thought there was more in the family but two ain t enough to go round they re little ones No but put them down and I ll make an omelette Just get the things ready for me Barby will you while I run up to see aunt Lucy The hens have begun to lay La yes Philetus fetches in lots of eggs he loves em I reckon but you ain t fit this minute to do a thing but rest Fleda I ll rest afterwards Just get the things ready for me Barby and an apron and the table I ll be down in a minute And Barby grind some coffee will you But as she turned to run up stairs her uncle stood in her way and the supper vanished from Fleda s head His arms were open and she was silently clasped in them with so much feeling on both sides that thought and well nigh strength for anything else on her part was gone His smothered words of deep blessing overcame her Fleda could do nothing but sob in distress till she recollected Barby Putting her arms round his neck then she whispered to him that mister Carleton was in the other room and shortly explained how he came to be there and begged her uncle would go in and see him till supper should be ready Enforcing this request with a parting kiss on his cheek she ran off up stairs mister Rossitur looked extremely moody and cloudy for a few minutes and then went in and joined his guest missus Rossitur and her daughter could not be induced to shew themselves Little Rolf however had no scruples of any kind He presently edged himself into the room to see the stranger whom he no sooner saw than with a joyous exclamation he bounded forward to claim an old friend Why mister Carleton exclaimed mister Rossitur in surprise I was not aware that this young gentleman had the honour of your acquaintance But I have said Rolf In London sir I had that pleasure said mister Carleton I think it was I had the pleasure said Rolf pounding one hand upon mister Carleton s knee Where is your mother She wouldn t come down said Rolf but I guess she will when she knows who is here And he was darting away to tell her when mister Carleton within whose arms he stood quietly restrained him and told him he was going away presently but would come again and see his mother another time Are you going back to England sir By and by But you will come here again first Yes if mister Rossitur will let me mister Carleton knows he commands his own welcome said that gentleman somewhat stately Go and tell your aunt Fleda that tea is ready Rolf She knows said Rolf She was making an omelette I guess it was for this gentleman Whose name he was not clear of yet mister Rossitur looked vexed but Hugh laughed and asked if his aunt gave him leave to tell that Rolf entered forthwith into discussion on this subject while mister Carleton who had not seemed to hear it engaged mister Rossitur busily in another till the omelette and Fleda came in Rolf s mind however was ill at ease Aunt Fleda said he as soon as she had fairly taken her place at the head of the table would you mind my telling that you made the omelette for this gentleman Fleda cast a confused glance first at the person in question and then round the table but mister Carleton without looking at her answered instantly Don t you understand Rolf that the same kindness which will do a favour for a friend will keep him in ignorance of it Rolf pondered a moment and then burst forth Why sir wouldn t you like it as well for knowing she made it It was hardly in human gravity to stand this Fleda herself laughed but mister Carleton as unmoved as possible answered him Certainly not and Rolf was nonplussed The supper was over Hugh had left the room and mister Rossitur had before that gone out to give directions about mister Carleton s horses He and Fleda were left alone I have something against you fairy said he lightly taking her hand and putting it to his lips You shall not again do me such honour as you have done me to day I did not deserve it Elfie The last words were spoken half reproachfully Fleda stood a moment motionless and then by some curious revulsion of feeling put both her hands to her face and burst into tears She struggled against them and spoke almost immediately You will think me very foolish mister Carleton I am ashamed of myself but I have lived here so long in this way my spirits have grown so quieted by different things that it seems sometimes as if I could not bear anything I am afraid Of what my dear Elfie But she did not answer and her tears came again You are weary and spent he said gently repossessing himself of one of her hands I will ask you another time what you are afraid of and rebuke all your fears I deserve nothing but rebuke now said Fleda But her hand knew by the gentle and quiet clasp in which it lay that there was no disposition to give it Do not speak to me for a minute she said hastily as she heard some one coming She went to the window and stood there looking out till mister Carleton came to bid her good bye Will you permit me to say to missus Evelyn he said in a low tone that you left a piece of your property in her house and have commissioned me to bring it you Yes said Fleda hesitating and looking a little confused but will you let me write a note instead mister Carleton Certainly but what are you thinking of Elfie what grave doubt is lying under your brow All Fleda s shadows rolled away before that clear bright eye I have found by experience she said smiling a little but looking down that whenever I tell my secret thoughts to anybody I have some reason afterwards to be sorry for it You shall make me an exception to your rule however Elfie Fleda looked up one of her looks half questioning half fearing and then answered a little hesitating I was afraid sir that if you went to missus Evelyn s on that errand I was afraid you would shew them you were displeased And what then said he quietly Only that I wanted to spare them what always gives me a cold chill Gives you said mister Carleton No sir only by sympathy I thought my agency would be the gentlest I see I was right she said looking up as he did not answer they don t deserve it not half so much as you think They talk they don t know what I am sure they never meant half they said never meant to annoy me with it I mean and I am sure they have a true love for me they have shewn it in a great many ways Constance especially never shewed me anything else They have been very kind to me and as to letting me come away as they did I suppose they thought I was in a greater hurry to get home than I really was and they would very likely not have minded travelling so themselves I am so different from them that they might in many things judge me by themselves and yet judge far wrong Fleda was going on but she suddenly became aware that the eye to which she was speaking had ceased to look at the Evelyns even in imagination and she stopped short Will you trust me after this to see missus Evelyn without the note said he smiling But Fleda gave him her hand very demurely without raising her eyes again and he went Barby who had come in to clear away the table took her stand at the window to watch mister Carleton drive off Fleda had retreated to the fire Barby looked in silence till the sleigh was out of sight Is he going back to England now she said coming back to the table No Barby gathered a pile of plates together and then enquired Is he going to settle in America Why no Barby What makes you ask such a thing I thought he looked as if he had dressed himself for a cold climate said Barby dryly Fleda sat down by Hugh s easy chair and laid her head on his breast I like your mister Carleton very much Hugh whispered after awhile Do you said Fleda a little wondering at Hugh s choice of that particular pronominal adjective Very much indeed But he has changed Fleda Yes in some things some great things He says he is coming again said Hugh Fleda s heart beat She was silent I am very glad repeated Hugh I like him very much But you won t leave me Fleda will you Leave you said Fleda looking at him Yes said Hugh smiling and drawing her head down again I always thought what he came over here for But you will stay with me while I want you Fleda While you want me said Fleda again Yes It won t be long What won t be long I said Hugh quietly Not long I am very glad I shall not leave you alone dear Fleda very glad promise me you will not leave me any more Don t talk so dear Hugh But it is true Fleda said Hugh gently I know it I sha n t be here but a little while I am so glad you are come home dear Fleda You will not let anybody take you away till I am gone first Fleda drew her arm close around Hugh s neck and was still still even to his ear for a good while A hard battle must be fought and she must not be weak for his sake and for everybody s sake Others of the family had come or were coming into the room Hugh waited till a short breath but freer drawn told him he might speak Fleda he whispered What I am very happy I only want your promise about that I can t talk to you Hugh No but promise me What That you will not let anybody take you away while I want you I am sure he would not ask it said Fleda hiding her cheeks and eyes at once in his breast Chapter XLIX Do you think I shall not love a sad Pamela as well as a joyful Sidney mister Carleton came back without his mother she had chosen to put off her voyage till spring He took up his quarters at Montepoole which far though it was was yet the nearest point where his notions of ease could have freedom enough One would have thought that saw him those most nearly concerned almost did think that in his daily coming to Queechy mister Carleton sought everybody s pleasure rather than his own He was Fleda s most gentle and kind assistant in taking care of Hugh soon dearly valued by the sick one who watched for and welcomed his coming as a bright spot in the day and loved particularly to have mister Carleton s hand do anything for him Rather than almost any other His mother s was too feeling Fleda s Hugh often feared was weary and his father s though gentle to him as to an infant yet lacked the mind s training And though Marion was his sister in blood Guy was his brother in better bonds The deep blue eye that little Fleda had admired Hugh learned to love and rest on singularly To the rest of the family mister Carleton s influence was more soothing and cheering than any cause beside To all but the head of it Even missus Rossitur after she had once made up her mind to see him could not bear to be absent when he was in the house The dreaded contrast with old times gave no pain either to her or Marion mister Carleton forgot so completely that there was any difference that they were charmed into forgetting it too But mister Rossitur s pride lay deeper or had been less humbled by sorrow the recollections that his family let slip never failed to gall him when mister Carleton was present and if now and then for a moment these were banished by his guest s graces of mind and manner the next breath was a sigh for the circles and the pleasures they served to recall now seeming for ever lost to him mister Carleton perceived that his company gave pain and not pleasure to his host and for that reason was the less in the house and made his visits to Hugh at times when mister Rossitur was not in the way Fleda he took out of the house and away with him for her good and his own To Fleda the old childish feeling came back that she was in somebody s hands who had a marvellous happy way of managing things about her and even of managing herself A kind of genial atmosphere that was always doing her good yet so quietly and so skilfully that she could only now and then get a chance even to look her thanks Quietly and efficiently he was exerting himself to raise the tone of her mind to brighten her spirits to reach those sober lines that years of patience had drawn round her eye and mouth and charm them away So gently so indirectly by efforts so wisely and gracefully aimed he set about it that Fleda did not know what he was doing but he knew He knew when he saw her brow unbend and her eye catch its old light sparkle that his conversation and the thoughts and interests with which he was rousing her mind or fancy were working and would work all he pleased And though the next day he might find the old look of patient gravity again he hardly wished it not there for the pleasure of doing it away Hugh s anxious question to Fleda had been very uncalled for and Fleda s assurance was well grounded that subject was never touched upon Fleda s manner with mister Carleton was peculiar and characteristic In the house before others she was as demure and reserved as though he had been a stranger she never placed herself near him nor entered into conversation with him unless when he obliged her but when they were alone there was a frank confidence and simplicity in her manner that most happily answered the high bred delicacy that had called it out One afternoon of a pleasant day in March Fleda and Hugh were sitting alone together in the sick room Hugh was weaker than usual but not confined to his bed he was in his great easy chair which had been moved up stairs for him again Fleda had been repeating hymns You are tired Hugh said No There s something about you that isn t strong said Hugh fondly I wonder where is mister Carleton to day It is very pleasant isn t it Very pleasant and warm it is like April the snow all went off yesterday and the ground is dry except in spots I wish he would come and give you a good walk I have noticed how you always come back looking so much brighter after one of your walks or rides with him What makes you think so dear Hugh said Fleda a little troubled Only my eyes said Hugh smiling It does me as much good as you Fleda I never want to go and leave you Hugh I am very glad there is somebody to take you I wish he would come You want it this minute I don t think I shall let him take me if he comes Whither and whom said another voice I didn t know you were there sir said Fleda suddenly rising I am but just here Rolf admitted me as he passed out Coming in between them and still holding the hand of one mister Carleton bent down towards the other How is Hugh to day It was pleasant to see that meeting of eyes the grave kindliness on the one side the confident affection on the other But the wasted features said as plainly as the tone of Hugh s gentle reply that he was passing away fast What shall I do for you Take Fleda out and give her a good walk She wants it I will presently You are weary what shall I do to rest you Nothing said Hugh closing his eyes with a very placid look unless you will put me in mind of something about heaven mister Carleton Shall I read to you Baxter or something else No just give me something to think of while you re gone as you have done before mister Carleton I will give you two or three of the Bible bits on that subject they are but hints and indications you know rather rays of light that stream out from the place than any description of it but you have only to follow one of these indications and see whither it will lead you The first I recollect is that one spoken to Abraham Fear not I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward Don t go any further mister Carleton said Hugh with a smile Fleda do you remember They sat all silent quite silent all three for nobody knew how long You were going to walk said Hugh without looking at them Fleda however did not move till a word or two from mister Carleton had backed Hugh s request then she went Is she gone said Hugh mister Carleton will you hand me that little desk It was his own mister Carleton brought it Hugh opened it and took out a folded paper which he gave to mister Carleton saying that he thought he ought to have it Do you know the handwriting sir No Ah she has scratched it so It is Fleda s Hugh shut his eyes again and mister Carleton seeing that he had settled himself to sleep went to the window with the paper It hardly told him anything he did not know before though set in a fresh light Cold blew the east wind And thick fell the rain I looked for the tops Of the mountains in vain Twilight was gathering And dark grew the west And the woodfire s crackling Toned well with the rest Speak fire and tell me Thy flickering flame Fell on me in years past Say am I the same Has my face the same brightness In those days it wore My foot the same lightness As it crosses the floor Methinks there are changes Am weary to night I once was as tireless As the bird on her flight My bark in full measure Threw foam from the prow Not even for pleasure Would I care to move now Tis not the foot only That lieth thus still I am weary in spirit I am listless in will My eye vainly peereth Through the darkness to find Some object that cheereth Some light for the mind What shadows come o er me What things of the past Bright things of my childhood That fled all too fast The scenes where light roaming My foot wandered free Come back through the gloamin Come all back to me The cool autumn evening The fair summer morn The dress and the aspect Some dear ones have worn The sunshiny places The shady hill side The words and the faces That might not abide Die out little fire Ay blacken and pine So have paled many lights That were brighter than thine I can quicken thy embers Again with a breath But the others lie cold In the ashes of death mister Carleton had read near through the paper before Fleda came in I have kept you a long time mister Carleton she said coming up to the window I found aunt Lucy wanted me But she saw with a little surprise the deepening eye which met her and which shewed she knew the working of strong feeling Her own eye went to the paper in search of explanation What have you there Oh mister Carleton she said putting her hand over it Please to give it to me Fleda s face was very much in earnest He took the hand but did not give her the paper and looked his refusal I am ashamed you should see that who gave it to you You shall wreak your displeasure on no one but me he said smiling But have you read it Yes I am very sorry I am very glad my dear Elfie You will think you will think what wasn t true it was just a mood I used to get into once in a while I used to be angry with myself for it but I could not help it one of those listless fits would take me now and then I understand it Elfie I am very sorry you should know I ever felt or wrote so Why It was very foolish and wrong Is that a reason for my not knowing it No not a good one But you have read it now won t you let me have it No I shall ask for all the rest of the portfolio Elfie he said as he put it in a place of security Pray do not said Fleda most unaffectedly Why Because I remember missus Carleton says you always have what you ask for Give me permission to put on your bonnet then said he laughingly taking it from her hand The air was very sweet the footing pleasant The first few steps of the walk were made by Fleda in silence with eager breath and a foot that grew lighter as it trod I don t think it was a right mood of mind I had when I wrote that she said It was morbid But I couldn t help it Yet if one could keep possession of those words you quoted just now I suppose one never would have morbid feelings mister Carleton Perhaps not but human nature has a weak hold of anything and many things may make it weaker Mine is weak said Fleda But it is possible to keep firm hold of those words mister Carleton Yes by strength that is not human nature s And after all the firm hold is rather that in which we are held or ours would soon fail The very hand that makes the promise its own must be nerved to grasp it And so it is best for it keeps us looking off always to the Author and Finisher of our faith I love those words said Fleda But mister Carleton how shall one be sure that one has a right to those other words those I mean that you told to Hugh One cannot take the comfort of them unless one is sure Her voice trembled My dear Elfie the promises have many of them their double stamped with the very same signet and if that sealed counterpart is your own it is the sure earnest and title to the whole value of the promise Well in this case said Fleda eagerly In this case God says I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward Now see if your own heart can give the countersign Thou art my portion O Lord Fleda s head sank instantly and almost lay upon his arm If you have the one my dear Elfie the other is yours it is the note of hand of the maker of the promise sure to be honoured And if you want proof here it is and a threefold cord is not soon broken Because he hath set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he hath known my name He shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honour him With long life will I satisfy him and shew him my salvation There was a pause of some length Fleda had lifted up her head but walked along very quietly not seeming to care to speak Have you the countersign Elfie Fleda flashed a look at him and only restrained herself from weeping again Yes But so I had then mister Carleton only sometimes I got those fits of feeling I forgot it I suppose When were these verses written Last fall uncle Rolf was away and aunt Lucy unhappy and I believe I was tired I suppose it was that For a matter of several rods each was busy with his own musings But mister Carleton bethought himself Where are you Elfie Where am I Yes Not at Queechy No indeed said Fleda laughing Far enough away Where At Paris at the Marche des Innocens How did you get to Paris I don t know by a bridge of associations I suppose resting one end on last year and the other on the time when I was eleven years old Very intelligible said mister Carleton smiling Do you remember that morning mister Carleton when you took Hugh and me to the Marche des Innocens Perfectly I have thanked you a great many times since for getting up so early that morning I think I was well paid at the time I remember I thought I had seen one of the prettiest sights I had even seen in Paris So I thought said Fleda It has been a pleasant picture in my imagination ever since There was a curious curl in the corners of mister Carleton s mouth which made Fleda look an inquiry a look so innocently wistful that his gravity gave way My dear Elfie said he you are the very child you were then Am I said Fleda I dare say I am for I feel so I have the very same feeling I used to have then that I am a child and you taking the care of me into your own hands One half of that is true and the other half nearly so How good you always were to me Fleda said with a sigh Not necessary to balance the debtor and creditor items on both sides he said with a smile as the account bids fair to run a good while A silence again during which Fleda is clearly not enjoying the landscape nor the fine weather Elfie what are you meditating She came back from her meditations with a very frank look I was thinking mister Carleton of your notions about female education Well They had paused upon a rising ground Fleda hesitated and then looked up in his face I am afraid you will find me wanting and when you do will you put me in the way of being all you wish me to be Her look was ingenuous and tender equally He gave her no answer except by the eye of grave intentness that fixed hers till she could meet it no longer and her own fell mister Carleton recollected himself My dear Elfie said he and whatever the look had meant Elfie was at no loss for the tone now what do you consider yourself deficient in Fleda spoke with a little difficulty I am afraid in a good many things in general reading and in what are called accomplishments You shall read as much as you please by and by said he provided you will let me read with you and as for the other want Elfie it is rather a source of gratification to me Elfie very naturally asked why Because as soon as I have the power I shall immediately constitute myself your master in the arts of riding and drawing and in any other art or acquisition you may take a fancy to and give you lessons diligently And will there be gratification in that said Fleda His answer was by a smile But he somewhat mischievously asked her Will there not and Fleda was quiet Chapter L Friends I sorrow not to leave ye If this life an exile be We who leave it do but journey Homeward to our family Spanish Ballad The first of April came mister Rossitur had made up his mind not to abide at Queechy which only held him now by the frail thread of Hugh s life mister Carleton knew this and had even taken some steps towards securing for him a situation in the West Indies But it was unknown to Fleda she had not heard her uncle say anything on the subject since she came home and though aware that their stay was a doubtful matter she still thought it might be as well to have the garden in order Philetus could not be trusted to do everything wisely of his own head and even some delicate jobs of hand could not be safely left to his skill if the garden was to make any headway Fleda s head and hand must both be there she knew So as the spring opened she used to steal away from the house every morning for an hour or two hardly letting her friends know what she was about to make sure that peas and potatoes and radishes and lettuce were in the right places at the right times and to see that the later and more delicate vegetables were preparing for She took care to have this business well over before the time that mister Carleton ever arrived from the Pool One morning she was busy in dressing the strawberry beds forking up the ground between the plants and filling the vacancies that the severe winter or some irregularities of fall dressing had made mister Skillcorn was rendering a somewhat inefficient help or perhaps amusing himself with seeing how she worked The little old silver grey hood was bending down over the strawberries and the fork was going at a very energetic rate Philetus Marm Will you bring me that bunch of strawberry plants that lies at the corner of the beds in the walk and my trowel I will said mister Skillcorn It was another hand however that brought them and laid them beside her but Fleda very intent upon her work and hidden under her close hood did not find it out She went on busily putting in the plants as she found room for them and just conscious as she thought that Philetus was still standing at her side she called upon him from time to time or merely stretched out her hand for a fresh plant as she had occasion for it Philetus she said at length raising her voice a little that it might win to him round the edge of her hood without turning her face I wish you would get the ground ready for that other planting of potatoes you needn t stay to help me any longer Tain t me I guess said the voice of Philetus on the other side of her Fleda looked in astonishment to make sure that it really was mister Skillcorn proceeding along the garden path in that quarter and turning jumped up and dropped her trowel and fork to have her hands otherwise occupied mister Skillcorn walked off leisurely towards the potato ground singing to himself in a kind of consolatory aside I cocked up my beaver and who but I The lace in my hat was so gallant and so gay That I flourished like a king in his own coun tray There is one of your countrymen that is an odd variety certainly said mister Carleton looking after him with a very comic expression of eye Is he not said Fleda And hardly a common one There never was a line more mathematically straight than the course of Philetus s ideas they never diverge I think to the right hand or the left a jot from his own self interest You will be an invaluable help to me Elfie if you can read my English friends as closely I am afraid you will not let me come as close to them said Fleda laughing Perhaps not I shouldn t like to pay too high a premium for the knowledge How is Hugh to day Fleda answered with a quick change of look and voice that he was much as usual My mother has written me that she will be here by the Europa which is due to morrow I must set off for New York this afternoon therefore I came so early to Queechy Fleda was instinctively pulling off her gardening gloves as they walked towards the house Aunt Miriam wants to see you mister Carleton she begged I would ask you to come there some time With great pleasure shall we go there now Elfie I will be ready in five minutes missus Rossitur was alone in the breakfast room when they went in Hugh she reported was asleep and would be just ready to see mister Carleton by the time they got back They stood a few minutes talking and then Fleda went to get ready Both pair of eyes followed her as she left the room and then met with perfect understanding Will you give your child to me missus Rossitur said the gentleman With all my heart exclaimed missus Rossitur bursting into tears even if I were left alone entirely Her agitation was uncontrolled for a minute and then she said with feeling seemingly too strong to be kept in If I were only sure of meeting her in heaven I could be content to be without her till then What is in the way my dear madam said mister Carleton with a gentle sympathy that touched the very spring he meant it should missus Rossitur waited a minute but it was only till tears would let her speak and then said like a child Oh it is all darkness Except this said he gently and clearly that Jesus Christ is a sun and a shield and those that put themselves at his feet are safe from all fear and they who go to him for light shall complain of darkness no more But I do not know how Ask him and he will tell you But I am unworthy even to look up towards him said missus Rossitur struggling it seemed between doubts and wishes He knows that and yet he has bid you come to him He knows that and knowing it he has taken your responsibility and paid your debt and offers you now a clean discharge if you will take it at his hand and for the other part of this unworthiness that blood cannot do away blood has brought the remedy Shall we who are evil give good things to our children and shall not our Father which is in heaven give his Holy Spirit to them that ask him But must I do nothing said missus Rossitur when she had remained quiet with her face in her hands for a minute or two after he had done speaking Nothing but be willing be willing to have Christ in all his offices as your Teacher your King and your Redeemer give yourself to him dear missus Rossitur and he will take care of the rest I am willing she exclaimed Fresh tears came and came freely mister Carleton said no more till hearing some noise of opening and shutting doors above stairs missus Rossitur hurriedly left the room and Fleda came in by the other entrance May I take you a little out of the way mister Carleton she said when they had passed through the Deepwater settlement I have a message to carry to missus Elster a poor woman out here beyond the lake It is not a disagreeable place And what if it were I should not perhaps have asked you to go with me said Fleda a little doubtfully You may take me where you will Elfie he said gently I hope to do as much by you some day Fleda looked up at the piece of elegance beside her and thought what a change must have come over him if he would visit poor places He was silent and grave however and so was she till they arrived at the house they were going to Certainly it was not a disagreeable place Barby s much less strong minded sister had at least a good share of her practical nicety The little board path to the door was clean and white still with possibly a trifle less brilliant effect The room and its old inhabitants were very comfortable and tidy the patchwork counterpane as gay as ever missus Elster was alone keeping company with a snug little wood fire which was near as much needed in that early spring weather as it had been during the winter mister Carleton had come back from his abstraction and stood taking half unconscious note of these things while Fleda was delivering her message to the old woman missus Elster listened to her implicitly with every now and then an acquiescing nod or ejaculation but so soon as Fleda had said her say she burst out with a voice that had never known the mufflings of delicacy and was now pitched entirely beyond its owner s ken Looking hard at mister Carleton Fleda Is this the gentleman that s to be your husband The last word elevated and brought out with emphatic distinctness of utterance If the demand had been whether the gentleman in question was a follower of Mahomet it would hardly have been more impossible for Fleda to give an affirmative answer but mister Carleton laughed and bringing his face a little nearer the old crone answered So she has promised ma am Illustration Is this the gentleman that s to be your husband It was curious to see the lines of the old woman s face relax as she looked at him He s worthy of you as far as looks goes she said in the same key as before apostrophizing Fleda who had drawn back but not stirring her eyes from mister Carleton all the time And then she added to him with a little satisfied nod and in a very decided tone of information She will make you a good wife Because she has made a good friend said mister Carleton quietly Will you let me be a friend too He had turned the old lady s thoughts into a golden channel whence as she was an American they had no immediate issue in words and Fleda and mister Carleton left the house without anything more Fleda felt nervous But mister Carleton s first words were as coolly and as gravely spoken as if they had just come out from a philosophical lecture and with an immediate spring of relief she enjoyed every step of the way and every word of the conversation which was kept up with great life till they reached missus Plumfield s door No one was in the sitting room Fleda left mister Carleton there and passed gently into the inner apartment the door of which was standing ajar But her heart absolutely leaped into her mouth for doctor Quackenboss and mister Olmney were there on either side of her aunt s bed Fleda came forward and shook hands This is quite a meeting of friends said the doctor blandly yet with a perceptible shading of the whilome broad sunshine of his face Your a aunt my dear Miss Ringgan is in a most extraordinary state of mind Fleda was glad to hide her face against her aunt s and asked her how she did doctor Quackenboss thinks it extraordinary Fleda said the old lady with her usual cheerful sedateness that one who has trusted God and had constant experience of his goodness and faithfulness for forty years should not doubt him at the end of it You have no doubt of any kind missus Plumfield said the clergyman Not the shadow of a doubt was the hearty steady reply You mistake my dear madam said doctor Quackenboss pardon me it is not that I would be understood to say merely that I do not comprehend how such a such security can be attained respecting what seems so a elevated and difficult to know Only by believing said missus Plumfield with a very calm smile He that believeth on him shall not be ashamed shall not be ashamed she repeated slowly doctor Quackenboss looked at Fleda who kept her eyes fixed upon her aunt But it seems to me I beg pardon perhaps I am arrogant he said with a little bow but it appears to me almost in a manner almost presumptuous not to be a little doubtful in such a matter until the time comes Am I do you disapprove of me mister Olmney mister Olmney silently referred him for his answer to the person he had first addressed who had closed her eyes while he was speaking Sir she said opening them it can t be presumption to obey God and he tells me to rejoice And I do I do Let all those that love thee rejoice in thee and be glad in thee But mind she added energetically fixing her strong grey eye upon him he does not tell you to rejoice do not think it not while you stand aloof from his terms of peace Take God at his word and be happy but if not you have nothing to do with the song that I sing The doctor stared at her till she had done speaking and then slunk out of her range of vision behind the curtains of the bed post Not silenced however But a mister Olmney said he hesitating don t you think that there is in general a a becoming modesty in a in people that have done wrong as we all have putting off being sure until they are so It seems so to me Come here doctor Quackenboss said aunt Miriam She waited till he came to her side and then taking his hand and looking at him very kindly she said Sir forty years ago I found in the Bible as you say that I was a sinner and that drove me to look for something else I found then God s promise that if I would give my dependence entirely to the substitute he had provided for me and yield my heart to his service he would for Christ s sake hold me quit of all my debts and be my father and make me his child And sir I did it I abhor every other dependence the things you count good in me I reckon but filthy rags At the same time I know that ever since that day forty years ago I have lived in his service and tried to live to his glory And now sir shall I disbelieve his promise do you think he would be pleased if I did The doctor s mouth was stopped for once He drew back as soon as he could and said not another word Before anybody had broken the silence Seth came in and after shaking hands with Fleda startled her by asking whether that was not mister Carleton in the other room Yes Fleda said he came to see aunt Miriam Ain t you well enough to see him mother Quite and very happy said she Seth immediately went back and invited him in Fleda dared not look up while the introductions were passing of the reverend mister Olmney and of doctor Quackenboss the former of whom mister Carleton took cordially by the hand while doctor Quackenboss conceiving that his hand must be as acceptable made his salutation with an indescribable air at once of attempted gracefulness and ingratiation Fleda saw the whole in the advancing line of the doctor s person a vision of which crossed her downcast eye She drew back then for mister Carleton came where she was standing to take her aunt s hand Seth had absolutely stayed his way before to make the said introductions missus Plumfield was little changed by years or disease since he had seen her There was somewhat more of a look of bodily weakness than there used to be but the dignified strong minded expression of the face was even heightened eye and brow were more pure and unclouded in their steadfastness She looked very earnestly at her visiter and then with evident pleasure from the manner of his look and greeting Fleda watched her eye softening with a gratified expression and fixed upon him as he was gently talking to her mister Olmney presently came round to take leave promising to see her another time and passing Fleda with a frank grave pressure of the hand which gave her some pain He and Seth left the room Fleda was hardly conscious that doctor Quackenboss was still standing at the foot of the bed making the utmost use of his powers of observation He could use little else for mister Carleton and missus Plumfield after a few words on each side had as it were by common consent come to a pause The doctor when a sufficient time had made him fully sensible of this walked up to Fleda who wished heartily at the moment that she could have presented the reverse end of the magnet to him Perhaps however it was that very thing which by a perverse sort of attraction drew him towards her I suppose a we may conclude said he with a somewhat saturnine expression of mischief that Miss Ringgan contemplates forsaking the agricultural line before a great while I have not given up my old habits sir said Fleda a good deal vexed No I suppose not but Queechy air is not so well suited for them other skies will prove more genial he said she could not help thinking pleased at her displeasure What is the fault of Queechy air sir said mister Carleton approaching them Sir said the doctor exceedingly taken aback though the words had been spoken in the quietest manner possible it a it has no fault sir that I am particularly aware of it is perfectly salubrious missus Plumfield I will bid you good day I a I hope you will get well again I hope not sir said aunt Miriam in the same clear hearty tones which had answered him before The doctor took his departure and made capital of his interview with mister Carleton who he affirmed he could tell by what he had seen of him was a very deciduous character and not always conciliating in his manners Fleda waited with a little anxiety for what was to follow the doctor s leave taking It was with a very softened eye that aunt Miriam looked at the two who were left clasping Fleda s hand again and it was with a very softened voice that she next spoke Do you remember our last meeting sir I remember it well he said Fleda tells me you are a changed man since that time He answered only by a slight and grave bow mister Carleton said the old lady I am a dying woman and this child is the dearest thing in the world to me after my own and hardly after him Will you pardon me will you bear with me if that I may die in peace I say sir what else it would not become me to say and it is for her sake Speak to me freely as you would to her he said with a look that gave her full permission Fleda had drawn close and hid her face in her aunt s neck Aunt Miriam s hand moved fondly over her cheek and brow for a minute or two in silence her eye resting there too mister Carleton this child is to belong to you how will you guide her By the gentlest paths he said with a smile A whispered remonstrance from Fleda to her aunt had no effect Will her best interests be safe in your hands How shall I resolve you of that missus Plumfield he said gravely Will you help her to mind her mother s prayer and keep herself unspotted from the world As I trust she will help me A rogue may answer questions but an eye that has never known the shadow of double dealing makes no doubtful discoveries of itself missus Plumfield read it and gave it her very thorough respect mister Carleton pardon me sir I do not doubt you but I remember hearing long ago that you were rich and great in the world it is dangerous for a Christian to be so Can she keep in your grandeur the simplicity of heart and life she has had at Queechy May I remind you of your own words my dear madam By the blessing of God all things are possible These things you speak of are not in themselves evil if the mind be set on somewhat else they are little beside a larger storehouse of material to work with an increased stewardship to account for She has been taking care of others all her life said aunt Miriam tenderly it is time she was taken care of and these feet are very unfit for rough paths but I would rather she should go on struggling as she has done with difficulties and live and die in poverty than that the lustre of her heavenly inheritance should be tarnished even a little I would my darling But the alternative is not so said mister Carleton with gentle grace touching Fleda s hand who he saw was a good deal disturbed Do not make her afraid of me missus Plumfield I do not believe I need said aunt Miriam and I am sure I could not but sir you will forgive me No madam that is not possible One cannot stand where I do said the old lady without learning a little the comparative value of things and I seek my child s good that is my excuse I could not be satisfied to take her testimony Take mine madam said mister Carleton I have learned the comparative value of things too and I will guard her highest interests as carefully as I will every other as earnestly as you can desire I thank you sir said the old lady gratefully I am sure of it I shall leave her in good hands I wanted this assurance And if ever there was a tender plant that was not fitted to grow on the rough side of the world I think this is one said she kissing earnestly the face that yet Fleda did not dare to lift up mister Carleton did not say what he thought He presently took kind leave of the old lady and went into the next room where Fleda soon rejoined him and they set off homewards Fleda was quietly crying all the way down the hill At the foot of the hill mister Carleton resolutely slackened his pace I have one consolation he said my dear Elfie you will have the less to leave for me She put her hand with a quick motion upon his and roused her self She is a beautiful rebuke to unbelief But she is hardly to be mourned for Elfie Oh I was not crying for aunt Miriam said Fleda For what then he said gently Myself That needs explanation he said in the same tone Let me have it Elfie O I was thinking of several things said Fleda not exactly wishing to give the explanation Too vague said mister Carleton smiling Trust me with a little more of your mind Elfie Fleda glanced up at him half smiling and yet with filling eyes and then as usual yielded to the winning power of the look that met her I was thinking she said keeping her head carefully down of some of the things you and aunt Miriam were saying just now and how good for nothing I am In what respect said mister Carleton with praiseworthy gravity Fleda hesitated and he pressed the matter no further but more unwilling to displease him than herself she presently went on with some difficulty wording what she had to say with as much care as she could I was thinking how gratitude or not gratitude alone but how one can be full of the desire to please another a fellow creature and find it constantly easy to do or bear anything for that purpose and how slowly and coldly duty has to move alone in the direction where it should be the swiftest and warmest She knew he would take her words as simply as she said them she was not disappointed He was silent a minute and then said gravely Is this a late discovery Elfie No only I was realizing it strongly just now It is a complaint we may all make The remedy is not to love less what we know but to know better that of which we are in ignorance We will be helps and not hindrances to each other Elfie You have said that before said Fleda still keeping her head down What About my being a help to you It will not be the first time said he smiling nor the second Your little hand first held up a glass to gather the scattered rays of truth that could not warm me into a centre where they must burn Very innocently said Fleda with a little unsteady feeling of voice Very innocently said mister Carleton smiling A veritable lens could hardly have been more unconscious of its work or more pure of design I do not think that was quite so either mister Carleton said Fleda It was so my dear Elfie and your present speech is nothing against it This power of example is always unconsciously wielded the medium ceases to be clear so soon as it is made anything but a medium The bits of truth you aimed at me wittingly would have been nothing if they had not come through that medium Then apparently one s prime efforts ought to be directed to oneself One s first efforts certainly Your silent example was the first thing that moved me Silent example said Fleda catching her breath a little Mine ought to be very good for I can never do good in any other way You used to talk pretty freely to me It wasn t my fault I am certain said Fleda half laughing Besides I was sure of my ground But in general I never can speak to people about what will do them any good Yet whatever be the power of silent example there are often times when a word is of incalculable importance I know it said Fleda earnestly I have felt it very often and grieved that I could not say it even at the very moment when I knew it was wanting Is that right Elfie No said Fleda with quick watering eyes It is not right at all but it is constitutional with me I never can talk to other people of what concerns my own thoughts and feelings But this concerns other people s thoughts and feelings Yes but there is an implied revelation of my own Do you expect to include me in the denomination of other people I don t know said Fleda laughing Do you wish it Fleda looked down and up and coloured and said she didn t know I will teach you said he smiling The rest of the day by both was given to Hugh Chapter LI O what is life but a sum of love And death but to lose it all Weeds be for those that are left behind And not for those that fall Milnes Here s something come Fleda said Barby walking into the sick room one morning a few days afterwards a great bag of something more than you can eat up in a fortnight it s for Hugh It s extraordinary that anybody should send me a great bag of anything eatable said Hugh Where did it come from said Fleda Philetus fetched it he found it down to mister Sampion s when he went with the sheep skins How do you know it s for me said Hugh Cause it s written on as plain as a pikestaff I guess it s a mistake though Why said Fleda and what is it O I don t much think twas meant for him said Barby It s oysters Oysters Yes come out and look at em you never see such fine fellows I ve heerd say said Barby abstractedly as Fleda followed her out and she displayed to view some magnificent Ostraceans I ve heerd say that an English shilling was worth two American ones but I never understood it rightly till now To all intents and purposes those were English oysters and worth twice as much as any others Fleda secretly confessed That evening up in the sick room it was quite evening and all the others of the family were taking rest or keeping mister Rossitur company down stairs Fleda was carefully roasting some of the same oysters for Hugh s supper She had spread out a glowing bed of coals on the hearth and there lay four or five of the big bivalves snapping and sputtering in approbation of their quarters in a most comfortable manner and Fleda standing before the fire tended them with a double kind of pleasure From one friend and for another those were most odorous oysters Hugh sat watching them and her the same in happy simplicity that he had been at eleven years old How pleasant those oysters smell said he Fleda they remind me so of the time when you and I used to roast oysters in missus Renney s room for lunch do you recollect and sometimes in the evening when everybody was gone out you know and what an airing we used to have to give the dining room afterwards How we used to enjoy them Fleda you and I all alone Yes said Fleda in a tone of doubtful enjoyment She was shielding her face with a paper and making self sacrificing efforts to persuade a large oyster shell to stand so on the coals as to keep the juice Don t said Hugh I would rather the oysters should burn than you mister Carleton wouldn t thank me for letting you do so Never mind said Fleda arranging the oysters to her satisfaction he isn t here to see Now Hugh my dear these are ready as soon as I am I am ready said Hugh How long it is since we had a roast oyster Fleda They look good don t they A little stand was brought up between them with the bread and butter and the cups and Fleda opened oysters and prepared tea for Hugh with her nicest gentlest busiest of hands making every bit to be twice as sweet for her sympathizing eyes and loving smile and pleasant word commenting She shared the meal with him but her own part was as slender as his and much less thought of His enjoyment was what she enjoyed though it was with a sad twinge of alloy which changed her face whenever it was where he could not see it when turned upon him it was only bright and affectionate and sometimes a little too tender but Fleda was too good a nurse to let that often appear mister Carleton did not bargain for your opening his oysters Fleda How kind it was of him to send them Yes How long will he be gone Fleda I don t know he didn t say I don t believe many days Hugh was silent a little while she was putting away the stand and the oyster shells Then she came and sat down by him You have burnt yourself over those things said he sorrowfully you shouldn t have done it It is not right Dear Hugh said Fleda lightly laying her head on his shoulder I like to burn myself for you That s just the way you have been doing all your life Hush she said softly It is true for me and for everybody else It is time you were taken better care of dear Fleda Don t dear Hugh I am right though said he You are pale and worn now with waiting upon me and thinking of me It is time you were gone But I think it is well I am going too for what should I do in the world without you Fleda Fleda was crying now intensely though quietly but Hugh went on with feeling as calm as it was deep What should I have done all these years or any of us How you have tired yourself for everybody in the garden and in the kitchen and with Earl Douglass how we could let you I don t know but I believe we could not help it Fleda put her hand upon his mouth But he took it away and went on How often I have seen you sleeping all the evening on the sofa with a pale face tired out Dear Fleda said he kissing her cheek I am glad there s to be an end put to it And all the day you went about with such a bright face that it made mother and me happy to look at you and I knew then many a time it was for our sakes Why do you cry so Fleda I like to think of it and to talk of it now that I know you won t do so any more I knew the whole truth and it went to the bottom of my heart but I could do nothing but love you I did that Don t cry so Fleda you ought not You have been the sunshine of the house My spirit never was so strong as yours I should have been borne to the ground I know in all these years if it had not been for you and mother you have been her life You have been tired too Fleda whispered Yes at the saw mill And then you would come up there through the sun to look at me and your smile would make me forget everything sorrowful for the rest of the day except that I couldn t help you Oh you did you did you helped me always Hugh Not much I couldn t help you when you were sewing for me and father till your fingers and eyes were aching and you never would own that you were anything but a little tired it made my heart ache Oh I knew it all dear Fleda I am very very glad that you will have somebody to take care of you now that will not let you burn your fingers for him or anybody else It makes me happy You make me very unhappy dear Hugh I don t mean it said Hugh tenderly I don t believe there is anybody else in the world that I could be so satisfied to leave you with Fleda made no answer to that She sat up and tried to recover herself I hope he will come back in time said Hugh settling himself back in the easy chair with a weary look and closing his eyes In time for what To see me again My dear Hugh he will to be sure I hope He must make haste said Hugh But I want to see him again very much Fleda For anything in particular No only because I love him I want to see him once more Hugh slumbered and Fleda by his side wept tears of mixed feeling till she was tired Hugh was right But nobody else knew it and his brother was not sent for It was about a week after this when one night a horse and wagon came up to the back of the house from the road the gentleman who had been driving leading the horse It was late long past mister Skillcorn s usual hour of retiring but some errand of business had kept him abroad and he stood there looking on The stars gave light enough Can you fasten my horse where he may stand a little while sir without taking him out I guess I can replied Philetus with reasonable confidence if there s a rope s end some place And forthwith he went back into the house to seek it The gentleman patiently holding his horse meanwhile till he came out How is mister Hugh to night Well he ain t just so smart they say responded Philetus insinuating the rope s end as awkwardly as possible among the horse s head gear I believe he s dying Instead of going round now to the front of the house mister Carleton knocked gently at the kitchen door and asked the question anew of Barby He s Come in sir if you please she said opening wide the door for him to enter I ll tell em you re here Do not disturb any one for me said he I won t disturb em said Barby in a tone a little though unconsciously significant mister Carleton neglected the chair she had placed for him and remained standing by the mantelpiece thinking of the scenes of his early introduction to that kitchen It wore the same look it had done then under Barby s rule it was precisely the same thing it had been under Cynthia s The passing years seemed a dream and the passing generations of men a vanity before the old house more abiding than they He stood thinking of the people he had seen gathered by that fireplace and the little household fairy whose childish ministrations had given such a beauty to the scene when a very light step crossed the painted floor and she was there again before him She did not speak a word she stood still a moment trying for words and then put her hand upon mister Carleton s arm and gently drew him out of the room with her The family were all gathered in the room to which she brought him mister Rossitur as soon as he saw mister Carleton come in shrunk back where he could be a little shielded by the bed post Marion s face was hid on the foot of the bed missus Rossitur did not move Leaving mister Carleton on the near side of the bed Fleda went round to the place she seemed to have occupied before at Hugh s right hand and they were all still for he was in a little doze lying with his eyes closed and the face as gently and placidly sweet as it had been in his boyhood Perhaps mister Rossitur looked at it but no other did just then except mister Carleton His eye rested nowhere else The breathing of an infant could not be more gentle the face of an angel not more peacefully at rest So he giveth his beloved sleep thought the gentleman as he gazed on the brow from which all care if care there had ever been seemed to have taken flight Not yet not quite yet for Hugh suddenly opened his eyes and without seeing anybody else said Father mister Rossitur left the bed post and came close to where Fleda was standing and leaning forward touched his son s head but did not speak Father said Hugh in a voice so gentle that it seemed as if strength must be failing what will you do when you come to lie here mister Rossitur put his hands to his face Father I must speak now if I never did before once I must speak to you what will you do when you come to lie where I do what will you trust to The person addressed was as motionless as a statue Hugh did not move his eyes from him Father I will be a living warning and example to you for I know that I shall live in your memory you shall remember what I say to you that Jesus Christ is a dear friend to those that trust in him and if he is not yours it will be because you will not let him You shall remember my testimony that he can make death sweeter than life in his presence is fulness of joy at his right hand there are pleasures for evermore He is better he is more to me even than you all and he will be to you a better friend than the poor child you are losing though you do not know it now It is he that has made my life in this world happy only he and I have nothing to look to but him in the world I am going to But what will you do in the hour of death as I am if he isn t your friend father mister Rossitur s frame swayed like a tree that one sees shaken by a distant wind but he said nothing Will you remember me happily father if you come to die without having done as I begged you Will you think of me in heaven and not try to come there too Father will you be a Christian will you not for my sake for little Hugh s sake as you used to call him Father mister Rossitur knelt down and hid his face in the coverings but he did not utter a word Hugh s eye dwelt on him for a moment with unspeakable expression and his lip trembled He said no more he closed his eyes and for a little time there was nothing to be heard but the sobs which could not be restrained from all but the two gentlemen It probably oppressed Hugh for after a while he said with a weary sigh and without opening his eyes I wish somebody would sing Nobody answered at first Sing what dear Hugh said Fleda putting aside her tears and leaning her face towards him Something that speaks of my want said Hugh What do you want dear Hugh Only Jesus Christ he said with a half smile But they were silent as death Fleda s face was in her hands and her utmost efforts after self control wrought nothing but tears The stillness had lasted a little while when very softly and sweetly the notes of a hymn floated to their ears and though they floated on and filled the room the voice was so nicely modulated that its waves of sweetness broke gently upon the nearest ear Jesus the sinner s friend to Thee Lost and undone for aid I flee Weary of earth myself and sin Open thine arms and take me in Pity and save my sin sick soul Tis thou alone canst make me whole Dark till in me thine image shine And lost I am till thou art mine At length I own it cannot be That I should fit myself for thee Here now to thee I all resign Thine is the work and only thine What shall I say thy grace to move Lord I am sin but thou art love I give up every plea beside Lord I am lost but thou hast died They were still again after the voice had ceased almost perfectly still though tears might be pouring as indeed they were from every eye there was no break to the silence other than a half caught sob now and then from a kneeling figure whose head was in Marion s lap Who was that said Hugh when the singer had been silent a minute Nobody answered immediately and then mister Carleton bending over him said Don t you know me dear Hugh Is it mister Carleton Hugh looked pleased and clasped both of his hands upon Guy s which he laid upon his breast For a second he closed his eyes and was silent Was it you sang Yes You never sang for me before he remarked He was silent again Are you going to take Fleda away By and by said mister Carleton gently Will you take good care of her mister Carleton hesitated and then said so low that it could reach but one other person s ear What hand and life can I know it said Hugh I am very glad you will have her You will not let her tire herself any more Whatever became of Fleda s tears she had driven them away and leaning forward she touched her cheek to his saying with a clearness and sweetness of voice that only intensity of feeling could have given her at the moment I am not tired dear Hugh Hugh clasped one arm round her neck and kissed her again and again seeming unable to say anything to her in any other way still keeping his hold of mister Carleton s hand I give all my part of her to you he said at length mister Carleton I shall see both of you in heaven I hope so was the answer in those very calm and clear tones that have a singular effect in quieting emotion while they indicate anything but the want of it I am the best off of you all Hugh said He lay still for awhile with shut eyes Fleda had withdrawn herself from his arms and stood at his side with a bowed head but perfectly quiet He still held mister Carleton s hand as something he did not want to part with Fleda said he who is that crying Mother come here mister Carleton gave place to her Hugh pulled her down to him till her face lay upon his and folded both his arms around her Mother he said softly will you meet me in heaven say yes How can I dear Hugh You can dear mother said he kissing her with exceeding tenderness of expression my Saviour will be yours and take you there Say you will give yourself to Christ dear mother sweet mother promise me I shall see you again missus Rossitur s weeping it was difficult to hear But Hugh hardly shedding a tear still kissed her repeating Promise me dear mother promise me that you will till missus Rossitur in an agony sobbed out the word he wanted and Hugh hid his face then in her neck mister Carleton left the room and went down stairs He found the sitting room desolate untenanted and cold for hours and he went again into the kitchen Barby was there for some time and then she left him alone He had passed a long while in thinking and walking up and down and he was standing musing by the fire when Fleda again came in She came in silently to his side and putting her arm within his laid her face upon it with a simplicity of trust and reliance that went to his heart and she wept there for a long hour They hardly changed their position in all that time and her tears flowed silently though incessantly the only tokens of sympathy on his part being such a gentle caressing smoothing of her hair or putting it from her brow as he had used when she was a child The bearing of her hand and head upon his arm in time shewed her increasingly weary Nothing shewed him so Elfie my dear Elfie he said at last very tenderly in the same way that he would have spoken nine years before Hugh gave his part of you to me I must take care of it Fleda tried to rouse herself immediately This is poor entertainment for you mister Carleton she said raising her head and wiping away the tears from her face You are mistaken he said gently You never gave me such pleasure but twice before Elfie Fleda s head went down again instantly and this time there was something almost caressing in the motion Next to the happiness of having friends on earth he said soothingly is the happiness of having friends in heaven Don t weep any more to night my dear Elfie He told me to thank you said Fleda But stopping short and clasping with convulsive energy the arm she held she shed more violent tears than she had done that night before The most gentle soothing the most tender reproof availed at last to quiet her and she stood clinging to his arm still and looking down into the fire I did not think it would be so soon she said It was not soon to him Elfie He told me to thank you for singing How little while it seems since we were children together how little while since before that when I was a little child here how different No the very same said he touching his lips to her forehead you are the very same child you were then but it is time you were my child for I see you would make yourself ill No said he softly taking the hand Fleda raised to her face no more tonight tell me how early I may see you in the morning for Elfie I must leave you after breakfast Fleda looked up inquiringly My mother has brought news that determines me to return to England immediately To England I have been too long from home I am wanted there Fleda looked down again and did her best not to shew what she felt I do not know how to leave you and now but I must There are disturbances among the people and my own are infected I must be there without delay Political disturbances said Fleda Somewhat of that nature but partly local How early may I come to you But you are not going away tonight It is very late That is nothing my horse is here Fleda would have begged in vain if Barby had not come in and added her word to the effect that it would be a mess of work to look for lodgings at that time of night and that she had made the west room ready for mister Carleton She rejected with great sincerity any claim to the thanks with which Fleda as well as mister Carleton repaid her there wa n t no trouble about it she said mister Carleton however found his room prepared for him with all the care that Barby s utmost ideas of refinement and exactness could suggest It was still very early the next morning when he left it and came into the sitting room but he was not the first there The firelight glimmered on the silver and china of the breakfast table all set everything was in absolute order from the fire to the two cups and saucers which were alone on the board A still silent figure was standing by one of the windows looking out Not crying but that mister Carleton knew from the unmistakable lines of the face was only because tears were waiting another time quiet now it would not be by and by He came and stood at the window with her Do you know he said after a little that mister Rossitur purposes to leave Queechy Does he said Fleda rather starting but she added not another word simply because she felt she could not safely He has accepted I believe a consulship at Jamaica Jamaica said Fleda I have heard him speak of the West Indies I am not surprised I know it was likely he would not stay here How tightly her fingers that were free grasped the edge of the window frame mister Carleton saw it and softly removed them into his own keeping He may go before I can be here again But I shall leave my mother to take care of you Elfie Thank you said Fleda faintly You are very kind Kind to myself he said smiling I am only taking care of my own I need not say that you will see me again as early as my duty can make it possible but I may be detained and your friends may be gone Elfie give me the right to send if I cannot come for you Let me leave my wife in my mother s care Fleda looked down and coloured and hesitated but the expression in her face was not that of doubt Am I asking too much he said gently No sir said Fleda and but What is in the way But it seemed impossible for Fleda to tell him May I not know he said gently putting away the hair from Fleda s face which looked distressed Is it only your feeling No sir said Fleda at least not the feeling you think it is but I could not do it without giving great pain mister Carleton was silent Not to anybody you know mister Carleton said Fleda suddenly fearing a wrong interpretation of her words I don t mean that I mean somebody else the person the only person you could apply to she said covering her face in utter confusion Do I understand you said he smiling Has this gentleman any reason to dislike the sight of me No sir said Fleda but he thinks he has That only I meant said he You are quite right my dear Elfie I of all men ought to understand that The subject was dropped and in a few minutes his gentle skill had well nigh made Fleda forget what they had been talking about Himself and his wishes seemed to be put quite out of his own view and out of hers as far as possible except that the very fact made Fleda recognize with unspeakable gratitude and admiration the kindness and grace that were always exerted for her pleasure If her good will could have been put into the cups of coffee she poured out for him he might have gone in the strength of them all the way to England There was strength of another kind to be gained from her face of quiet sorrow and quiet self command which were her very childhood s own You will see me at the earliest possible moment he said when at last taking leave I hope to be free in a short time but it may not be Elfie if I should be detained longer than I hope if I should not be able to return in a reasonable time will you let my mother bring you out if I cannot come to you will you come to me Fleda coloured a good deal and said scarce intelligibly that she hoped he would be able to come He did not press the matter He parted from her and was leaving the room Fleda suddenly sprang after him before he had reached the door and laid her hand on his arm I did not answer your question mister Carleton she said with cheeks that were dyed now I will do whatever you please whatever you think best His thanks were most gratefully though silently spoken and he went away Chapter LII Daughter they seem to say Peace to thy heart We too yes daughter Have been as thou art Hope lifted doubt depressed Seeing in part Tried troubled tempted Sustained as thou art Unknown mister Rossitur was disposed for no further delay now in leaving Queechy The office at Jamaica which mister Carleton and doctor Gregory had secured for him was immediately accepted and every arrangement pressed to hasten his going On every account he was impatient to be out of America and especially since his son s death Marion was of his mind missus Rossitur had more of a home feeling even for the place where home had not been to her as happy as it might They were sad weeks of bustle and weariness that followed Hugh s death less sad perhaps for the weariness and the bustle There was little time for musing no time for lingering regrets If thought and feeling played their Eolian measures on Fleda s harpstrings they were listened to only by snatches and she rarely sat down and cried to them A very kind note had been received from missus Carleton April gave place to May One afternoon Fleda had taken an hour or two to go and look at some of the old places on the farm that she loved and that were not too far to reach A last look she guessed it might be for it was weeks since she had had a spare afternoon and another she might not he able to find It was a doubtful pleasure she sought too but she must have it She visited the long meadow and the height that stretched along it and even went so far as the extremity of the valley at the foot of the twenty acre lot and then stood still to gather up the ends of memory There she had gone chestnutting with mister Ringgan thither she had guided mister Carleton and her cousin Rossitur that day when they were going after wood cock there she had directed and overseen Earl Douglass s huge crop of corn How many pieces of her life were connected with it She stood for a little while looking at the old chestnut trees looking and thinking and turned away soberly with the recollection The world passeth away but the word of our God shall stand forever And though there was one thought that was a continual well of happiness in the depth of Fleda s heart her mind passed it now and echoed with great joy the countersign of Abraham s privilege Thou art my portion O Lord And in that assurance every past and every hoped for good was sweet with added sweetness She walked home without thinking much of the long meadow It was a chill spring afternoon and Fleda was in her old trim the black cloak the white shawl over it and the hood of grey silk And in that trim she walked into the sitting room A lady was there in a travelling dress a stranger Fleda s eye took in her outline and feature one moment with a kind of bewilderment the next with perfect intelligence If the lady had been in any doubt Fleda s cheeks alone would have announced her identity But she came forward without hesitation after the first moment pulling off her hood and stood before her visiter blushing in a way that perhaps missus Carleton looked at as a novelty in her world Fleda did not know how she looked at it but she had nevertheless an instinctive feeling even at the moment that the lady wondered how her son should have fancied particularly anything that went about under such a hood Whatever missus Carleton thought her son s fancies she knew were unmanageable and she had far too much good breeding to let her thoughts be known unless to one of those curious spirit thermometers that can tell a variation of temperature through every sort of medium There might have been the slightest want of forwardness to do it but she embraced Fleda with great cordiality This is for the old time not for the new dear Fleda she said Do you remember me Perfectly very well said Fleda giving missus Carleton for a moment a glimpse of her eyes I do not easily forget Your look promises me an advantage from that which I do not deserve but which I may as well use as another I want all I can have Fleda There was a half look at the speaker that seemed to deny the truth of that but Fleda did not otherwise answer She begged her visiter to sit down and throwing off the white shawl and black cloak took tongs in hand and began to mend the fire missus Carleton sat considering a moment the figure of the fire maker not much regardful of the skill she was bringing to bear upon the sticks of wood Fleda turned from the fire to remove her visitor s bonnet and wrappings but the former was all missus Carleton would give her she threw off shawl and tippet on the nearest chair It was the same missus Carleton of old Fleda saw while this was doing unaltered almost entirely The fine figure and bearing were the same time had made no difference even the face had paid little tribute to the years that had passed by it and the hair held its own without a change Bodily and mentally she was the same Apparently she was thinking the like of Fleda I remember you very well she said with kindly accent when Fleda sat down by her I have never forgotten you A dear little creature you were I always knew that Fleda hoped privately the lady would see no occasion to change her mind but for the present she was bankrupt in words I was in the same room this morning at Montepoole where we used to dine and it brought back the whole thing to me the time when you were sick there with us I could think of nothing else But I don t think I was your favourite Fleda Such a rush of blood again answered her as moved missus Carleton in common kindness to speak of common things She entered into a long story of her journey of her passage from England of the steamer that brought her of her stay in New York all which Fleda heard very indifferently well She was more distinctly conscious of the handsome travelling dress which seemed all the while to look as its wearer had done with some want of affinity upon the little grey hood which lay on the chair in the corner Still she listened and responded as became her though for the most part with eyes that did not venture from home The little hood itself could never have kept its place with less presumption nor with less flutter of self distrust missus Carleton came at last to a general account of the circumstances that had determined Guy to return home so suddenly where she was more interesting She hoped he would not be detained but it was impossible to tell It was just as it might happen Are you acquainted with the commission I have been charged with she said when her narrations had at last lapsed into silence and Fleda s eyes had returned to the ground I suppose so ma am said Fleda with a little smile It is a very pleasant charge said missus Carleton softly kissing her cheek Something in the face itself must have called forth that kiss for this time there were no requisitions of politeness Do you recognize my commission Fleda Fleda did not answer missus Carleton sat a few minutes thoughtfully drawing back the curls from her forehead mister Carleton s very gesture but not by any means with his fingers and musing perhaps on the possibility of a hood s having very little to do with what it covered Do you know she said I have felt as if I were nearer to Guy since I have seen you The quick smile and colour that answered this both very bright wrought in missus Carleton an instant recollection that her son was very apt to be right in his judgments and that probably the present case might prove him so The hand which had played with Fleda s hair was put round her waist very affectionately and missus Carleton drew near her I am sure we shall love each other Fleda she said It was said like Fleda not like missus Carleton and answered as simply Fleda had gained her place Her head was in missus Carleton s neck and welcomed there At least I am sure I shall love you said the lady kissing her and I don t despair on my own account for somebody else s sake No said Fleda but she was not fluent to day She sat up and repeated I have not forgotten old times either missus Carleton I don t want to think of the old time I want to think of the new she seemed to have a great fancy for stroking back those curls of hair I want to tell you how happy I am dear Fleda Fleda did not say whether she was happy or unhappy and her look might have been taken for dubious She kept her eyes on the ground while missus Carleton drew the hair off from her flushing cheeks and considered the face laid bare to her view and thought it was a fair face a very presentable face delicate and lovely a face that she would have no reason to be ashamed of even by her son s side Her speech was not precisely to that effect You know now why I have come upon you at such a time I need not ask pardon I felt that I should be hardly discharging my commission if I did not see you till you arrived in New York My wishes I could have made to wait but not my trust So I came I am very glad you did She could fain have persuaded the lady to disregard circumstances and stay with her at least till the next day but missus Carleton was unpersuadable She would return immediately to Montepoole And how long shall you be here now she said A few days it will not be more than a week Do you know how soon mister Rossitur intends to sail for Jamaica As soon as possible he will make his stay in New York very short not more than a fortnight perhaps as short as he can And then my dear Fleda I am to have the charge of you for a little while am I not Fleda hesitated and began to say Thank you but it was finished with a burst of very hearty tears missus Carleton knew immediately the tender spot she had touched She put her arms about Fleda and caressed her as gently as her own mother might have done Forgive me dear Fleda I forgot that so much that is sad to you must come before what is so much pleasure to me Look up and tell me that you forgive me Fleda soon looked up but she looked very sorrowful and said nothing missus Carleton watched her face for a little while really pained Have you heard from Guy since he went away she whispered No ma am I have And therewith she put into Fleda s hand a letter not missus Carleton s letter as Fleda s first thought was It had her own name and the seal was unbroken But it moved missus Carleton s wonder to see Fleda cry again and longer than before She did not understand it She tried soothing but she ventured no attempt at consoling for she did not know what was the matter You will let me go now I know she said smilingly when Fleda was again recovered and standing before the fire with a face not so sorrowful missus Carleton saw But I must say something I shall not hurt you again Oh no you did not hurt me at all it was not what you said You will come to me dear Fleda I feel that I want you very much Thank you but there is my uncle Orrin missus Carleton doctor Gregory doctor Gregory He is just on the eve of sailing for Europe I thought you knew it On the eve so soon Very soon he told me Dear Fleda shall I remind you of my commission and who gave it to me Fleda hesitated still at least she stood looking into the fire and did not answer You do not own his authority yet missus Carleton went on but I am sure his wishes do not weigh for nothing with you and I can plead them Probably it was a source of some gratification to missus Carleton to see those deep spots on Fleda s cheeks They were a silent tribute to an invisible presence that flattered the lady s affection or her pride What do you say dear Fleda to him and to me she said smiling and kissing her I will come missus Carleton The lady was quite satisfied and departed on the instant having got she said all she wanted and Fleda cried till her eyes were sore The days were few that remained to them in their old home not more than a week as Fleda had said It was the first week in May The evening before they were to leave Queechy Fleda and missus Rossitur went together to pay their farewell visit to Hugh s grave It was some distance off They walked there arm in arm without a word by the way The little country grave yard lay alone on a hill side a good way from any house and out of sight even of any but a very distant one A sober and quiet place no tokens of busy life immediately near the fields around it being used for pasturing sheep except an instance or two of winter grain now nearing its maturity A by road not much travelled led to the grave yard and led off from it over the broken country following the ups and downs of the ground to a long distance away without a moving thing upon it in sight near or far No sound of stirring and active humanity Nothing to touch the perfect repose But every lesson of the place could be heard more distinctly amid that silence of all other voices Except indeed nature s voice that was not silent and neither did it jar with the other The very light of the evening fell more tenderly upon the old grey stones and the thick grass in that place Fleda and missus Rossitur went softly to one spot where the grass was not grown and where the bright white marble caught the eye and spoke of grief fresh too Oh that that were grey and moss grown like the others The mother placed herself where the staring black letters of Hugh s name could not remind her so harshly that it no more belonged to the living and sitting down on the ground hid her face to struggle through the parting agony once more with added bitterness Fleda stood awhile sharing it for with her too it was the last time in all likelihood If she had been alone her grief might have witnessed itself bitterly and uncontrolled but the selfish relief was foregone for the sake of another that it might be in her power by and by to minister to a heart yet sorer and weaker than hers The tears that fell so quietly and so fast upon the foot of Hugh s grave were all the deeper drawn and richer fraught Awhile she stood there and then passed round to a group a little way off that had as dear and strong claims upon her love and memory These were not fresh not very oblivion had not come there yet only Time s softening hand Was it softening for Fleda s head was bent down further here and tears rained faster It was hard to leave these The cherished names that from early years had lived in her child s heart from this their last earthly abiding place she was to part company Her mother s and her father s graves were there side by side and never had Fleda s heart so clung to the old grey stones never had the faded lettering seemed so dear of the dear names and of the words of faith and hope that were their dying or living testimony And next to them was her grandfather s resting place and with that sunshiny green mound came a throng of strangely tender and sweet associations more even than with the other two His gentle venerable dignified figure rose before her and her heart yearned towards it In imagination Fleda pressed again to her breast the withered hand that had led her childhood so kindly and overcome here for a little she kneeled down upon the sod and bent her head till the long grass almost touched it in an agony of human sorrow Could she leave them and for ever in this world and be content to see no more these dear memorials till others like them should be raised for herself far away But then stole in consolations not human nor of man s devising the words that were written upon her mother s tombstone Them that sleep in Jesus will God bring with him It was like the march of angel s feet over the turf And her mother had been a meek child of faith and her father and grandfather though strong men had bowed like little children to the same rule Fleda s head bent lower yet and she wept even aloud but it was one half in pure thankfulness and a joy that the world knows nothing of Doubtless they and she were one doubtless though the grass now covered their graves the heavenly bond in which they were held would bring them together again in light to a new and more beautiful life that should know no severing Asleep in Jesus and even as he had risen so should they they and others that she loved all whom she loved best She could leave their graves and with an unspeakable look of thanks to Him who had brought life and immortality to light she did but not till she had there once again remembered her mother s prayer and her aunt Miriam s words and prayed that rather anything might happen to her than that prosperity and the world s favour should draw her from the simplicity and humility of a life above the world Rather than not meet them in joy at the last oh let her want what she most wished for in this world If riches have their poisonous snares Fleda carried away from this place a strong antidote With a spirit strangely simple pure and calm she went back to her aunt Poor missus Rossitur was not quieted but at Fleda s touch and voice gentle and loving as the spirit of love and gentleness could make them she tried to rouse herself lifted up her weary head and clasped her arms about her niece The manner of it went to Fleda s heart for there was in it both a looking to her for support and a clinging to her as another dear thing she was about to lose Fleda could not speak for the heart ache It is harder to leave this place than all the rest missus Rossitur murmured after some little time had passed on He is not here said Fleda s soothing voice It set her aunt to crying again No I know it she said We shall see him again Think of that You will said missus Rossitur very sadly And so will you dear aunt Lucy dear aunt Lucy you promised him Yes sobbed missus Rossitur I promised him but I am such a poor creature So poor that Jesus cannot save you or will not No dear aunt Lucy you do not think that only trust him you do trust him now do you not A fresh gush of tears came with the answer but it was in the affirmative and after a few minutes missus Rossitur grew more quiet I wish something were done to this she said looking at the fresh earth beside her if we could have planted something I have thought of it a thousand times said Fleda sighing I would have done it long ago if I could have got here but it doesn t matter aunt Lucy I wish I could have done it You said missus Rossitur my poor child you have been wearing yourself out working for me I never was worth anything she said hiding her face again When you have been the dearest and best mother to me Now that is not right aunt Lucy look up and kiss me The pleading sweet tone of voice was not to be resisted missus Rossitur looked up and kissed her earnestly enough but with unabated self reproach I don t deserve to kiss you for I have let you try yourself beyond your strength How you look Oh how you look Never mind how I look said Fleda bringing her face so close that her aunt could not see it You helped me all you could aunt Lucy don t talk so and I shall look well enough by and by I am not so very tired You always were so exclaimed missus Rossitur clapping her in her arms again and now I am going to lose you too My dear Fleda that gives me more pleasure than anything else in the world But it was a pleasure well cried over We shall all meet again I hope I will hope said missus Rossitur meekly when Fleda had risen from her arms Dear aunty but before that in England you will come to see me Uncle Rolf will bring you Even then Fleda could not say even that without the blood mounting to her face missus Rossitur shook her head and sighed but smiled a little too as if that delightful chink of possibility let some light in I shouldn t like to see mister Carleton now she said for I could not look him in the face and I am afraid he wouldn t want to look in mine he would be so angry with me Illustration Slowly and lingeringly they moved away The sun was sinking low on that fair May afternoon and they had two miles to walk to get home Slowly and lingeringly they moved away The talk with her aunt had shaken Fleda s calmness and she could have cried now with all her heart but she constrained herself They stopped a moment at the fence to look the last before turning their backs upon the place They lingered and still missus Rossitur did not move and Fleda could not take away her eyes It was that prettiest time of nature which while it shows indeed the shade side of everything makes it the occasion of a fair contrast The grave stones cast long shadows over the ground foretokens of night where another night was resting already the longest stretched away from the head of Hugh s grave But the rays of the setting sun softly touching the grass and the face of the white tombstone seemed to say Thy brother shall rise again Light upon the grave The promise kissing the record of death It was impossible to look in calmness Fleda bowed her head upon the paling and cried with a straitened heart for grief and gratitude together missus Rossitur had not moved when Fleda looked up again The sun was yet lower the sunbeams more slant touched not only that bright white stone they passed on beyond and carried the promise to those other grey ones a little further off that she had left yes for the last time and Fleda s thoughts went forward swiftly to the time of the promise Then shall be brought to pass the saying which is written Death is swallowed up in victory O death where is thy sting O grave where is thy victory The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ And then as she looked the sunbeams might have been a choir of angels in light singing ever so softly Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace good will towards men With a full heart Fleda clasped her aunt s arm and they went gently down the lane without saying one word to each other till they had left the graveyard far behind them and were in the high road again Fleda internally thanked mister Carleton for what he had said to her on a former occasion for the thought of his words had given her courage or strength to go beyond her usual reserve in speaking to her aunt and she thought her words had done good Chapter LIII Use your pleasure If your love do not persuade you to come let not my letter Merchant of Venice On the way home missus Rossitur and Fleda went a trifle out of their road to say good bye to missus Douglass s family Fleda had seen her aunt Miriam in the morning and bid her a conditional farewell for as after missus Rossitur s sailing she would be with missus Carleton she judged it little likely that she should see Queechy again They had time for but a minute at missus Douglass s missus Rossitur had shaken hands and was leaving the house when missus Douglass pulled Fleda back Be you going to the West Indies too Fleda No missus Douglass Then why don t you stay here I want to be with my aunt while I can said Fleda And then do you calculate to stop in New York For awhile said Fleda colouring O go long said missus Douglass I know all about it Now do you s pose you re agoing to be any happier among all those great folks than you would be if you staid among little folks she added tartly while Catherine looked with a kind of incredulous admiration at the future lady of Carleton I don t suppose that greatness has anything to do with happiness missus Douglass said Fleda gently So gently and so calmly sweet the face was that said it that missus Douglass s mood was overcome Well you ain t agoing to forget Queechy she said shaking Fleda s hand with a hearty grasp Never never I ll tell you what I think said missus Douglass the tears in her eyes answering those in Fleda s It ll be a happy house that gets you into it wherever tis I only wish it wa n t out o Queechy Fleda thought on the whole as she walked home that she did not wish any such thing Queechy seemed dismantled and she thought she would rather go to a new place now that she had taken such a leave of every thing here Two things remained however to be taken leave of the house and Barby Happily Fleda had little time for the former It was a busy evening and the morning would be more busy she contrived that all the family should go to rest before her meaning then to have one quiet look at the old rooms by herself a leave taking that no other eyes should interfere with She sat down before the kitchen fire place but she had hardly realized that she was alone when one of the many doors opened and Barby s tall figure walked in Here you be she half whispered I knowed there wouldn t be a minute s peace to morrow so I thought I d bid you good bye to night Fleda gave her a smile and a hand but did not speak Barby drew up a chair beside her and they sat silent for some time while quiet tears from the eyes of each said a great many things Well I hope you ll be as happy as you deserve to be were Barby s first words in a voice very altered from its accustomed firm and spirited accent Make some better wish for me than that dear Barby I wouldn t want any better for myself said Barby determinately I would for you said Fleda She thought of mister Carleton s words again and went on in spite of herself It is a mistake Barby The best of us do not deserve anything good and if we have the sight of a friend s face or the very sweet air we breathe it is because Christ has bought it for us Don t let us forget that and forget him I do always said Barby crying forget everything Fleda I wish you d pray for me when you are far away for I ain t as good as you be Dear Barby said Fleda touching her shoulder affectionately I haven t waited to be far away to do that Barby sobbed for a few minutes with the strength of a strong nature that rarely gave way in that manner and then dashed her tears right and left not at all as if she were ashamed of them but with a resolution not to be overcome There won t be nothing good left in Queechy when you re gone you and Mis Plumfield without I go and look at the place where Hugh lies Dear Barby said Fleda with softening eyes won t you be something good yourself Barby put up her hand to shield her face Fleda was silent for she saw that strong feeling was at work I wish I could Barby broke forth at last if it was only for your sake Dear Barby said Fleda you can do this for me you can go to church and hear what mister Olmney says I should go away happier if I thought you would and if I thought you would follow what he says for dear Barby there is a time coming when you will wish you were a Christian more than you do now and not for my sake I believe there is Fleda Then will you won t you give me so much pleasure I d do a most anything to do you a pleasure Then do it Barby Well I ll go said Barby But now just think of that Fleda how you might have stayed in Queechy all your days and done what you liked with everybody I m glad you ain t though I guess you ll be better off Fleda was silent upon that I d like amazingly to see how you ll be fixed said Barby after a trifle of ruminating If twa n t for my old mother I d be most a mind to pull up sticks and go after you I wish you could Barby only I am afraid you would not like it so well there as here Maybe I wouldn t I s pect them English folks has ways of their own from what I ve heerd tell they set up dreadful don t they Not all of them said Fleda No I don t believe but what I could get along with mister Carleton well enough I never see any one that knowed how to behave himself better Fleda gave her a smiling acknowledgment of this compliment He s plenty of money ha n t he I believe so You ll be sot up like a princess and never have anything to do no more O no said Fleda laughing I expect to have a great deal to do if I don t find it I shall make it I guess it ll be pleasant work said Barby Well I don t care you ve done work enough since you ve lived here that wa n t pleasant to play for the rest of your days and I m glad on t I guess he don t hurt himself You wouldn t stand it much longer to do as you have been doing lately That couldn t be helped said Fleda but that I may stand it to morrow I am afraid we must go to bed Barby Barby bade her good night and left her But Fleda s musing mood was gone She had no longer the desire to call back the reminiscences of the old walls All that page of her life she felt was turned over and after a few minutes quiet survey of the familiar things without the power of moralizing over them as she could have done half an hour before she left them for the next day had no eyes but for business It was a trying week or two before mister Rossitur and his family were fairly on shipboard Fleda as usual and more than usual with the eagerness of affection that felt its opportunities numbered and would gladly have concentrated the services of years into days wrought watched and toiled at what expense to her own flesh and blood missus Rossitur never knew and the others were too busy to guess But missus Carleton saw the signs of it and was heartily rejoiced when they were fairly gone and Fleda was committed to her hands For days almost for weeks after her aunt was gone Fleda could do little but rest and sleep so great was the weariness of mind and body and the exhaustion of the animal spirits which had been kept upon a strain to hide her feelings and support those of others To the very last moment affection s sweet work had been done the eye the voice the smile to say nothing of the hands had been tasked and kept in play to put away recollections to cheer hopes to soften the present to lighten the future and hardest of all to do the whole by her own living example As soon as the last look and wave of the hand were exchanged and there was no longer anybody to lean upon her for strength and support Fleda shewed how weak she was and sank into a state of prostration as gentle and deep almost as an infant s As sweet and lovely as a child too missus Carleton declared her to be sweet and lovely as she was when a child and there was no going beyond that As neither this lady nor Fleda had changed essentially since the days of their former acquaintanceship it followed that there was still as little in common between them except indeed now the strong ground of affection Whatever concerned her son concerned missus Carleton in almost equal degree anything that he valued she valued and to have a thorough appreciation of him was a sure title to her esteem The consequence of all this was that Fleda was now the most precious thing in the world to her after himself especially since her eyes sharpened as well as opened by affection could find in her nothing that she thought unworthy of him In her personally country and blood missus Carleton might have wished changed but her desire that her son should marry the strongest wish she had known for years had grown so despairing that her only feeling now on the subject was joy she was not in the least inclined to quarrel with his choice Fleda had from her the tenderest care as well as the utmost delicacy that affection and good breeding could teach And Fleda needed both for she was slow in going back to her old health and strength and stripped on a sudden of all her old friends on this turning point of her life her spirits were in that quiet mood that would have felt any jarring most keenly The weeks of her first languor and weariness were over and she was beginning again to feel and look like herself The weather was hot and the city disagreeable now for it was the end of June but they had pleasant rooms upon the Battery and Fleda s windows looked out upon the waving tops of green trees and the bright waters of the bay She used to lie gazing out at the coming and going vessels with a curious fantastic interest in them they seemed oddly to belong to that piece of her life and to be weaving the threads of her future fate as they flitted about in all directions before her In a very quiet placid mood not as if she wished to touch one of the threads she lay watching the bright sails that seemed to carry the shuttle of life to and fro letting missus Carleton arrange and dispose of everything and of her as she pleased She was on her couch as usual looking out one fair morning when missus Carleton came in to kiss her and ask how she did Fleda said better Better you always say better said missus Carleton but I don t see that you get better very fast And sober this cheek is too sober she added passing her hand fondly over it I don t like to see it so That is just the way I have been feeling ma am unable to rouse myself I should be ashamed of it if I could help it missus Evelyn has been here begging that we would join her in a party to the Springs Saratoga how would you like that I should like anything that you would like ma am said Fleda with a thought how she would like to read Montepoole for Saratoga The city is very hot and dusty just now Very and I am sorry to keep you in it missus Carleton Keep me love said missus Carleton bending down her face to her again it s a pleasure to be kept anywhere by you Fleda shut her eyes for she could hardly bear a little word now I don t like to keep you here it is not myself I am thinking of I fancy a change would do you good You are very kind ma am Very interested kindness said missus Carleton I want to see you looking a little better before Guy comes I am afraid he will look grave at both of us But as she paused and stroked Fleda s cheek it came into her mind to doubt the truth of the last assertion and she ended off with I wish he would come So Fleda wished truly for now cut off as she was from her old associations she longed for the presence of the one friend that was to take place of them all I hope we shall hear soon that there is some prospect of his getting free missus Carleton went on He has been gone now how many weeks I am looking for a letter to day And there it is The maid at this moment entered with the steamer despatches missus Carleton pounced upon the one she knew and broke it open Here it is and there is yours Fleda With kind politeness she went off to read her own and left Fleda to study hers at her leisure An hour after she came in again Fleda s face was turned from her Well what does he say she asked in a lively tone I suppose the same he has said to you ma am said Fleda I don t suppose it indeed said missus Carleton laughing He has given me sundry charges which if he has given you it is morally certain we shall never come to an understanding I have received no charges said Fleda I am directed to be very careful to find out your exact wish in the matter and to let you follow no other So what is it my sweet Fleda I promised said Fleda colouring and turning her letter over But there she stopped Whom and what said missus Carleton after she had waited a reasonable time mister Carleton What did you promise my dear Fleda That I would do as he said But he wishes you to do as you please Fleda brought her eyes quick out of missus Carleton s view and was silent What do you say dear Fleda said the lady taking her hand and bending over her I am sure we shall be expected said Fleda I will go You are a darling girl said missus Carleton kissing her again and again I will love you forever for that And I am sure it will be the best thing for you the sea will do you good and ne vous en deplaise our own home is pleasanter just now than this dusty town I will write by this steamer and tell Guy we will be there by the next He will have everything in readiness I know at all events and in half an hour after you get there my dear Fleda you will be established in all your rights as well as if it had been done six months before Guy will know how to thank you But after all Fleda you might do him this grace considering how long he has been waiting upon you Something in Fleda s eyes induced missus Carleton to say laughing What s the matter He never waited for me said Fleda simply Didn t he But my dear Fleda I said missus Carleton in amused extremity how long is it since you knew what he came out here for I don t know now ma am said Fleda But she became angelically rosy the next minute He never told you No And you never asked him Why no ma am He will be well suited in a wife said missus Carleton laughing But he can have no objection to your knowing now I suppose He never told me but at the latest You must know Fleda that it has been my wish for a great many years that Guy would marry and I almost despaired he was so difficult to please his taste in everything is so fastidious but I am glad of it now she added kissing Fleda s cheek Last spring not this last but a year ago one evening at home I was talking to him on this subject but he met everything I said lightly you know his way and I saw my words took no hold I asked him at last in a kind of desperation if he supposed there was a woman in the world that could please him and he laughed and said if there was he was afraid she was not in that hemisphere And a day or two after he told me he was going to America Did he say for what No but I guessed as soon as I found he was prolonging his stay and I was sure when he wrote me to come out to him But I never knew till I landed Fleda my dear any more than that The first question I asked him was who he was going to introduce to me The interval was short to the next steamer but also the preparations were few A day or two after the foregoing conversation Constance Evelyn coming into Fleda s room found her busy with some light packing My dear little creature she exclaimed ecstatically are you going with us No said Fleda Where are you going then To England England Has I mean is there any addition to my list of acquaintances in the city Not that I know of said Fleda going on with her work And you are going to England Greenhouses will be a desolation to me I hope not said Fleda smiling you will recover yourself and your sense of sweetness in time It will have nothing to act upon And you are going to England I think it is very mean of you not to ask me to go too and be your bridesmaid I don t expect to have such a thing said Fleda Not Horrid I wouldn t be married so Fleda You don t know the world little Queechy the art de vous faire valoir I am afraid is unknown to you So it may remain with my good will said Fleda Why said Constance I have never felt the want of it said Fleda simply When are you going said Constance after a minute s pause By the Europa But this is a very sudden move Yes very sudden I should think you would want a little time to make preparations That is all happily taken off my hands said Fleda missus Carleton has written to her sister in England to take care of it for me I didn t know that missus Carleton had a sister What s her name Lady Peterborough Constance was silent again What are you going to do about mourning Fleda wear white I suppose As nobody there knows anything about you you won t care I do not care in the least said Fleda calmly my feeling would quite as soon choose white as black Mourning so often goes alone that I should think grief might be excused for shunning its company And as you have not put it on yet said Constance you won t feel the change And then in reality after all he was only a cousin Fleda s quiet mood sober and tender as it was could go to a certain length of endurance but this asked too much Dropping the things from her hands she turned from the trunk beside which she was kneeling and hiding her face on a chair wept such tears as cousins never shed for each other Constance was startled and distressed and Fleda s quick sympathy knew that she must be before she could see it You needn t mind it at all dear Constance she said as soon as she could speak it s no matter I am in such a mood sometimes that I cannot bear anything Don t think of it she said kissing her Constance however could not for the remainder of her visit get back her wonted light mood which indeed had been singularly wanting to her during the whole interview missus Carleton counted the days to the steamer and her spirits rose with each one Fleda s spirits were quiet to the last degree and passive too passive missus Carleton thought She did not know the course of the years that had gone and could not understand how strangely Fleda seemed to herself now to stand alone broken off from her old friends and her former life on a little piece of time that was like an isthmus joining two continents Fleda felt it all exceedingly felt that she was changing from one sphere of life to another never forgot the graves she had left at Queechy and as little the thoughts and prayers that had sprung up beside them She felt with all missus Carleton s kindness that she was completely alone with no one on her side the ocean to look to and glad to be relieved from taking active part in anything she made her little Bible her companion for the greater part of the time Are you going to carry that sober face all the way to Carleton said missus Carleton one day pleasantly I don t know ma am What do you suppose Guy will think of it But the thought of what he would think of it and what he would say to it and how fast he would brighten it made Fleda burst into tears missus Carleton resolved to talk to her no more but to get her home as fast as possible I have one consolation said Charlton Rossitur as he shook hands with her on board the steamer I have received permission from head quarters to come and see you in England and to that I shall look forward constantly from this time Chapter LIV The full sum of me Is sum of something which to term in gross Is an unlesson d girl unschool d unpractis d Happy in this she is not yet so old But she may learn and happier than this She is not bred so dull but she can learn Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord her governor her king Merchant of Venice They had a very speedy passage to the other side and partly in consequence of that mister Carleton was not found waiting for them in Liverpool missus Carleton would not tarry there but hastened down at once to the country thinking to be at home before the news of their arrival It was early morning of one fair day in July when they were at last drawing near the end of their journey They would have reached it the evening before but for a storm which had constrained them to stop and wait over the night at a small town about eight miles off For fear then of passing Guy on the road his mother sent a servant before and making an extraordinary exertion was actually herself in the carriage by seven o clock Nothing could be fairer than that early drive if Fleda might have enjoyed it in peace The sweet morning air was exceeding sweet and the summer light fell upon a perfect luxuriance of green things Out of the carriage Fleda s spirits were at home but not within it and it was sadly irksome to be obliged to hear and respond to missus Carleton s talk which was kept up she knew in the charitable intent to divert her She was just in a state to listen to nature s talk to the other she attended and replied with a patient longing to be left free that she might steady and quiet herself Perhaps missus Carleton s tact discovered this in the matter of course and uninterested manner of her rejoinders for as they entered the park gates she became silent and the long drive from them to the house was made without a word on either side For a length of way the road was through a forest of trees of noble growth which in some places closed their arms overhead and in all sentinelled the path in stately array The eye had no scope beyond the ranks of this magnificent body Carleton park was celebrated for its trees but magnificent though they were and dearly as Fleda loved every form of forest beauty she felt oppressed The eye forbidden to range so was the mind shut in to itself and she only felt under the gloom and shadow of those great trees the shadow of the responsibilities and of the change that were coming upon her But after a while the ranks began to be thinned and the ground to be broken the little touches of beauty with which the sun had enlivened the woodland began to grow broader and cheerfuller and then as the forest scattered away to the right and left gay streams of light came through the glades and touched the surface of the rolling ground where in the hollows on the heights on the sloping sides of the dingles knots of trees of yet more luxuriant and picturesque growth planted or left by the cultivator s hand long ago and trained by no hand but nature s stood so as to distract a painter s eye and just now in the fresh gilding of the morning and with all the witchery of the long shadows upon the uneven ground certainly charmed Fleda s eye and mind both Fancy was dancing again albeit with one hand upon gravity s shoulder and the dancing was a little nervous too But she looked and caught her breath as she looked while the road led along the very edge of a dingle and then was lost in a kind of enchanted open woodland it seemed so and then passing through a thicket came out upon a broad sweep of green turf that wiled the eye by its smooth facility to the distant screen of oaks and beeches and firs on its far border It was all new Fleda s memory had retained only an indistinct vision of beauty like the face of an angel in a cloud as painters have drawn it now came out the beautiful features one after another as if she had never seen them So far nature had seemed to stand alone But now another hand appeared not interfering with nature but adding to her The road came upon a belt of the shrubbery where the old tenants of the soil were mingled with lighter and gayer companionship and in some instances gave it place though in general the mingling was very graceful There was never any crowding of effects it seemed all nature still only as if several climes had joined together to grace one Then that was past and over smooth undulating ground bearing a lighter growth of foreign wood with here and there a stately elm or ash that disdained their rivalry the carriage came under the brown walls and turrets of the house Fleda s mood had changed again and as the grave outlines rose above her half remembered and all the more for that imposing she trembled at the thought of what she had come there to do and to be She felt very nervous and strange and out of place and longed for the familiar free and voice that would bid her be at home missus Carleton now was not enough of a stand by With all that Fleda descended from the carriage with her usual quiet demureness no one that did not know her well would have seen in her any other token of emotion than a somewhat undue and wavering colour They were welcomed at least one of them was with every appearance of sincerity by the most respectable looking personage who opened to them and whom Fleda remembered instantly The array of servants in the hall would almost have startled her if she had not recollected the same thing on her first coming to Carleton She stepped in with a curious sense of that first time when she had come there a little child Where is your master was missus Carleton s immediate demand mister Carleton set off this morning for Liverpool missus Carleton gave a quick glance at Fleda who kept her eyes at home We did not meet him we have not passed him how long ago were her next rapid words My master left Carleton as early as five o clock he gave orders to drive as fast as possible Then he had gone through Hollonby an hour before we left it said missus Carleton looking again to her companion but he will hear of us at Carstairs we stopped there yesterday afternoon he will be back again in a few hours I am sure Then we have been expected Yes ma am my master gave orders that you should be expected Is all well Popham All is well madam Is Lady Peterborough here His lordship and Lady Peterborough arrived the day before yesterday was the succint reply Drawing Fleda s arm within hers and giving kind recognition to the rest who stood around missus Carleton led her to the stairs and mounted them repeating in a whisper He will be here presently again They went to missus Carleton s dressing room Fleda wondering in an interval fever whether orders had been given to expect her also from the old butler s benign look at her as he said All is well she could not help thinking it If she maintained her outward quiet it was the merest external crust of seeming there was nothing like quiet beneath it and missus Carleton s kiss and fond words of welcome were hardly composing missus Carleton made her sit down and with very gentle hands was busy arranging her hair when the housekeeper came in to pay her more particular respects and to offer her services Fleda hardly ventured a glance to see whether she looked benign She was a dignified elderly person as stately and near as handsome as missus Carleton herself My dear Fleda said the latter when she had finished the hair I am going to see my sister will you let missus Fothergill help you in anything you want and take you then to the library you will find no one and I will come to you there missus Fothergill I recommend you to the particular care of this lady The recommendation was not needed Fleda thought or was very effectual the housekeeper served her with most assiduous care and in absolute silence Fleda hurried the finishing of her toilet Are the people quiet in the country she forced herself to say Perfectly quiet ma am It needed only that my master should be at home to make them so How is that He has their love and their ear ma am and so it is that he can just do his pleasure with them How is it in the neighbouring country They re quiet ma am I believe mostly there s been some little disturbance in one place and another and more fear of it as well as I can make out but it s well got over as it appears The noblemen and gentlemen in the country around were very glad all of them I am told of mister Carleton s return Is there nothing more I can do for you ma am The last question was put with an indefinable touch of kindliness which had not softened the respect of her first words Fleda begged her to show the way to the library which missus Fothergill immediately did remarking as she ushered her in that those were mister Carleton s favourite rooms Fleda did not need to be told that she put the remark and the benignity together and drew a nervous inference But missus Fothergill was gone and she was alone Nobody was there as missus Carleton had said Fleda stood still in the middle of the floor looking around her in a bewildered effort to realize the past and the present with all the mind in the world to cry but there was too great a pressure of excitement and too much strangeness of feeling at work Nothing before her in the dimly familiar place served at all to lessen this feeling and recovering from her maze she went to one of the glazed doors which stood open and turned her back upon the room with its oppressive recollections Her eye lighted upon nothing that was not quiet now A secluded piece of smooth green partially bordered with evergreens and set with light shrubbery of rare kinds exquisitely kept over against her a sweetbriar that seemed to have run wild indicating Fleda was sure the entrance of the path to the rose garden that her memory alone would hardly have helped her to find All this in the bright early summer morning and the sweet aromatic smell of firs and flowers coming with every breath There were draughts of refreshment in the air It composed her and drinking it in delightedly Fleda stood with folded arms in the doorway half forgetting herself and her position and going in fancy from the firs and the roses over a very wide field of meditation indeed So lost that she started fearfully on suddenly becoming aware that a figure had come just beside her It was an elderly and most gentlemanly looking man as a glance made her know Fleda was reassured and ashamed in a breath The gentleman did not notice her confusion however otherwise than by a very pleasant and well bred smile and immediately entered into some light remarks on the morning the place and the improvements mister Carleton had made in the latter Though he said the place was one of those which could bear very well to want improvement but Carleton was always finding something to do which excited his admiration Landscape gardening is one of the pleasantest of amusements said Fleda I have just knowledge enough in the matter to admire to originate any ideas is beyond me I have to depend for them upon my gardener and my wife and so I lose a pleasure I suppose but every man has his own particular hobby Carleton however has more than his share he has half a dozen I think Half a dozen hobbies said Fleda Perhaps I should not call them hobbies for he manages to ride them all skilfully and a hobby horse I believe always runs away with the man Fleda could hardly return his smile She thought people were possessed with an unhappy choice of subjects in talking to her that morning But fancying that she had very ill kept up her part in the conversation and must have looked like a simpleton she forced herself to break the silence which followed the last remark and asked the same question she had asked missus Fothergill if the country was quiet Outwardly quiet he said O yes there is no more difficulty that is none which cannot easily be handled There was some danger a few months ago but it is blown over all was quiet on Carleton s estates so soon as he was at home and that of course had great influence on the neighbourhood No there is nothing to be apprehended He has the hearts of his people completely and one who has their hearts can do what he pleases with their heads you know Well he deserves it he has done a great deal for them Fleda was afraid to ask in what way but perhaps he read the question in her eyes That s one of his hobbies ameliorating the condition of the poorer classes on his estates He has given himself to it for some years back he has accomplished a great deal for them a vast deal indeed He has changed the face of things mentally and morally in several places with his adult schools and agricultural systems and I know not what but the most powerful means I think after all has been the weight of his personal influence by which he can introduce and carry through any measure neither ignorance nor prejudice nor obstinacy seem to make head against him It requires a peculiar combination of qualities I think very peculiar and rare to deal successfully with the mind of the masses I should think so indeed said Fleda He has it I don t comprehend it and I have not studied his machinery enough to understand that but I have seen the effects Never should have thought he was the kind of man either but there it is I don t comprehend him There is only one fault to be found with him though What is that said Fleda smiling He has built a fine dissenting chapel down here towards Hollonby he said gravely looking her in the face and what is yet worse his uncle tells me he goes there half the time himself Fleda could not help laughing nor colouring at his manner I thought it was always considered a meritorious action to build a church she said Indubitably But you see this was a chapel The laugh and the colour both grew more unequivocal Fleda could not help it I beg your pardon sir I have not learned such nice distinctions Perhaps a chapel was wanted just in that place That is presumable But he might be wanted somewhere else However said the gentleman with a good humoured smile his uncle forgives him and if his mother cannot influence him I am afraid nobody else will There is no help for it And I should be very sorry to stand ill with him I have given you the dark side of his character What is the other side in the contrast said Fleda wondering at herself for her daring It is not for me to say he answered with a slight shrug of the shoulders and an amused glance at her I suppose it depends upon people s vision but if you will permit me I will instance a bright spot that was shewn to me the other day that I confess when I look at it dazzles my eyes a little Fleda only bowed she dared not speak again There was a poor fellow the son of one of mister Carleton s old tenants down here at Enchapel who was under sentence of death lying in prison at Carstairs The father I am told is an excellent man and a good tenant the son had been a miserable scapegrace and now for some crime I forget what had at last been brought to justice The evidence against him was perfect and the offence was not trifling there was not the most remote chance of a pardon but it seemed the poor wretch had been building up his dependence upon that hope and was resting on it and consequently was altogether indisposed and unfit to give his attention to the subjects that his situation rendered proper for him The gentleman who gave me this story was requested by a brother clergyman to go with him to visit the prisoner They found him quite stupid unmovable by all that could be urged or rather perhaps the style of the address as it was described to me was fitted to confound and bewilder the man rather than enlighten him In the midst of all this mister Carleton came in he was just then on the wing for America and he had heard of the poor creature s condition in a visit to his father He came my informant said like a being of a different planet He took the man s hand he was chained foot and wrist My poor friend he said I have been thinking of you here shut out from the light of the sun and I thought you might like to see the face of a friend with that singular charm of manner which he knows how to adapt to everybody and every occasion The man was melted at once at his feet as it were he could do anything with him Carleton began then quietly to set before him the links in the chain of evidence which had condemned him one by one in such a way as to prove to him by degrees but irresistibly that he had no hope in this world The man was perfectly subdued sat listening and looking into those powerful eyes that perhaps you know taking in all his words and completely in his hand And then Carleton went on to bring before him the considerations that he thought should affect him in such a case in a way that this gentleman said was indescribably effective and winning till that hardened creature was broken down sobbing like a child actually sobbing Fleda did her best but she was obliged to hide her face in her hands let what would be thought of her It was the finest exhibition of eloquence this gentleman said he had ever listened to For me it was an exhibition of another kind I would have believed such an account of few men but of all the men I know I would least have believed it of Guy Carleton a few years ago even now I can hardly believe it But it is a thing that would do honour to any man Fleda felt that the tears were making their way between her fingers but she could not help it and she presently knew that her companion had gone and she was left alone again Who was this gentleman and how much did he know about her More than that she was a stranger Fleda was sure and dreading his return or that somebody else might come and find her with tokens of tears upon her face she stepped out upon the greensward and made for the flaunting sweet briar that seemed to beckon her to visit its relations The entrance of a green path was there or a grassy glade more or less wide leading through a beautiful growth of firs and larches No roses nor any other ornamental shrubs only the soft well kept footway through the woodland Fleda went gently on and on admiring where the trees sometimes swept back leaving an opening and at other places stretched their graceful branches over her head The perfect condition of everything to the eye the rich coloured vegetation of varying colour above and below the absolute retirement and the strong pleasant smell of the evergreens had a kind of charmed effect upon senses and mind too It was a fairyland sort of place The presence of its master seemed everywhere it was like him and Fleda pressed on to see yet livelier marks of his character and fancy beyond By degrees the wood began to thin on one side then at once the glade opened into a bright little lawn rich with roses in full bloom Fleda was stopped short at the sudden vision of loveliness There was the least possible appearance of design no dry beds were to be seen the luxuriant clumps of Provence and white roses with the varieties of the latter seemed to have chosen their own places only to have chosen them very happily One hardly imagined that they had submitted to dictation if it were not that Queen Flora never was known to make so effective a disposition of her forces without help The screen of trees was very thin on the border of this opening so thin that the light from beyond came through On a slight rocky elevation which formed the further side of it sat an exquisite little Moorish temple about which and the face of the rock below some Noisette and Multiflora climbers were vying with each other and just at the entrance of the further path a white dog rose had thrown itself over the way covering the lower branches of the trees with its blossoms Fleda stood spell bound a good while with a breath oppressed with pleasure But what she had seen excited her to see more and a dim recollection of the sea view from somewhere in the walk drew her on Roses met her now frequently Now and then a climber all alone seemed to have sought protection in a tree by the path side and to have displayed itself thence in the very wantonness of security hanging out its flowery wreaths fearless of hand or knife Clusters of Noisettes or of French or Damask roses where the ground was open enough stood without a rival and needing no foil other than the beautiful surrounding of dark evergreen foliage But the distance was not long before she came out upon a wider opening and found what she was seeking the sight of the sea The glade here was upon the brow of high ground and the wood disappearing entirely for a space left the eye free to go over the lower tree tops and the country beyond to the distant shore and sea line Roses were here too the air was full of the sweetness of Damask and Bourbon varieties and a few beautiful Banksias happily placed contrasted without interfering with them It was very still it was very perfect the distant country was fresh coloured with the yet early light which streamed between the trees and laid lines of enchantment upon the green turf and the air came up from the sea board and bore the breath of the roses to Fleda every now and then with a gentle puff of sweetness Such light she had seen none such light since she was a child Was it the burst of mental sunshine that had made it so bright or was she going to be really a happy child again No no not that and yet something very like it So like it that she almost startled at herself She went no further She could not have borne just then to see any more and feeling her heart too full she stood even there with hands crossed upon her bosom looking away from the roses to the distant sea line Illustration The roses could not be sweeter to any one That said something very different That was very sobering if she had needed sobering which she did not But it helped her to arrange the scattered thoughts which had been pressing confusedly upon her brain Look away from the roses indeed she could not for the same range of vision took in the sea and them and the same range of thought These might stand for an emblem of the present that of the future grave far off impenetrable and passing as it were the roses of time Fleda fixed upon that image of eternity and weighing the one against the other felt never in her life more keenly how wild it would be to forget in smelling the roses her preparations for that distant voyage that must be made from the shores where they grow With one eye upon this brightest bits of earth before her the other mentally was upon Hugh s grave The roses could not be sweeter to any one but in view of the launching away into that distant sea line in view of the issues on the other shore in view of the welcome that might be had there the roses might fade and wither but her happiness could not go with their breath They were something to be loved to be used to be thankful for but not to live upon something too that whispered of an increased burden of responsibility and never more deeply than at that moment did Fleda remember her mother s prayer never more simply recognized that happiness could not be made of these things She might be as happy at Queechy as here It depended on the sunlight of undying hopes which indeed would give wonderful colour to the flowers that might be in her way on the possession of resources the spring of which would never dry on the peace which secures the continual feast of a merry heart Fleda could take her new honours and advantages very meekly and very soberly with all her appreciation of them The same work of life was to be done here as at Queechy To fulfil the trust committed to her larger here to keep her hope for the future undeceived by the sunshine of earth to plant her roses where they would bloom everlastingly The weight of these things bowed Fleda to the ground and made her bury her face in her hands But there was one item of happiness from which her thoughts never even in imagination dissevered themselves and round it they gathered now in their weakness A strong mind and heart to uphold hers a strong hand for here to rest in that was a blessing and Fleda would have cried heartily but that her feelings were too high wrought They made her deaf to the light sound of footsteps coming over the grass till two hands gently touched hers and lifted her up and then Fleda was at home But surprised and startled she could hardly lift up her face mister Carleton s greeting was as grave and gentle as if she had been a stray child Do not fancy I am going to thank you for the grace you have shewn me said he lightly I know you would never have done it if circumstances had not been hard pleaders in my cause I will thank you presently when you have answered one or two questions for me Questions said Fleda looking up But she blushed the next instant at her own simplicity He was leading her back on the path she had come No further however than to the first opening where the climbing dog rose hung over the way There he turned aside crossing the little plot of greensward and they ascended some steps cut in the rock to the pavilion Fleda had looked at from a distance It stood high enough to command the same sea view On that side it was entirely open and of very light construction on the others Several people were there Fleda could hardly tell how many and when Lord Peterborough was presented to her she did not find out that he was her morning s acquaintance Her eye only took in besides that there were one or two ladies and a clergyman in the dress of the Church of England she could not distinguish Yet she stood beside mister Carleton with all her usual quiet dignity though her eye did not leave the ground and her words were in no higher key than was necessary and though she could hardly bear the unchanged easy tone of his The birds were in a perfect ecstasy all about them the soft breeze came through the trees gently waving the branches and stirring the spray wreaths of the roses the very fluttering of summer s drapery some roses looked in at the lattice and those which could not be there sent in their congratulations on the breath of the wind while the words were spoken that bound them together mister Carleton then dismissing his guests to the house went with Fleda again the other way He had felt the extreme trembling of the hand which he took and would not go in till it was quieted He led her back to the very rose bush where he had found her and in his own way presently brought her spirit home from its trembling and made it rest and then suffered her to stand a few minutes quite silent looking out again over the fair rich spread of country that lay between them and the sea Now tell me Elfie said he softly drawing back with the same old caressing and tranquillizing touch the hair that hung over her brow what you were thinking about when I found you here in the very luxury of seclusion behind a rose bush Fleda looked a quick look smiled and hesitated and then said it was rather a confusion of thoughts It will be a confusion no longer when you have disentangled them for me I don t know said Fleda And she was silent but so was he quietly waiting for her to go on Perhaps you will wonder at me mister Carleton she said hesitating and colouring Perhaps he said smiling but if I do I will not keep you in ignorance Elfie I was almost bewildered in the first place with beauty and then Do you like the rose garden Like it I cannot speak of it I don t want you to speak of it said he smiling at her What followed upon liking it Elfie I was thinking said Fleda looking resolutely away from him in the midst of all this that it is not these things which make people happy There is no question of that he replied I have realized it thoroughly for a few months past No but seriously I mean said Fleda pleadingly And seriously you are quite right dear Elfie What then I was thinking said Fieda speaking with some difficulty of Hugh s grave and of the comparative value of things and afraid I believe especially here Of making a wrong estimate Yes and of not doing and being just what I ought mister Carleton was silent for a minute considering the brow from which his fingers drew off the light screen Will you trust me to watch over and tell you Fleda did not trust her voice to tell him but her eyes did it As to the estimate the remedy is to keep ourselves in the love of God and then these things are the gifts of our Father s hand and will never be put in competition with him And they are never so sweet as when taken so Oh I know that This is a danger I share with you We will watch over each other Fleda was silent with filling eyes We do not seek our happiness in these things he said tenderly I never found it in them For years whatever others may have judged I have felt myself a poor man because I had not in the world a friend in whom I could have entire sympathy And if I am rich now it is not in any treasure that I look to enjoy in this world alone Oh do not mister Carleton exclaimed Fleda bowing her head in distress and giving his hand an earnest entreaty What shall I not do said he half laughing and half gently bringing her face near enough for his lips to try another kind of eloquence You shall not do this Elfie for any so light occasion Was this the whole burden of those grave thoughts Not quite entirely she said stammering But grave thoughts are not always unhappy Not always I want to know what gave yours a tinge of that colour this morning It was hardly that You know what Foster says about power to its very last particle being duty I believe it frightened me a little If you feel that as strongly as I do Elfie it will act as a strong corrective to the danger of false estimates I do feel it said Fleda One of my fears was that I should not feel it enough One of my cares will be that you do not act upon it too fiercely said he smiling The power being limited so is the duty But you shall have power enough Elfie and work enough I have precisely what I have needed my good sprite back again With a slight difference What difference She is to act under direction now Not at all only under safe control he said laughing I am very glad of the difference mister Carleton said Fleda with a grave and grateful remembrance of it If you think the sprite s old office is gone you are mistaken said he What were your other fears one was that you should not feel enough your responsibility and the other that you might forget it I don t know that there were any other particular fears said Fleda I had been thinking of all these things And what else Her colour and her silence begged him not to ask He said no more and let her stand still again looking off through the roses while her mind more quietly and lightly went over the same train of thoughts that had moved it before gradually calmed came back from being a stranger to being at home at least in one presence and ended her action even before her look told him where as her other hand unconsciously was joined to the one already on his arm A mute expression of feeling the full import of which he read even before her eye coming back from its musings was raised to him perhaps unconsciously too with all the mind in it its timidity was not more apparent than its simplicity of clinging affection and dependence mister Carleton s answer was in three words but in the tone and manner that accompanied them there was a response to every part of her appeal so perfect that Fleda was confused at her own frankness They began to move towards the house but Fleda was in a maze again and could hardly realize anything His wife was she that had so marvellous a change really been wrought in her the little asparagus cutter of Queechy transformed into the mistress of all this domain and of the stately mansion of which they caught glimpses now and then as they drew near it by another approach into which mister Carleton had diverged And his wife that was the hardest to realize of all She was as far from realizing it when she got into the house They entered now at once into the breakfast room where the same party were gathered whom she had met once before that morning mister Carleton the elder and Lord Peterborough and Lady Peterborough she had met without seeing But Fleda could look at them now and if her colour came and went as frankly as when she was a child she could speak to them and meet their advances with the same free and sweet self possession as then the rare dignity of a little wood flower that is moved by a breath but recovers as easily and instantly its quiet standing There were one or two who looked a little curiously at first to see whether this new member of the family were worthy of her place and would fill it to satisfy them Not mister Carleton he never sought to ascertain the value of anything that belonged to him by a popular vote and his own judgment always stood carelessly alone But missus Carleton was less sure of her own ground or of others For five minutes she noted Fleda s motions and words her blushes and smiles as she stood talking to one and another for five minutes and then with a little smile at her sister missus Carleton moved off to the breakfast table well pleased that Lady Peterborough was too engaged to answer her Fleda had won them all mister Carleton s intervening shield of grace and kindness was only needed here against the too much attention or attraction that might distress her He was again now they were in presence of others exactly what he had been to her when she was a child the same cool and efficient friend and protector Nobody in the room shewed less thought of her except in action a great many little things done for her pleasure or comfort so quietly that nobody knew it but one person and she hardly noticed it at the time All could not have the same tact There was an uninterrupted easy flow of talk at the table which Fleda heard just enough to join in where it was necessary the rest of the time she sat in a kind of abstraction dipping enormous strawberries one by one into white sugar with a curious want of recognition between them and the ends of her fingers it never occurred to her that they had picked baskets full I have done something for which you will hardly thank me mister Carleton said Lord Peterborough I have driven this lady to tears within the first hour of her being in the house If she will forgive you I will my lord mister Carleton answered carelessly I will confess myself though continued his lordship looking at the face that was so intent over the strawberries I was under the impression when I first saw a figure in the window that it was Lady Peterborough I own as soon as I found it was a stranger I had my suspicions which did not lack confirmation in the course of the interview I trust I am forgiven the means I used It seems you had your curiosity too my lord said mister Carleton the uncle Which ought in all justice to have lacked gratification said Lady Peterborough I hope Fleda will not be too ready to forgive you I expect forgiveness nevertheless said he looking at Fleda Must I wait for it I am much obliged to you sir And then she gave him a very frank smile and blush as she added I beg pardon you know my tongue is American I don t like that said his lordship gravely Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh said the elder Carleton The heart being English we may hope the tongue will become so too I will not assure you of that sir Fleda said laughingly though her cheeks showed the conversation was not carried on without effort Oddly enough nobody saw it with any dissatisfaction Of what madam said Lord Peterborough That I will not always keep a rag of the stars and stripes flying somewhere But that little speech had almost been too much for her equanimity Like Queen Elizabeth who retained the crucifix when she gave up the profession of popery Very unlike indeed said Fleda endeavouring to understand what mister Carleton was saying to her about wood strawberries and hautbois Will you allow that Carleton What my lord A rival banner to float alongside of saint George s The flags are friendly my lord Hum just now they may seem so Has your little standard bearer anything of a rebellious disposition Not against any lawful authority I hope said Fleda Then there is hope for you mister Carleton that you will be able to prevent the introduction of mischievous doctrines For shame Lord Peterborough said his wife what atrocious suppositions you are making I am blushing I am sure for your want of discernment Why yes said his lordship looking at another face whose blushes were more unequivocal it may seem so there is no appearance of anything untoward but she is a woman after all I will try her missus Carleton don t you think with my Lady Peterborough that in the present nineteenth century women ought to stand more on that independent footing from which lordly monopoly has excluded them The first name Fleda thought belonged to another person and her downcast eyelids prevented her seeing to whom it was addressed It was no matter for any answer was anticipated The boast of independence is not engrossed by the boldest footing my lord She has never considered the subject said Lady Peterborough It is no matter said his lordship I must respectfully beg an answer to my question The silence made Fleda look up Don t you think that the rights of the weak ought to be on a perfect equality with those of the strong The rights of the weak as such yes my lord The gentlemen smiled the ladies looked rather puzzled I have no more to say mister Carleton said his lordship but that we must make an Englishwoman of her I am afraid she will never be a perfect cure said mister Carleton smiling I conceive it might require peculiar qualities in the physician but I do not despair I was telling her of some of your doings this morning and happy to see that they met with her entire disapproval mister Carleton did not even glance towards Fleda and made no answer but carelessly gave the conversation another turn for which she thanked him unspeakably There was no other interruption of any consequence to the well bred flow of talk and kindliness of manner on the part of all the company that put Fleda as much as possible at her ease Still she did not realize anything and yet she did realize it so strongly that her woman s heart could not rest till it bad eased itself in tears The superbly appointed table at which she sat her own though missus Carleton this morning presided the like of which she had not seen since she was at Carleton before the beautiful room with its arrangements bringing back a troop of recollections of that old time all the magnificence about her instead of elevating sobered her spirits to the last degree It pressed home upon her that feeling of responsibility of the change that come over her and though beneath it all very happy Fleda hardly knew it she longed so to be alone and to cry One person s eyes however little seemingly observant of her read sufficiently well the unusual shaded air of her brow and her smile But a sudden errand of business called him abroad immediately after breakfast The ladies seized the opportunity to carry Fleda up and introduce her to her dressing room and take account of Lady Peterborough s commission and ladies and ladies maids soon formed a busy committee of dress and decorations It did not enliven Fleda it wearied her though she forgave them the annoyance in gratitude for the pleasure they took in looking at her Even the delight her eye had from the first minute she saw it in the beautiful room and her quick sense of the carefulness with which it had been arranged for her added to the feeling with which she was oppressed she was very passive in the hands of her friends In the midst of all this the housekeeper was called in and formally presented and received by Fleda with a mixture of frankness and bashfulness that caused missus Fothergill afterwards to pronounce her a lady of a very sweet dignity indeed She is just such a lady as you might know my master would have fancied said mister Spenser And what kind of a lady is that said missus Fothergill But mister Spenser was too wise to enter into any particulars and merely informed missus Fothergill that she would know in a few days The first words missus Carleton said when mister Carleton got home said the old butler she put both her hands on his arms and cried out Guy I am delighted with her And what did he say said missus Fothergill He echoed mister Spenser in a tone of indignant intelligence what should he say He didn t say anything only asked where she was I believe In the midst of silks muslins and jewels mister Carleton found Fleda still on his return looking pale and even sad though nobody but himself through her gentle and grateful bearing would have discerned it He took her out of the hands of the committee and carried her down to the little library adjoining the great one but never thrown open his room as it was called where more particularly art and taste had accumulated their wealth of attractions I remember this very well said Fleda This beautiful room It is as free to you as to me Elfie and I never gave the freedom of it to any one else I will not abuse it said Fleda I hope not my dear Elfie said he smiling for the room will want something to me now when you are not in it and a gift is abused that is not made free use of A large and deep bay window in the room looked upon the same green lawn and fir wood with the windows of the library Like those this casement stood open and mister Carleton leading Fleda there remained quietly beside her for a moment watching her face which his last words had a little moved from its outward composure Then gently and gravely as if she had been a child putting his arm round her shoulders and drawing her to him he whispered My dear Elfie you need not fear being misunderstood Fleda started and looked up to see what he meant But his face said it so plainly in its perfect intelligence and sympathy with her that her barrier of self command and reserve was all broken down and hiding her head in her hands upon his breast she let the pent up burden upon her heart come forth in a flood of unrestrained tears She could not help herself And when she would fain have checked them after the first burst and bidden them according to her habit to wait another time it was out of her power for the same kindness and tenderness that had set them a flowing perhaps witting of her intent effectually hindered its execution He did not say a single word but now and then a soft touch of his hand or of his lips upon her brow in its expressive tenderness would unnerve all her resolution and oblige her to have no reserve that time at least in letting her secret thoughts and feelings be known as far as tears could tell them She wept at first in spite of herself and afterwards in the very luxury of indulged feeling till she was as quiet as a child and the weight of oppression was all gone mister Carleton did not move nor speak till she did I never knew before how good you were mister Carleton said Fleda raising her head at length as soon as she dared but still held fast by that kind arm What new light have you got on the subject said he smiling Why said Fleda trying as hard as ever did sunshine to scatter the remnants of a cloud it was a bright cloud too by this time I have always heard that men cannot endure the sight of a woman s tears You shall give me a reward then Elfie What reward said Fleda Promise me that you will shed them nowhere else Nowhere else But here in my arms I don t feel like crying any more now said Fleda evasively at least for drops were falling rather fast again not sorrowfully Promise me Elfie said mister Carleton after a pause But Fleda hesitated still and looked dubious Come he said smiling you know you promised a little while ago that you would have a particular regard to my wishes Fleda s cheeks answered that appeal with sufficient brightness but she looked down and said demurely I am sure one of your wishes is that I should not say anything rashly Well One cannot answer for such wilful things as tears And for such wilful things as men said he smiling But Fleda was silent Then I will alter the form of my demand Promise me that no shadow of anything shall come over your spirit that you do not let me either share or remove There was no trifling in the tone full of gentleness as it was there could be no evading its requisition But the promise demanded was a grave one Fleda was half afraid to make it She looked up in the very way he had seen her do when a child to find a warrant for her words before she uttered them But the full clear steadfast eye into which she looked for two seconds authorized as well as required the promise and hiding her face again on his breast Fleda gave it amid a gush of tears every one of which was illumined with heart sunshine The End End of the Project
