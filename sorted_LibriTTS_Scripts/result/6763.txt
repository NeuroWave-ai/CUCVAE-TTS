EBOOK THE POETICS Produced by Eric Eldred ON THE ART OF POETRY By Aristotle Translated By Ingram Bywater With A Preface By Gilbert Murray Oxford At The Clarendon Press First Published nineteen twenty Reprinted nineteen twenty five nineteen twenty eight nineteen thirty two nineteen thirty eight nineteen forty five nineteen forty seven nineteen fifty one nineteen fifty four nineteen fifty nine nineteen sixty two Printed In Great Britain PREFACE In the tenth book of the Republic when Plato has completed his final burning denunciation of Poetry the false Siren the imitator of things which themselves are shadows the ally of all that is low and weak in the soul against that which is high and strong who makes us feed the things we ought to starve and serve the things we ought to rule he ends with a touch of compunction We will give her champions not poets themselves but poet lovers an opportunity to make her defence in plain prose and show that she is not only sweet as we well know but also helpful to society and the life of man and we will listen in a kindly spirit For we shall be gainers I take it if this can be proved Aristotle certainly knew the passage and it looks as if his treatise on poetry was an answer to Plato s challenge Few of the great works of ancient Greek literature are easy reading They nearly all need study and comment and at times help from a good teacher before they yield up their secret And the Poetics cannot be accounted an exception For one thing the treatise is fragmentary It originally consisted of two books one dealing with Tragedy and Epic the other with Comedy and other subjects We possess only the first For another even the book we have seems to be unrevised and unfinished The style though luminous vivid and in its broader division systematic is not that of a book intended for publication Like most of Aristotle s extant writing it suggests the MS of an experienced lecturer full of jottings and adscripts with occasional phrases written carefully out but never revised as a whole for the general reader Even to accomplished scholars the meaning is often obscure as may be seen by a comparison of the three editions recently published in England all the work of savants of the first eminence one or still more strikingly by a study of the long series of misunderstandings and overstatements and corrections which form the history of the Poetics since the Renaissance one Prof Butcher eighteen ninety five and eighteen ninety eight Prof Bywater nineteen oh nine and Prof Margoliouth nineteen eleven But it is of another cause of misunderstanding that I wish principally to speak in this preface The great edition from which the present translation is taken was the fruit of prolonged study by one of the greatest Aristotelians of the nineteenth century and is itself a classic among works of scholarship In the hands of a student who knows even a little Greek the translation backed by the commentary may lead deep into the mind of Aristotle But when the translation is used as it doubtless will be by readers who are quite without the clue provided by a knowledge of the general habits of the Greek language there must arise a number of new difficulties or misconceptions To understand a great foreign book by means of a translation is possible enough where the two languages concerned operate with a common stock of ideas and belong to the same period of civilization But between ancient Greece and modern England there yawn immense gulfs of human history the establishment and the partial failure of a common European religion the barbarian invasions the feudal system the regrouping of modern Europe the age of mechanical invention and the industrial revolution In an average page of French or German philosophy nearly all the nouns can be translated directly into exact equivalents in English but in Greek that is not so Scarcely one in ten of the nouns on the first few pages of the Poetics has an exact English equivalent Every proposition has to be reduced to its lowest terms of thought and then re built This is a difficulty which no translation can quite deal with it must be left to a teacher who knows Greek And there is a kindred difficulty which flows from it Where words can be translated into equivalent words the style of an original can be closely followed but no translation which aims at being written in normal English can reproduce the style of Aristotle I have sometimes played with the idea that a ruthlessly literal translation helped out by bold punctuation might be the best For instance premising that the words poesis poetes mean originally making and maker one might translate the first paragraph of the Poetics thus MAKING kinds of making function of each and how the Myths ought to be put together if the Making is to go right Number of parts nature of parts rest of same inquiry Begin in order of nature from first principles Epos making tragedy making also comedy dithyramb making and most fluting and harping taken as a whole are really not Makings but Imitations They differ in three points they imitate a different objects b by different means c differently i e different manner Some artists imitate i e depict by shapes and colours Obs sometimes by art sometimes by habit Some by voice Similarly the above arts all imitate by rhythm language and tune and these either one separate or two mixed Rhythm and tune alone harping fluting and other arts with same effect e g panpipes Rhythm without tune dancing Dancers imitate characters emotions and experiences by means of rhythms expressed in form Language alone whether prose or verse and one form of verse or many this art has no name up to the present i e there is no name to cover mimes and dialogues and any similar imitation made in iambics elegiacs c Commonly people attach the making to the metre and say elegiac makers hexameter makers giving them a common class name by their metre as if it was not their imitation that makes them makers Such an experiment would doubtless be a little absurd but it would give an English reader some help in understanding both Aristotle s style and his meaning For example their enlightenment in the literal phrase how the myths ought to be put together The higher Greek poetry did not make up fictitious plots its business was to express the heroic saga the myths Again the literal translation of poetes poet as maker helps to explain a term that otherwise seems a puzzle in the Poetics If we wonder why Aristotle and Plato before him should lay such stress on the theory that art is imitation it is a help to realize that common language called it making and it was clearly not making in the ordinary sense The poet who was maker of a Fall of Troy clearly did not make the real Fall of Troy He made an imitation Fall of Troy An artist who painted Pericles really made an imitation Pericles by means of shapes and colours Hence we get started upon a theory of art which whether finally satisfactory or not is of immense importance and are saved from the error of complaining that Aristotle did not understand the creative power of art As a rule no doubt the difficulty even though merely verbal lies beyond the reach of so simple a tool as literal translation To say that tragedy imitates good men while comedy imitates bad men strikes a modern reader as almost meaningless The truth is that neither good nor bad is an exact equivalent of the Greek It would be nearer perhaps to say that relatively speaking you look up to the characters of tragedy and down upon those of comedy High or low serious or trivial many other pairs of words would have to be called in in order to cover the wide range of the common Greek words And the point is important because we have to consider whether in Chapter VI Aristotle really lays it down that tragedy so far from being the story of un happiness that we think it is properly an imitation of eudaimonia a word often translated happiness but meaning something more like high life or blessedness one one See Margoliouth p one hundred twenty one By water with most editors emends the text Another difficult word which constantly recurs in the Poetics is prattein or praxis generally translated to act or action But prattein like our do also has an intransitive meaning to fare either well or ill and Professor Margoliouth has pointed out that it seems more true to say that tragedy shows how men fare than how they act It shows their experiences or fortunes rather than merely their deeds But one must not draw the line too bluntly I should doubt whether a classical Greek writer was ordinarily conscious of the distinction between the two meanings Certainly it is easier to regard happiness as a way of faring than as a form of action Yet Aristotle can use the passive of prattein for things done or gone through e g fifty twoa twenty two twenty nine fifty fivea twenty five The fact is that much misunderstanding is often caused by our modern attempts to limit too strictly the meaning of a Greek word Greek was very much a live language and a language still unconscious of grammar not like ours dominated by definitions and trained upon dictionaries An instance is provided by Aristotle s famous saying that the typical tragic hero is one who falls from high state or fame not through vice or depravity but by some great hamartia Hamartia means originally a bad shot or error but is currently used for offence or sin Aristotle clearly means that the typical hero is a great man with something wrong in his life or character but I think it is a mistake of method to argue whether he means an intellectual error or a moral flaw The word is not so precise Similarly when Aristotle says that a deed of strife or disaster is more tragic when it occurs amid affections or among people who love each other no doubt the phrase as Aristotle s own examples show would primarily suggest to a Greek feuds between near relations Yet some of the meaning is lost if one translates simply within the family There is another series of obscurities or confusions in the Poetics which unless I am mistaken arises from the fact that Aristotle was writing at a time when the great age of Greek tragedy was long past and was using language formed in previous generations The words and phrases remained in the tradition but the forms of art and activity which they denoted had sometimes changed in the interval If we date the Poetics about the year three hundred thirty B C as seems probable that is more than two hundred years after the first tragedy of Thespis was produced in Athens and more than seventy after the death of the last great masters of the tragic stage When we remember that a training in music and poetry formed a prominent part of the education of every wellborn Athenian we cannot be surprised at finding in Aristotle and to a less extent in Plato considerable traces of a tradition of technical language and even of aesthetic theory It is doubtless one of Aristotle s great services that he conceived so clearly the truth that literature is a thing that grows and has a history But no writer certainly no ancient writer is always vigilant Sometimes Aristotle analyses his terms but very often he takes them for granted and in the latter case I think he is sometimes deceived by them Thus there seem to be cases where he has been affected in his conceptions of fifth century tragedy by the practice of his own day when the only living form of drama was the New Comedy For example as we have noticed above true Tragedy had always taken its material from the sacred myths or heroic sagas which to the classical Greek constituted history But the New Comedy was in the habit of inventing its plots Consequently Aristotle falls into using the word mythos practically in the sense of plot and writing otherwise in a way that is unsuited to the tragedy of the fifth century He says that tragedy adheres to the historical names for an aesthetic reason because what has happened is obviously possible and therefore convincing The real reason was that the drama and the myth were simply two different expressions of the same religious kernel p forty four Again he says of the Chorus p sixty five that it should be an integral part of the play which is true but he also says that it should be regarded as one of the actors which shows to what an extent the Chorus in his day was dead and its technique forgotten He had lost the sense of what the Chorus was in the hands of the great masters say in the Bacchae or the Eumenides He mistakes again the use of that epiphany of a God which is frequent at the end of the single plays of Euripides and which seems to have been equally so at the end of the trilogies of Aeschylus Having lost the living tradition he sees neither the ritual origin nor the dramatic value of these divine epiphanies He thinks of the convenient gods and abstractions who sometimes spoke the prologues of the New Comedy and imagines that the God appears in order to unravel the plot As a matter of fact in one play which he often quotes the Iphigenia Taurica the plot is actually distorted at the very end in order to give an opportunity for the epiphany one one See my Euripides and his Age pp two hundred twenty one forty five One can see the effect of the tradition also in his treatment of the terms Anagnorisis and Peripeteia which Professor Bywater translates as Discovery and Peripety and Professor Butcher as Recognition and Reversal of Fortune Aristotle assumes that these two elements are normally present in any tragedy except those which he calls simple we may say roughly in any tragedy that really has a plot This strikes a modern reader as a very arbitrary assumption Reversals of Fortune of some sort are perhaps usual in any varied plot but surely not Recognitions The clue to the puzzle lies it can scarcely be doubted in the historical origin of tragedy Tragedy according to Greek tradition is originally the ritual play of Dionysus performed at his festival and representing as Herodotus tells us the sufferings or passion of that God We are never directly told what these sufferings were which were so represented but Herodotus remarks that he found in Egypt a ritual that was in almost all points the same one This was the well known ritual of Osiris in which the god was torn in pieces lamented searched for discovered or recognized and the mourning by a sudden Reversal turned into joy In any tragedy which still retained the stamp of its Dionysiac origin this Discovery and Peripety might normally be expected to occur and to occur together I have tried to show elsewhere how many of our extant tragedies do as a matter of fact show the marks of this ritual two one Cf Hdt ii forty eight cf forty two thousand one hundred forty four The name of Dionysus must not be openly mentioned in connexion with mourning ib sixty one one hundred thirty two eighty six This may help to explain the transference of the tragic shows to other heroes two In Miss Harrison s Themis pp three hundred forty one sixty three I hope it is not rash to surmise that the much debated word katharsis purification or purgation may have come into Aristotle s mouth from the same source It has all the appearance of being an old word which is accepted and re interpreted by Aristotle rather than a word freely chosen by him to denote the exact phenomenon he wishes to describe At any rate the Dionysus ritual itself was a katharmos or katharsis a purification of the community from the taints and poisons of the past year the old contagion of sin and death And the words of Aristotle s definition of tragedy in Chapter VI might have been used in the days of Thespis in a much cruder and less metaphorical sense According to primitive ideas the mimic representation on the stage of incidents arousing pity and fear did act as a katharsis of such passions or sufferings in real life For the word pathemata means sufferings as well as passions It is worth remembering that in the year three hundred sixty one B C during Aristotle s lifetime Greek tragedies were introduced into Rome not on artistic but on superstitious grounds as a katharmos against a pestilence Livy vii two One cannot but suspect that in his account of the purpose of tragedy Aristotle may be using an old traditional formula and consciously or unconsciously investing it with a new meaning much as he has done with the word mythos Apart from these historical causes of misunderstanding a good teacher who uses this book with a class will hardly fail to point out numerous points on which two equally good Greek scholars may well differ in the mere interpretation of the words What for instance are the two natural causes in Chapter IV which have given birth to Poetry Are they as our translator takes them one that man is imitative and two that people delight in imitations Or are they one that man is imitative and people delight in imitations and two the instinct for rhythm as Professor Butcher prefers Is it a creature a thousand miles long or a picture a thousand miles long which raises some trouble in Chapter VII The word zoon means equally picture and animal Did the older poets make their characters speak like statesmen politikoi or merely like ordinary citizens politai while the moderns made theirs like professors of rhetoric Chapter VI p thirty eight cf Margoliouth s note and glossary It may seem as if the large uncertainties which we have indicated detract in a ruinous manner from the value of the Poetics to us as a work of criticism Certainly if any young writer took this book as a manual of rules by which to commence poet he would find himself embarrassed But if the book is properly read not as a dogmatic text book but as a first attempt made by a man of astounding genius to build up in the region of creative art a rational order like that which he established in logic rhetoric ethics politics physics psychology and almost every department of knowledge that existed in his day then the uncertainties become rather a help than a discouragement They give us occasion to think and use our imagination They make us to the best of our powers try really to follow and criticize closely the bold gropings of an extraordinary thinker and it is in this process and not in any mere collection of dogmatic results that we shall find the true value and beauty of the Poetics The book is of permanent value as a mere intellectual achievement as a store of information about Greek literature and as an original or first hand statement of what we may call the classical view of artistic criticism It does not regard poetry as a matter of unanalysed inspiration it makes no concession to personal whims or fashion or ennui It tries by rational methods to find out what is good in art and what makes it good accepting the belief that there is just as truly a good way and many bad ways in poetry as in morals or in playing billiards This is no place to try to sum up its main conclusions But it is characteristic of the classical view that Aristotle lays his greatest stress first on the need for Unity in the work of art the need that each part should subserve the whole while irrelevancies however brilliant in themselves should be cast away and next on the demand that great art must have for its subject the great way of living These judgements have often been misunderstood but the truth in them is profound and goes near to the heart of things Characteristic too is the observation that different kinds of art grow and develop but not indefinitely they develop until they attain their natural form also the rule that each form of art should produce not every sort of pleasure but its proper pleasure and the sober language in which Aristotle instead of speaking about the sequence of events in a tragedy being inevitable as we bombastic moderns do merely recommends that they should be either necessary or probable and appear to happen because of one another Conceptions and attitudes of mind such as these constitute what we may call the classical faith in matters of art and poetry a faith which is never perhaps fully accepted in any age yet unlike others is never forgotten but lives by being constantly criticized re asserted and rebelled against For the fashions of the ages vary in this direction and that but they vary for the most part from a central road which was struck out by the imagination of Greece G M ARISTOTLE ON THE ART OF POETRY one Our subject being Poetry I propose to speak not only of the art in general but also of its species and their respective capacities of the structure of plot required for a good poem of the number and nature of the constituent parts of a poem and likewise of any other matters in the same line of inquiry Let us follow the natural order and begin with the primary facts Epic poetry and Tragedy as also Comedy Dithyrambic poetry and most flute playing and lyre playing are all viewed as a whole modes of imitation But at the same time they differ from one another in three ways either by a difference of kind in their means or by differences in the objects or in the manner of their imitations I Just as form and colour are used as means by some who whether by art or constant practice imitate and portray many things by their aid and the voice is used by others so also in the above mentioned group of arts the means with them as a whole are rhythm language and harmony used however either singly or in certain combinations A combination of rhythm and harmony alone is the means in flute playing and lyre playing and any other arts there may be of the same description e g imitative piping Rhythm alone without harmony is the means in the dancer s imitations for even he by the rhythms of his attitudes may represent men s characters as well as what they do and suffer There is further an art which imitates by language alone without harmony in prose or in verse and if in verse either in some one or in a plurality of metres This form of imitation is to this day without a name We have no common name for a mime of Sophron or Xenarchus and a Socratic Conversation and we should still be without one even if the imitation in the two instances were in trimeters or elegiacs or some other kind of verse though it is the way with people to tack on poet to the name of a metre and talk of elegiac poets and epic poets thinking that they call them poets not by reason of the imitative nature of their work but indiscriminately by reason of the metre they write in Even if a theory of medicine or physical philosophy be put forth in a metrical form it is usual to describe the writer in this way Homer and Empedocles however have really nothing in common apart from their metre so that if the one is to be called a poet the other should be termed a physicist rather than a poet We should be in the same position also if the imitation in these instances were in all the metres like the Centaur a rhapsody in a medley of all metres of Chaeremon and Chaeremon one has to recognize as a poet So much then as to these arts There are lastly certain other arts which combine all the means enumerated rhythm melody and verse e g Dithyrambic and Nomic poetry Tragedy and Comedy with this difference however that the three kinds of means are in some of them all employed together and in others brought in separately one after the other These elements of difference in the above arts I term the means of their imitation two II The objects the imitator represents are actions with agents who are necessarily either good men or bad the diversities of human character being nearly always derivative from this primary distinction since the line between virtue and vice is one dividing the whole of mankind It follows therefore that the agents represented must be either above our own level of goodness or beneath it or just such as we are in the same way as with the painters the personages of Polygnotus are better than we are those of Pauson worse and those of Dionysius just like ourselves It is clear that each of the above mentioned arts will admit of these differences and that it will become a separate art by representing objects with this point of difference Even in dancing flute playing and lyre playing such diversities are possible and they are also possible in the nameless art that uses language prose or verse without harmony as its means Homer s personages for instance are better than we are Cleophon s are on our own level and those of Hegemon of Thasos the first writer of parodies and Nicochares the author of the Diliad are beneath it The same is true of the Dithyramb and the Nome the personages may be presented in them with the difference exemplified in the of and Argas and in the Cyclopses of Timotheus and Philoxenus This difference it is that distinguishes Tragedy and Comedy also the one would make its personages worse and the other better than the men of the present day three III A third difference in these arts is in the manner in which each kind of object is represented Given both the same means and the same kind of object for imitation one may either one speak at one moment in narrative and at another in an assumed character as Homer does or two one may remain the same throughout without any such change or three the imitators may represent the whole story dramatically as though they were actually doing the things described As we said at the beginning therefore the differences in the imitation of these arts come under three heads their means their objects and their manner So that as an imitator Sophocles will be on one side akin to Homer both portraying good men and on another to Aristophanes since both present their personages as acting and doing This in fact according to some is the reason for plays being termed dramas because in a play the personages act the story Hence too both Tragedy and Comedy are claimed by the Dorians as their discoveries Comedy by the Megarians by those in Greece as having arisen when Megara became a democracy and by the Sicilian Megarians on the ground that the poet Epicharmus was of their country and a good deal earlier than Chionides and Magnes even Tragedy also is claimed by certain of the Peloponnesian Dorians In support of this claim they point to the words comedy and drama Their word for the outlying hamlets they say is comae whereas Athenians call them demes thus assuming that comedians got the name not from their comoe or revels but from their strolling from hamlet to hamlet lack of appreciation keeping them out of the city Their word also for to act they say is dran whereas Athenians use prattein So much then as to the number and nature of the points of difference in the imitation of these arts four It is clear that the general origin of poetry was due to two causes each of them part of human nature Imitation is natural to man from childhood one of his advantages over the lower animals being this that he is the most imitative creature in the world and learns at first by imitation And it is also natural for all to delight in works of imitation The truth of this second point is shown by experience though the objects themselves may be painful to see we delight to view the most realistic representations of them in art the forms for example of the lowest animals and of dead bodies The explanation is to be found in a further fact to be learning something is the greatest of pleasures not only to the philosopher but also to the rest of mankind however small their capacity for it the reason of the delight in seeing the picture is that one is at the same time learning gathering the meaning of things e g that the man there is so and so for if one has not seen the thing before one s pleasure will not be in the picture as an imitation of it but will be due to the execution or colouring or some similar cause Imitation then being natural to us as also the sense of harmony and rhythm the metres being obviously species of rhythms it was through their original aptitude and by a series of improvements for the most part gradual on their first efforts that they created poetry out of their improvisations Poetry however soon broke up into two kinds according to the differences of character in the individual poets for the graver among them would represent noble actions and those of noble personages and the meaner sort the actions of the ignoble The latter class produced invectives at first just as others did hymns and panegyrics We know of no such poem by any of the pre Homeric poets though there were probably many such writers among them instances however may be found from Homer downwards e g his Margites and the similar poems of others In this poetry of invective its natural fitness brought an iambic metre into use hence our present term iambic because it was the metre of their iambs or invectives against one another The result was that the old poets became some of them writers of heroic and others of iambic verse Homer s position however is peculiar just as he was in the serious style the poet of poets standing alone not only through the literary excellence but also through the dramatic character of his imitations so too he was the first to outline for us the general forms of Comedy by producing not a dramatic invective but a dramatic picture of the Ridiculous his Margites in fact stands in the same relation to our comedies as the Iliad and Odyssey to our tragedies As soon however as Tragedy and Comedy appeared in the field those naturally drawn to the one line of poetry became writers of comedies instead of iambs and those naturally drawn to the other writers of tragedies instead of epics because these new modes of art were grander and of more esteem than the old If it be asked whether Tragedy is now all that it need be in its formative elements to consider that and decide it theoretically and in relation to the theatres is a matter for another inquiry It certainly began in improvisations as did also Comedy the one originating with the authors of the Dithyramb the other with those of the phallic songs which still survive as institutions in many of our cities And its advance after that was little by little through their improving on whatever they had before them at each stage It was in fact only after a long series of changes that the movement of Tragedy stopped on its attaining to its natural form one The number of actors was first increased to two by Aeschylus who curtailed the business of the Chorus and made the dialogue or spoken portion take the leading part in the play two A third actor and scenery were due to Sophocles three Tragedy acquired also its magnitude Discarding short stories and a ludicrous diction through its passing out of its satyric stage it assumed though only at a late point in its progress a tone of dignity and its metre changed then from trochaic to iambic The reason for their original use of the trochaic tetrameter was that their poetry was satyric and more connected with dancing than it now is As soon however as a spoken part came in nature herself found the appropriate metre The iambic we know is the most speakable of metres as is shown by the fact that we very often fall into it in conversation whereas we rarely talk hexameters and only when we depart from the speaking tone of voice four Another change was a plurality of episodes or acts As for the remaining matters the superadded embellishments and the account of their introduction these must be taken as said as it would probably be a long piece of work to go through the details five As for Comedy it is as has been observed an imitation of men worse than the average worse however not as regards any and every sort of fault but only as regards one particular kind the Ridiculous which is a species of the Ugly The Ridiculous may be defined as a mistake or deformity not productive of pain or harm to others the mask for instance that excites laughter is something ugly and distorted without causing pain Though the successive changes in Tragedy and their authors are not unknown we cannot say the same of Comedy its early stages passed unnoticed because it was not as yet taken up in a serious way It was only at a late point in its progress that a chorus of comedians was officially granted by the archon they used to be mere volunteers It had also already certain definite forms at the time when the record of those termed comic poets begins Who it was who supplied it with masks or prologues or a plurality of actors and the like has remained unknown The invented Fable or Plot however originated in Sicily with Epicharmus and Phormis of Athenian poets Crates was the first to drop the Comedy of invective and frame stories of a general and non personal nature in other words Fables or Plots Epic poetry then has been seen to agree with Tragedy to this extent that of being an imitation of serious subjects in a grand kind of verse It differs from it however one in that it is in one kind of verse and in narrative form and two in its length which is due to its action having no fixed limit of time whereas Tragedy endeavours to keep as far as possible within a single circuit of the sun or something near that This I say is another point of difference between them though at first the practice in this respect was just the same in tragedies as in epic poems They differ also three in their constituents some being common to both and others peculiar to Tragedy hence a judge of good and bad in Tragedy is a judge of that in epic poetry also All the parts of an epic are included in Tragedy but those of Tragedy are not all of them to be found in the Epic six Reserving hexameter poetry and Comedy for consideration hereafter let us proceed now to the discussion of Tragedy before doing so however we must gather up the definition resulting from what has been said A tragedy then is the imitation of an action that is serious and also as having magnitude complete in itself in language with pleasurable accessories each kind brought in separately in the parts of the work in a dramatic not in a narrative form with incidents arousing pity and fear wherewith to accomplish its catharsis of such emotions Here by language with pleasurable accessories I mean that with rhythm and harmony or song superadded and by the kinds separately I mean that some portions are worked out with verse only and others in turn with song I As they act the stories it follows that in the first place the Spectacle or stage appearance of the actors must be some part of the whole and in the second Melody and Diction these two being the means of their imitation Here by Diction I mean merely this the composition of the verses and by Melody what is too completely understood to require explanation But further the subject represented also is an action and the action involves agents who must necessarily have their distinctive qualities both of character and thought since it is from these that we ascribe certain qualities to their actions There are in the natural order of things therefore two causes Character and Thought of their actions and consequently of their success or failure in their lives Now the action that which was done is represented in the play by the Fable or Plot The Fable in our present sense of the term is simply this the combination of the incidents or things done in the story whereas Character is what makes us ascribe certain moral qualities to the agents and Thought is shown in all they say when proving a particular point or it may be enunciating a general truth There are six parts consequently of every tragedy as a whole that is of such or such quality viz a Fable or Plot Characters Diction Thought Spectacle and Melody two of them arising from the means one from the manner and three from the objects of the dramatic imitation and there is nothing else besides these six Of these its formative elements then not a few of the dramatists have made due use as every play one may say admits of Spectacle Character Fable Diction Melody and Thought II The most important of the six is the combination of the incidents of the story Tragedy is essentially an imitation not of persons but of action and life of happiness and misery All human happiness or misery takes the form of action the end for which we live is a certain kind of activity not a quality Character gives us qualities but it is in our actions what we do that we are happy or the reverse In a play accordingly they do not act in order to portray the Characters they include the Characters for the sake of the action So that it is the action in it i e its Fable or Plot that is the end and purpose of the tragedy and the end is everywhere the chief thing Besides this a tragedy is impossible without action but there may be one without Character The tragedies of most of the moderns are characterless a defect common among poets of all kinds and with its counterpart in painting in Zeuxis as compared with Polygnotus for whereas the latter is strong in character the work of Zeuxis is devoid of it And again one may string together a series of characteristic speeches of the utmost finish as regards Diction and Thought and yet fail to produce the true tragic effect but one will have much better success with a tragedy which however inferior in these respects has a Plot a combination of incidents in it And again the most powerful elements of attraction in Tragedy the Peripeties and Discoveries are parts of the Plot A further proof is in the fact that beginners succeed earlier with the Diction and Characters than with the construction of a story and the same may be said of nearly all the early dramatists We maintain therefore that the first essential the life and soul so to speak of Tragedy is the Plot and that the Characters come second compare the parallel in painting where the most beautiful colours laid on without order will not give one the same pleasure as a simple black and white sketch of a portrait We maintain that Tragedy is primarily an imitation of action and that it is mainly for the sake of the action that it imitates the personal agents Third comes the element of Thought i e the power of saying whatever can be said or what is appropriate to the occasion This is what in the speeches in Tragedy falls under the arts of Politics and Rhetoric for the older poets make their personages discourse like statesmen and the moderns like rhetoricians One must not confuse it with Character Character in a play is that which reveals the moral purpose of the agents i e the sort of thing they seek or avoid where that is not obvious hence there is no room for Character in a speech on a purely indifferent subject Thought on the other hand is shown in all they say when proving or disproving some particular point or enunciating some universal proposition Fourth among the literary elements is the Diction of the personages i e as before explained the expression of their thoughts in words which is practically the same thing with verse as with prose As for the two remaining parts the Melody is the greatest of the pleasurable accessories of Tragedy The Spectacle though an attraction is the least artistic of all the parts and has least to do with the art of poetry The tragic effect is quite possible without a public performance and actors and besides the getting up of the Spectacle is more a matter for the costumier than the poet seven Having thus distinguished the parts let us now consider the proper construction of the Fable or Plot as that is at once the first and the most important thing in Tragedy We have laid it down that a tragedy is an imitation of an action that is complete in itself as a whole of some magnitude for a whole may be of no magnitude to speak of Now a whole is that which has beginning middle and end A beginning is that which is not itself necessarily after anything else and which has naturally something else after it an end is that which is naturally after something itself either as its necessary or usual consequent and with nothing else after it and a middle that which is by nature after one thing and has also another after it A well constructed Plot therefore cannot either begin or end at any point one likes beginning and end in it must be of the forms just described Again to be beautiful a living creature and every whole made up of parts must not only present a certain order in its arrangement of parts but also be of a certain definite magnitude Beauty is a matter of size and order and therefore impossible either one in a very minute creature since our perception becomes indistinct as it approaches instantaneity or two in a creature of vast size one say one thousand miles long as in that case instead of the object being seen all at once the unity and wholeness of it is lost to the beholder Just in the same way then as a beautiful whole made up of parts or a beautiful living creature must be of some size a size to be taken in by the eye so a story or Plot must be of some length but of a length to be taken in by the memory As for the limit of its length so far as that is relative to public performances and spectators it does not fall within the theory of poetry If they had to perform a hundred tragedies they would be timed by water clocks as they are said to have been at one period The limit however set by the actual nature of the thing is this the longer the story consistently with its being comprehensible as a whole the finer it is by reason of its magnitude As a rough general formula a length which allows of the hero passing by a series of probable or necessary stages from misfortune to happiness or from happiness to misfortune may suffice as a limit for the magnitude of the story eight The Unity of a Plot does not consist as some suppose in its having one man as its subject An infinity of things befall that one man some of which it is impossible to reduce to unity and in like manner there are many actions of one man which cannot be made to form one action One sees therefore the mistake of all the poets who have written a Heracleid a Theseid or similar poems they suppose that because Heracles was one man the story also of Heracles must be one story Homer however evidently understood this point quite well whether by art or instinct just in the same way as he excels the rest in every other respect In writing an Odyssey he did not make the poem cover all that ever befell his hero it befell him for instance to get wounded on Parnassus and also to feign madness at the time of the call to arms but the two incidents had no probable or necessary connexion with one another instead of doing that he took an action with a Unity of the kind we are describing as the subject of the Odyssey as also of the Iliad The truth is that just as in the other imitative arts one imitation is always of one thing so in poetry the story as an imitation of action must represent one action a complete whole with its several incidents so closely connected that the transposal or withdrawal of any one of them will disjoin and dislocate the whole

none	none	nine From what we have said it will be seen that the poet s function is to describe not the thing that has happened but a kind of thing that might happen i e what is possible as being probable or necessary The distinction between historian and poet is not in the one writing prose and the other verse you might put the work of Herodotus into verse and it would still be a species of history it consists really in this that the one describes the thing that has been and the other a kind of thing that might be Hence poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history since its statements are of the nature rather of universals whereas those of history are singulars By a universal statement I mean one as to what such or such a kind of man will probably or necessarily say or do which is the aim of poetry though it affixes proper names to the characters by a singular statement one as to what say Alcibiades did or had done to him In Comedy this has become clear by this time it is only when their plot is already made up of probable incidents that they give it a basis of proper names choosing for the purpose any names that may occur to them instead of writing like the old iambic poets about particular persons In Tragedy however they still adhere to the historic names and for this reason what convinces is the possible now whereas we are not yet sure as to the possibility of that which has not happened that which has happened is manifestly possible else it would not have come to pass Nevertheless even in Tragedy there are some plays with but one or two known names in them the rest being inventions and there are some without a single known name e g Agathon s Anthens in which both incidents and names are of the poet s invention and it is no less delightful on that account So that one must not aim at a rigid adherence to the traditional stories on which tragedies are based It would be absurd in fact to do so as even the known stories are only known to a few though they are a delight none the less to all It is evident from the above that the poet must be more the poet of his stories or Plots than of his verses inasmuch as he is a poet by virtue of the imitative element in his work and it is actions that he imitates And if he should come to take a subject from actual history he is none the less a poet for that since some historic occurrences may very well be in the probable and possible order of things and it is in that aspect of them that he is their poet Of simple Plots and actions the episodic are the worst I call a Plot episodic when there is neither probability nor necessity in the sequence of episodes Actions of this sort bad poets construct through their own fault and good ones on account of the players His work being for public performance a good poet often stretches out a Plot beyond its capabilities and is thus obliged to twist the sequence of incident Tragedy however is an imitation not only of a complete action but also of incidents arousing pity and fear Such incidents have the very greatest effect on the mind when they occur unexpectedly and at the same time in consequence of one another there is more of the marvellous in them then than if they happened of themselves or by mere chance Even matters of chance seem most marvellous if there is an appearance of design as it were in them as for instance the statue of Mitys at Argos killed the author of Mitys death by falling down on him when a looker on at a public spectacle for incidents like that we think to be not without a meaning A Plot therefore of this sort is necessarily finer than others ten Plots are either simple or complex since the actions they represent are naturally of this twofold description The action proceeding in the way defined as one continuous whole I call simple when the change in the hero s fortunes takes place without Peripety or Discovery and complex when it involves one or the other or both These should each of them arise out of the structure of the Plot itself so as to be the consequence necessary or probable of the antecedents There is a great difference between a thing happening propter hoc and post hoc eleven A Peripety is the change from one state of things within the play to its opposite of the kind described and that too in the way we are saying in the probable or necessary sequence of events as it is for instance in Oedipus here the opposite state of things is produced by the Messenger who coming to gladden Oedipus and to remove his fears as to his mother reveals the secret of his birth And in Lynceus just as he is being led off for execution with Danaus at his side to put him to death the incidents preceding this bring it about that he is saved and Danaus put to death A Discovery is as the very word implies a change from ignorance to knowledge and thus to either love or hate in the personages marked for good or evil fortune The finest form of Discovery is one attended by Peripeties like that which goes with the Discovery in Oedipus There are no doubt other forms of it what we have said may happen in a way in reference to inanimate things even things of a very casual kind and it is also possible to discover whether some one has done or not done something But the form most directly connected with the Plot and the action of the piece is the first mentioned This with a Peripety will arouse either pity or fear actions of that nature being what Tragedy is assumed to represent and it will also serve to bring about the happy or unhappy ending The Discovery then being of persons it may be that of one party only to the other the latter being already known or both the parties may have to discover themselves Iphigenia for instance was discovered to Orestes by sending the letter and another Discovery was required to reveal him to Iphigenia Two parts of the Plot then Peripety and Discovery are on matters of this sort A third part is Suffering which we may define as an action of a destructive or painful nature such as murders on the stage tortures woundings and the like The other two have been already explained twelve The parts of Tragedy to be treated as formative elements in the whole were mentioned in a previous Chapter From the point of view however of its quantity i e the separate sections into which it is divided a tragedy has the following parts Prologue Episode Exode and a choral portion distinguished into Parode and Stasimon these two are common to all tragedies whereas songs from the stage and Commoe are only found in some The Prologue is all that precedes the Parode of the chorus an Episode all that comes in between two whole choral songs the Exode all that follows after the last choral song In the choral portion the Parode is the whole first statement of the chorus a Stasimon a song of the chorus without anapaests or trochees a Commas a lamentation sung by chorus and actor in concert The parts of Tragedy to be used as formative elements in the whole we have already mentioned the above are its parts from the point of view of its quantity or the separate sections into which it is divided thirteen The next points after what we have said above will be these one What is the poet to aim at and what is he to avoid in constructing his Plots and two What are the conditions on which the tragic effect depends We assume that for the finest form of Tragedy the Plot must be not simple but complex and further that it must imitate actions arousing pity and fear since that is the distinctive function of this kind of imitation It follows therefore that there are three forms of Plot to be avoided one A good man must not be seen passing from happiness to misery or two a bad man from misery to happiness The first situation is not fear inspiring or piteous but simply odious to us The second is the most untragic that can be it has no one of the requisites of Tragedy it does not appeal either to the human feeling in us or to our pity or to our fears Nor on the other hand should three an extremely bad man be seen falling from happiness into misery Such a story may arouse the human feeling in us but it will not move us to either pity or fear pity is occasioned by undeserved misfortune and fear by that of one like ourselves so that there will be nothing either piteous or fear inspiring in the situation There remains then the intermediate kind of personage a man not pre eminently virtuous and just whose misfortune however is brought upon him not by vice and depravity but by some error of judgement of the number of those in the enjoyment of great reputation and prosperity e g Oedipus Thyestes and the men of note of similar families The perfect Plot accordingly must have a single and not as some tell us a double issue the change in the hero s fortunes must be not from misery to happiness but on the contrary from happiness to misery and the cause of it must lie not in any depravity but in some great error on his part the man himself being either such as we have described or better not worse than that Fact also confirms our theory Though the poets began by accepting any tragic story that came to hand in these days the finest tragedies are always on the story of some few houses on that of Alemeon Oedipus Orestes Meleager Thyestes Telephus or any others that may have been involved as either agents or sufferers in some deed of horror The theoretically best tragedy then has a Plot of this description The critics therefore are wrong who blame Euripides for taking this line in his tragedies and giving many of them an unhappy ending It is as we have said the right line to take The best proof is this on the stage and in the public performances such plays properly worked out are seen to be the most truly tragic and Euripides even if his elecution be faulty in every other point is seen to be nevertheless the most tragic certainly of the dramatists After this comes the construction of Plot which some rank first one with a double story like the Odyssey and an opposite issue for the good and the bad personages It is ranked as first only through the weakness of the audiences the poets merely follow their public writing as its wishes dictate But the pleasure here is not that of Tragedy It belongs rather to Comedy where the bitterest enemies in the piece e g Orestes and Aegisthus walk off good friends at the end with no slaying of any one by any one fourteen The tragic fear and pity may be aroused by the Spectacle but they may also be aroused by the very structure and incidents of the play which is the better way and shows the better poet The Plot in fact should be so framed that even without seeing the things take place he who simply hears the account of them shall be filled with horror and pity at the incidents which is just the effect that the mere recital of the story in Oedipus would have on one To produce this same effect by means of the Spectacle is less artistic and requires extraneous aid Those however who make use of the Spectacle to put before us that which is merely monstrous and not productive of fear are wholly out of touch with Tragedy not every kind of pleasure should be required of a tragedy but only its own proper pleasure The tragic pleasure is that of pity and fear and the poet has to produce it by a work of imitation it is clear therefore that the causes should be included in the incidents of his story Let us see then what kinds of incident strike one as horrible or rather as piteous In a deed of this description the parties must necessarily be either friends or enemies or indifferent to one another Now when enemy does it on enemy there is nothing to move us to pity either in his doing or in his meditating the deed except so far as the actual pain of the sufferer is concerned and the same is true when the parties are indifferent to one another Whenever the tragic deed however is done within the family when murder or the like is done or meditated by brother on brother by son on father by mother on son or son on mother these are the situations the poet should seek after The traditional stories accordingly must be kept as they are e g the murder of Clytaemnestra by Orestes and of Eriphyle by Alcmeon At the same time even with these there is something left to the poet himself it is for him to devise the right way of treating them Let us explain more clearly what we mean by the right way The deed of horror may be done by the doer knowingly and consciously as in the old poets and in Medea s murder of her children in Euripides Or he may do it but in ignorance of his relationship and discover that afterwards as does the Oedipus in Sophocles Here the deed is outside the play but it may be within it like the act of the Alcmeon in Astydamas or that of the Telegonus in Ulysses Wounded A third possibility is for one meditating some deadly injury to another in ignorance of his relationship to make the discovery in time to draw back These exhaust the possibilities since the deed must necessarily be either done or not done and either knowingly or unknowingly The worst situation is when the personage is with full knowledge on the point of doing the deed and leaves it undone It is odious and also through the absence of suffering untragic hence it is that no one is made to act thus except in some few instances e g Haemon and Creon in Antigone Next after this comes the actual perpetration of the deed meditated A better situation than that however is for the deed to be done in ignorance and the relationship discovered afterwards since there is nothing odious in it and the Discovery will serve to astound us But the best of all is the last what we have in Cresphontes for example where Merope on the point of slaying her son recognizes him in time in Iphigenia where sister and brother are in a like position and in Helle where the son recognizes his mother when on the point of giving her up to her enemy This will explain why our tragedies are restricted as we said just now to such a small number of families It was accident rather than art that led the poets in quest of subjects to embody this kind of incident in their Plots They are still obliged accordingly to have recourse to the families in which such horrors have occurred On the construction of the Plot and the kind of Plot required for Tragedy enough has now been said fifteen In the Characters there are four points to aim at First and foremost that they shall be good There will be an element of character in the play if as has been observed what a personage says or does reveals a certain moral purpose and a good element of character if the purpose so revealed is good Such goodness is possible in every type of personage even in a woman or a slave though the one is perhaps an inferior and the other a wholly worthless being The second point is to make them appropriate The Character before us may be say manly but it is not appropriate in a female Character to be manly or clever The third is to make them like the reality which is not the same as their being good and appropriate in our sense of the term The fourth is to make them consistent and the same throughout even if inconsistency be part of the man before one for imitation as presenting that form of character he should still be consistently inconsistent We have an instance of baseness of character not required for the story in the Menelaus in Orestes of the incongruous and unbefitting in the lamentation of Ulysses in Scylla and in the clever speech of Melanippe and of inconsistency in Iphigenia at Aulis where Iphigenia the suppliant is utterly unlike the later Iphigenia The right thing however is in the Characters just as in the incidents of the play to endeavour always after the necessary or the probable so that whenever such and such a personage says or does such and such a thing it shall be the probable or necessary outcome of his character and whenever this incident follows on that it shall be either the necessary or the probable consequence of it From this one sees to digress for a moment that the Denouement also should arise out of the plot itself arid not depend on a stage artifice as in Medea or in the story of the arrested departure of the Greeks in the Iliad The artifice must be reserved for matters outside the play for past events beyond human knowledge or events yet to come which require to be foretold or announced since it is the privilege of the Gods to know everything There should be nothing improbable among the actual incidents If it be unavoidable however it should be outside the tragedy like the improbability in the Oedipus of Sophocles But to return to the Characters As Tragedy is an imitation of personages better than the ordinary man we in our way should follow the example of good portrait painters who reproduce the distinctive features of a man and at the same time without losing the likeness make him handsomer than he is The poet in like manner in portraying men quick or slow to anger or with similar infirmities of character must know how to represent them as such and at the same time as good men as Agathon and Homer have represented Achilles All these rules one must keep in mind throughout and further those also for such points of stage effect as directly depend on the art of the poet since in these too one may often make mistakes Enough however has been said on the subject in one of our published writings sixteen Discovery in general has been explained already As for the species of Discovery the first to be noted is one the least artistic form of it of which the poets make most use through mere lack of invention Discovery by signs or marks Of these signs some are congenital like the lance head which the Earth born have on them or stars such as Carcinus brings in in his Thyestes others acquired after birth these latter being either marks on the body e g scars or external tokens like necklaces or to take another sort of instance the ark in the Discovery in Tyro Even these however admit of two uses a better and a worse the scar of Ulysses is an instance the Discovery of him through it is made in one way by the nurse and in another by the swineherds A Discovery using signs as a means of assurance is less artistic as indeed are all such as imply reflection whereas one bringing them in all of a sudden as in the Bath story is of a better order Next after these are two Discoveries made directly by the poet which are inartistic for that very reason e g Orestes Discovery of himself in Iphigenia whereas his sister reveals who she is by the letter Orestes is made to say himself what the poet rather than the story demands This therefore is not far removed from the first mentioned fault since he might have presented certain tokens as well Another instance is the shuttle s voice in the Tereus of Sophocles three A third species is Discovery through memory from a man s consciousness being awakened by something seen or heard Thus in The Cyprioe of Dicaeogenes the sight of the picture makes the man burst into tears and in the Tale of Alcinous hearing the harper Ulysses is reminded of the past and weeps the Discovery of them being the result four A fourth kind is Discovery through reasoning e g in The Choephoroe One like me is here there is no one like me but Orestes he therefore must be here Or that which Polyidus the Sophist suggested for Iphigenia since it was natural for Orestes to reflect My sister was sacrificed and I am to be sacrificed like her Or that in the Tydeus of Theodectes I came to find a son and am to die myself Or that in The Phinidae on seeing the place the women inferred their fate that they were to die there since they had also been exposed there five There is too a composite Discovery arising from bad reasoning on the side of the other party An instance of it is in Ulysses the False Messenger he said he should know the bow which he had not seen but to suppose from that that he would know it again as though he had once seen it was bad reasoning six The best of all Discoveries however is that arising from the incidents themselves when the great surprise comes about through a probable incident like that in the Oedipus of Sophocles and also in Iphigenia for it was not improbable that she should wish to have a letter taken home These last are the only Discoveries independent of the artifice of signs and necklaces Next after them come Discoveries through reasoning seventeen At the time when he is constructing his Plots and engaged on the Diction in which they are worked out the poet should remember one to put the actual scenes as far as possible before his eyes In this way seeing everything with the vividness of an eye witness as it were he will devise what is appropriate and be least likely to overlook incongruities This is shown by what was censured in Carcinus the return of Amphiaraus from the sanctuary it would have passed unnoticed if it had not been actually seen by the audience but on the stage his play failed the incongruity of the incident offending the spectators two As far as may be too the poet should even act his story with the very gestures of his personages Given the same natural qualifications he who feels the emotions to be described will be the most convincing distress and anger for instance are portrayed most truthfully by one who is feeling them at the moment Hence it is that poetry demands a man with special gift for it or else one with a touch of madness in him the former can easily assume the required mood and the latter may be actually beside himself with emotion three His story again whether already made or of his own making he should first simplify and reduce to a universal form before proceeding to lengthen it out by the insertion of episodes The following will show how the universal element in Iphigenia for instance may be viewed A certain maiden having been offered in sacrifice and spirited away from her sacrificers into another land where the custom was to sacrifice all strangers to the Goddess she was made there the priestess of this rite Long after that the brother of the priestess happened to come the fact however of the oracle having for a certain reason bidden him go thither and his object in going are outside the Plot of the play On his coming he was arrested and about to be sacrificed when he revealed who he was either as Euripides puts it or as suggested by Polyidus by the not improbable exclamation So I too am doomed to be sacrificed as my sister was and the disclosure led to his salvation This done the next thing after the proper names have been fixed as a basis for the story is to work in episodes or accessory incidents One must mind however that the episodes are appropriate like the fit of madness in Orestes which led to his arrest and the purifying which brought about his salvation In plays then the episodes are short in epic poetry they serve to lengthen out the poem The argument of the Odyssey is not a long one A certain man has been abroad many years Poseidon is ever on the watch for him and he is all alone Matters at home too have come to this that his substance is being wasted and his son s death plotted by suitors to his wife Then he arrives there himself after his grievous sufferings reveals himself and falls on his enemies and the end is his salvation and their death This being all that is proper to the Odyssey everything else in it is episode eighteen four There is a further point to be borne in mind Every tragedy is in part Complication and in part Denouement the incidents before the opening scene and often certain also of those within the play forming the Complication and the rest the Denouement By Complication I mean all from the beginning of the story to the point just before the change in the hero s fortunes by Denouement all from the beginning of the change to the end In the Lynceus of Theodectes for instance the Complication includes together with the presupposed incidents the seizure of the child and that in turn of the parents and the Denouement all from the indictment for the murder to the end Now it is right when one speaks of a tragedy as the same or not the same as another to do so on the ground before all else of their Plot i e as having the same or not the same Complication and Denouement Yet there are many dramatists who after a good Complication fail in the Denouement But it is necessary for both points of construction to be always duly mastered five There are four distinct species of Tragedy that being the number of the constituents also that have been mentioned first the complex Tragedy which is all Peripety and Discovery second the Tragedy of suffering e g the Ajaxes and Ixions third the Tragedy of character e g The Phthiotides and Peleus The fourth constituent is that of Spectacle exemplified in The Phorcides in Prometheus and in all plays with the scene laid in the nether world The poet s aim then should be to combine every element of interest if possible or else the more important and the major part of them This is now especially necessary owing to the unfair criticism to which the poet is subjected in these days Just because there have been poets before him strong in the several species of tragedy the critics now expect the one man to surpass that which was the strong point of each one of his predecessors six One should also remember what has been said more than once and not write a tragedy on an epic body of incident i e one with a plurality of stories in it by attempting to dramatize for instance the entire story of the Iliad In the epic owing to its scale every part is treated at proper length with a drama however on the same story the result is very disappointing This is shown by the fact that all who have dramatized the fall of Ilium in its entirety and not part by part like Euripides or the whole of the Niobe story instead of a portion like Aeschylus either fail utterly or have but ill success on the stage for that and that alone was enough to ruin a play by Agathon Yet in their Peripeties as also in their simple plots the poets I mean show wonderful skill in aiming at the kind of effect they desire a tragic situation that arouses the human feeling in one like the clever villain e g Sisyphus deceived or the brave wrongdoer worsted This is probable however only in Agathon s sense when he speaks of the probability of even improbabilities coming to pass seven The Chorus too should be regarded as one of the actors it should be an integral part of the whole and take a share in the action that which it has in Sophocles rather than in Euripides With the later poets however the songs in a play of theirs have no more to do with the Plot of that than of any other tragedy Hence it is that they are now singing intercalary pieces a practice first introduced by Agathon And yet what real difference is there between singing such intercalary pieces and attempting to fit in a speech or even a whole act from one play into another nineteen The Plot and Characters having been discussed it remains to consider the Diction and Thought As for the Thought we may assume what is said of it in our Art of Rhetoric as it belongs more properly to that department of inquiry The Thought of the personages is shown in everything to be effected by their language in every effort to prove or disprove to arouse emotion pity fear anger and the like or to maximize or minimize things It is clear also that their mental procedure must be on the same lines in their actions likewise whenever they wish them to arouse pity or horror or have a look of importance or probability The only difference is that with the act the impression has to be made without explanation whereas with the spoken word it has to be produced by the speaker and result from his language What indeed would be the good of the speaker if things appeared in the required light even apart from anything he says As regards the Diction one subject for inquiry under this head is the turns given to the language when spoken e g the difference between command and prayer simple statement and threat question and answer and so forth The theory of such matters however belongs to Elocution and the professors of that art Whether the poet knows these things or not his art as a poet is never seriously criticized on that account What fault can one see in Homer s Sing of the wrath Goddess which Protagoras has criticized as being a command where a prayer was meant since to bid one do or not do he tells us is a command Let us pass over this then as appertaining to another art and not to that of poetry twenty 
154_124003_000001_000000	train-clean-360	The Diction viewed as a whole is made up of the following parts the Letter or ultimate element the Syllable the Conjunction the Article the Noun the Verb the Case and the Speech one The Letter is an indivisible sound of a particular kind one that may become a factor in an intelligible sound 
none	none	Indivisible sounds are uttered by the brutes also but no one of these is a Letter in our sense of the term These elementary sounds are either vowels semivowels or mutes A vowel is a Letter having an audible sound without the addition of another Letter A semivowel one having an audible sound by the addition of another Letter e g S and R A mute one having no sound at all by itself but becoming audible by an addition that of one of the Letters which have a sound of some sort of their own e g D and G The Letters differ in various ways as produced by different conformations or in different regions of the mouth as aspirated not aspirated or sometimes one and sometimes the other as long short or of variable quantity and further as having an acute grave or intermediate accent The details of these matters we must leave to the metricians two A Syllable is a nonsignificant composite sound made up of a mute and a Letter having a sound a vowel or semivowel for GR without an A is just as much a Syllable as GRA with an A The various forms of the Syllable also belong to the theory of metre three A Conjunction is a a non significant sound which when one significant sound is formable out of several neither hinders nor aids the union and which if the Speech thus formed stands by itself apart from other Speeches must not be inserted at the beginning of it e g men de toi de Or b a non significant sound capable of combining two or more significant sounds into one e g amphi peri et cetera four An Article is a non significant sound marking the beginning end or dividing point of a Speech its natural place being either at the extremities or in the middle five A Noun or name is a composite significant sound not involving the idea of time with parts which have no significance by themselves in it It is to be remembered that in a compound we do not think of the parts as having a significance also by themselves in the name Theodorus for instance the doron means nothing to us six A Verb is a composite significant sound involving the idea of time with parts which just as in the Noun have no significance by themselves in it Whereas the word man or white does not imply when walks and has walked involve in addition to the idea of walking that of time present or time past seven A Case of a Noun or Verb is when the word means of or to a thing and so forth or for one or many e g man and men or it may consist merely in the mode of utterance e g in question command et cetera Walked and Walk are Cases of the verb to walk of this last kind eight A Speech is a composite significant sound some of the parts of which have a certain significance by themselves It may be observed that a Speech is not always made up of Noun and Verb it may be without a Verb like the definition of man but it will always have some part with a certain significance by itself

given by the poet himself e g for there are some words that seem to be of this origin hernyges for horns and areter for priest A word is said to be lengthened out when it has a short vowel made long or an extra syllable inserted e g polleos for poleos Peleiadeo for Peleidon It is said to be curtailed when it has lost a part e g kri do and ops in mia ginetai amphoteron ops It is an altered word when part is left as it was and part is of the poet s making e g dexiteron for dexion in dexiteron kata maxon The Nouns themselves to whatever class they may belong are either masculines feminines or intermediates neuter All ending in N P S or in the two compounds of this last PS and X are masculines All ending in the invariably long vowels H and O and in A among the vowels that may be long are feminines So that there is an equal number of masculine and feminine terminations as PS and X are the same as S and need not be counted There is no Noun however ending in a mute or in either of the two short vowels E and O Only three meli kommi peperi end in I and five in T The intermediates or neuters end in the variable vowels or in N P X twenty two The perfection of Diction is for it to be at once clear and not mean The clearest indeed is that made up of the ordinary words for things but it is mean as is shown by the poetry of Cleophon and Sthenelus On the other hand the Diction becomes distinguished and non prosaic by the use of unfamiliar terms i e strange words metaphors lengthened forms and everything that deviates from the ordinary modes of speech But a whole statement in such terms will be either a riddle or a barbarism a riddle if made up of metaphors a barbarism if made up of strange words The very nature indeed of a riddle is this to describe a fact in an impossible combination of words which cannot be done with the real names for things but can be with their metaphorical substitutes e g I saw a man glue brass on another with fire and the like The corresponding use of strange words results in a barbarism A certain admixture accordingly of unfamiliar terms is necessary These the strange word the metaphor the ornamental equivalent et cetera will save the language from seeming mean and prosaic while the ordinary words in it will secure the requisite clearness What helps most however to render the Diction at once clear and non prosaic is the use of the lengthened curtailed and altered forms of words Their deviation from the ordinary words will by making the language unlike that in general use give it a non prosaic appearance and their having much in common with the words in general use will give it the quality of clearness It is not right then to condemn these modes of speech and ridicule the poet for using them as some have done e g the elder Euclid who said it was easy to make poetry if one were to be allowed to lengthen the words in the statement itself as much as one likes a procedure he caricatured by reading Epixarhon eidon Marathonade Badi gonta and ouk han g eramenos ton ekeinou helle boron as verses A too apparent use of these licences has certainly a ludicrous effect but they are not alone in that the rule of moderation applies to all the constituents of the poetic vocabulary even with metaphors strange words and the rest the effect will be the same if one uses them improperly and with a view to provoking laughter The proper use of them is a very different thing To realize the difference one should take an epic verse and see how it reads when the normal words are introduced The same should be done too with the strange word the metaphor and the rest for one has only to put the ordinary words in their place to see the truth of what we are saying The same iambic for instance is found in Aeschylus and Euripides and as it stands in the former it is a poor line whereas Euripides by the change of a single word the substitution of a strange for what is by usage the ordinary word has made it seem a fine one Aeschylus having said in his Philoctetes phagedaina he mon sarkas hesthiei podos Euripides has merely altered the hesthiei here into thoinatai Or suppose nun de m heon holigos te kai outidanos kai haeikos to be altered by the substitution of the ordinary words into nun de m heon mikros te kai hasthenikos kai haeidos Or the line diphron haeikelion katatheis olingen te trapexan into diphron moxtheron katatheis mikran te trapexan Or heiones boosin into heiones kraxousin Add to this that Ariphrades used to ridicule the tragedians for introducing expressions unknown in the language of common life doeaton hapo for apo domaton sethen hego de nin Achilleos peri for peri Achilleos and the like The mere fact of their not being in ordinary speech gives the Diction a non prosaic character but Ariphrades was unaware of that It is a great thing indeed to make a proper use of these poetical forms as also of compounds and strange words But the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor It is the one thing that cannot be learnt from others and it is also a sign of genius since a good metaphor implies an intuitive perception of the similarity in dissimilars Of the kinds of words we have enumerated it may be observed that compounds are most in place in the dithyramb strange words in heroic and metaphors in iambic poetry Heroic poetry indeed may avail itself of them all But in iambic verse which models itself as far as possible on the spoken language only those kinds of words are in place which are allowable also in an oration i e the ordinary word the metaphor and the ornamental equivalent Let this then suffice as an account of Tragedy the art imitating by means of action on the stage twenty three As for the poetry which merely narrates or imitates by means of versified language without action it is evident that it has several points in common with Tragedy I The construction of its stories should clearly be like that in a drama they should be based on a single action one that is a complete whole in itself with a beginning middle and end so as to enable the work to produce its own proper pleasure with all the organic unity of a living creature Nor should one suppose that there is anything like them in our usual histories A history has to deal not with one action but with one period and all that happened in that to one or more persons however disconnected the several events may have been Just as two events may take place at the same time e g the sea fight off Salamis and the battle with the Carthaginians in Sicily without converging to the same end so too of two consecutive events one may sometimes come after the other with no one end as their common issue Nevertheless most of our epic poets one may say ignore the distinction Herein then to repeat what we have said before we have a further proof of Homer s marvellous superiority to the rest He did not attempt to deal even with the Trojan war in its entirety though it was a whole with a definite beginning and end through a feeling apparently that it was too long a story to be taken in in one view or if not that too complicated from the variety of incident in it As it is he has singled out one section of the whole many of the other incidents however he brings in as episodes using the Catalogue of the Ships for instance and other episodes to relieve the uniformity of his narrative As for the other epic poets they treat of one man or one period or else of an action which although one has a multiplicity of parts in it This last is what the authors of the Cypria and Little Iliad have done And the result is that whereas the Iliad or Odyssey supplies materials for only one or at most two tragedies the Cypria does that for several and the Little Iliad for more than eight for an Adjudgment of Arms a Philoctetes a Neoptolemus a Eurypylus a Ulysses as Beggar a Laconian Women a Fall of Ilium and a Departure of the Fleet as also a Sinon and Women of Troy twenty four II Besides this Epic poetry must divide into the same species as Tragedy it must be either simple or complex a story of character or one of suffering Its parts too with the exception of Song and Spectacle must be the same as it requires Peripeties Discoveries and scenes of suffering just like Tragedy Lastly the Thought and Diction in it must be good in their way All these elements appear in Homer first and he has made due use of them His two poems are each examples of construction the Iliad simple and a story of suffering the Odyssey complex there is Discovery throughout it and a story of character And they are more than this since in Diction and Thought too they surpass all other poems There is however a difference in the Epic as compared with Tragedy one in its length and two in its metre one As to its length the limit already suggested will suffice it must be possible for the beginning and end of the work to be taken in in one view a condition which will be fulfilled if the poem be shorter than the old epics and about as long as the series of tragedies offered for one hearing For the extension of its length epic poetry has a special advantage of which it makes large use In a play one cannot represent an action with a number of parts going on simultaneously one is limited to the part on the stage and connected with the actors Whereas in epic poetry the narrative form makes it possible for one to describe a number of simultaneous incidents and these if germane to the subject increase the body of the poem This then is a gain to the Epic tending to give it grandeur and also variety of interest and room for episodes of diverse kinds Uniformity of incident by the satiety it soon creates is apt to ruin tragedies on the stage two As for its metre the heroic has been assigned it from experience were any one to attempt a narrative poem in some one or in several of the other metres the incongruity of the thing would be apparent The heroic in fact is the gravest and weightiest of metres which is what makes it more tolerant than the rest of strange words and metaphors that also being a point in which the narrative form of poetry goes beyond all others The iambic and trochaic on the other hand are metres of movement the one representing that of life and action the other that of the dance Still more unnatural would it appear it one were to write an epic in a medley of metres as Chaeremon did Hence it is that no one has ever written a long story in any but heroic verse nature herself as we have said teaches us to select the metre appropriate to such a story Homer admirable as he is in every other respect is especially so in this that he alone among epic poets is not unaware of the part to be played by the poet himself in the poem The poet should say very little in propria persona as he is no imitator when doing that Whereas the other poets are perpetually coming forward in person and say but little and that only here and there as imitators Homer after a brief preface brings in forthwith a man a woman or some other Character no one of them characterless but each with distinctive characteristics The marvellous is certainly required in Tragedy The Epic however affords more opening for the improbable the chief factor in the marvellous because in it the agents are not visibly before one The scene of the pursuit of Hector would be ridiculous on the stage the Greeks halting instead of pursuing him and Achilles shaking his head to stop them but in the poem the absurdity is overlooked The marvellous however is a cause of pleasure as is shown by the fact that we all tell a story with additions in the belief that we are doing our hearers a pleasure Homer more than any other has taught the rest of us the art of framing lies in the right way I mean the use of paralogism Whenever if A is or happens a consequent B is or happens men s notion is that if the B is the A also is but that is a false conclusion Accordingly if A is untrue but there is something else B that on the assumption of its truth follows as its consequent the right thing then is to add on the B Just because we know the truth of the consequent we are in our own minds led on to the erroneous inference of the truth of the antecedent Here is an instance from the Bath story in the Odyssey A likely impossibility is always preferable to an unconvincing possibility The story should never be made up of improbable incidents there should be nothing of the sort in it If however such incidents are unavoidable they should be outside the piece like the hero s ignorance in Oedipus of the circumstances of Lams death not within it like the report of the Pythian games in Electra or the man s having come to Mysia from Tegea without uttering a word on the way in The Mysians So that it is ridiculous to say that one s Plot would have been spoilt without them since it is fundamentally wrong to make up such Plots If the poet has taken such a Plot however and one sees that he might have put it in a more probable form he is guilty of absurdity as well as a fault of art Even in the Odyssey the improbabilities in the setting ashore of Ulysses would be clearly intolerable in the hands of an inferior poet As it is the poet conceals them his other excellences veiling their absurdity Elaborate Diction however is required only in places where there is no action and no Character or Thought to be revealed Where there is Character or Thought on the other hand an over ornate Diction tends to obscure them twenty five As regards Problems and their Solutions one may see the number and nature of the assumptions on which they proceed by viewing the matter in the following way one The poet being an imitator just like the painter or other maker of likenesses he must necessarily in all instances represent things in one or other of three aspects either as they were or are or as they are said or thought to be or to have been or as they ought to be two All this he does in language with an admixture it may be of strange words and metaphors as also of the various modified forms of words since the use of these is conceded in poetry three It is to be remembered too that there is not the same kind of correctness in poetry as in politics or indeed any other art There is however within the limits of poetry itself a possibility of two kinds of error the one directly the other only accidentally connected with the art If the poet meant to describe the thing correctly and failed through lack of power of expression his art itself is at fault But if it was through his having meant to describe it in some incorrect way e g to make the horse in movement have both right legs thrown forward that the technical error one in a matter of say medicine or some other special science or impossibilities of whatever kind they may be have got into his description his error in that case is not in the essentials of the poetic art These therefore must be the premisses of the Solutions in answer to the criticisms involved in the Problems I As to the criticisms relating to the poet s art itself Any impossibilities there may be in his descriptions of things are faults But from another point of view they are justifiable if they serve the end of poetry itself if to assume what we have said of that end they make the effect of some portion of the work more astounding The Pursuit of Hector is an instance in point If however the poetic end might have been as well or better attained without sacrifice of technical correctness in such matters the impossibility is not to be justified since the description should be if it can entirely free from error One may ask too whether the error is in a matter directly or only accidentally connected with the poetic art since it is a lesser error in an artist not to know for instance that the hind has no horns than to produce an unrecognizable picture of one II If the poet s description be criticized as not true to fact one may urge perhaps that the object ought to be as described an answer like that of Sophocles who said that he drew men as they ought to be and Euripides as they were If the description however be neither true nor of the thing as it ought to be the answer must be then that it is in accordance with opinion The tales about Gods for instance may be as wrong as Xenophanes thinks neither true nor the better thing to say but they are certainly in accordance with opinion Of other statements in poetry one may perhaps say not that they are better than the truth but that the fact was so at the time e g the description of the arms their spears stood upright butt end upon the ground for that was the usual way of fixing them then as it is still with the Illyrians As for the question whether something said or done in a poem is morally right or not in dealing with that one should consider not only the intrinsic quality of the actual word or deed but also the person who says or does it the person to whom he says or does it the time the means and the motive of the agent whether he does it to attain a greater good or to avoid a greater evil III Other criticisms one must meet by considering the language of the poet one by the assumption of a strange word in a passage like oureas men proton where by oureas Homer may perhaps mean not mules but sentinels And in saying of Dolon hos p e toi eidos men heen kakos his meaning may perhaps be not that Dolon s body was deformed but that his face was ugly as eneidos is the Cretan word for handsome faced So too goroteron de keraie may mean not mix the wine stronger as though for topers but mix it quicker two Other expressions in Homer may be explained as metaphorical e g in halloi men ra theoi te kai aneres eudon hapantes pannux as compared with what he tells us at the same time e toi hot hes pedion to Troikon hathreseien aulon suriggon te homadon the word hapantes all is metaphorically put for many since all is a species of many So also his oie d ammoros is metaphorical the best known standing alone three A change as Hippias suggested in the mode of reading a word will solve the difficulty in didomen de oi and to men ou kataputhetai hombro four Other difficulties may be solved by another punctuation e g in Empedocles aipsa de thnet ephyonto ta prin mathon athanata xora te prin kekreto Or five by the assumption of an equivocal term as in parocheken de pleo nux where pleo in equivocal Or six by an appeal to the custom of language Wine and water we call wine and it is on the same principle that Homer speaks of a knemis neoteuktou kassiteroio a greave of new wrought tin A worker in iron we call a brazier and it is on the same principle that Ganymede is described as the wine server of Zeus though the Gods do not drink wine This latter however may be an instance of metaphor But whenever also a word seems to imply some contradiction it is necessary to reflect how many ways there may be of understanding it in the passage in question e g in Homer s te r hesxeto xalkeon hegxos one should consider the possible senses of was stopped there whether by taking it in this sense or in that one will best avoid the fault of which Glaucon speaks They start with some improbable presumption and having so decreed it themselves proceed to draw inferences and censure the poet as though he had actually said whatever they happen to believe if his statement conflicts with their own notion of things This is how Homer s silence about Icarius has been treated Starting with the notion of his having been a Lacedaemonian the critics think it strange for Telemachus not to have met him when he went to Lacedaemon Whereas the fact may have been as the Cephallenians say that the wife of Ulysses was of a Cephallenian family and that her father s name was Icadius not Icarius So that it is probably a mistake of the critics that has given rise to the Problem Speaking generally one has to justify one the Impossible by reference to the requirements of poetry or to the better or to opinion For the purposes of poetry a convincing impossibility is preferable to an unconvincing possibility and if men such as Zeuxis depicted be impossible the answer is that it is better they should be like that as the artist ought to improve on his model two The Improbable one has to justify either by showing it to be in accordance with opinion or by urging that at times it is not improbable for there is a probability of things happening also against probability three The contradictions found in the poet s language one should first test as one does an opponent s confutation in a dialectical argument so as to see whether he means the same thing in the same relation and in the same sense before admitting that he has contradicted either something he has said himself or what a man of sound sense assumes as true But there is no possible apology for improbability of Plot or depravity of character when they are not necessary and no use is made of them like the improbability in the appearance of Aegeus in Medea and the baseness of Menelaus in Orestes The objections then of critics start with faults of five kinds the allegation is always that something in either one impossible two improbable three corrupting four contradictory or five against technical correctness The answers to these objections must be sought under one or other of the above mentioned heads which are twelve in number twenty six The question may be raised whether the epic or the tragic is the higher form of imitation It may be argued that if the less vulgar is the higher and the less vulgar is always that which addresses the better public an art addressing any and every one is of a very vulgar order It is a belief that their public cannot see the meaning unless they add something themselves that causes the perpetual movements of the performers bad flute players for instance rolling about if quoit throwing is to be represented and pulling at the conductor if Scylla is the subject of the piece Tragedy then is said to be an art of this order to be in fact just what the later actors were in the eyes of their predecessors for Myrmiscus used to call Callippides the ape because he thought he so overacted his parts and a similar view was taken of Pindarus also All Tragedy however is said to stand to the Epic as the newer to the older school of actors The one accordingly is said to address a cultivated audience which does not need the accompaniment of gesture the other an uncultivated one If therefore Tragedy is a vulgar art it must clearly be lower than the Epic The answer to this is twofold In the first place one may urge one that the censure does not touch the art of the dramatic poet but only that of his interpreter for it is quite possible to overdo the gesturing even in an epic recital as did Sosistratus and in a singing contest as did Mnasitheus of Opus two That one should not condemn all movement unless one means to condemn even the dance but only that of ignoble people which is the point of the criticism passed on Callippides and in the present day on others that their women are not like gentlewomen three That Tragedy may produce its effect even without movement or action in just the same way as Epic poetry for from the mere reading of a play its quality may be seen So that if it be superior in all other respects this element of inferiority is not a necessary part of it In the second place one must remember one that Tragedy has everything that the Epic has even the epic metre being admissible together with a not inconsiderable addition in the shape of the Music a very real factor in the pleasure of the drama and the Spectacle two That its reality of presentation is felt in the play as read as well as in the play as acted three That the tragic imitation requires less space for the attainment of its end which is a great advantage since the more concentrated effect is more pleasurable than one with a large admixture of time to dilute it consider the Oedipus of Sophocles for instance and the effect of expanding it into the number of lines of the Iliad four That there is less unity in the imitation of the epic poets as is proved by the fact that any one work of theirs supplies matter for several tragedies the result being that if they take what is really a single story it seems curt when briefly told and thin and waterish when on the scale of length usual with their verse In saying that there is less unity in an epic I mean an epic made up of a plurality of actions in the same way as the Iliad and Odyssey have many such parts each one of them in itself of some magnitude yet the structure of the two Homeric poems is as perfect as can be and the action in them is as nearly as possible one action If then Tragedy is superior in these respects and also besides these in its poetic effect since the two forms of poetry should give us not any or every pleasure but the very special kind we have mentioned it is clear that as attaining the poetic effect better than the Epic it will be the higher form of art So much for Tragedy and Epic poetry for these two arts in general and their species the number and nature of their constituent parts the causes of success and failure in them the Objections of the critics and the Solutions in
