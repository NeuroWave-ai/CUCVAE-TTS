of Olympus that of Beethoven climbs shuddering the storm beaten sides of a Sinai Blessed be they both Each represents a moment of the ideal life each does us good Our love is due to both Self interest is but the survival of the animal in us Humanity only begins for man with self surrender MAY twenty sevenTH eighteen fifty seven Wagner s is a powerful mind endowed with strong poetical sensitiveness His work is even more poetical than musical The suppression of the lyrical element and therefore of melody is with him a systematic parti pris No more duos or trios monologue and the aria are alike done away with There remains only declamation the recitative and the choruses In order to avoid the conventional in singing Wagner falls into another convention that of not singing at all He subordinates the voice to articulate speech and for fear lest the muse should take flight he clips her wings so that his works are rather symphonic dramas than operas The voice is brought down to the rank of an instrument put on a level with the violins the hautboys and the drums and treated instrumentally Man is deposed from his superior position and the centre of gravity of the work passes into the baton of the conductor It is music depersonalized neo Hegelian music music multiple instead of individual If this is so it is indeed the music of the future the music of the socialist democracy replacing the art which is aristocratic heroic or subjective DECEMBER fourTH eighteen sixty three The whole secret of remaining young in spite of years and even of gray hairs is to cherish enthusiasm in one s self by poetry by contemplation by charity that is in fewer words by the maintenance of harmony in the soul APRIL twelveTH eighteen fifty eight The era of equality means the triumph of mediocrity It is disappointing but inevitable for it is one of time s revenges Art no doubt will lose but justice will gain Is not universal leveling down the law of nature The world is striving with all its force for the destruction of what it has itself brought forth MARCH oneST eighteen sixty nine From the point of view of the ideal humanity is triste and ugly But if we compare it with its probable origins we see that the human race has not altogether wasted its time Hence there are three possible views of history the view of the pessimist who starts from the ideal the view of the optimist who compares the past with the present and the view of the hero worshiper who sees that all progress whatever has cost oceans of blood and tears AUGUST thirty oneST eighteen sixty nine I have finished Schopenhauer My mind has been a tumult of opposing systems Stoicism Quietism Buddhism Christianity Shall I never be at peace with myself If impersonality is a good why am I not consistent in the pursuit of it and if it is a temptation why return to it after having judged and conquered it Is happiness anything more than a conventional fiction The deepest reason for my state of doubt is that the supreme end and aim of life seems to me a mere lure and deception The individual is an eternal dupe who never obtains what he seeks and who is forever deceived by hope My instinct is in harmony with the pessimism of Buddha and of Schopenhauer It is a doubt which never leaves me even in my moments of religious fervor Nature is indeed for me a Maia and I look at her as it were with the eyes of an artist My intelligence remains skeptical What then do I believe in I do not know And what is it I hope for It would be difficult to say Folly I believe in goodness and I hope that good will prevail Deep within this ironical and disappointed being of mine there is a child hidden a frank sad simple creature who believes in the ideal in love in holiness and all heavenly superstitions A whole millennium of idyls sleeps in my heart I am a pseudo skeptic a pseudo scoffer Borne dans sa nature infini dans ses voeux L homme est un dieu tombe qui se souvient des cieux MARCH seventeenTH eighteen seventy This morning the music of a brass band which had stopped under my windows moved me almost to tears It exercised an indefinable nostalgic power over me it set me dreaming of another world of infinite passion and supreme happiness Such impressions are the echoes of Paradise in the soul memories of ideal spheres whose sad sweetness ravishes and intoxicates the heart O Plato O Pythagoras ages ago you heard these harmonies surprised these moments of inward ecstasy knew these divine transports If music thus carries us to heaven it is because music is harmony harmony is perfection perfection is our dream and our dream is heaven APRIL oneST eighteen seventy I am inclined to believe that for a woman love is the supreme authority that which judges the rest and decides what is good or evil For a man love is subordinate to right It is a great passion but it is not the source of order the synonym of reason the criterion of excellence It would seem then that a woman places her ideal in the perfection of love and a man in the perfection of justice JUNE fiveTH eighteen seventy The efficacy of religion lies precisely in that which is not rational philosophic nor eternal its efficacy lies in the unforeseen the miraculous the extraordinary Thus religion attracts more devotion in proportion as it demands more faith that is to say as it becomes more incredible to the profane mind The philosopher aspires to explain away all mysteries to dissolve them into light It is mystery on the other hand which the religious instinct demands and pursues it is mystery which constitutes the essence of worship the power of proselytism When the cross became the foolishness of the cross it took possession of the masses And in our own day those who wish to get rid of the supernatural to enlighten religion to economize faith find themselves deserted like poets who should declaim against poetry or women who should decry love Faith consists in the acceptance of the incomprehensible and even in the pursuit of the impossible and is self intoxicated with its own sacrifices its own repeated extravagances It is the forgetfulness of this psychological law which stultifies the so called liberal Christianity It is the realization of it which constitutes the strength of Catholicism Apparently no positive religion can survive the supernatural element which is the reason for its existence Natural religion seems to be the tomb of all historic cults All concrete religions die eventually in the pure air of philosophy So long then as the life of nations is in need of religion as a motive and sanction of morality as food for faith hope and charity so long will the masses turn away from pure reason and naked truth so long will they adore mystery so long and rightly so will they rest in faith the only region where the ideal presents itself to them in an attractive form OCTOBER twenty sixTH eighteen seventy If ignorance and passion are the foes of popular morality it must be confessed that moral indifference is the malady of the cultivated classes The modern separation of enlightenment and virtue of thought and conscience of the intellectual aristocracy from the honest and vulgar crowd is the greatest danger that can threaten liberty When any society produces an increasing number of literary exquisites of satirists skeptics and beaux esprits some chemical disorganization of fabric may be inferred Take for example the century of Augustus and that of Louis XV Our cynics and railers are mere egotists who stand aloof from the common duty and in their indolent remoteness are of no service to society against any ill which may attack it Their cultivation consists in having got rid of feeling And thus they fall farther and farther away from true humanity and approach nearer to the demoniacal nature What was it that Mephistopheles lacked Not intelligence certainly but goodness DECEMBER elevenTH eighteen seventy five The ideal which the wife and mother makes for herself the manner in which she understands duty and life contain the fate of the community Her faith becomes the star of the conjugal ship and her love the animating principle that fashions the future of all belonging to her Woman is the salvation or destruction of the family She carries its destinies in the folds of her mantle JANUARY twenty twoD eighteen seventy five The thirst for truth is not a French passion In everything appearance is preferred to reality the outside to the inside the fashion to the material that which shines to that which profits opinion to conscience That is to say the Frenchman s centre of gravity is always outside him he is always thinking of others playing to the gallery To him individuals are so many zeros the unit which turns them into a number must be added from outside it may be royalty the writer of the day the favorite newspaper or any other temporary master of fashion All this is probably the result of an exaggerated sociability which weakens the soul s forces of resistance destroys its capacity for investigation and personal conviction and kills in it the worship of the ideal DECEMBER nineTH eighteen seventy seven The modern haunters of Parnassus carve urns of agate and of onyx but inside the urns what is there Ashes Their work lacks feeling seriousness sincerity and pathos in a word soul and moral life I cannot bring myself to sympathize with such a way of understanding poetry The talent shown is astonishing but stuff and matter are wanting It is an effort of the imagination to stand alone substitute for everything else We find metaphors rhymes music color but not man not humanity Poetry of this factitious kind may beguile one at twenty but what can one make of it at fifty It reminds me of Pergamos of Alexandria of all the epochs of decadence when beauty of form hid poverty of thought and exhaustion of feeling I strongly share the repugnance which this poetical school arouses in simple people It is as though it only cared to please the world worn the over subtle the corrupted while it ignores all normal healthy life virtuous habits pure affections steady labor honesty and duty It is an affectation and because it is an affectation the school is struck with sterility The reader desires in the poem something better than a juggler in rhyme or a conjurer in verse he looks to find in him a painter of life a being who thinks loves and has a conscience who feels passion and repentance The true critic strives for a clear vision of things as they are for justice and fairness his effort is to get free from himself so that he may in no way disfigure that which he wishes to understand or reproduce His superiority to the common herd lies in this effort even when its success is only partial He distrusts his own senses he sifts his own impressions by returning upon them from different sides and at different times by comparing moderating shading distinguishing and so endeavoring to approach more and more nearly to the formula which represents the maximum of truth The art which is grand and yet simple is that which presupposes the greatest elevation both in artist and in public MAY nineteenTH eighteen seventy eight Criticism is above all a gift an intuition a matter of tact and flair it cannot be taught or demonstrated it is an art Critical genius means an aptitude for discerning truth under appearances or in disguises which conceal it for discovering it in spite of the errors of testimony the frauds of tradition the dust of time the loss or alteration of texts It is the sagacity of the hunter whom nothing deceives for long and whom no ruse can throw off the trail It is the talent of the Juge d Instruction who knows how to interrogate circumstances and to extract an unknown secret from a thousand falsehoods The true critic can understand everything but he will be the dupe of nothing and to no convention will he sacrifice his duty which is to find out and proclaim truth Competent learning general cultivation absolute probity accuracy of general view human sympathy and technical capacity how many things are necessary to the critic without reckoning grace delicacy savoir vivre and the gift of happy phrasemaking MAY twenty twoD eighteen seventy nine Ascension Day Wonderful and delicious weather Soft caressing sunlight the air a limpid blue twitterings of birds even the distant voices of the city have something young and springlike in them It is indeed a new birth The ascension of the Savior of men is symbolized by the expansion this heavenward yearning of nature I feel myself born again all the windows of the soul are clear Forms lines tints reflections sounds contrasts and harmonies the general play and interchange of things it is all enchanting In my courtyard the ivy is green again the chestnut tree is full of leaf the Persian lilac beside the little fountain is flushed with red and just about to flower through the wide openings to the right and left of the old College of Calvin I see the Saleve above the trees of saint Antoine the Voirons above the hill of Cologny while the three flights of steps which from landing to landing lead between two high walls from the Rue Verdaine to the terrace of the Tranchees recall to one s imagination some old city of the south a glimpse of Perugia or of Malaga All the bells are ringing It is the hour of worship A historical and religious impression mingles with the picturesque the musical the poetical impressions of the scene All the peoples of Christendom all the churches scattered over the globe are celebrating at this moment the glory of the Crucified And what are those many nations doing who have other prophets and honor the Divinity in other ways the Jews the Mussulmans the Buddhists the Vishnuists the Guebers They have other sacred days other rites other solemnities other beliefs But all have some religion some ideal end for life all aim at raising man above the sorrows and smallnesses of the present and of the individual existence All have faith in something greater than themselves all pray all bow all adore all see beyond nature Spirit and beyond evil Good All bear witness to the Invisible Here we have the link which binds all peoples together All men are equally creatures of sorrow and desire of hope and fear All long to recover some lost harmony with the great order of things and to feel themselves approved and blessed by the Author of the universe All know what suffering is and yearn for happiness All know what sin is and feel the need of pardon Christianity reduced to its original simplicity is the reconciliation of the sinner with God by means of the certainty that God loves in spite of everything and that he chastises because he loves Christianity furnished a new motive and a new strength for the achievement of moral perfection It made holiness attractive by giving to it the air of filial gratitude JULY twenty eightTH eighteen eighty This afternoon I have had a walk in the sunshine and have just come back rejoicing in a renewed communion with nature The waters of the Rhone and the Arve the murmur of the river the austerity of its banks the brilliancy of the foliage the play of the leaves the splendor of the July sunlight the rich fertility of the fields the lucidity of the distant mountains the whiteness of the glaciers under the azure serenity of the sky the sparkle and foam of the mingling rivers the leafy masses of the La Batie woods all and everything delighted me It seemed to me as though the years of strength had come back to me I was overwhelmed with sensations I was surprised and grateful The universal life carried me on its breast the summer s caress went to my heart Once more my eyes beheld the vast horizons the soaring peaks the blue lakes the winding valleys and all the free outlets of old days And yet there was no painful sense of longing The scene left upon me an indefinable impression which was neither hope nor desire nor regret but rather a sense of emotion of passionate impulse mingled with admiration and anxiety I am conscious at once of joy and of want beyond what I possess I see the impossible and the unattainable I gauge my own wealth and poverty in a word I am and I am not my inner state is one of contradiction because it is one of transition APRIL oneOTH eighteen eighty one he died May eleventh What dupes we are of our own desires Destiny has two ways of crushing us by refusing our wishes and by fulfilling them But he who only wills what God wills escapes both catastrophes All things work together for his good ANACREON B C five hundred sixty two four hundred seventy seven Illustration ANACREON Of the life of this lyric poet we have little exact knowledge We know that he was an Ionian Greek and therefore by racial type a luxury loving music loving Greek born in the city of Teos on the coast of Asia Minor The year was probably B C five hundred sixty two With a few fellow citizens it is supposed that he fled to Thrace and founded Abdera when Cyrus the Great or his general Harpagus was conquering the Greek cities of the coast Abdera however was too new to afford luxurious living and the singing Ionian soon found his way to more genial Samos whither the fortunes of the world then seemed converging Polycrates was tyrant in the old Greek sense of irresponsible ruler but withal so large minded and far sighted a man that we may use a trite comparison and say that under him his island was to the rest of Greece as Florence in the time of Lorenzo the Magnificent was to the rest of Italy or Athens in the time of Pericles to the other Hellenic States Anacreon became his tutor and may have been of his council for Herodotus says that when Oroetes went to see Polycrates he found him in the men s apartment with Anacreon the Teian Another historian says that he tempered the stern will of the ruler Still another relates that Polycrates once presented him with five talents but that the poet returned the sum after two nights made sleepless from thinking what he would do with his riches saying it was not worth the care it cost After the murder of Polycrates Hipparchus who ruled at Athens sent a trireme to fetch the poet Like his father Pisistratus Hipparchus endeavored to further the cause of letters by calling poets to his court Simonides of Ceos was there and Lasus of Hermione the teacher of Pindar with many rhapsodists or minstrels who edited the poems of Homer and chanted his lays at the Panathenaea or high festival of Athena which the people celebrated every year with devout and magnificent show Amid this brilliant company Anacreon lived and sang until Hipparchus fell five hundred fourteen by the famous conspiracy of Harmodius and Aristogeiton He then returned to his native Teos and according to a legend died there at the age of eighty five choked by a grape seed Anacreon was a lyrist of the first order Plato s poet says of him in the Symposium When I hear the verses of Sappho or Anacreon I set down my cup for very shame of my own performance He composed in Greek somewhat to use a very free comparison as Herrick did in English expressing the unrefined passion and excesses which he saw just as the Devonshire parson preserved the spirit of the country festivals of Old England in his vivid verse To Anacreon music and poetry were inseparable The poet of his time recited his lines with lyre in hand striking upon it in the measure he thought best suited to his song Doubtless the poems of Anacreon were delivered in this way His themes were simple wine love and the glorification of youth and poetry but his imagination and poetic invention so animated every theme that it is the perfect rendering which we see not the simplicity of the commonplace idea His delicacy preserves him from grossness and his grace from wantonness In this respect his poems are a fair illustration of the Greek sense of self limitation which guided the art instincts of that people and made them the creators of permanent canons of taste Anacreon had no politics no earnest interest in the affairs of life no morals in the large meaning of that word no aims reaching further than the merriment and grace of the moment Loving luxury and leisure he was the follower of a pleasure loving court His cares are that the bowl is empty that age is joyless that women tell him he is growing gray He is closely paralleled in this by one side of Beranger but the Frenchman s soul had a passionately earnest half which the Greek entirely lacked Nor is there ever any outbreak of the deep yearning the underlying melancholy which pervades and now and then interrupts like a skeleton at the feast the gayest verses of Omar Khayyam His metres like his matter are simple and easy So imitators perhaps as brilliant as the master have sprung up and produced a mass of songs and at this time it remains in doubt whether any complete poem of Anacreon remains untouched For this reason the collection is commonly termed Anacreontics Some of the poems are referred to the school of Gaza and the fourth century after Christ and some to the secular teachings and refinement of the monks of the Middle Ages Since the discovery and publication of the text by Henry Stephens in fifteen fifty four poets have indulged their lighter fancies in such songs and a small literature of delicate trifles now exists under the name of Anacreontics in Italian German and English Bergk s recension of the poems appeared in eighteen seventy eight The standard translations or rather imitations in English are those of Cowley and Moore The Irish poet was not unlike in nature to the ancient Ionian Moore s fine voice in the London drawing rooms echoes at times the note of Anacreon in the men s quarters of Polycrates or the symposia of Hipparchus The joy of feasting and music the color of wine and the scent of roses alike inspire the songs of each DRINKING The thirsty earth soaks up the rain And drinks and gapes for drink again The plants suck in the earth and are With constant drinking fresh and fair The sea itself which one would think Should have but little need of drink Drinks twice ten thousand rivers up So filled that they o erflow the cup The busy Sun and one would guess By s drunken fiery face no less Drinks up the sea and when he s done The Moon and Stars drink up the Sun They drink and dance by their own light They drink and revel all the night Nothing in nature s sober found But an eternal health goes round Fill up the bowl then fill it high Fill all the glasses there for why Should every creature drink but I Why man of morals tell me why Cowley s Translation AGE Oft am I by the women told Poor Anacreon thou grow saint old Look how thy hairs are falling all Poor Anacreon how they fall Whether I grow old or no By th effects I do not know This I know without being told Tis time to live if I grow old Tis time short pleasures now to take Of little life the best to make And manage wisely the last stake Cowley s Translation THE EPICURE I Fill the bowl with rosy wine Around our temples roses twine And let us cheerfully awhile Like the wine and roses smile Crowned with roses we contemn Gyges wealthy diadem To day is ours what do we fear To day is ours we have it here Let s treat it kindly that it may Wish at least with us to stay Let s banish business banish sorrow To the gods belongs to morrow II Underneath this myrtle shade On flowery beds supinely laid With odorous oils my head o erflowing And around it roses growing What should I do but drink away The heat and troubles of the day In this more than kingly state Love himself shall on me wait Fill to me Love nay fill it up And mingled cast into the cup Wit and mirth and noble fires Vigorous health and gay desires The wheel of life no less will stay In a smooth than rugged way Since it equally doth flee Let the motion pleasant be Why do we precious ointments show r Noble wines why do we pour Beauteous flowers why do we spread Upon the monuments of the dead Nothing they but dust can show Or bones that hasten to be so Crown me with roses while I live Now your wines and ointments give After death I nothing crave Let me alive my pleasures have All are Stoics in the grave Cowley s Translation GOLD A mighty pain to love it is And tis a pain that pain to miss But of all pains the greatest pain It is to love but love in vain Virtue now nor noble blood Nor wit by love is understood Gold alone does passion move Gold monopolizes love A curse on her and on the man Who this traffic first began A curse on him who found the ore A curse on him who digged the store A curse on him who did refine it A curse on him who first did coin it A curse all curses else above On him who used it first in love Gold begets in brethren hate Gold in families debate Gold does friendship separate Gold does civil wars create These the smallest harms of it Gold alas does love beget Cowley s Translation THE GRASSHOPPER Happy Insect what can be In happiness compared to thee Fed with nourishment divine The dewy Morning s gentle wine Nature waits upon thee still And thy verdant cup does fill Tis filled wherever thou dost tread Nature s self s thy Ganymede Thou dost drink and dance and sing Happier than the happiest king All the fields which thou dost see All the plants belong to thee All that summer hours produce Fertile made with early juice Man for thee does sow and plow Farmer he and landlord thou Thou dost innocently joy Nor does thy luxury destroy The shepherd gladly heareth thee More harmonious than he Thee country hinds with gladness hear Prophet of the ripened year Thee Phoebus loves and does inspire Phoebus is himself thy sire To thee of all things upon Earth Life s no longer than thy mirth Happy insect happy thou Dost neither age nor winter know But when thou saint drunk and danced and sung Thy fill the flowery leaves among Voluptuous and wise withal Epicurean animal Sated with thy summer feast Thou retir saint to endless rest Cowley s Translation THE SWALLOW Foolish prater what dost thou So early at my window do With thy tuneless serenade Well t had been had Tereus made Thee as dumb as Philomel There his knife had done but well In thy undiscovered nest Thou dost all the winter rest And dreamest o er thy summer joys Free from the stormy season s noise Free from th ill thou saint done to me Who disturbs or seeks out thee Hadst thou all the charming notes Of the wood s poetic throats All thou art could never pay What thou hast ta en from me away Cruel bird thou saint ta en away A dream out of my arms to day A dream that ne er must equaled be By all that waking eyes may see Thou this damage to repair Nothing half so sweet or fair Nothing half so good canst bring Though men say thou bring saint the Spring Cowley s Translation THE POET S CHOICE If hoarded gold possessed a power To lengthen life s too fleeting hour And purchase from the hand of death A little span a moment s breath How I would love the precious ore And every day should swell my store That when the fates would send their minion To waft me off on shadowy pinion I might some hours of life obtain And bribe him back to hell again But since we ne er can charm away The mandate of that awful day Why do we vainly weep at fate And sigh for life s uncertain date The light of gold can ne er illume The dreary midnight of the tomb And why should I then pant for treasures Mine be the brilliant round of pleasures The goblet rich the hoard of friends Whose flowing souls the goblet blends Moore s Translation DRINKING I care not for the idle state Of Persia s king the rich the great I envy not the monarch s throne Nor wish the treasured gold my own But oh be mine the rosy braid The fervor of my brows to shade Be mine the odors richly sighing Amid my hoary tresses flying To day I ll haste to quaff my wine As if to morrow ne er should shine But if to morrow comes why then I ll haste to quaff my wine again And thus while all our days are bright Nor time has dimmed their bloomy light Let us the festal hours beguile With mantling cup and cordial smile And shed from every bowl of wine The richest drop on Bacchus s shrine For Death may come with brow unpleasant May come when least we wish him present And beckon to the sable shore And grimly bid us drink no more Moore s Translation A LOVER S SIGH The Phrygian rock that braves the storm Was once a weeping matron s form And Procne hapless frantic maid Is now a swallow in the shade Oh that a mirror s form were mine To sparkle with that smile divine And like my heart I then should be Reflecting thee and only thee Or could I be the robe which holds That graceful form within its folds Or turned into a fountain lave Thy beauties in my circling wave Or better still the zone that lies Warm to thy breast and feels its sighs Or like those envious pearls that show So faintly round that neck of snow Yes I would be a happy gem Like them to hang to fade like them What more would thy Anacreon be Oh anything that touches thee Nay sandals for those airy feet Thus to be pressed by thee were sweet Moore s Translation HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN eighteen oh five eighteen seventy five BY BENJAMIN W WELLS The place of Hans Christian Andersen in literature is that of the Children s Poet though his best poetry is prose He was born in the ancient Danish city of Odense on April twod eighteen oh five of poor and shiftless parents He had little regular instruction and few childish associates His youthful imagination was first stimulated by La Fontaine s Fables and the Arabian Nights and he showed very early a dramatic instinct trying to act and even to imitate Shakespeare though as he says hardly able to spell a single word correctly It was therefore natural that the visit of a dramatic company to Odense in eighteen eighteen should fire his fancy to seek his theatrical fortune in Copenhagen whither he went in September eighteen nineteen with fifteen dollars in his pocket and a letter of introduction to a danseuse at the Royal Theatre who not unnaturally took her strange visitor for a lunatic and showed him the door For four years he labored diligently suffered acutely and produced nothing of value though he gained some influential friends who persuaded the king to grant him a scholarship for three years that he might prepare for the university Though he was neither a brilliant nor a docile pupil he did not exhaust the generous patience of his friends who in eighteen twenty nine enabled him to publish by subscription his first book A Journey on Foot from Holm Canal to the East Point of Amager a fantastic arabesque partly plagiarized and partly parodied from the German romanticists but with a naivete that might have disarmed criticism In eighteen thirty one there followed a volume of poems the sentimental and rather mawkish Fantasies and Sketches product of a journey in Jutland and of a silly love affair This book was so harshly criticized that he resolved to seek a refuge and new literary inspiration in a tour to Germany for all through his life traveling was Andersen s stimulus and distraction so that he compares himself later to a pendulum bound to go backward and forward tic toc tic toc till the clock stops and down I lie Illustration HANS CHR ANDERSEN This German tour inspired his first worthy book Silhouettes with some really admirable pages of description His success encouraged him to attempt the drama again where he failed once more and betook himself for relief to Paris and Italy with a brief stay in the Jura Mountains which is delightfully described in his novel O T Italy had on him much the same clarifying effect that it had on Goethe and his next book the novel Improvisatore eighteen thirty five achieved and deserved a European recognition Within ten years the book was translated into six languages It bears the mark of its date in its romantic sentiments There is indeed no firm character drawing here or in any of his novels but the book still claims attention for its exquisite descriptions of Italian life and scenery The year eighteen thirty five saw also Andersen s first essay in the Wonder Stories which were to give him his lasting title to grateful remembrance He did not think highly of this work at the time though his little volume contained the now classic Tinderbox and Big Claus and Little Claus Indeed he always chafed a little at the modest fame of a writer for children but he continued for thirty seven years to publish those graceful fancies which in their little domain still hold the first rank and certainly gave the freest scope to Andersen s qualities while they masked his faults and limitations He turned again from this sleight of hand with Fancy s golden apples to the novel in the O T eighteen thirty six which marks no advance on the Improvisatore and in the next year he published his best romance Only a Fiddler which is still charming for its autobiographical touches its genuine humor and its deep pathos At the time this book assured his European reputation though it has less interest for us to day than the Tales or the Picture Book without Pictures eighteen forty where perhaps more than anywhere else in his work the child speaks with all the naivete of his nature A journey to the East was reflected in A Poet s Bazaar eighteen forty two and these years contain also his last unsuccessful dramatic efforts The King Dreams and The New Lying in Room In eighteen forty three he was in Paris in eighteen forty four in Germany and in the next year he extended his wanderings to Italy and England where Mary Howitt s translations had assured him a welcome Ten years later he revisited England as the guest of Dickens at Gadshill The failure of an epic Ahasuerus eighteen forty seven and of a novel The Two Baronesses eighteen forty nine made him turn with more interest to wonder tales and fairy dramas which won a considerable success and when the political troubles of eighteen forty eight directed his wanderings toward Sweden he made from them I Sverrig In Sweden eighteen forty nine his most exquisite book of travels As Europe grew peaceful again he resumed his indefatigable wanderings visiting Germany France Italy Switzerland Spain Bohemia and England printing between eighteen fifty two and eighteen sixty two nine little volumes of stories the mediocre but successful In Spain eighteen sixty and his last novel To Be or Not To Be eighteen fifty seven which reflects the religious speculations of his later years He was now in comparatively easy circumstances and passed the last fifteen years of his life unharassed by criticism and surrounded with the honor love obedience troops of friends that should accompany old age It was not until eighteen sixty six that he made himself a home and even at sixty one he said the idea positively frightened him he knew he should run away from it as soon as ever the first warm sunbeam struck him like any other bird of passage In eighteen sixty nine he celebrated his literary jubilee In eighteen seventy two he finished his last Stories That year he met with an accident in Innsbruck from which he never recovered Kind friends eased his invalid years and so general was the grief at his illness that the children of the United States collected a sum of money for his supposed necessities which at his request took the form of books for his library A few months later after a brief and painless illness he died August first eighteen seventy five His admirers had already erected a statue in his honor and the State gave him a magnificent funeral but his most enduring monument is that which his Wonder Tales are still building all around the world The character of Andersen is full of curious contrasts Like the French fabulist La Fontaine he was a child all his life and often a spoiled child yet he joined to childlike simplicity no small share of worldly wisdom Constant travel made him a shrewd observer of detail but his self absorption kept him from sympathy with the broad political aspirations of his generation In the judgment of his friends and critics his autobiographical Story of My Life is strangely unjust and he never understood the limitations of his genius He was not fond of children nor personally attractive to them though his letters to them are charming In personal appearance he was limp ungainly awkward and odd with long lean limbs broad flat hands and feet of striking size His eyes were small and deep set his nose very large his neck very long but he masked his defects by studied care in dress and always fancied he looked distinguished delighting to display his numerous decorations on his evening dress in complacent profusion On Andersen s style there is a remarkably acute study by his fellow countryman Brandes in Kritiker og Portraite Critiques and Portraits and a useful comment in Boyesen s Scandinavian Literature When not perverted by his translators it is perhaps better suited than any other to the comprehension of children His syntax and rhetoric are often faulty and in the Tales he does not hesitate to take liberties even with German if he can but catch the vivid darting imagery of juvenile fancy the ohs and ahs of the nursery its changing intonations its fears its smiles its personal appeals and its venerable devices to spur attention and kindle sympathy Action or imitation takes the place of description We hear the trumpeter s taratantara and the pattering rain on the leaves rum dum dum rum dum dum The soldier comes marching along left right left right No one puts himself so wholly in the child s place and looks at nature so wholly with his eyes as Andersen If you hold one of those burdock leaves before your little body it s just like an apron and if you put it on your head it s almost as good as an umbrella it s so big Or he tells you that when the sun shone on the flax and the clouds watered it it was just as nice for it as it is for the little children to be washed and then get a kiss from mother that makes them prettier of course it does And here as Brandes remarks every right minded mamma stops and kisses the child and their hearts are warmer for that day s tale The starting point of this art is personification To the child s fancy the doll is as much alive as the cat the broom as the bird and even the letters in the copy book can stretch themselves On this foundation he builds myths that tease by a certain semblance of rationality elegiac more often sentimental but at their best like normal children without strained pathos or forced sympathy Such personification has obvious dramatic and lyric elements but Andersen lacked the technique of poetic and dramatic art and marred his prose descriptions both in novels and books of travel by an intrusive egotism and lyric exaggeration No doubt therefore the most permanent part of his work is that which popular instinct has selected the Picture Book without Pictures the Tales and Stories and among these those will last longest that have least of the lyric and most of the dramatic element Nearly all of Andersen s books are translated in ten uniform but unnumbered volumes published by Houghton Mifflin and Company Of the numerous translations of the Tales Mary Howitt s eighteen forty six and Sommer s eighteen ninety three are the best though far from faultless The Life of Hans Christian Andersen by R Nisbet Bain New York eighteen ninety five is esteemed the best Illustration signature THE STEADFAST TIN SOLDIER From Collected Fairy Tales newly translated There were once twenty five tin soldiers who were all brothers for they were cast out of one old tin spoon They held their muskets and their faces were turned to the enemy red and blue ever so fine were the uniforms The first thing they heard in this world when the cover was taken from the box where they lay were the words Tin soldiers A little boy shouted it and clapped his hands He had got them because it was his birthday and now he set them up on the table Each soldier was just like the other only one was a little different He had but one leg for he had been cast last and there was not enough tin But he stood on his one leg just as firm as the others on two so he was just the one to be famous On the table where they were set up stood a lot of other playthings but what caught your eye was a pretty castle of paper Through the little windows you could see right into the halls Little trees stood in front around a bit of looking glass which was meant for a lake Wax swans swam on it and were reflected in it That was all very pretty but still the prettiest thing was a little girl who stood right in the castle gate She was cut out of paper too but she had a silk dress and a little narrow blue ribbon across her shoulders on which was a sparkling star as big as her whole face The little girl lifted her arms gracefully in the air for she was a dancer and then she lifted one leg so high that the tin soldier could not find it at all and thought that she had only one leg just like himself That would be the wife for me thought he but she is too fine for me She lives in a castle and I have only a box which I have to share with twenty four That is no house for her But I will see whether I can make her acquaintance Then he lay down at full length behind a snuff box which was on the table From there he could watch the trig little lady who kept standing on one leg without losing her balance When evening came the other tin soldiers were all put in their box and the people in the house went to bed Then the playthings began to play first at visiting then at war and at dancing The tin soldiers rattled in their box for they would have liked to join in it but they could not get the cover off The nutcracker turned somersaults and the pencil scrawled over the slate There was such a racket that the canary bird woke up and began to sing and that in verses The only ones that did not stir were the tin soldier and the little dancer She stood straight on tiptoe and stretched up both arms he was just as steadfast on his one leg He did not take his eyes from her a moment Now it struck twelve and bang up went the cover of the snuff box but it wasn t tobacco in it no but a little black Troll It was a trick box Tin soldier said the Troll will you stare your eyes out But the tin soldier made believe he did not hear You wait till morning said the Troll When morning came and the children got up the tin soldier was put on the window ledge and whether it was the Troll or a gust of wind all at once the window flew open and the tin soldier fell head first from the third story That was an awful fall He stretched his leg straight up and stuck with his bayonet and cap right between the paving stones The maid and the little boy came right down to hunt for him but they couldn t see him though they came so near that they almost trod on him If the tin soldier had called Here I am they surely would have found him but since he was in uniform he did not think it proper to call aloud Now it began to rain The drops chased one another It was a regular shower When that was over two street boys came along Hallo said one There s a tin soldier He must be off and sail Then they made a boat out of a newspaper put the tin soldier in it and made him sail down the gutter Both boys ran beside it and clapped their hands Preserve us What waves there were in the gutter and what a current It must have rained torrents The paper boat rocked up and down and sometimes it whirled around so that the tin soldier shivered But he remained steadfast did not lose color looked straight ahead and held his musket firm All at once the boat plunged under a long gutter bridge It was as dark there as it had been in his box Where am I going now thought he Yes yes that is the Troll s fault Oh if the little lady were only in the boat I would not care if it were twice as dark At that instant there came a great water rat who lived under the gutter bridge Have you a pass said the rat Show me your pass But the tin soldier kept still and only held his musket the firmer The boat rushed on and the rat behind Oh how he gnashed his teeth and called to the sticks and straws Stop him Stop him He has not paid toll He has showed no pass But the current got stronger and stronger Before he got to the end of the bridge the tin soldier could see daylight but he heard also a rushing noise that might frighten a brave man s heart Just think at the end of the bridge the gutter emptied into a great canal which for him was as dangerous as for us to sail down a great waterfall He was so near it already that he could not stop The boat went down The poor tin soldier held himself as straight as he could No one should say of him that he had ever blinked his eyes The boat whirled three or four times and filled with water It had to sink The tin soldier stood up to his neck in water and deeper deeper sank the boat The paper grew weaker and weaker Now the waves went over the soldier s head Then he thought of the pretty little dancer whom he never was to see again and there rang in the tin soldier s ears Farewell warrior farewell Death shalt thou stiffer Now the paper burst in two and the tin soldier fell through but in that minute he was swallowed by a big fish Oh wasn t it dark in there It was worse even than under the gutter bridge and besides so cramped But the tin soldier was steadfast and lay at full length musket in hand The fish rushed around and made the most fearful jumps At last he was quite still and something went through him like a lightning flash Then a bright light rushed in and somebody called aloud The tin soldier The fish had been caught brought to market sold and been taken to the kitchen where the maid had slit it up with a big knife She caught the soldier around the body and carried him into the parlor where everybody wanted to see such a remarkable man who had traveled about in a fish s belly But the tin soldier was not a bit proud They put him on the table and there well what strange things do happen in the world the tin soldier was in the very same room that he had been in before He saw the same children and the same playthings were on the table the splendid castle with the pretty little dancer she was still standing on one leg and had the other high in the air She was steadfast too That touched the tin soldier so that he could almost have wept tin tears but that would not have been proper He looked at her and she looked at him but they said nothing at all Suddenly one of the little boys seized the tin soldier and threw him right into the tile stove although he had no reason to It was surely the Troll in the box who was to blame The tin soldier stood in full light and felt a fearful heat but whether that came from the real fire or from his glowing love he could not tell All the color had faded from him but whether this had happened on the journey or whether it came from care no one could say He looked at the little girl and she looked at him He felt that he was melting but still he stood steadfast musket in hand Then a door opened A whiff of air caught the dancer and she flew like a sylph right into the tile stove to the tin soldier blazed up in flame and was gone Then the tin soldier melted to a lump and when the maid next day took out the ashes she found him as a little tin heart But of the dancer only the star was left and that was burnt coal black THE TEAPOT From Riverside Literature Series eighteen ninety one by Houghton Mifflin company There was a proud Teapot proud of being porcelain proud of its long spout proud of its broad handle It had something before and behind the spout before the handle behind and that was what it talked about But it did not talk of its lid that was cracked it was riveted it had faults and one does not talk about one s faults there are plenty of others to do that The cups the cream pot the sugar bowl the whole tea service would be reminded much more of the lid s weakness and talk about that than of the sound handle and the remarkable spout The Teapot knew it I know you it said within itself I know well enough too my fault and I am well aware that in that very thing is seen my humility my modesty We all have faults but then one also has a talent The cups get a handle the sugar bowl a lid I get both and one thing besides in front which they never got I get a spout and that makes me a queen on the tea table The sugar bowl and cream pot are good looking serving maids but I am the one who gives yes the one high in council I spread abroad a blessing among thirsty mankind In my insides the Chinese leaves are worked up in the boiling tasteless water All this said the Teapot in its fresh young life It stood on the table that was spread for tea it was lifted by a very delicate hand but the very delicate hand was awkward the Teapot fell The spout snapped off the handle snapped off the lid was no worse to speak of the worst had been spoken of that The Teapot lay in a swoon on the floor while the boiling water ran out of it It was a horrid shame but the worst was that they jeered at it they jeered at it and not at the awkward hand I never shall lose the memory of that said the Teapot when it afterward talked to itself of the course of its life I was called an invalid and placed in a corner and the day after was given away to a woman who begged victuals I fell into poverty and stood dumb both outside and in but there as I stood began my better life One is one thing and becomes quite another Earth was placed in me for a Teapot that is the same as being buried but in the earth was placed a flower bulb Who placed it there who gave it I know not given it was and it took the place of the Chinese leaves and the boiling water the broken handle and spout And the bulb lay in the earth the bulb lay in me it became my heart my living heart such as I never before had There was life in me power and might My pulses beat the bulb put forth sprouts it was the springing up of thoughts and feelings they burst forth in flower I saw it I bore it I forgot myself in its delight Blessed is it to forget one s self in another The bulb gave me no thanks it did not think of me it was admired and praised I was so glad at that how happy must it have been One day I heard it said that it ought to have a better pot I was thumped on my back that was rather hard to bear but the flower was put in a better pot and I was thrown away in the yard where I lie as an old crock But I have the memory that I can never lose THE UGLY DUCKLING From Riverside Literature Series eighteen ninety one by Houghton Mifflin company I THE DUCKLING IS BORN It was glorious in the country It was summer the cornfields were yellow the oats were green the hay had been put up in stacks in the green meadows and the stork went about on his long red legs and chattered Egyptian for this was the language he had learned from his mother All around the fields and meadows were great woods and in the midst of these woods deep lakes Yes it was right glorious in the country In the midst of the sunshine there lay an old farm with deep canals about it and from the wall down to the water grew great burdocks so high that little children could stand upright under the tallest of them It was just as wild there as in the deepest wood and here sat a Duck upon her nest She had to hatch her ducklings but she was almost tired out before the little ones came and she seldom had visitors The other ducks liked better to swim about in the canals than to run up to sit under a burdock and gabble with her At last one egg shell after another burst open Pip pip each cried and in all the eggs there were little things that stuck out their heads Quack quack said the Duck and they all came quacking out as fast as they could looking all around them under the green leaves and the mother let them look as much as they liked for green is good for the eye How wide the world is said all the young ones for they certainly had much more room now than when they were inside the eggs D ye think this is all the world said the mother That stretches far across the other side of the garden quite into the parson s field but I have never been there yet I hope you are all together and she stood up No I have not all The largest egg still lies there How long is that to last I am really tired of it And so she sat down again Well how goes it asked an old Duck who had come to pay her a visit It lasts a long time with this one egg said the Duck who sat there It will not open Now only look at the others They are the prettiest little ducks I ever saw They are all like their father the rogue he never comes to see me Let me see the egg which will not burst said the old Duck You may be sure it is a turkey s egg I was once cheated in that way and had much care and trouble with the young ones for they are afraid of the water Must I say it to you I could not make them go in I quacked and I clacked but it was no use Let me see the egg Yes that s a turkey s egg Let it lie there and do you teach the other children to swim I think I will sit on it a little longer said the Duck I ve sat so long now that I can sit a few days more Just as you please said the old Duck and she went away At last the great egg burst Pip pip said the little one and crept forth He was so big and ugly The Duck looked at him It s a very large Duckling said she None of the others looks like that it really must be a turkey chick Well we shall soon find out Into the water shall he go even if I have to push him in II HOW THE DUCKLING WAS TREATED AT HOME The next day it was bright beautiful weather the sun shone on all the green burdocks The Mother Duck with all her family went down to the canal Splash she jumped into the water Quack quack she said and one duckling after another plumped in The water closed over their heads but they came up in an instant and swam off finely their legs went of themselves and they were all in the water even the ugly gray Duckling swam with them No it s not a turkey said she look how well he uses his legs how straight he holds himself It is my own child On the whole he s quite pretty when one looks at him rightly Quack quack come now with me and I ll lead you out into the world and present you in the duck yard but keep close to me all the time so that no one may tread on you and look out for the cats And so they came into the duck yard There was a terrible row going on in there for two families were fighting about an eel s head and so the cat got it See that s the way it goes in the world said the Mother Duck and she whetted her beak for she too wanted the eel s head Only use your legs she said See that you can bustle about and bend your necks before the old Duck yonder She s the grandest of all here she s of Spanish blood that s why she s so fat and do you see she has a red rag around her leg that s something very very fine and the greatest mark of honor a duck can have it means that one does not want to lose her and that she s known by the animals and by men too Hurry hurry don t turn in your toes a well brought up duck turns it s toes quite out just like father and mother so Now bend your necks and say Quack And they did so but the other ducks round about looked at them and said quite boldly Look there now we re to have this crowd too as if there were not enough of us already And fie how that Duckling yonder looks we won t stand that And at once one Duck flew at him and bit him in the neck Let him alone said the mother he is not doing anything to any one Yes but he s too large and odd said the Duck who had bitten him and so he must be put down Those are pretty children the mother has said the old Duck with the rag round her leg They re all pretty but that one that is rather unlucky I wish she could have that one over again That cannot be done my lady said the Mother Duck He is not pretty but he has a really good temper and swims as well as any of the others yes I may even say it a little better I think he will grow up pretty perhaps in time he will grow a little smaller he lay too long in the egg and therefore he has not quite the right shape And she pinched him in the neck and smoothed his feathers Besides he is a drake she said and so it does not matter much I think he will be very strong he makes his way already The other ducklings are graceful enough said the old Duck Make yourself at home and if you find an eel s head you may bring it to me And now they were at home But the poor Duckling who had crept last out of the egg and looked so ugly was bitten and pushed and made fun of as much by the ducks as by the chickens He is too big they all said And the turkey cock who had been born with spurs and so thought he was an emperor blew himself up like a ship in full sail and bore straight down upon him then he gobbled and grew quite red in the face The poor Duckling did not know where he dared stand or walk he was quite unhappy because he looked ugly and was the sport of the whole duck yard So it went on the first day and then it grew worse and worse The poor Duckling was hunted about by every one even his brothers and sisters were quite angry with him and said If the cat would only catch you you ugly creature And the ducks bit him and the chickens beat him and the girl who had to feed the poultry kicked at him with her foot III OUT ON THE MOOR Then he ran and flew over the fence and the little birds in the bushes flew up in fear That is because I am so ugly thought the Duckling and he shut his eyes but flew on further and so he came out into the great moor where the wild ducks lived Here he lay the whole night long he was so tired and sad Toward morning the wild ducks flew up and looked at their new mate What sort of a one are you they asked and the Duckling turned about to each and bowed as well as he could You are really very ugly said the Wild Ducks But that is all the same to us so long as you do not marry into our family Poor thing he certainly did not think of marrying and only dared ask leave to lie among the reeds and drink some of the swamp water There he lay two whole days then came thither two wild geese or more truly two wild ganders It was not long since each had crept out of an egg and that s why they were so saucy Listen comrade said one of them You re so ugly that I like you Will you go with us and become a bird of passage Near here is another moor where are a few sweet lovely wild geese all unmarried and all able to say Quack You ve a chance of making your fortune ugly as you are Piff paff sounded through the air and both the ganders fell down dead in the reeds and the water became blood red Piff paff it sounded again and the whole flock of wild geese flew up from the reeds And then there was another report A great hunt was going on The gunners lay around in the moor and some were even sitting up in the branches of the trees which spread far over the reeds The blue smoke rose like clouds in among the dark trees and hung over the water and the hunting dogs came splash splash into the mud and the rushes and reeds bent down on every side That was a fright for the poor Duckling He turned his head to put it under his wing and at that very moment a frightful great dog stood close by the Duckling His tongue hung far out of his mouth and his eyes glared horribly He put his nose close to the Duckling showed his sharp teeth and splash splash on he went without seizing it Oh Heaven be thanked sighed the Duckling I am so ugly that even the dog does not like to bite me And so he lay quite quiet while the shots rattled through the reeds and gun after gun was fired At last late in the day all was still but the poor little thing did not dare to rise up he waited several hours still before he looked around and then hurried away out of the moor as fast as he could He ran on over field and meadow there was a storm so that he had hard work to get away IV IN THE PEASANT S HUT Towards evening the Duckling came to a peasant s poor little hut it was so tumbled down that it did not itself know on which side it should fall and that s why it stood up The storm whistled around the Duckling in such a way that he had to sit down to keep from blowing away and the wind blew worse and worse Then he noticed that one of the hinges of the door had given way and the door hung so slanting that he could slip through the crack into the room and that is what he did Here lived an old woman with her Cat and her Hen And the Cat whom she called Sonnie could arch his back and purr he could even give out sparks but for that one had to stroke his fur the wrong way The Hen had quite small short legs and therefore she was called Chickabiddy Shortshanks she laid good eggs and the woman loved her as her own child In the morning they noticed at once the strange Duckling and the Cat began to purr and the Hen to cluck What s this said the woman and looked all around but she could not see well and therefore she thought the Duckling was a fat duck that had strayed This is a rare prize she said Now I shall have duck s eggs I hope it is not a drake We must try that And so the Duckling was taken on trial for three weeks but no eggs came And the Cat was master of the house and the Hen was the lady and always said We and the world for they thought they were half the world and by far the better half It seemed to the Duckling that one might have another mind but the Hen would not allow it Can you lay eggs No Then will you hold your tongue And the Cat said Can you curve your back and purr and give out sparks No Then you will please have no opinion of your own when sensible folks are speaking And the Duckling sat in a corner and was in low spirits then he began to think of the fresh air and the sunshine and he was seized with such a strange longing to swim on the water that he could not help telling the Hen of it What are you thinking of cried the Hen You have nothing to do that s why you have these fancies Lay eggs or purr and they will pass over But it is so charming to swim in the water said the Duckling so nice to feel it go over one s head and to dive down to the bottom Yes that s a fine thing truly said the Hen You are clean gone crazy Ask the Cat about it he s the cleverest thing I know ask him if he likes to swim in the water or to dive down I won t speak about myself Ask our mistress herself the old woman no one in the world knows more than she Do you think she wants to swim and let the water close above her head You don t understand me said the Duckling We don t understand you Then pray who is to understand you You surely don t pretend to be cleverer than the Cat and the woman I won t say anything of myself Don t make a fool of yourself child and thank your Maker for all the good you have Are you not come into a warm room and have you not folks about you from whom you can learn something But you are a goose and it is not pleasant to have you about You may believe me I speak for your good I tell you things you won t like and by that one may always know one s true friends Only take care that you learn to lay eggs or to purr and to give out sparks I think I will go out into the wide world said the Duckling Yes do go replied the Hen And so the Duckling went away He swam on the water and dived but he was shunned by every creature because he was so ugly V WHAT BECAME OF THE DUCKLING Now came the fall of the year The leaves in the wood turned yellow and brown the wind caught them so that they danced about and up in the air it was very cold The clouds hung low heavy with hail and snow flakes and on the fence stood the raven crying Croak croak for mere cold yes one could freeze fast if one thought about it The poor little Duckling certainly had not a good time One evening the sun was just going down in fine style there came a whole flock of great handsome birds out of the bushes they were shining white with long supple necks they were swans They uttered a very strange cry spread forth their glorious great wings and flew away from that cold region to warmer lands to fair open lakes They mounted so high so high and the ugly Duckling had such a strange feeling as he saw them He turned round and round in the water like a wheel stretched out his neck towards them and uttered a cry so high so strange that he was frightened as he heard it Oh he could not forget those beautiful happy birds and as soon as he could see them no longer he dived down to the very bottom and when he came up again he was quite beside himself He did not know what the birds were nor where they were flying to but he loved them more than he had ever loved any one He did not envy them at all How could he think of wishing to have such loveliness as they had He would have been glad if only the ducks would have let him be among them the poor ugly creature And the winter grew so cold so cold The Duckling had to swim about in the water to keep it from freezing over but every night the hole in which he swam about became smaller and smaller It froze so hard that the icy cover sounded and the Duckling had to use his legs all the time to keep the hole from freezing tight At last he became worn out and lay quite still and thus froze fast in the ice Early in the morning a peasant came by and found him there he took his wooden shoe broke the ice to pieces and carried the Duckling home to his wife Then the Duckling came to himself again The children wanted to play with him but he thought they wanted to hurt him and in his terror he flew up into the milk pan so that the milk spilled over into the room The woman screamed and shook her hand in the air at which the Duckling flew down into the tub where they kept the butter and then into the meal barrel and out again How he looked then The woman screamed and struck at him with the fire tongs the children tumbled over one another as they tried to catch the Duckling and they laughed and they screamed well was it that the door stood open and the poor creature was able to slip out between the bushes into the newly fallen snow there he lay quite worn out But it would be too sad if I were to tell all the misery and care which the Duckling had to bear in the hard winter He lay out on the moor among the reeds when the sun began to shine again and the larks to sing it was a beautiful spring Then all at once the Duckling could flap his wings they beat the air more strongly than before and bore him stoutly away and before he well knew it he found himself in a great garden where the elder trees stood in flower and bent their long green branches down to the winding canal and the lilacs smelt sweet Oh here it was beautiful fresh and springlike and from the thicket came three glorious white swans they rustled their wings and sat lightly on the water The Duckling knew the splendid creatures and felt a strange sadness I will fly away to them to the royal birds and they will beat me because I that am so ugly dare to come near them But it is all the same Better to be killed by them than to be chased by ducks and beaten by fowls and pushed about by the girl who takes care of the poultry yard and to suffer hunger in winter And he flew out into the water and swam toward the beautiful swans these looked at him and came sailing down upon him with outspread wings Kill me said the poor creature and bent his head down upon the water and waited for death But what saw he in the clear water He saw below him his own image and lo it was no longer a clumsy dark gray bird ugly and hateful to look at but a swan It matters nothing if one is born in a duck yard if one has only lain in a swan s egg He felt quite glad at all the need and hard times he had borne now he could joy in his good luck in all the brightness that was round him And the great swans swam round him and stroked him with their beaks Into the garden came little children who threw bread and corn into the water and the youngest cried There is a new one and the other children shouted Yes a new one has come And they clapped their hands and danced about and ran to their father and mother and bread and cake were thrown into the water and they all said The new one is the most beautiful of all so young and so handsome and the old swans bowed their heads before him Then he felt quite ashamed and hid his head under his wings for he did not know what to do he was so happy and yet not at all proud for a good heart is never proud He thought how he had been driven about and mocked and despised and now he heard them all saying that he was the most beautiful of all beautiful birds And the lilacs bent their branches straight down into the water before him and the sun shone warm and mild Then his wings rustled he lifted his slender neck and cried from the depths of his heart I never dreamed of so much happiness when I was the Ugly Duckling WHAT THE MOON SAW Hear what the Moon told me I have seen a cadet promoted to be an officer and dressing himself for the first time in his gorgeous uniform I have seen young girls in bridal attire and the prince s young bride in her wedding dress but I never saw such bliss as that of a little four year old girl whom I watched this evening She had got a new blue dress and a new pink hat The finery was just put on and all were calling for light for the moonbeams that came through the window were not bright enough They wanted very different lights from that There stood the little girl stiff as a doll keeping her arms anxiously off her dress and her fingers stretched wide apart Oh what happiness beamed from her eyes from her whole face To morrow you may go to walk in the dress said the mother and the little one looked up at her hat and down again at her dress and smiled blissfully Mother she cried what will the little dogs think when they see me in all these fine clothes THE LOVERS From Riverside Literature Series eighteen ninety one by Houghton Mifflin company The Top and the Ball lay in a drawer among some other toys and so the Top said to the Ball Shall we not be lovers since we live together in the same drawer But the Ball which had a coat of morocco leather and thought herself as good as any fine lady had nothing to say to such a thing The next day came the little boy who owned the toys he painted the Top red and yellow and drove a brass nail into it and the Top looked splendidly when he turned round Look at me he cried to the Ball What do you say now Shall we not be lovers We go so nicely together You jump and I dance No one could be happier than we two should be Indeed Do you think so said the Ball Perhaps you do not know that my papa and my mamma were morocco slippers and that I have a cork inside me Yes but I am made of mahogany said the Top and the mayor himself turned me He has a turning lathe of his own and it amuses him greatly Can I depend on that asked the Ball May I never be whipped again if it is not true replied the Top You talk well for yourself said the Ball but I cannot do what you ask I am as good as half engaged to a swallow every time I leap up into the air he sticks his head out of the nest and says Will you will you And now I have silently said Yes and that is as good as being half engaged but I promise I will never forget you Much good that will do said the Top And they spoke no more to each other Next day the Ball was taken out The Top saw how she flew high into the air like a bird at last one could no longer see her Each time she came back again but always gave a high leap when she touched the earth and that came about either from her longing or because she had a cork in her body The ninth time the Ball stayed away and did not come back again and the boy looked and looked but she was gone I know very well where she is sighed the Top She is in the Swallow s nest and has married the Swallow The more the Top thought of this the more he longed for the Ball Just because he could not get her he fell more in love with her That she had taken some one else that was another thing So the Top danced around and hummed but always thought of the Ball which grew more and more lovely in his fancy Thus many years went by and now it was an old love And the Top was no longer young But one day he was gilt all over never had he looked so handsome he was now a golden Top and sprang till he hummed again Yes that was something But all at once he sprang too high and he was gone They looked and looked even in the cellar but he was not to be found Where was he He had jumped into the dust box where all kinds of things were lying cabbage stalks sweepings and gravel that had fallen down from the roof Here s a nice place to lie in The gilding will soon leave me here And what a rabble I ve come amongst And then he looked askance at a long cabbage stalk that was much too near him and at a curious round thing like an old apple but it was not an apple it was an old Ball which had lain for years in the roof gutter and was soaked through with water Thank goodness here comes one of us with whom one can talk said the little Ball and looked at the gilt Top I am really morocco sewn by a girl s hands and have a cork inside me but no one would think it to look at me I was very near marrying a swallow but I fell into the gutter on the roof and have laid there full five years and am quite soaked through That s a long time you may believe me for a young girl But the Top said nothing He thought of his old love and the more he heard the clearer it became to him that this was she Then came the servant girl and wanted to empty the dust box Aha there s a gilt top she cried And so the Top was brought again to notice and honor but nothing was heard of the Ball And the Top spoke no more of his old love for that dies away when the beloved has lain for five years in a gutter and got soaked through yes one does not know her again when one meets her in the dust box THE SNOW QUEEN From Riverside Literature Series eighteen ninety one by Houghton Mifflin company FOURTH STORY THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS Gerda was obliged to rest herself again when just over against where she sat a large Crow hopped over the white snow He had sat there a long while looking at her and shaking his head and now he said Caw caw Good day good day He could not say it better but he meant well by the little girl and asked her where she was going all alone out in the wide world The word alone Gerda understood quite well and felt how much lay in it so she told the Crow her whole history and asked if he had not seen Kay The Crow nodded very gravely and said It may be it may be What do you really think so cried the little girl and she nearly squeezed the Crow to death so much did she kiss him Gently gently said the Crow I think I know I think that it may be little Kay But now he has quite forgotten you for the Princess Does he live with a princess asked Gerda Yes listen said the Crow but it is hard for me to speak your language If you understand the Crow language I can tell you better No I have not learnt it said Gerda but my grandmother understands it I wish I had learnt it No matter said the Crow I will tell you as well as I can but it will be bad enough And then he told all he knew In the kingdom where we now are there lives a princess who is vastly clever for she has read all the newspapers in the whole world and has forgotten them again so clever is she Some time ago they say she was sitting on her throne which is no great fun after all when she began humming an old tune and it was just Oh why should I not be married Come now there is something in that said she and so then she was bound to marry but she would have a husband who knew how to give an answer when he was spoken to not one who was good for nothing but to stand and be looked at for that is very tiresome She then had all the ladies of the court drummed together and when they heard what she meant to do all were well pleased and said We are quite glad to hear it it is the very thing we were thinking of You may believe every word I say said the Crow for I have a tame sweetheart that hops about in the palace quite freely and she told me all The newspapers at once came out with a border of hearts and the initials of the Princess and you could read in them that every good looking young man was free to come to the palace and speak to the Princess and he who spoke in such wise as showed he felt himself at home there and talked best that one the Princess would choose for her husband Yes yes said the Crow you may believe it it is as true as I am sitting here People came in crowds there was a crush and a hurry but no one had good luck either on the first or second day They could all talk well enough when they were out in the street but as soon as they came inside the palace gates and saw the guard richly dressed in silver and the lackeys in gold on the staircase and the large lighted halls then they were dumb and when they stood before the throne on which the Princess was sitting all they could do was to repeat the last word she had said and she didn t care to hear that again It was just as if the people within were under a charm and had fallen into a trance till they came out again into the street for then oh then they could chatter enough There was a whole row of them from the town gates to the palace I was there myself to look on said the Crow They grew hungry and thirsty but from the palace they got not so much as a glass of water Some of the cleverest it is true had taken bread and butter with them but none shared it with his neighbor for each thought Let him look hungry and then the Princess won t have him But Kay little Kay asked Gerda when did he come Was he among the number Give me time give me time we are coming to him It was on the third day when a little personage without horse or carriage came marching right boldly up to the palace his eyes shone like yours he had beautiful long hair but his clothes were very shabby That was Kay cried Gerda with a voice of delight Oh now I ve found him and she clapped her hands He had a little knapsack at his back said the Crow No that was certainly his sled said Gerda for he went away with his sled That may be said the Crow I did not see him close to but I know from my tame sweetheart that when he came into the courtyard of the palace and saw the body guard in silver and the lackeys on the staircase in gold he was not in the least cast down he nodded and said to them It must be very tiresome to stand on the stairs for my part I shall go in The halls were bright with lights Court people and fine folks were walking about on bare feet it was all very solemn His boots creaked too very loudly but still he was not at all afraid That s Kay for certain said Gerda I know he had on new boots I have heard them creaking in grandmamma s room Yes they creaked said the Crow And on he went boldly up to the Princess who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning wheel All the ladies of the court stood about with their maids and their maids maids and all the gentlemen with their servants and their servants servants who kept a boy and the nearer they stood to the door the prouder they looked The boy of the servants servants who always goes in slippers hardly looked at one so very proudly did he stand in the doorway It must have been terrible said little Gerda And did Kay get the Princess Were I not a Crow I should have taken the Princess myself although I am engaged It is said he spoke as well as I speak when I talk crow language this I learned from my tame sweetheart He was bold and nicely behaved he had not come to woo the Princess but only to hear her wisdom She pleased him and he pleased her Yes yes for certain that was Kay said Gerda He was so clever he could do sums with fractions Oh won t you take me to the palace That is very easily said answered the Crow But how are we to manage it I ll speak to my tame sweetheart about it she can tell us what to do for so much I must tell you such a little girl as you are will never get leave to go in the common way Oh yes I shall said Gerda when Kay hears that I am here he will come out at once to fetch me Wait for me here on these steps said the Crow He wagged his head and flew away When it grew dark the Crow came back Caw caw said he I bring you a great many good wishes from her and here is a bit of bread for you She took it out of the kitchen where there is bread enough and you are hungry no doubt It is not possible for you to enter the palace for you are barefoot the guards in silver and the lackeys in gold would not allow it but do not cry you shall come in still My sweetheart knows a little back stair that leads to the chamber and she knows where she can get the key of it And they went into the garden by the broad path where one leaf was falling after the other and when the lights in the palace were all put out one after the other the Crow led little Gerda to the back door which stood ajar Oh how Gerda s heart beat with doubt and longing It was just as if she had been about to do something wrong and yet she only wanted to know if little Kay was there Yes he must be there She called to mind his clear eyes and his long hair so vividly she could quite see him as he used to laugh when they were sitting under the roses at home He would surely be glad to see her to hear what a long way she had come for his sake to know how unhappy all at home were when he did not come back Oh what a fright and what a joy it was Now they were on the stairs A single lamp was burning there and on the floor stood the tame Crow turning her head on every side and looking at Gerda who bowed as her grandmother had taught her to do My intended has told me so much good of you my dear young lady said the tame Crow Your Life as they call it is very affecting If you will take the lamp I will go before We will go straight on for we shall meet no one I think there is somebody just behind us said Gerda and it rushed past her It was like shadows on the wall horses with flowing manes and thin legs huntsmen ladies and gentlemen on horseback They are only dreams said the Crow They come to fetch the thoughts of the fine folk to the chase tis well for now you can see them asleep all the better But let me find when you come to have honor and fame that you possess a grateful heart Tut that s not worth talking about said the Crow from the woods Now they came into the first hall which was of rose colored satin with painted flowers on the wall Here the dreams were rushing past but they hurried by so quickly that Gerda could not see the fine people One hall was more showy than the other well might people be abashed and at last they came into the bed chamber The ceiling of the room was like a great palm tree with leaves of glass of costly glass and in the middle of the floor from a thick golden stalk hung two beds each of which was shaped like a lily One was white and in this lay the Princess the other was red and it was here that Gerda was to look for little Kay She bent back one of the red leaves and saw a brown neck oh that was Kay She called him quite loud by name held the lamp toward him the dreams rushed again on horseback into the chamber he awoke turned his head and it was not little Kay The Prince was only like him about the neck but he was young and handsome And out of the white lily leaves the Princess peeped too and asked what was the matter Then little Gerda cried and told her whole history and all that the Crows had done for her Poor little thing said the Prince and the Princess and they praised the Crows very much and told them they were not at all angry with them but they were not to do so again However they should have a reward Will you fly about at liberty asked the Princess or would you like to have a steady place as court Crows with all the broken bits from the kitchen And both the Crows nodded and begged for a steady place for they thought of their old age and said it was a good thing to have something for the old folks as the saying is And the Prince got up and let Gerda sleep in his bed and more than this he could not do She folded her little hands and thought How good men and animals are and then she shut her eyes and slept soundly All the dreams came flying in again and they now looked like the angels they drew a little sled on which Kay sat and nodded his head but the whole was only a dream and so it was all gone as soon as she awoke The next day she was dressed from top to toe in silk and velvet They offered to let her stay at the palace and lead a happy life but she begged only to have a little carriage with a horse in front and for a small pair of shoes then she said she would again go forth in the wide world and look for Kay And she got both shoes and a muff she was dressed very nicely too and when she was about to set off a new carriage stopped before the door It was of pure gold and the arms of the Prince and Princess shone like a star upon it the coachman the footmen and the outriders for outriders were there too all wore golden crowns The Prince and Princess helped her into the carriage themselves and wished her good luck The Crow of the woods who was now married went with her for the first three miles He sat beside Gerda for he could not bear riding backward the other Crow stood in the doorway and flapped her wings she could not go with Gerda because she suffered from headache since she had had a steady place and ate so much The carriage was lined inside with sugar plums and in the seats were fruits and cookies Good by good by cried Prince and Princess and little Gerda wept and the Crows wept Thus passed the first miles and then the Crow said good by and this was the worst good by of all He flew into a tree and beat his black wings as long as he could see the carriage that shone from afar like the clear sunlight THE NIGHTINGALE From Riverside Literature Series eighteen ninety one by Houghton Mifflin company I THE REAL NIGHTINGALE 
5569-40540-0000	train-other-500	In China you must know the Emperor is a Chinaman and all whom he has about him are Chinamen too It happened a good many years ago but that s just why it s worth while to hear the story before it is forgotten
5569-40540-0001	train-other-500	The Emperor s palace was the most splendid in the world It was made wholly of fine porcelain very costly but so brittle and so hard to handle that one had to take care how one touched it In the garden
5569-40540-0002	train-other-500	were to be seen the most wonderful flowers and to the prettiest of them silver bells were tied which tinkled so that nobody should pass by without noticing the flowers Yes everything in the Emperor s garden was nicely set out
5569-40540-0003	train-other-500	and it reached so far that the gardener himself did not know where the end was If a man went on and on he came into a glorious forest with high trees and deep lakes The wood went straight down to the sea
5569-40540-0004	train-other-500	which was blue and deep great ships could sail to and fro beneath the branches of the trees and in the trees lived a Nightingale which sang so finely that even the poor Fisherman who had many other things to do
5569-40540-0005	train-other-500	stopped still and listened when he had gone out at night to throw out his nets
none	none	 and heard the Nightingale 
5569-40540-0006	train-other-500	How beautiful that is he said but he had to attend to his work and so he forgot the bird But the next night when the bird sang again and the Fisherman heard it he said as before How beautiful that is
5569-40540-0007	train-other-500	From all the countries of the world travelers came to the city of the Emperor and admired it and the palace and the garden but when they heard the Nightingale they all said That is the best of all
5569-40540-0008	train-other-500	And the travelers told of it when they came home and the learned men wrote many books about the town the palace and the garden But they did not forget the Nightingale that was spoken of most of all
5569-40540-0009	train-other-500	and all those who were poets wrote great poems about the Nightingale in the wood by the deep lake The books went all over the world and a few of them once came to the Emperor He sat in his golden chair and read and read
5569-40540-0010	train-other-500	every moment he nodded his head for it pleased him to hear the fine things that were said about the city the palace and the garden But the Nightingale is the best of all it stood written there
none	none	 What s that exclaimed the Emperor The Nightingale 
5569-40540-0011	train-other-500	I don t know that at all Is there such a bird in my empire and in my garden to boot I ve never heard of that One has to read about such things Hereupon he called his Cavalier
5569-40540-0012	train-other-500	who was so grand that if any one lower in rank than he dared to speak to him or to ask him any question
none	none	 he answered nothing but P and that meant 
5569-40540-0013	train-other-500	nothing There is said to be a strange bird here called a Nightingale said the Emperor They say it is the best thing in all my great empire Why has no one ever told me anything about it
5569-40540-0014	train-other-500	I have never heard it named replied the Cavalier It has never been presented at court I command that it shall come here this evening and sing before me said the Emperor All the world knows what I have and I do not know it myself
5569-40540-0015	train-other-500	I have never heard it mentioned said the Cavalier I will seek for it I will find it But where was it to be found
none	none	 The Cavalier ran up and down all the stairs through halls and passages but no one among all those whom he met had heard talk of the Nightingale 
5569-40540-0016	train-other-500	And the Cavalier ran back to the Emperor and said that it must be a fable made up by those who write books Your Imperial Majesty must not believe what is written It is fiction and something that they call the black art
5569-40540-0017	train-other-500	But the book in which I read this said the Emperor was sent to me by the high and mighty Emperor of Japan and so it cannot be a falsehood I will hear the Nightingale It must be here this evening
5569-40540-0018	train-other-500	It has my high favor and if it does not come
none	none	 all the court shall be trampled upon after it has supped Tsing pe said the Cavalier 
5569-40540-0019	train-other-500	and again he ran up and down all the stairs and through all the halls and passages and half the court ran with him
none	none	 for the courtiers did not like being trampled upon 
5569-40540-0020	train-other-500	There was a great inquiry after the wonderful Nightingale which all the world knew but not the people at court
none	none	 At last they met with a poor little girl in the kitchen She said The Nightingale I know it well yes how it can sing 
5569-40540-0021	train-other-500	Every evening I get leave to carry my poor sick mother the scraps from the table She lives down by the beach and when I get back and am tired and rest in the wood then I hear the Nightingale sing And then the tears come into my eyes
none	none	 and it is just as if my mother kissed me 
5569-40540-0022	train-other-500	Little Kitchen girl said the Cavalier I will get you a fixed place in the kitchen with leave to see the Emperor dine if you will lead us to the Nightingale
none	none	 for it is promised for this evening 
5569-40540-0023	train-other-500	So they all went out into the wood where the Nightingale was wont to sing half the court went out When they were on the way a cow began to low Oh cried the court pages now we have it
none	none	 That shows a great power in so small a creature We have certainly heard it before No 
5569-40540-0024	train-other-500	those are cows mooing said the little Kitchen girl We are a long way from the place yet Now the frogs began to croak in the marsh Glorious said the Chinese Court Preacher Now I hear it
none	none	 it sounds just like little church bells No 
5569-40540-0025	train-other-500	those are frogs said the little Kitchen maid But now I think we shall soon hear it
none	none	 And then the Nightingale began to sing That is it exclaimed the little Girl 
5569-40540-0026	train-other-500	Listen listen and yonder it sits And she pointed to a little gray bird up in the boughs Is it possible cried the Cavalier
none	none	 I should never have thought it looked like that How simple it looks 
5569-40540-0027	train-other-500	It must certainly have lost its color at seeing so many famous people around Little Nightingale called the little Kitchen maid quite loudly our gracious Emperor wishes you to sing before him
none	none	 With the greatest pleasure replied the Nightingale 
5569-40540-0028	train-other-500	and sang so that it was a joy to hear it It sounds just like glass bells said the Cavalier And look
none	none	 at its little throat how it s working 
5569-40540-0029	train-other-500	It s wonderful that we should never have heard it before That bird will be a great success at court Shall I sing once more before the Emperor asked the Nightingale for it thought the Emperor was present
5569-40540-0030	train-other-500	My excellent little Nightingale said the Cavalier I have great pleasure in inviting you to a court festival this evening when you shall charm his Imperial Majesty with your beautiful singing
5569-40540-0031	train-other-500	My song sounds best in the greenwood replied the Nightingale still it came willingly when it heard what the Emperor wished
none	none	 In the palace there was a great brushing up The walls and the floor which were of porcelain shone with many thousand golden lamps 
5569-40540-0032	train-other-500	The most glorious flowers which could ring clearly had been placed in the halls There was a running to and fro and a draught of air but all the bells rang so exactly together that one could not hear any noise
none	none	 In the midst of the great hall where the Emperor sat a golden perch had been placed on which the Nightingale was to sit The whole court was there and the little Cook maid had leave to stand behind the door 
5569-40540-0033	train-other-500	as she had now received the title of a real cook maid
none	none	 All were in full dress and all looked at the little gray bird to which the Emperor nodded 
5569-40540-0034	train-other-500	And the Nightingale sang so gloriously that the tears came into the Emperor s eyes and the tears ran down over his cheeks and then the Nightingale sang still more sweetly
none	none	 that went straight to the heart The Emperor was happy 
5569-40540-0035	train-other-500	and he said the Nightingale should have his golden slipper to wear round its neck But the Nightingale thanked him
none	none	 it had already got reward enough 
5569-40540-0036	train-other-500	I have seen tears in the Emperor s eyes that is the real treasure to me An Emperor s tears have a strange power I am paid enough Then it sang again with a sweet glorious voice
5569-40540-0037	train-other-500	That s the most lovely way of making love I ever saw said the ladies who stood round about and then they took water in their mouths to gurgle when any one spoke to them They thought they should be nightingales too
5569-40540-0038	train-other-500	And the lackeys and maids let it be known that they were pleased too and that was saying a good deal for they are the hardest of all to please In short the Nightingale made a real hit
5569-40540-0039	train-other-500	It was now to remain at court to have its own cage with freedom to go out twice every day and once at night It had twelve servants and they all had a silken string tied to the bird s leg which they held very tight
5569-40540-0040	train-other-500	There was really no pleasure in going out The whole city spoke of the wonderful bird and when two people met one said nothing but Nightin and the other said gale and then they sighed and understood one another
5569-40540-0041	train-other-500	Eleven storekeepers children were named after the bird but not one of them could sing a note
none	none	 II THE TOY NIGHTINGALE 
5569-40540-0042	train-other-500	One day a large parcel came to the Emperor on which was written The Nightingale Here we have a new book about this famous bird said the Emperor But it was not a book
5569-40540-0043	train-other-500	it was a little work of art that lay in a box a toy nightingale which was to sing like a live one but it was all covered with diamonds rubies and sapphires
5569-40540-0044	train-other-500	So soon as the toy bird was wound up he could sing one of the pieces that the real one sang and then his tail moved up and down and shone with silver and gold Round his neck hung a little ribbon and on that was written
5569-40540-0045	train-other-500	The Emperor of Japan s Nightingale is poor beside that of the Emperor in China That is capital said they all
none	none	 and he who had brought the toy bird at once got the title Imperial Head Nightingale Bringer Now they must sing together what a duet that will be And so they had to sing together but it did not sound very well for the real Nightingale sang in its own way and the toy bird sang waltzes That s not its fault said the Play master it s quite perfect and very much in my style Now the toy bird was to sing alone It made just as much of a hit as the real one and then it was so much more fine to look at it shone like bracelets and breastpins 
5569-40540-0046	train-other-500	Three and thirty times over did it sing the same piece and yet was not tired The people would gladly have heard it again but the Emperor said that the living Nightingale ought to sing a little something But where was it
5569-40540-0047	train-other-500	No one had noticed that it had flown away out of the open window back to its green woods But what is become of it asked the Emperor Then all the courtiers scolded and thought the Nightingale was a very thankless creature
none	none	 We have the best bird after all said they 
5569-40540-0048	train-other-500	And so the toy bird had to sing again and this was the thirty fourth time they had listened to the same piece For all that they did not know it quite by heart for it was so very difficult And the Play master praised the bird highly
5569-40540-0049	train-other-500	yes he declared that it was better than the real Nightingale not only in its feathers and its many beautiful diamonds but inside as well For you see ladies and gentlemen and above all your Imperial Majesty
none	none	 with the real Nightingale one can never make sure what is coming 
5569-40540-0050	train-other-500	but in this toy bird everything is settled It is just so and not any other way One can explain it one can open it and can show how much thought went to making it
5569-40540-0051	train-other-500	where the waltzes come from how they go and how one follows another Those are quite our own ideas they all said And the Play master got leave to show the bird to the people on the next Sunday The people were to hear it sing too said the Emperor
5569-40540-0052	train-other-500	and they did hear it and were as much pleased as if they had all had tea for that s quite the Chinese fashion and they all said Oh and held their forefingers up in the air and nodded But the poor Fisherman who had heard the real Nightingale said
none	none	 It sounds pretty enough and it s a little like but there s something wanting though I know not what 
5569-40540-0053	train-other-500	The real Nightingale was exiled from the land and empire The toy bird had its place on a silken cushion close to the Emperor s bed All the presents it had received gold and precious stones
5569-40540-0054	train-other-500	were ranged about it In title it had come to be High Imperial After Dinner Singer and in rank it was Number One on the left hand for the Emperor reckoned that side the most important on which the heart is placed
5569-40540-0055	train-other-500	and even in an Emperor the heart is on the left side
none	none	 And the Play master wrote a work of five and twenty volumes about the toy bird it was so learned and so long full of the most difficult Chinese words that all the people said they had read it and understood it or else they would have been thought stupid and would have had their bodies trampled on So a whole year went by The Emperor the court and all the other Chinese knew every little twitter in the toy bird s song by heart But just for that reason it pleased them best they could sing with it themselves and they did so The street boys sang Tsi tsi tsi glug glug and the Emperor himself sang it too Yes that was certainly famous But one evening when the toy bird was singing its best and the Emperor lay in bed and heard it something inside the bird said Svup Something cracked Whir r r All the wheels ran round and then the music stopped The Emperor jumped at once out of bed and had his own doctor called but what could he do Then they sent for a watchmaker and after a good deal of talking and looking he got the bird into some sort of order but he said that it must be looked after a good deal for the barrels were worn and he could not put new ones in in such a manner that the music would go There was a great to do only once in a year did they dare to let the bird sing and that was almost too much But then the Play master made a little speech full of heavy words 
5569-40540-0056	train-other-500	and said this was just as good as before and so of course it was as good as before
none	none	 III THE REAL NIGHTINGALE AGAIN 
5569-40540-0057	train-other-500	Five years had gone by and a real grief came upon the whole nation The Chinese were really fond of their Emperor and now he was sick and could not it was said live much longer
5569-40540-0058	train-other-500	Already a new Emperor had been chosen and the people stood out in the street and asked the Cavalier how their old Emperor did
none	none	 P said he and shook his head 
5569-40540-0059	train-other-500	Cold and pale lay the Emperor in his great gorgeous bed the whole court thought him dead and each one ran to pay respect to the new ruler The chamberlains ran out to talk it over
5569-40540-0060	train-other-500	and the ladies maids had a great coffee party
none	none	 All about in all the halls and passages 
5569-40540-0061	train-other-500	cloth had been laid down so that no one could be heard go by and therefore it was quiet there quite quiet But the Emperor was not dead yet
5569-40540-0062	train-other-500	stiff and pale he lay on the gorgeous bed with the long velvet curtains and the heavy gold tassels high up a window stood open and the moon shone in upon the Emperor and the toy bird
5569-40540-0063	train-other-500	The poor Emperor could scarcely breathe it was just as if something lay upon his breast He opened his eyes and then he saw that it was Death who sat upon his breast and had put on his golden crown
5569-40540-0064	train-other-500	and held in one hand the Emperor s sword and in the other his beautiful banner And all around from among the folds of the splendid velvet curtains strange heads peered forth a few very ugly
5569-40540-0065	train-other-500	the rest quite lovely and mild These were all the Emperor s bad and good deeds that stood before him now that Death sat upon his heart Do you remember this whispered one to the other Do you remember that
none	none	 and then they told him so much that the sweat ran from his forehead I did not know that said the Emperor Music music the great Chinese drum he cried 
5569-40540-0066	train-other-500	so that I need not hear all they say And they kept on and Death nodded like a Chinaman to all they said Music music cried the Emperor
none	none	 You little precious golden bird sing sing I have given you gold and costly presents I have even hung my golden slipper around your neck now sing But the bird stood still 
5569-40540-0067	train-other-500	no one was there to wind him up and he could not sing without that but Death kept on staring at the Emperor with his great hollow eyes and it was quiet fearfully quiet Then there sounded
5569-40540-0068	train-other-500	close by the window the most lovely song It was the little live Nightingale that sat outside on a spray It had heard of the Emperor s need and had come to sing to him of trust and hope
5569-40540-0069	train-other-500	And as it sang the spectres grew paler and paler the blood ran more and more quickly through the Emperor s weak limbs and Death himself listened and said Go on little Nightingale go on But will you give me that splendid golden sword
none	none	 Will you give me that rich banner 
5569-40540-0070	train-other-500	Will you give me the Emperor s crown And Death gave up each of these treasures for a song And the Nightingale sang on and on it sang of the quiet churchyard where the white roses grow
5569-40540-0071	train-other-500	where the elder blossom smells sweet and where the fresh grass is wet with the tears of mourners Then Death felt a longing to see his garden and floated out at the window in the form of a cold white mist
5569-40540-0072	train-other-500	Thanks thanks said the Emperor You heavenly little bird I know you well I drove you from my land and empire and yet you have charmed away the evil faces from my bed
5569-40540-0073	train-other-500	and driven Death from my heart How can I pay you You have paid me replied the Nightingale I drew tears from your eyes the first time I sang I shall never forget that
5569-40540-0074	train-other-500	Those are the jewels that make a singer s heart glad But now sleep and grow fresh and strong again I will sing you something And it sang and the Emperor fell into a sweet sleep
5569-40540-0075	train-other-500	Ah how mild and refreshing that sleep was The sun shone upon him through the windows when he awoke strong and sound Not one of his servants had yet come back for they all thought that he was dead
5569-40540-0076	train-other-500	but the Nightingale still sat beside him and sang You must always stay with me said the Emperor You shall sing as you please and I ll break the toy bird into a thousand pieces Not so replied the Nightingale
5569-40540-0077	train-other-500	It did well as long as it could keep it as you have done till now I cannot build my nest in the palace to dwell in it but let me come when I feel the wish
none	none	 then I will sit in the evening on the spray yonder by the window and sing for you 
5569-40540-0078	train-other-500	so that you may be glad and thoughtful at once I will sing of those who are happy and of those who suffer I will sing of good and of evil that remain hidden round about you The little singing bird flies far around
5569-40540-0079	train-other-500	to the poor fisherman to the peasant s roof to every one who dwells far away from you and from your court I love your heart more than your crown and yet the crown has an air of sanctity about it I will come and sing to you
5569-40540-0080	train-other-500	but one thing you must promise me Everything said the Emperor and he stood there in his royal robes which he had put on himself and pressed the sword which was heavy with gold to his heart One thing I beg of you
none	none	 tell no one 
5569-40540-0081	train-other-500	that you have a little bird who tells you everything Then all will go well
none	none	 And the Nightingale flew away The servants came in to look on their dead Emperor and yes there he stood and the Emperor said Good morning THE MARKET PLACE AT ODENSE eighteen thirty six From The Story of My Life If the reader was a child who lived in Odense he would just need to say the words saint Knud s Fair and it would rise before him in the brightest colors lighted by the beams of childish fancy Somewhere near the middle of the town five streets meet and make a little square There the town crier in striped homespun with a yellow bandoleer beat his drum and proclaimed from a scroll the splendid things to be seen in the town He beats a good drum said the chamberlain It would delight Spontini and Rossini to hear the fellow said William Really Odense at New Year would just suit these composers The drums and fifes are in their glory They drum the New Year in Seven or eight little drummers or fifers go from door to door with troops of children and old women and they beat the drum taps and the reveille That fetches the pennies Then when the New Year is well drummed in the city they go into the country and drum for meat and porridge The drumming in of the New Year lasts until Lent And then we have new sports said the chamberlain The fishers come from Stege with a full band and on their shoulders a boat with all sorts of flags Then they lay a board between two boats and on this two of the youngest and spryest wrestle till one falls into the water But all the fun s gone now When I was young there was different sport going That was a sight the corporation procession with the banners and the harlequin atop and at Shrovetide when the butchers led about an ox decked with ribbons and carnival twigs with a boy on his back with wings and a little shirt All that s past now people are got so fine saint Knud s Fair is not what it used to be Well I m glad it isn t said William but let us go into the market and look at the Jutlanders who are sitting with their pottery amidst the hay Just as the various professions in the Middle Ages had each its quarter so here the shoemakers had ranged their tables side by side and behind them stood the skillful workman in his long coat and with his well brushed felt hat in his hand Where the shoemakers quarter ended the hatters began and there one was in the midst of the great market where tents and booths formed many parallel streets The milliners the goldsmiths the pastry cooks with booths of canvas and wood were the chief attractions Ribbons and handkerchiefs fluttered Noise and bustle was everywhere The girls from the same village always went in rows seven or eight inseparables with hands fast clasped It was impossible to break the chain and if you tried to pass through the whole band wound itself into a clump Behind the booth was a great space with wooden shoes pottery turners and saddlers wares Rude and rough toys were spread on tables Around them children were trying little trumpets or moving about the playthings Country girls twirled and twisted the work boxes and themselves many a time before making their bargain The air was thick and heavy with odors that were spiced with the smell of honey cake On Fair day saint Knud s Church and all its tombs are open to the public From whatever side you look at this fine old building it has something imposing with its high tower and spire The interior produces the same perhaps a greater effect But its full impression is not felt on entering it nor until you get to the main aisle There all is grand beautiful light The whole interior is bright with gilding Up in the high vaulted roof there shine since old time a multitude of golden stars On both sides high up above the side aisles are great gothic windows from which the light streams down The side aisles are painted with oil portraits whole families women and children all in clerical dress with long gowns and deep ruffs Usually the figures are ranged by ages the eldest first and then down to the very smallest They all stand with folded hands and look piously down before them till their colors have gradually faded away in dust THE ANDERSEN JUBILEE AT ODENSE From The Story of My Life I heard on the morning of December sixth eighteen sixty seven that the town was decorated that all the schools had a holiday because it was my festival I felt myself as humble meek and poor as though I stood before my God Every weakness or error or sin in thought word and deed was revealed to me All stood out strangely clear in my soul as though it were doomsday and it was my festival God knows how humble I felt when men exalted and honored me so Then came the first telegram from the Student Club I saw that they shared and did not envy my joy Then came a dispatch from a private club of students in Copenhagen and from the Artisans Club of Slagelse You will remember that I went to school in that town and was therefore attached to it Soon followed messages from sympathetic friends in Aarhuus in Stege telegram on telegram from all around One of these was read aloud by Privy Councillor Koch It was from the king The assembly burst out in applause Every cloud and shadow in my soul vanished How happy I was And yet man must not exalt himself I was to feel that I was only a poor child of humanity bound by the frailty of earth I suffered from a dreadful toothache which was increased unbearably by the heat and excitement Yet at evening I read a Wonder Story for the little friends Then the deputation came from the town corporations with torches and waving banners through the street to the guild hall And now the prophecy was to be fulfilled that the old woman gave when I left home as a boy Odense was to be illuminated for me I stepped to the open window All was aglow with torchlight the square was filled with people Songs swelled up to me I was overcome emotionally Physically racked with pain I could not enjoy this crowning fruit of my life the toothache was so intolerable The ice cold air that blew against me fanned the pain to an awful intensity and instead of enjoying the bliss of these never to be repeated moments I looked at the printed song to see how many verses had to be sung before I could step away from the torture which the cold air sent through my teeth It was the acme of suffering As the glow of the piled up torches subsided my pain subsided too How thankful I was though Gentle eyes were fastened upon me all around All wanted to speak with me to press my hand Tired out I reached the bishop s house and sought rest But I got no sleep till toward morning so filled and overflowing was I MISERERE IN THE SIXTINE CHAPEL From The Improvisatore Translation by Mary Howitt On Wednesday afternoon began the Miserere in the Sixtine Chapel My soul longed for music in the world of melody I could find sympathy and consolation The throng was great even within the chapel the foremost division was already filled with ladies Magnificent boxes hung with velvet and golden draperies for royal personages and foreigners from various courts were here erected so high that they looked out beyond the richly carved railing which separated the ladies from the interior of the chapel The papal Swiss Guards stood in their bright festal array The officers wore light armor and in their helmets a waving plume The old cardinals entered in their magnificent scarlet velvet cloaks with their white ermine capes and seated themselves side by side in a great half circle within the barrier while the priests who had carried their trains seated themselves at their feet By the little side door of the altar the holy father now entered in his scarlet mantle and silver tiara He ascended his throne Bishops swung the vessels of incense around him while young priests in scarlet vestments knelt with lighted torches in their hands before him and the high altar The reading of the lessons began But it was impossible to keep the eyes fixed on the lifeless letters of the Missal they raised themselves with the thoughts to the vast universe which Michael Angelo has breathed forth in colors upon the ceiling and the walls I contemplated his mighty sibyls and wondrously glorious prophets every one of them a subject for a painting My eyes drank in the magnificent processions the beautiful groups of angels they were not to me painted pictures all stood living before me The rich tree of knowledge from which Eve gave the fruit to Adam the Almighty God who floated over the waters not borne up by angels as the older masters had represented him no the company of angels rested upon him and his fluttering garments It is true I had seen these pictures before but never as now had they seized upon me My excited state of mind the crowd of people perhaps even the lyric of my thoughts made me wonderfully alive to poetical impressions and many a poet s heart has felt as mine did The bold foreshortenings the determinate force with which every figure steps forward is amazing and carries one quite away It is a spiritual Sermon on the Mount in color and form Like Raphael we stand in astonishment before the power of Michael Angelo Every prophet is a Moses like that which he formed in marble What giant forms are those which seize upon our eye and our thoughts as we enter But when intoxicated with this view let us turn our eyes to the background of the chapel whose whole wall is a high altar of art and thought The great chaotic picture from the floor to the roof shows itself there like a jewel of which all the rest is only the setting We see there the Last Judgment Christ stands in judgment upon the clouds and his Mother and the Apostles stretch forth their hands beseechingly for the poor human race The dead raise the gravestones under which they have lain blessed spirits adoring float upward to God while the abyss seizes its victims Here one of the ascending spirits seeks to save his condemned brother whom the abyss already embraces in its snaky folds The children of despair strike their clenched fists upon their brows and sink into the depths In bold foreshortenings float and tumble whole legions between heaven and earth The sympathy of the angels the expression of lovers who meet the child that at the sound of the trumpet clings to the mother s breast are so natural and beautiful that one believes one s self to be among those who are waiting for judgment Michael Angelo has expressed in colors what Dante saw and has sung to the generations of the earth The descending sun at that moment threw his last beams in through the uppermost window Christ and the blessed around him were strongly lighted up while the lower part where the dead arose and the demons thrust their boat laden with the damned from the shore were almost in darkness Just as the sun went down the last lesson was ended the last light which now remained was extinguished and the whole picture world vanished in the gloom from before me but in that same moment burst forth music and singing That which color had bodily revealed arose now in sound the day of judgment with its despair and its exultation resounded above us The father of the church stripped of his papal pomp stood before the altar and prayed to the holy cross and upon the wings of the trumpet resounded the trembling choir Populus meus quid feci tibi Soft angel tones rose above the deep song tones which ascended not from a human breast it was not a man s nor a woman s it belonged to the world of spirits it was like the weeping of angels dissolved in melody ANEURIN Sixth Century A D Among the triad of singers Llywarch prince and bard Aneurin warrior and bard and Taliessin bard only who were among the followers of the heroic British chief Urien when he bravely but unsuccessfully resisted the invasion of the victorious Angles and Saxons Aneurin was famous both as poet and warrior He sang of the long struggle that eventually was to turn Briton into England and celebrated in his Gododin ninety of the fallen Cymric chiefs The notes of his life are scanty and are drawn chiefly from his allusion to himself in his poem He was the son of Cwm Cawlwyd a chief of the tribe of Gododin He seems to have been educated at saint Cadoc s College at Llancarvan and afterwards entered the bardic order As appears from the Gododin he was present at the battle of Cattraeth both as bard and as priest He fled but was taken prisoner In his poem he refers to the hardships he endured in his captivity After his release he returned to Llancarvan Wales and in his old age he went north to live with his brother in Galloway Here he was murdered his death is referred to as one of the three accursed hatchet strokes of the isle of Britain His friendship with Taliessin is commemorated by both bards The Gododin is at once the longest and the most important composition in early Welsh literature It has been variously interpreted but is thought to celebrate the battle of Cattraeth This battle was fought in five hundred seventy between the Britons who had formed a league to defend their country and their Teutonic invaders It began on a Tuesday lasted for a week and ended with great slaughter of the Britons who fought desperately till they perished on the field Three hundred and sixty chieftains were slain only three escaped by flight among whom was Aneurin who afterwards commemorated the slaughter in the Gododin a lament for the dead Ninety seven of the stanzas remain In various measures of alliterative and assonant verse they sing the praises of ninety of the fallen chiefs usually giving one stanza to each hero One of these stanzas is known to readers of Gray who translated it under the name of The Death of Hoel Again the Gododin is assumed to be like many early epic poems whose origin is wrapped in mystery not the commemoration of one single particular event but a collection of lays composed at various times which compresses into one battle the long and disastrous period of the Anglo Saxon invasion ending in the subjugation of the Britons But whatever its history the Gododin is one of the finest monuments of Cymric literature In the brevity of the narrative the careless boldness of the actors as they present themselves the condensed energy of the action and the fierce exultation of the slaughter together with the recurring elegiac note this poem or poems if it be the work of two authors has some of the highest epic qualities The ideas and manners are in harmony with the age and the country to which it is referred Like all early songs the poem was handed down through centuries by oral tradition It is now preserved in the Book of Aneurin a small quarto manuscript of nineteen leaves of vellum of the end of the thirteenth century The Gododin has been published with an English translation and notes by the reverend J Williams eighteen fifty two and by the Cymmrodorion Society with a translation by Thomas Stevens in eighteen eighty five Interesting information covering it may be found in Skene s Four Ancient Books of Wales eighteen sixty six and in the article Celtic Literature in this work THE SLAYING OF OWAIN During the battle a conference was held at which the British leaders demanded as a condition of peace that part of the land of Gododin be restored In reply the Saxons killed Owain one of the greatest of the Cymric bards Aneurin thus pictures him A man in thought a boy in form He stoutly fought and sought the storm Of flashing war that thundered far His courser lank and swift thick maned Bore on his flank as on he strained The light brown shield as on he sped With golden spur in cloak of fur His blue sword gleaming Be there said No word of mine that does not hold thee dear Before thy youth had tasted bridal cheer The red death was thy bride The ravens feed On thee yet straining to the front to lead Owain the friend I loved is dead Woe is it that on him the ravens feed THE FATE OF HOEL SON OF THE GREAT CIAN From various expressions used by Aneurin in different parts of his great poem it is evident that the warriors of whom he sang fortified themselves before entering the field of battle with unstinted libations of that favorite intoxicant of those days sweet mead He mentions the condition of the warriors as they started for the fray and tells of Hoel s fate This son of Cian had married the daughter of one of the Bryneish His marriage caused no abatement of a feud existing between the tribes to which the husband and wife respectively belonged He repudiated her family disdained to take her away and was sought and slain by her insulted father The warriors marched to Cattraeth full of mead Drunken but firm of array great the shame But greater the valor no bard can defame The war dogs fought fiercely red swords seemed to bleed Flesh and soul I had slain thee myself had I thought Son of Cian my friend that thy faith had been bought By a bribe from the tribe of the Bryneish But no He scorned to take dowry from hands of the foe And I all unhurt lost a friend in the fight Whom the wrath of a father felled down for the slight THE GIANT GWRVELING FALLS AT LAST The bard tells the story of Gwrveling s revelry impulsive bravery and final slaughter of the foe before yielding to their prowess Light of lights the sun Leader of the day First to rise and run His appointed way Crowned with many a ray Seeks the British sky Sees the flight s dismay Sees the Britons fly The horn in Eiddin s hall Had sparkled with the wine And thither at a call To drink and be divine He went to share the feast Of reapers wine and mead He drank and so increased His daring for wild deed The reapers sang of war That lifts its shining wings Its shining wings of fire Its shields that flutter far The bards too sang of war Of plumed and crested war The song rose ever higher Not a shield Escapes the shock To the field They fiercely flock There to fall But of all Who struck on giant Gwrveling Whom he would he struck again All he struck in grave were lain Ere the bearers came to bring To his grave stout Gwrveling ANGLO SAXON LITERATURE BY ROBERT SHARP The earliest recorded utterances of a race whether in poetry or in prose become to the representatives of this race in later days a treasure beyond price The value of such monuments of the remote past is manifold In them we first begin to become really acquainted with ancestors of the people of to day even though we may have read in the pages of earlier writers of alien descent much that is of great concurrent interest Through the medium of the native saga epic and meagre chronicle we see for the first time their real though dim outlines moving in and out of the mists that obscure the dawn of history and these outlines become more and more distinct as the literary remains of succeeding periods become more abundant and present more varied aspects of life We come gradually to know what manner of men and women were these ancestors what in peace and in war were their customs what their family and social relations their food and drink their dress their systems of law and government their religion and morals what were their art instincts what were their ideals This is essential material for the construction of history in its complete sense And this evidence when subjected to judicious criticism is trustworthy for the ancient story teller and poet reflects the customs and ideas and ideals of his own time even though the combination of agencies and the preternatural proportions of the actors and their deeds belong to the imagination The historian must know how to supplement and to give life and interest to the colorless succession of dates names and events of the chronicler by means of these imaginative yet truth bearing creations of the poet Remnants of ancient poetry and legend have again an immediate value in proportion as they exhibit a free play of fine imagination that is according as they possess the power of stirring to response the aesthetic feeling of subsequent ages as they possess the true poetic quality This gift of imagination varies greatly among races as among individuals and the earliest manifestations of it frequently throw a clear light upon apparently eccentric tendencies developed in a literature in later times For these reasons added to a natural family pride in them the early literary monuments of the Anglo Saxons should be cherished by us as among the most valued possessions of the race The first Teutonic language to be reduced to writing was the Moeso Gothic Considerable portions of a translation of the Bible into that language made by Bishop Ulfilas in the fourth century still remain But this cannot be called the beginning of a literature for there is no trace of original creative impulse The Gothic movement too seems to have ceased immediately after its beginning It is elsewhere that we must seek for the rise of a real Teutonic literature We shall not find it till after the lapse of several centuries and we find it not among the tribes that remained in the fatherland nor with those that had broken into and conquered parts of the Roman empire only to be absorbed and to blend with other races into Romanic nations The proud distinction belongs to the Low German tribes that had created an England in Britain The conquest of Britain by the Anglo Saxons begun in four hundred forty nine seemed at first to promise only retrogression and the ruin of an existing civilization These fierce barbarians found among the Celts of Britain a Roman culture and the Christian religion exerting its influence for order and humanity Their mission seemed to be to destroy both In their original homes in the forests of northern Germany they had come little if at all into contact with Roman civilization At any rate we may assume that they had felt no Roman influence capable of stemming their national and ethnical tendencies We cannot yet solve the difficult problem of the extent of their mingling with the conquered Celts in Britain In spite of learned opinions to the contrary the evidence now available seems to point to only a small infusion of Celtic blood The conquerors seem to have settled down to their new homes with all the heathenism and most of the barbarism they had brought from their old home a Teutonic people still In these ruthless plundering barbarians whose very breath was battle and who seemed for the time the very genius of disorder and ruin there existed nevertheless potentialities of humanity order and enlightenment far exceeding those of the system they displaced In all their barbarism there was a certain nobility their courage was unflinching the fidelity even unto death of thane to lord repaid the open handed generosity of lord to thane they honored truth and even after we allow for the exaggerated claims made for a chivalrous devotion that did not exist we find that they held their women in higher respect than was usual even among many more enlightened peoples There are few more remarkable narratives in history than that of the facility and enthusiasm with which the Anglo Saxons a people conservative then as now to the degree of extreme obstinacy accepted Christianity and the new learning which followed in the train of the new religion After a few lapses into paganism in some localities we find these people who lately had swept Christian Britain with fire and sword themselves became most zealous followers of Christ Under the influence of the Roman missionaries who under saint Augustine had begun their work in the south in five hundred ninety seven among the Saxons and Jutes and under the combined influence of Irish and Roman missionaries in the north and east among the Angles theological and secular studies were pursued with avidity By the end of the seventh century we find Anglo Saxon missionaries with saint Boniface at their head carrying Christianity and enlightenment to the pagan German tribes on the Continent The torch had been passed to the Anglo Saxon and a new centre of learning York the old Roman capital now the chief city of the Northumbrian Angles became famous throughout Europe Indeed York seemed for a time the chief hope for preserving and advancing Christian culture for the danger of a relapse into dense ignorance had become imminent in the rest of Europe Bede born about six hundred seventy three a product of this Northumbrian culture represented the highest learning of his day He wrote a vast number of works in Latin treating nearly all the branches of knowledge existing in his day Alcuin another Northumbrian born about seven hundred thirty five was called by Charlemagne to be tutor for himself and his children and to organize the educational system of his realm Other great names might be added to show the extent and brilliancy of the new learning It was more remarkable among the Angles and only at a later day when the great schools of the north had gone up in fire and smoke in the pitiless invasion of the Northmen did the West Saxons become the leaders almost the only representatives of the literary impulse among the Anglo Saxons It is significant that the first written English that we know of contains the first Christian English king s provision for peace and order in his kingdom The laws of Athelbert King of Kent who died in six hundred sixteen were written down early in the seventh century This code as it exists is the oldest surviving monument of English prose The laws of Ine King of the West Saxons were put into writing about six hundred ninety These collections can scarcely be said to have a literary value but they are of the utmost importance as throwing light upon the early customs of our race and the laws of Ine may be considered as the foundation of modern English law Many of these laws were probably much older but they were now first codified and systematically enforced The language employed is direct almost crabbed but occasionally the Anglo Saxon love of figure shows itself To illustrate I quote after Brooke from Earle s Anglo Saxon Literature page one hundred fifty three In case any one burn a tree in a wood and it came to light who did it let him pay the full penalty and give sixty shillings because fire is a thief If one fell in a wood ever so many trees and it be found out afterwards let him pay for three trees each with thirty shillings He is not required to pay for more of them however many they may be because the axe is a reporter and not a thief The italicized sentences are evidently current sayings But even these remains important and interesting as they are may not be called the beginning of a vernacular literature It is among the Angles of Northumbria that we shall find the earliest native and truly literary awakening in England Here we perceive the endeavor to do something more than merely to aid the memory of men in preserving necessary laws and records of important events The imagination had become active The impulse was felt to give expression to deep emotions to sing the deeds and noble character of some hero embodying the loftiest ideals of the time and the race to utter deep religious feeling There was an effort to do this in a form showing harmony in theme and presentation Here we find displayed a feeling for art often crude but still a true and native impulse This activity produced or gave definite form to the earliest Anglo Saxon poetry a poetry often of a very high quality perhaps never of the highest but always of intense interest We may claim even a greater distinction for the early fruit of Anglo Saxon inspiration mister Stopford Brooke says With the exception of perhaps a few Welsh and Irish poems it is the only vernacular poetry in Europe outside of the classic tongues which belongs to so early a time as the seventh and eighth centuries The oldest of these poems belong in all save their final form to the ancient days in Northern Germany They bear evidence of transmission with varying details from gleeman to gleeman till they were finally carried over to England and there edited often with discordant interpolations and modifications by Christian scribes Tacitus tells us that at his time songs or poems were a marked feature in the life of the Germans but we cannot trace the clue further To these more ancient poems many others were added by Christian Northumbrian poets and we find that a large body of poetry had grown up in the North before the movement was entirely arrested by the destroying Northmen Not one of these poems unless we except a few fragmentary verses has come down to us in the Northumbrian dialect Fortunately they had been transcribed by the less poetically gifted West Saxons into theirs and it is in this form that we possess them This poetry shows in subject and in treatment very considerable range We have a great poem epic in character poems partly narrative and partly descriptive poems that may be classed as lyric or elegiac in character a large body of verse containing a paraphrase of portions of the Bible a collection of Riddles poems on animals with morals and others difficult to classify The regular verse form was the alliterative four accent line broken by a strongly marked caesura into two half lines which were in early editions printed as short lines The verse was occasionally extended to six accents In the normal verse there were two alliterated words in the first half of the line each of which received a strong accent in the second half there was one accented word in alliteration with the alliterated words in the first half and one other accented word not in alliteration A great license was allowed as to the number of unaccented syllables and as to their position in regard to the accented ones and this lent great freedom and vigor to the verse When well constructed and well read it must have been very effective There were of course many variations from the normal number three of alliterated words as it would be impossible to find so many for every line Something of the quality of this verse form may be felt in translations which aim at the same effect Notice the result in the following from Professor Gummere s version of as election from Beowulf Then the warriors went as the way was showed to them Under Heorot s roof the hero stepped Hardy neath helm till the hearth he neared In these verses it will be noted that the alliteration is complete in the first and third and that in the second it is incomplete A marked feature of the Anglo Saxon poetry is parallelism or the repetition of an idea by means of new phrases or epithets most frequently within the limits of a single sentence This proceeds from the desire to emphasize attributes ascribed to the deity or to some person or object prominent in the sentence But while the added epithets have often a cumulative force and are picturesque yet it must be admitted that they sometimes do not justify their introduction This may be best illustrated by an example The following in the translation of Earle is Caedmon s first hymn composed between six hundred fifty eight and six hundred eighty and the earliest piece of Anglo Saxon poetry that we know to have had its origin in England Now shall we glorify the guardian of heaven s realm The Maker s might and the thought of his mind The work of the Glory Father how He of every wonder He the Lord eternal laid the foundation He shaped erst for the sons of men Heaven their roof Holy Creator The middle world He mankind s sovereign Eternal captain afterwards created The land for men Lord Almighty Many of the figurative expressions are exceedingly vigorous and poetic some to our taste not so much so Note the epithets in the lank wolf the wan raven bird greedy for slaughter the dewy winged eagle dusky coated crooked beaked horny beaked the maid fair cheeked curly locked elf bright To the Anglo Saxon poet much that we call metaphorical was scarcely more than literal statement As the object pictured itself to his responsive imagination he expressed it with what was to him a direct realism His lines are filled with a profusion of metaphors of every degree of effectiveness To him the sea was the water street the swan path the strife of the waves the whale path the ship was the foamy necked floater the wave farer the sea wood the sea horse the arrow was the battle adder the battle was spear play sword play the prince was the ring giver the gold friend the throne was the gift stool the body the bone house the mind the breast hoard Indeed as it has been pointed out by many writers the metaphor is almost the only figure of the Anglo Saxon poetry The more developed simile belongs to a riper and more reflective culture and is exceedingly rare in this early native product It has been noted that Beowulf a poem of three thousand one hundred and eighty four lines contains only four or five simple similes and only one that is fully carried out The ship glides away likest to a bird The monster s eyes gleam like fire are simple examples cited by Ten Brink who gives also the elaborate one The sword hilt melted likened to ice when the Father looseneth the chain of frost and unwindeth the wave ropes But even this simile is almost obliterated by the crowding metaphors Intensity an almost abrupt directness a lack of explanatory detail are more general characteristics though in greatly varying degrees As some critic has well said the Anglo Saxon poet seems to presuppose a knowledge of his subject matter by those he addresses Such a style is capable of great swiftness of movement and is well suited to rapid description and narrative but at times roughness or meagreness results The prevailing tone is one of sadness In the lyric poetry this is so decided that all the Anglo Saxon lyrics have been called elegies This note seems to be the echo of the struggle with an inhospitable climate dreary with rain ice hail and snow and of the uncertainties of life and the certainty of death Suffering was never far off and everything was in the hands of Fate This is true at least of the earlier poetry and the note is rarely absent even in the Christian lyrics A more cheerful strain is sometimes heard as in the Riddles but it is rather the exception and any alleged humor is scarcely more than a suspicion Love and sentiment in the modern sense are not made the subject of Anglo Saxon poetry and this must mean that they did not enter into the Anglo Saxon life with the same intensity as into modern life The absence of this beautiful motive has to some degree its compensation in the exceeding moral purity of the whole literature It is doubtful whether it has its equal in this respect Anglo Saxon prose displays as a general thing a simple direct and clear style There is of course a considerable difference between the prose of the earlier and that of the later period and individual writers show peculiarities It displays throughout a marked contrast with the poetic style in its freedom from parallelisms in thought and phrase from inversions archaisms and the almost excessive wealth of metaphor and epithet In its early stages there is apparent perhaps a poverty of resource a lack of flexibility but this charge cannot be sustained against the best prose of the later period In the translations from the Latin it shows a certain stiffness and becomes sometimes involved in the too conscientious effort of the translator to follow the classic original No attempt will be made here to notice or even to name all the large number of literary works of the Anglo Saxons It must be sufficient to examine briefly a few of the most important and characteristic productions of this really remarkable and prolific movement The Song of Widsith the Far Traveler is now generally conceded to be in part at least the oldest existing Anglo Saxon poem We do not know when it assumed its present form but it is certain that it was after the conversion of the Anglo Saxons since it has interpolations from the Christian scribe The poem seems to give evidence of being a growth from an original song by a wandering scop or poet who claims to have visited the Gothic king Eormanric the grim violator of treaties who died in three hundred seventy five or three hundred seventy six But other kings are mentioned who lived in the first half of the sixth century It is probable then that it was begun in the fourth century and having been added to by successive gleemen as it was transmitted orally was finally completed in the earlier part of the sixth It was then carried over to England and there first written down in Northumbria It possesses great interest because of its antiquity and because of the light it throws upon the life of the professional singer in those ancient times among the Teutons It has a long list of kings and places partly historical partly mythical or not identified The poem though narrative and descriptive is also lyrical We find here the strain of elegiac sadness of regretful retrospection so generally present in Anglo Saxon poetry of lyric character and usually much more pronounced than in Widsith Beowulf is in many respects the most important poetical monument of the Anglo Saxons The poem is undoubtedly of heathen origin and the evidence that it was a gradual growth the result of grouping several distinct songs around one central figure seems unmistakable We may trace it in its earliest stages to the ancient home of the Angles in North Germany It was transplanted to England in the migration of the tribes and was edited in the present form by some unknown Northumbrian poet When this occurred we do not know certainly but there seems good reason for assuming the end of the seventh or the beginning of the eighth century as the time The poem is epic in cast and epic in proportion Although judged by the Homeric standard it falls short in many respects of the complete form yet it may without violence be called an epic The central figure Beowulf a nobly conceived hero possessing immense strength unflinching courage a never swerving sense of honor magnanimity and generosity the friend and champion of the weak against evil however terrible is the element of unity in the whole poem It is in itself a great honor to the race that they were able to conceive as their ideal a hero so superior in all that constitutes true nobility to the Greek ideal Achilles It is true that the poem consists of two parts connected by little more than the fact that they have the same hero at different times of life that episodes are introduced that do not blend perfectly into the unity of the poem and that there is a lack of repose and sometimes of lucidity Yet there is a dignity and vigor and a large consistency in the treatment of the theme that is epic Ten Brink says The poet s intensity is not seldom imparted to the listener The portrayals of battles although much less realistic than the Homeric descriptions are yet at times superior to them in so far as the demoniac rage of war elicits from the Germanic fancy a crowding affluence of vigorous scenes hastily projected in glittering lights of grim half gloom In addition to its great poetic merit Beowulf is of the greatest importance to us on account of the many fine pictures of ancient Teutonic life it presents In the merest outline the argument of Beowulf is as follows Hrothgar King of the Gar Danes has built a splendid hall called Heorot This is the scene of royal festivity until a monster from the fen Grendel breaks into it by night and devours thirty of the king s thanes From that time the hall is desolate for no one can cope with Grendel and Hrothgar is in despair Beowulf the noble hero of the Geats in Sweden hears of the terrible calamity and with fourteen companions sails across the sea to undertake the adventure Hrothgar receives him joyfully and after a splendid banquet gives Heorot into his charge During the following night Beowulf is attacked by Grendel and after one of his companions has been slain he tears out the arm of the monster who escapes mortally hurt to his fen On the morrow all is rejoicing but when night falls the monster s mother attacks Heorot and kills Hrothgar s favorite thane The next day Beowulf pursues her to her den under the waters of the fen and after a terrific combat slays her The hero returns home to Sweden laden with gifts This ends the main thread of the first incident In the second incident after an interval of fifty years we find Beowulf an old man He has been for many years king of the Geats A fire breathing dragon the guardian of a great treasure is devastating the land The heroic old king accompanied by a party of thanes attacks the dragon All the thanes save one are cowardly but the old hero with the aid of the faithful one slays the dragon not however till he is fatally injured Then follow his death and picturesque burial In this sketch stirring episodes graphic descriptions and fine effects are all sacrificed The poem itself is a noble one and the English people may well be proud of preserving in it the first epic production of the Teutonic race The Fight at Finnsburg is a fine fragment of epic cast The Finn saga is at least as old as the Beowulf poem since the gleeman at Hrothgar s banquet makes it his theme From the fragment and the gleeman s song we perceive that the situation here is much more complex than is usual in Anglo Saxon poems and involves a tragic conflict of passion Hildeburh s brother is slain through the treachery of her husband Finn her son partaking of Finn s faithlessness falls at the hands of her brother s men in a subsequent counterplot her husband is slain Besides the extraordinary vigor of the narrative the theme has special interest in that a woman is really the central figure though not treated as a heroine A favorite theme in the older lyric poems is the complaint of some wandering scop driven from his home by the exigencies of those perilous times Either the singer has been bereft of his patron by death or he has been supplanted in his favor by some successful rival and he passes in sorrowful review his former happiness and contrasts it with his present misery The oldest of these lyrics are of pagan origin though usually with Christian additions In the Wanderer an unknown poet pictures the exile who has fled across the sea from his home He is utterly lonely He must lock his sorrow in his heart In his dream he embraces and kisses his lord and lays his head upon his knee as of old He awakes and sees nothing but the gray sea the snow and hail and the birds dipping their wings in the waves And so he reflects the world is full of care we are all in the hands of Fate Then comes the Christian sentiment happy is he who seeks comfort with his Father in heaven with whom alone all things are enduring Another fine poem of this class somewhat similar to the Wanderer is the Seafarer It is however distinct in detail and treatment and has its own peculiar beauty In the Fortunes of Men the poet treats the uncertainty of all things earthly from the point of view of the parent forecasting the ill and the good the future may bring to his sons Deor s Lament possesses a genuine lyrical quality of high order The singer has been displaced by a rival and finds consolation in his grief from reciting the woes that others have endured and reflects in each instance That was got over and so this may be Other poems on other subjects might be noticed here as The Husband s Message where the love of husband for wife is the theme and The Ruin which contains reflections suggested by a ruined city It is a remarkable fact that only two of these poets are known to us by name Caedmon and Cynewulf We find the story of the inspiration work and death of Caedmon the earlier of these told in the pages of Bede The date of his birth is not given but his death fell in six hundred eighty He was a Northumbrian and was connected in a lay capacity with the great monastery of Whitby He was uneducated and not endowed in his earlier life with the gift of song One night after he had fled in mortification from a feast where all were required to improvise and sing he received as he slept the divine inspiration The next day he made known his new gift to the authorities of the monastery After he had triumphantly made good his claims he was admitted to holy orders and began his work of paraphrasing into noble verse portions of the Scriptures that were read to him Of the body of poetry that comes down to us under his name we cannot be sure that any is his unless we except the short passage given here It is certainly the work of different poets and varies in merit The evidence seems conclusive that he was a poet of high order that his influence was very great and that many others wrote in his manner The actors and the scenery of the Caedmonian poetry are entirely Anglo Saxon only the names and the outline of the narrative being biblical and the spirit of battle that breathes in some passages is the same that we find in the heathen epic Cynewulf was most probably a Northumbrian though this is sometimes questioned The dates of his birth and death are unknown It seems established however that his work belongs to the eighth century A great deal of controversy has arisen over a number of poems that have been ascribed to him and denied to him with equal persistency But we stand upon sure ground in regard to four poems the Christ the Fates of the Apostles Juliana and Elene for he has signed them in runes If the runic enigma in the first of the Riddles has been correctly interpreted then they or portions of them are his also But about this there is much doubt The Andreas and the Dream of the Rood may be mentioned as being of exceptional interest among the poems that are almost certainly his In the latter he tells in a personal strain the story of the appearance to him of the holy cross and of his conversion and dedication of himself to the service of Christ The Elene generally considered the finest of his poems is the story of the miraculous finding of the holy cross by saint Helena the mother of the Emperor Constantine The poet has lent great charm to the tradition in his treatment The poem sounds a triumphant note throughout till we reach the epilogue where the poet speaks in his own person and in a sadder tone The quality of Cynewulf s poetry is unequal but when he is at his best he is a great poet and a great artist His personality appears in direct subjective utterance more plainly than does that of any other Anglo Saxon poet While we must pass over many fine Anglo Saxon poems without mention there are two that must receive some notice Judith is an epic based upon the book of Judith in the Apocrypha Only about one fourth of it has survived The author is still unknown in spite of many intelligent efforts to determine to whom the honor belongs The dates assigned to it vary from the seventh to the tenth century here too uncertainty prevails but we are at least sure that it is one of the best of the Anglo Saxon poems It has been said that this work shows a more definite plan and more conscious art than any other Anglo Saxon poem Brooke finds it sometimes conventional in the form of expression and denies it the highest rank for that reason But he does not seem to sustain the charge The two principal characters the dauntless Judith and the brutal Holofernes stand out with remarkable distinctness and a fine dramatic quality has been noted by several critics The epithets and metaphors the description of the drunken debauch and the swift powerful narrative of the battle and the rout of the Assyrians are in the best Anglo Saxon epic strain The poem is distinctly Christian for the Hebrew heroine with a naive anachronism prays thus God of Creation Spirit of Consolation Son of the Almighty I pray for Thy mercy to me greatly in need of it Glory of the Trinity The Battle of Maldon is a ballad containing an account of a fight between the Northmen and the East Saxons under the Aldorman Byrhtnoth The incident is mentioned in one MS of the Chronicle under the date of nine hundred ninety one in another under the date of nine hundred ninety three The poem is exceedingly graphic The poet seems filled with intense feeling and may have been a spectator or may indeed have taken part in the struggle He tells how the brave old Aldorman disdains to use the advantage of his position which bade fair to give him victory Like a boy he cannot take a dare but fatuously allows the enemy to begin the battle upon an equal footing with his own men He pays for his noble folly with his life and the defeat of his army The devotion of the Aldorman s hearth companions who refuse to survive their lord and with brave words meet their death is finely described But not all are true some who have been especially favored ignobly flee These are treated with the racial contempt for cowards The poem has survived in fragmentary form and the name of the poet is not known As distinguished from all poetical remains of such literature the surviving prose of the Anglo Saxons though extensive and of the greatest interest and value is less varied in subject and manner than their poetry It admits of brief treatment The earliest known specimens of Anglo Saxon prose writing have been already mentioned These do not constitute the beginning of a literature yet with the rest of the extensive collection of Anglo Saxon laws that has survived they are of the greatest importance to students Earle quotes doctor Reinhold Schmid as saying No other Germanic nation has bequeathed to us out of its earliest experience so rich a treasure of original legal documents as the Anglo Saxon nation has only another instance of the precocity of our ancestors To the West Saxons belongs nearly the whole of Anglo Saxon prose Whatever may have existed in Northumbria perished in the inroads of the Northmen except such parts as may have been incorporated in West Saxon writings It will be remembered however that the great Northumbrian prose writers had held to the Latin as their medium The West Saxon prose literature may be said to begin in Alfred s reign The most important production that we have to consider is the famous Anglo Saxon Chronicle It covers with more or less completeness the period from four hundred forty nine to eleven fifty four This was supplemented by fanciful genealogies leading back to Woden or even to Adam It is not known when the practice of jotting down in the native speech notices of contemporary events began but probably in very early times It is believed however that no intelligent effort to collect and present them with order and system was made until the middle of the ninth century In the oldest of the seven MSS in which it has come down to us we have the Chronicle to eight hundred ninety one as it was written down in Alfred s time and probably under his supervision The meagreness of the earliest entries and the crudeness of the language together with occasional picturesque force indicate that many of them were drawn from current song or tradition The style and fullness of the entries differ greatly throughout as might be expected since the Chronicle is the work of so many hands From mere bare notices they vary to strong full narrative and description Indeed the Chronicle contains some of the most effective prose produced by the Anglo Saxons and in one instance under the date nine hundred thirty seven the annalist describes the battle of Brunanburh in a poem of considerable merit But we know the name of no single contributor This Chronicle is the oldest and most important work of the kind produced outside of the classical languages in Europe It is meagre in places and its entire trustworthiness has been questioned But it and Bede s Ecclesiastical History supplemented by other Anglo Saxon writings constitute the basis of early English history and this fact alone entitles it to the highest rank in importance among ancient documents A large body of Anglo Saxon prose nearly all of it translation or adaptation of Latin works has come down to us under the name of King Alfred A peculiar interest attaches to these works They belong to a period when the history of England depended more than at any other time upon the ability and devotion of one man and that man the most heroic and the greatest of English kings was himself the author of them When Alfred became king in eight hundred seventy one his throne seemed tottering to its fall Practically all the rest of England was at the feet of the ruthless Northmen and soon Alfred himself was little better than a fugitive But by his military skill which was successful if not brilliant and by his never wavering devotion and English persistency he at last freed the southern part of the island from his merciless and treacherous enemies and laid the firm foundation of West Saxon supremacy If Alfred had failed in any respect to be the great king that he was English history would have been changed for all time Although Alfred had saved his kingdom yet it was a kingdom almost in ruins The hopeful advance of culture had been entirely arrested The great centres of learning had been utterly destroyed in the north and little remained intact in the south And even worse than this was the demoralization of all classes and an indisposition to renewed effort There was moreover a great scarcity of books Alfred showed himself as great in peace as in war and at once set to work to meet all those difficulties To supply the books that were so urgently needed he found time in the midst of his perplexing cares to translate from the Latin into the native speech such works as he thought would supply the most pressing want This was the more necessary from the prevailing ignorance of Latin It is likely that portions of the works that go under his name were produced under his supervision by carefully selected company workers But it is certain that in a large part of them we may see the work of the great Alfred s own hand He has used his own judgment in these translations omitting whatever he did not think would be immediately helpful to his people and making such additions as he thought might be of advantage Just these additions have the greatest interest for us He translated for instance Orosius s History a work in itself of inferior worth but as an attempt at a universal history from the Christian point of view he thought it best suited to the needs of his people The Anglo Saxon version contains most interesting additions of original matter by Alfred They consist of accounts of the voyages of Ohtere a Norwegian who was the first so far as we know to sail around the North Cape and into the White Sea and of Wulfstan who explored parts of the coast of the Baltic These narratives give us our first definite information about the lands and people of these regions and appear to have been taken down by the king directly as related by the explorers Alfred added to this History also a description of Central Europe which Morley calls the only authentic record of the Germanic nations written by a contemporary so early as the ninth century In Gregory s Pastoral Care we have Alfred s closest translation It is a presentation of the ideal Christian pastor Ten Brink and was intended for the benefit of the lax Anglo Saxon priests Perhaps the work that appealed most strongly to Alfred himself was Boethius s Consolations of Philosophy and in his full translation and adaptation of this book we see the hand and the heart of the good king We shall mention one other work of Alfred s his translation of the already frequently mentioned Historia Ecclesiastica Anglorum of the Venerable Bede This great work Alfred with good reason considered to be of the greatest possible value to his people and the king has given it additional value for us Alfred was not a great scholar The wonder is that in the troublous times of his youth he had learned even the rudiments The language in his translations however though not infrequently affected for the worse by the Latin idiom of the original is in the main free from ornament of any kind simple and direct and reflects in its sincerity the noble character of the great king The period between the death of Alfred nine hundred one and the end of the tenth century was deficient in works of literary value except an entry here and there in the Chronicle Alfric s is the last great name in the story of our literature before the Conquest says Henry Morley He began writing about the end of the tenth century and we do not know when his work and his life ended This gentle priest as he appears to us through his writings following Alfred s example wrote not from personal ambition but for the betterment of his fellow men His style is eminently lucid fluent forcible and of graceful finish Earle observes of it The English of these Homilies is splendid indeed we may confidently say that here English appears fully qualified to be the medium of the highest learning This is high praise and should be well considered by those disposed to consider the Anglo Saxon as a rude tongue incapable of great development in itself and only enabled by the Norman infusion to give expression to a deep and broad culture Alfric s works in Anglo Saxon for he wrote also in Latin were very numerous embracing two series of homilies theological writings of many kinds translations of portions of the Bible an English Anglo Saxon grammar adapted from a Latin work a Latin dictionary and many other things of great use in their day and of great interest in ours The names of other writers and of other single works might well be added here But enough has been said perhaps to show that a great and hopeful development of prose took place among the West Saxons It must be admitted that the last years of the Anglo Saxon nationality before the coming of the Normans show a decline in literary productiveness of a high order The causes of this are to be found chiefly in the political and ecclesiastical history of the time Wars with the Northmen internal dissensions religious controversies the greater cultivation of Latin by the priesthood all contributed to it But hopeful signs of a new revival were not wanting The language had steadily developed with the enlightenment of the people and was fast becoming fit to meet any demands that might be made upon it when the great catastrophe of the Norman Conquest came and with it practically the end of the historical and distinctive Anglo Saxon literature Illustration Signature Robert Sharp FROM

Monthly February eighteen ninety one by permission of Houghton Mifflin and Company FROM THE WANDERER Oft times the Wanderer waiteth God s mercy Sad and disconsolate though he may be Far o er the watery track must he travel Long must he row o er the rime crusted sea Plod his lone exile path Fate is severe Mindful of slaughter his kinsman friends death Mindful of hardships the wanderer saith Oft must I lonely when dawn doth appear Wail o er my sorrow since living is none Whom I may whisper my heart s undertone Know I full well that in man it is noble Fast in his bosom his sorrow to bind Weary at heart yet his Fate is unyielding Help cometh not to his suffering mind Therefore do those who are thirsting for glory Bind in their bosom each pain s biting smart Thus must I often afar from my kinsmen Fasten in fetters my home banished heart Now since the day when my dear prince departed Wrapped in the gloom of his dark earthen grave I a poor exile have wandered in winter Over the flood of the foam frozen wave Seeking sad hearted some giver of treasure Some one to cherish me friendless some chief Able to guide me with wisdom of counsel Willing to greet me and comfort my grief He who hath tried it and he alone knoweth How harsh a comrade is comfortless Care Unto the man who hath no dear protector Gold wrought with fingers nor treasure so fair Chill is his heart as he roameth in exile Thinketh of banquets his boyhood saw spread Friends and companions partook of his pleasures Knoweth he well that all friendless and lordless Sorrow awaits him a long bitter while Yet when the spirits of Sorrow and Slumber Fasten with fetters the orphaned exile Seemeth him then that he seeth in spirit Meeteth and greeteth his master once more Layeth his head on his lord s loving bosom Just as he did in the dear days of yore But he awaketh forsaken and friendless Seeth before him the black billows rise Seabirds are bathing and spreading their feathers Hailsnow and hoar frost are hiding the skies Then in his heart the more heavily wounded Longeth full sore for his loved one his own Sad is the mind that remembereth kinsmen Greeting with gladness the days that are gone Seemeth him then on the waves of the ocean Comrades are swimming well nigh within reach Yet from the spiritless lips of the swimmers Cometh familiar no welcoming speech So is his sorrow renewed and made sharper When the sad exile so often must send Thoughts of his suffering spirit to wander Wide o er the waves where the rough billows blend So lest the thought of my mind should be clouded Close must I prison my sadness of heart When I remember my bold comrade kinsmen How from the mede hall I saw them depart Thus is the earth with its splendor departing Day after day it is passing away Nor may a mortal have much of true wisdom Till his world life numbers many a day He who is wise then must learn to be patient Not too hot hearted too hasty of speech Neither too weak nor too bold in the battle Fearful nor joyous nor greedy to reach Neither too ready to boast till he knoweth Man must abide when he vaunted his pride Till strong of mind he hath surely determined Whether his purpose can be turned aside Surely the wise man may see like the desert How the whole wealth of the world lieth waste How through the earth the lone walls are still standing Blown by the wind and despoiled and defaced Covered with frost the proud dwellings are ruined Crumbled the wine halls the king lieth low Robbed of his pride and his troop have all fallen Proud by the wall some the spoil of the foe War took away and some the fierce sea fowl Over the ocean and some the wolf gray Tore after death and yet others the hero Sad faced has laid in earth caverns away Thus at his will the eternal Creator Famished the fields of the earth s ample fold Until her dwellers abandoned their feast boards Void stood the work of the giants of old One who was viewing full wisely this wall place Pondering deeply his dark dreary life Spake then as follows his past thus reviewing Years full of slaughter and struggle and strife Wither alas have my horses been carried Whither alas are my kinspeople gone Where is my giver of treasure and feasting Where are the joys of the hall I have known Ah the bright cup and the corseleted warrior Ah the bright joy of a king s happy lot How the glad time has forever departed Swallowed in darkness as though it were not Standeth instead of the troop of young warriors Stained with the bodies of dragons a wall The men were cut down in their pride by the spearpoints Blood greedy weapons but noble their fall Earth is enwrapped in the lowering tempest Fierce on the stone cliff the storm rushes forth Cold winter terror the night shade is dark ning Hail storms are laden with death from the north All full of hardships is earthly existence Here the decrees of the Fates have their sway Fleeting is treasure and fleeting is friendship Here man is transient here friends pass away Earth s widely stretching extensive domain Desolate all empty idle and vain In Modern Language Notes Translation of W R Sims THE SEAFARER Sooth the song that I of myself can sing Telling of my travels how in troublous days Hours of hardship oft I ve borne With a bitter breast care I have been abiding Many seats of sorrow in my ship have known Frightful was the whirl of waves when it was my part Narrow watch at night to keep on my Vessel s prow When it rushed the rocks along By the rigid cold Fast my feet were pinched fettered by the frost By the chains of cold Care was sighing then Hot my heart around hunger rent to shreds Courage in me me sea wearied This the man knows not He to whom it happens happiest on earth How I carked with care in the ice cold sea Overwent the winter on my wander ways All forlorn of happiness all bereft of loving kinsmen Hung about with icicles flew the hail in showers Nothing heard I there save the howling of the sea And the ice chilled billow whiles the crying of the swan All the glee I got me was the gannet s scream And the swoughing of the seal stead of mirth of men Stead of the mead drinking moaning of the sea mew There the storms smote on the crags there the swallow of the sea Answered to them icy plumed and that answer oft the earn Wet his wings were barked aloud None of all my kinsmen Could this sorrow laden soul stir to any joy Little then does he believe who life s pleasure owns While he tarries in the towns and but trifling ills Proud and insolent with wine how out wearied I Often must outstay on the ocean path Sombre grew the shade of night and it snowed from northward Frost the field enchained fell the hail on earth Coldest of all grains Wherefore now then crash together Thoughts my soul within that I should myself adventure The high streamings of the sea and the sport of the salt waves For a passion of the mind every moment pricks me on All my life to set a faring so that far from hence I may seek the shore of the strange outlanders Yes so haughty of his heart is no hero on the earth Nor so good in all his giving nor so generous in youth Nor so daring in his deed nor so dear unto his lord That he has not always yearning unto his sea faring To whatever work his Lord may have will to make for him For the harp he has no heart nor for having of the rings Nor in woman is his weal in the world he s no delight Nor in anything whatever save the tossing o er the waves Oh forever he has longing who is urged towards the sea Trees rebloom with blossoms burghs are fair again Winsome are the wide plains and the world is gay All doth only challenge the impassioned heart Of his courage to the voyage whosoever thus bethinks him O er the ocean billows far away to go Every cuckoo calls a warning with his chant of sorrow Sings the summer s watchman sorrow is he boding Bitter in the bosom s hoard This the brave man wots not of Not the warrior rich in welfare what the wanderer endures Who his paths of banishment widest places on the sea For behold my thought hovers now above my heart O er the surging flood of sea now my spirit flies O er the homeland of the whale hovers then afar O er the foldings of the earth Now again it flies to me Full of yearning greedy Yells that lonely flier Whets upon the Whale way irresistibly my heart O er the storming of the seas Translation of Stopford Brooke THE FORTUNES OF MEN Full often it falls out by fortune from God That a man and a maiden may marry in this world Find cheer in the child whom they cherish and care for Tenderly tend it until the time comes Beyond the first years when the young limbs increasing Grown firm with life s fullness are formed for their work Fond father and mother so guide it and feed it Give gifts to it clothe it God only can know What lot to its latter days life has to bring To some that make music in life s morning hour Pining days are appointed of plaint at the close One the wild wolf shall eat hoary haunter of wastes His mother shall mourn the small strength of a man One shall sharp hunger slay one shall the storm beat down One be destroyed by darts one die in war One shall live losing the light of his eyes Feel blindly with fingers and one lame of foot With sinew wound wearily wasteth away Musing and mourning with death in his mind One failing feathers shall fall from the height Of the tall forest tree yet he trips as though flying Plays proudly in air till he reaches the point Where the woodgrowth is weak life then whirls in his brain Bereft of his reason he sinks to the root Falls flat on the ground his life fleeting away Afoot on the far ways his food in his hand One shall go grieving and great be his need Press dew on the paths of the perilous lands Where the stranger may strike where live none to sustain All shun the desolate for being sad One the great gallows shall have in its grasp Stained in dark agony till the soul s stay The bone house is bloodily all broken up When the harsh raven hacks eyes from the head The sallow coated slits the soulless man Nor can he shield from shame scare with his hands Off from their eager feast prowlers of air Lost is his life to him left is no breath Bleached on the gallows beam bides he his doom Cold death mists close round him called the Accursed One shall die by the dagger in wrath drenched with ale Wild through wine on the mead bench too swift with his words Through the hand that brings beer through the gay boon companion His mouth has no measure his mood no restraint Too lightly his life shall the wretched one lose Undergo the great ill be left empty of joy When they speak of him slain by the sweetness of mead His comrades shall call him one killed by himself Some have good hap and some hard days of toil Some glad glow of youth and some glory in war Strength in the strife some sling the stone some shoot One shall handle the harp at the feet of his hero Sit and win wealth from the will of his Lord Still quickly contriving the throb of the cords The nail nimbly makes music awakes a glad noise While the heart of the harper throbs hurried by zeal Translation of Henry Morley FROM JUDITH The Assyrian officers obeying the commands of Holofernes come to the carouse They then at the feast proceeded to sit The proud to the wine drinking all his comrades in ill Bold mailed warriors There were lofty beakers Oft borne along the benches also were cups and flagons Full to the hall sitters borne The fated partook of them Brave warriors with shields though the mighty weened not of it Awful lord of earls Then was Holofernes Gold friend of men full of wine joy He laughed and clamored shouted and dinned That children of men from afar might hear How the strong minded both stormed and yelled Moody and mead drunken often admonished The sitters on benches to bear themselves well Thus did the hateful one during all day His liege men loyal keep plying with wine Stout hearted giver of treasure until they lay in a swoon Holofernes has been slain by Judith The Hebrews encouraged by her surprise the drunken and sleeping Assyrians Then the band of the brave was quickly prepared Of the bold for battle stepped out the valiant Men and comrades bore their banners Went forth to fight straight on their way The heroes neath helmets from the holy city At the dawn itself shields made a din Loudly resounded Thereat laughed the lank Wolf in the wood and the raven wan Fowl greedy for slaughter both of them knew That for them the warriors thought to provide Their fill on the fated and flew on their track The dewy winged eagle eager for prey The dusky coated sang his war song The crooked beaked Stepped forth the warriors The heroes for battle with boards protected With hollow shields who awhile before The foreign folk s reproach endured The heathens scorn fiercely was that At the ash spear s play to them all repaid All the Assyrians after the Hebrews Under their banners had boldly advanced To the army camps They bravely then Forthright let fly showers of arrows Of battle adders out from the horn bows Of strongly made shafts stormed they aloud The cruel warriors sent forth their spears Among the brave the heroes were angry The dwellers in land with the loathed race The stern minded stepped the stout in heart Rudely awakened their ancient foes Weary from mead with hands drew forth The men from the sheaths the brightly marked swords Most choice in their edges eagerly struck Of the host of Assyrians the battle warriors The hostile minded not one they spared Of the army folk nor low nor high Of living men whom they might subdue By consent of Ginn company Translation of Garnett THE FIGHT AT MALDON The Anglo Saxons under Byrhtnoth are drawn up on one side of Panta stream the Northmen on the other The herald of the

stood on the shore To thee me did send the seamen snell Bade to thee say thou must send to them quickly Bracelets for safety and tis better for you That ye this spear rush with tribute buy off Than we in so fierce a fight engage We need not each spill if ye speed to this We will for the pay a peace confirm If thou that redest who art highest in rank If thou to the seamen at their own pleasure Money for peace and take peace from us We will with the treasure betake us to ship Fare on the flood and peace with you confirm Byrhtnoth replied his buckler uplifted Waved his slim spear with words he spake Angry and firm gave answer to him Hear saint thou seafarer what saith this folk They will for tribute spear shafts you pay Poisonous points and trusty swords Those weapons that you in battle

wikings band west over Panta O er the clear water carried their shields Boatmen to bank their bucklers bore There facing their foes ready were standing Byrhtnoth with warriors with shields he bade The war hedgel work and the war band hold Fast gainst the foes Then fight was nigh Glory in battle the time was come That fated men should there now fall Then outcry was raised the ravens circled Eagle eager for prey on earth was uproar Then they let from their fists the file hardened spears The darts well ground fiercely fly forth The bows were busy board point received Bitter the battle rush warriors fell down On either hand the youths lay dead By consent of Ginn company Translation of Garnett CAEDMON S INSPIRATION He Caedmon had remained in the secular life until the time when he was of advanced age and he had never learned any song For that reason oftentimes when it was decided at a feasting that all should sing in turn to the accompaniment of the harp for the sake of entertainment he would arise for shame from the banquet when he saw the harp approaching him and would go home to his house When he on a certain occasion had done this and had left the house of feasting and had gone to the stable of the cattle which had been intrusted to his care for that night and when he there after a reasonable time had arranged his limbs for rest he fell asleep And a man stood by him in a dream and hailed him and greeted him and called him by name and said Caedmon sing something for me Then he answered and said I cannot sing I went out from the feast and came hither because I could not sing Again said the one who was speaking with him Nevertheless thou canst sing for me Said Caedmon What shall I sing Said he Sing to me of creation When Caedmon received this answer then began he soon to sing in glorification of God the Creator verses and words that he had never before heard Then he arose from sleep and he had fast in his memory all those things he had sung in his sleep and to these words he soon added many other words of song of the same measure worthy for God Then came he in the morning to the town reeve who was his aldorman and told him of the gift he had received And the reeve soon led him to the abbess and made that known to her and told her Then bade she assemble all the very learned men and the learners and bade him tell the dream in their presence and sing the song so that by the judgment of them all it might be determined what it was and whence it had come Then it was seen by them all just as it was that the heavenly gift had been given him by the Lord himself Alfred s Bede Translation of Robert Sharp FROM THE CHRONICLE Selection from the entry for the year eight hundred ninety seven Then Alfred the King ordered long ships built to oppose the war ships of the enemy They were very nearly twice as long as the others some had sixty oars some more They were both swifter and steadier and also higher than the others they were shaped neither on the Frisian model nor on the Danish but as it seemed to King Alfred that they would be most useful Then at a certain time in that year came six hostile ships to Wight and did much damage both in Devon and elsewhere on the seaboard Then the King ordered that nine of the new ships should proceed thither And his ships blockaded the mouth of the passage on the outer sea against the enemy Then the Danes came out with three ships against the King s ships but three of the Danish ships lay above the mouth high and dry aground and the men were gone off upon the shore Then the King s men took two of the three ships outside at the mouth and slew the crews but one ship escaped On this one all the men were slain except five these escaped because the King s ship got aground They were aground moreover very inconveniently since three were situated upon the same side of the channel with the three stranded Danish ships and all the others were upon the other side so that there could be no communication between the two divisions But when the water had ebbed many furlongs from the ships then went the Danes from their three ships to the King s three ships that had been left dry upon the same side by the ebbing of the tide and they fought together there Then were slain Lucumon the King s Reeve Wulfheard the Frisian and AEbbe the Frisian and AEthelhere the Frisian and AEthelferth the King s companion and of all the men Frisians and English sixty two and of the Danes one hundred and twenty But the flood came to the Danish ships before the Christians could shove theirs out and for that reason the Danes rowed off They were nevertheless so grievously wounded that they could not row around the land of the South Saxons and the sea cast up there two of the ships upon the shore And the men from them were led to Winchester to the King and he commanded them to be hanged there But the men who were in the remaining ship came to East Anglia sorely wounded Translation of Robert Sharp GABRIELE D ANNUNZIO eighteen sixty four An Italian poet and novelist of early promise who has become a somewhat unique figure in contemporary literature Gabriele d Annunzio is a native of the Abruzzi born in the little village of Pescara on the Adriatic coast Its picturesque scenery has formed the background for more than one of his stories At the age of fifteen while still a student at Prato he published his first volume of poems Intermezzo di Rime Interludes of Verse grand plastic verse of an impeccable prosody as he maintained in their defense but so daringly erotic that their appearance created no small scandal Other poems followed at intervals notably Il Canto Nuovo The New Song Rome eighteen eighty two Isotteo e la Chimera Isotteo and the Chimera Rome eighteen ninety Poema Paradisiaco and Odi Navali Marine Odes Milan eighteen ninety three which leave no doubt of his high rank as poet The novel however is his chosen vehicle of expression and the one which gives fullest scope to his rich and versatile genius His first long story Il Piacere Pleasure appeared in eighteen eighty nine As the title implies it was pervaded with a frank almost complacent sensuality which its author has since been inclined to deprecate Nevertheless the book received merited praise for its subtle portrayal of character and incident and its exuberance of phraseology and more than all for the promise which it suggested With the publication of L Innocente the author for the first time showed a real seriousness of purpose His views of life had meanwhile essentially altered As was just he confessed I began to pay for my errors my disorders my excesses I began to suffer with the same intensity with which I had formerly enjoyed myself sorrow had made of me a new man Accordingly his later books while still emphatically realistic are chastened by an underlying tone of pessimism Passion is no longer the keynote of life but rather as exemplified in Il Trionfo della Morte the prelude of death Leaving Rome where like the outpouring of the sewers a flood of base desires invaded every square and cross road ever more putrid and more swollen D Annunzio retired to Francovilla al Mare a few miles from his birthplace There he lives in seclusion esteemed by the simple minded honest and somewhat fanatical peasantry to whose quaint and primitive manners his books owe much of their distinctive atmosphere In Italy D Annunzio s career has been watched with growing interest Until recently however he was scarcely known to the world at large when a few poems translated into French brought his name into immediate prominence Within a year three Paris journals acquired rights of translation from him and he has since occupied the attention of such authoritative French critics as Henri Rabusson Rene Doumic Edouard Rod Eugene Melchior de Voguee and most recently Ferdinand Brunetiere all of whom seem to have a clearer appreciation of his quality than even his critics at home At the same time there is a small but hostile minority among the French novelists whose literary feelings are voiced by Leon Daudet in a vehement protest under the title Assez d Etrangers Enough of Foreigners It is too soon to pass final judgment on D Annunzio s style which has been undergoing an obvious transition not yet accomplished Realist and psychologist symbolist and mystic by turns and first and always a poet he has been compared successively to Bourget and Maupassant Tolstoi and Dostoievsky Theophile Gautier and Catulle Mendes Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Baudelaire Such complexity of style is the outcome of his cosmopolitan taste in literature and his tendency to assimilate for future use whatever pleases him in each successive author Shakespeare and Goethe Keats and Heine Plato and Zoroaster figure among the names which throng his pages while his unacknowledged and often unconscious indebtedness to writers of lesser magnitude notably the self styled Sar Joseph Peladan has lately raised an outcry of plagiarism Yet whatever leaves his pen borrowed or original has received the unmistakable imprint of his powerful individuality It is easy to trace the influences under which successively D Annunzio has come They are essentially French He is a French writer in an Italian medium His early short sketches noteworthy chiefly for their morbid intensity were modeled largely on Maupassant whose frank unblushing realism left a permanent imprint upon the style of his admirer and whose later analytic tendency probably had an important share in turning his attention to the psychological school Il Piacere though largely inspired by Paul Bourget contains as large an element of Notre Coeur and Bel Ami as of Le Disciple and Coeur de Femme In this novel Andrea Sperelli affords us the type of D Annunzio s heroes who aside from differences due to age and environment are all essentially the same somewhat weak yet undeniably attractive containing all of them something of a Don Juan and a Cherubini with the Don Juan element preponderating The plot of Il Piacere is not remarkable either for depth or for novelty being the needlessly detailed record of Sperelli s relations with two married women of totally opposite types Giovanni Episcopo is a brief painful tragedy of low life written under the influence of Russian evangelism and full of reminiscences of Dostoievsky s Crime and Punishment Giovanni is a poor clerk of a weak pusillanimous nature completely dominated by a coarse brutal companion Giulio Wanzer who makes him an abject slave until a detected forgery compels Wanzer to flee the country Episcopo then marries Ginevra the pretty but unprincipled waitress at his pension who speedily drags him down to the lowest depths of degradation making him a mere nonentity in his own household willing to live on the proceeds of her infamy They have one child a boy Ciro on whom Giovanni lavishes all his suppressed tenderness After ten years of this martyrdom the hated Wanzer reappears and installs himself as husband in the Episcopo household Giovanni submits in helpless fury till one day Wanzer beats Ginevra and little Ciro intervenes to protect his mother Wanzer turns on the child and a spark of manhood is at last kindled in Giovanni s breast He springs upon Wanzer and with the pent up rage of years stabs him L Innocente D Annunzio s second long novel also bears the stamp of Russian influence It is a gruesome repulsive story of domestic infidelity in which he has handled the theory of pardon the motive of numerous recent French novels like Daudet s La Petite Paroisse and Paul Marguerite s La Tourmente In another extended work Il Trionfo della Morte The Triumph of Death D Annunzio appears as a convert to Nietzsche s philosophy and to Wagnerianism Ferdinand Brunetiere has pronounced it unsurpassed by the naturalistic schools of England France or Russia In brief the hero Giorgio Aurispa a morbid sensualist with an inherited tendency to suicide is led by fate through a series of circumstances which keep the thought of death continually before him They finally goad him on to fling himself from a cliff into the sea dragging with him the woman he loves The Vergini della Rocca Maidens of the Crag his last story is more an idyllic poem than a novel Claudio Cantelmo sickened with the corruption of Rome retires to his old home in the Abruzzi where he meets the three sisters Massimilla Anatolia Violante names expressive as faces full of light and shade and in which I seemed already to discover an infinity of grace of passion and of sorrow It is inevitable that he should chose one of the three but which And in the denouement the solution is only half implied D Annunzio is now occupied with a new romance and coming years will doubtless present him all the more distinctively as a writer of Italy on whom French inflences have been seed sowed in fertile ground The place in contemporary Italian of such work as his is indisputably considerable THE DROWNED BOY From The Triumph of Death All of a sudden Albadora the septuagenarian Cybele she who had given life to twenty two sons and daughters came toiling up the narrow lane into the court and indicating the neighboring shore where it skirted the promontory on the left announced breathlessly Down yonder there has been a child drowned Candia made the sign of the cross Giorgio arose and ascended to the loggia to observe the spot designated Upon the sand below the promontory in close vicinity to the chain of rocks and the tunnel he perceived a blotch of white presumably the sheet which hid the little body A group of people had gathered around it As Ippolita had gone to mass with Elena at the chapel of the Port he yielded to his curiosity and said to his entertainers I am going down to see Why asked Candia Why do you wish to put a pain in your heart Hastening down the narrow lane he descended by a short cut to the beach and continued along the water Reaching the spot somewhat out of breath he inquired What has happened The assembled peasants saluted him and made way for him One of them answered tranquilly The son of a mother has been drowned Another clad in linen who seemed to be standing guard over the corpse bent down and drew aside the sheet The inert little body was revealed extended upon the unyielding sand It was a lad eight or nine years old fair and frail with slender limbs His head was supported on his few humble garments rolled up in place of pillow the shirt the blue trousers the red sash the cap of limp felt His face was but slightly livid with flat nose prominent forehead and long long lashes the mouth was half open with thick lips which were turning blue between which the widely spaced teeth gleamed white His neck was slender flaccid as a wilted stem and seamed with tiny creases The jointure of the arms at the shoulder looked feeble The arms themselves were fragile and covered with a down similar to the fine plumage which clothes the bodies of newly hatched birds The whole outline of the ribs was distinctly visible down the middle of the breast the skin was divided by a darker line the navel stood out like a knot The feet slightly bloated had assumed the same sallow color as the little hands which were callous and strewn with warts with white nails beginning to turn livid On the left arm on the thighs near the groin and further down on the knees and along the legs appeared reddish blotches of scurf Every detail of this wretched little body assumed in the eyes of Giorgio an extraordinary significance immobile as it was and fixed forever in the rigidity of death How was he drowned Where he questioned lowering his voice The man dressed in linen gave with some show of impatience the account which he had probably had to repeat too many times already He had a brutal countenance square cut with bushy brows and a large mouth harsh and savage Only a little while after leading the sheep back to their stalls the lad taking his breakfast along with him had gone down together with a comrade to bathe He had hardly set foot in the water when he had fallen and was drowned At the cries of his comrade some one from the house overhead on the bluff had hurried down and wading in up to the knees had dragged him from the water half dead they had turned him upside down to make him throw up the water they had shaken him but to no purpose To indicate just how far the poor little fellow had gone in the man picked up a pebble and threw it into the sea There only to there at three yards from the shore The sea lay at rest breathing peacefully close to the head of the dead child But the sun blazed fiercely down upon the sand and something pitiless emanating from that sky of flame and from those stolid witnesses seemed to pass over the pallid corpse Why asked Giorgio do you not place him in the shade in one of the houses on a bed He is not to be moved declared the man on guard until they hold the inquest At least carry him into the shade down there below the embankment Stubbornly the man reiterated He is not to be moved There could be no sadder sight than that frail lifeless little being extended on the stones and watched over by the impassive brute who repeated his account every time in the selfsame words and every time made the selfsame gesture throwing a pebble into the sea There only to there A woman joined the group a hook nosed termagant with gray eyes and sour lips mother of the dead boy s comrade She manifested plainly a mistrustful restlessness as if she anticipated some accusation against her own son She spoke with bitterness and seemed almost to bear a grudge against the victim It was his destiny God had said to him Go into the sea and end yourself She gesticulated with vehemence What did he go in for if he did not know how to swim A young lad a stranger in the district the son of a mariner repeated contemptuously Yes what did he go in for We yes who know how to swim Other people joined the group gazed with cold curiosity then lingered or passed on A crowd occupied the railroad embankment another gathered on the crest of the promontory as if at a spectacle Children seated or kneeling played with pebbles tossing them into the air and catching them now on the back and now in the hollow of their hands They all showed the same profound indifference to the presence of other people s troubles and of death Another woman joined the group on her way home from mass wearing a dress of silk and all her gold ornaments For her also the harassed custodian repeated his account for her also he indicated the spot in the water She was talkative I am always saying to my children Don t you go into the water or I will kill you The sea is the sea Who can save himself She called to mind other instances of drowning she called to mind the case of the drowned man with the head cut off driven by the waves all the way to San Vito and found among the rocks by a child Here among these rocks He came and told us There is a dead man there We thought he was joking But we came and we found He had no head They had an inquest he was buried in a ditch then in the night he was dug up again His flesh was all mangled and like jelly but he still had his boots on The judge said See they are better than mine So he must have been a rich man And it turned out that he was a dealer in cattle They had killed him and chopped off his head and had thrown him into the Tronto She continued to talk in her shrill voice from time to time sucking in the superfluous saliva with a slight hissing sound And the mother When is the mother coming At that name there arose exclamations of compassion from all the women who had gathered The mother There comes the mother now And all of them turned around fancying that they saw her in the far distance along the burning strand Some of the women could give particulars about her Her name was Riccangela she was a widow with seven children She had placed this one in a farmer s family so that he might tend the sheep and gain a morsel of bread One woman said gazing down at the corpse Who knows how much pains the mother has taken in raising him Another said To keep the children from going hungry she has even had to ask charity Another told how only a few months before the unfortunate child had come very near strangling to death in a courtyard in a pool of water barely six inches deep All the women repeated It was his destiny He was bound to die that way And the suspense of waiting rendered them restless anxious The mother There comes the mother now Feeling himself grow sick at heart Giorgio exclaimed Can t you take him into the shade or into a house so that the mother will not see him here naked on the stones under a sun like this Stubbornly the man on guard objected He is not to be touched He is not to be moved until the inquest is held The bystanders gazed in surprise at the stranger Candia s stranger Their number was augmenting A few occupied the embankment shaded with acacias others crowned the promontory rising abruptly from the rocks Here and there on the monstrous bowlders a tiny boat lay sparkling like gold at the foot of the detached crag so lofty that it gave the effect of the ruins of some Cyclopean tower confronting the immensity of the sea All at once from above on the height a voice announced There she is Other voices followed The mother The mother All turned Some stepped down from the embankment Those on the promontory leaned far over All became silent in expectation The man on guard drew the sheet once more over the corpse In the midst of the silence the sea barely seemed to draw its breath the acacias barely rustled And then through the silence they could hear her cries as she drew near The mother came along the strand beneath the sun crying aloud She was clad in widow s mourning She tottered along the sand with bowed body calling out O my son My son She raised her palms to heaven and then struck them upon her knees calling out My son One of her older sons with a red handkerchief bound around his neck to hide some sore followed her like one demented dashing aside his tears with the back of his hand She advanced along the strand beating her knees directing her steps toward the sheet And as she called upon her dead there issued from her mouth sounds scarcely human but rather like the howling of some savage dog As she drew near she bent over lower and lower she placed herself almost on all fours till reaching him she threw herself with a howl upon the sheet She arose again With hand rough and toil stained hand toughened by every variety of labor she uncovered the body She gazed upon it a few instants motionless as though turned to stone Then time and time again shrilly with all the power of her voice she called as if trying to awaken him My son My son My son Sobs suffocated her Kneeling beside him she beat her sides furiously with her fists She turned her despairing eyes around upon the circle of strangers During a pause in her paroxysms she seemed to recollect herself And then she began to sing She sang her sorrow in a rhythm which rose and fell continually like the palpitation of a heart It was the ancient monody which from time immemorial in the land of the Abruzzi the women have sung over the remains of their relatives It was the melodious eloquence of sacred sorrow which renewed spontaneously in the profundity of her being this hereditary rhythm in which the mothers of bygone ages had modulated their lamentations She sang on and on Open your eyes arise and walk my son How beautiful you are How beautiful you are She sang on For a morsel of bread I have drowned you my son For a morsel of bread I have borne you to the slaughter For that have I raised you But the irate woman with the hooked nose interrupted her It was not you who drowned him it was Destiny It was not you who took him to the slaughter You had placed him in the midst of bread And making a gesture toward the hill where the house stood which had sheltered the lad she added They kept him there like a pink at the ear The mother continued O my son who was it sent you who was it sent you here to drown And the irate woman Who was it sent him It was our Lord He said to him Go into the water and end yourself As Giorgio was affirming in a low tone to one of the bystanders that if succored in time the child might have been saved and that they had killed him by turning him upside down and holding him suspended by the feet he felt the gaze of the mother fixed upon him Can t you do something for him sir she prayed Can t you do something for him And she prayed O Madonna of the Miracles work a miracle for him Touching the head of the dead boy she repeated My son my son my son arise and walk On his knees in front of her was the brother of the dead boy he was sobbing but without grief and from time to time he glanced around with a face that suddenly grew indifferent Another brother the oldest one remained at a little distance seated in the shade of a bowlder and he was making a great show of grief hiding his face in his hands The women striving to console the mother were bending over her with gestures of compassion and accompanying her monody with an occasional lament And she sang on Why have I sent you forth from my house Why have I sent you to your death I have done everything to keep my children from hunger everything everything except to be a woman with a price And for a morsel of bread I have lost you This was the way you were to die Thereupon the woman with the hawk nose raised her petticoats in an impetus of wrath entered the water up to her knees and cried Look He came only to here Look The water is like oil It is a sign that he was bound to die that way With two strides she regained the shore Look she repeated pointing to the deep imprint in the sand made by the man who recovered the body Look The mother looked in a dull way but it seemed as if she neither saw nor comprehended After her first wild outbursts of grief there came over her brief pauses amounting to an obscurement of consciousness She would remain silent she would touch her foot or her leg with a mechanical gesture Then she would wipe away her tears with the black apron She seemed to be quieting down Then all of a sudden a fresh explosion would shake her from head to foot and prostrate her upon the corpse And I cannot take you away I cannot take you in these arms to the church My son My son She fondled him from head to foot she caressed him softly Her savage anguish was softened to an infinite tenderness Her hand the burnt and callous hand of a hard working woman became infinitely gentle as she touched the eyes the mouth the forehead of her son How beautiful you are How beautiful you are She touched his lower lip already turned blue and as she pressed it slightly a whitish froth issued from the mouth From between his lashes she brushed away some speck very carefully as though fearful of hurting him How beautiful you are heart of your mamma His lashes were long very long and fair On his temples on his cheeks was a light bloom pale as gold Do you not hear me Rise and walk She took the little well worn cap limp as a rag She gazed at it and kissed it saying I am going to make myself a charm out of this and wear it always on my breast She lifted the child a quantity of water escaped from the mouth and trickled down upon the breast O Madonna of the Miracles perform a miracle she prayed raising her eyes to heaven in a supreme supplication Then she laid softly down again the little being who had been so dear to her and took up the worn shirt the red sash the cap She rolled them up together in a little bundle and said This shall be my pillow on these I shall rest my head always at night on these I wish to die She placed these humble relics on the sand beside the head of her child and rested her temple on them stretching herself out as if on a bed Both of them mother and son now lay side by side on the hard rocks beneath the flaming sky close to the homicidal sea And now she began to croon the very lullaby which in the past had diffused pure sleep over his infant cradle She took up the red sash and said I want to dress him The cross grained woman who still held her ground assented Let us dress him now And she herself took the garments from under the head of the dead boy she felt in the jacket pocket and found a slice of bread and a fig Do you see They had given him his food just before just before They cared for him like a pink at the ear The mother gazed upon the little shirt all soiled and torn over which her tears fell rapidly and said Must I put that shirt on him The other woman promptly raised her voice to some one of her family above on the bluff Quick bring one of Nufrillo s new shirts The new shirt was brought The mother flung herself down beside him Get up Riccangela get up solicited the women around her She did not heed them Is my son to stay like that on the stones and I not stay there too like that on the stones my own son Get up Riccangela come away She arose She gazed once more with terrible intensity upon the little livid face of the dead Once again she called with all the power of her voice My son My son My son Then with her own hands she covered up with the sheet the unheeding remains And the women gathered around her drew her a little to one side under shadow of a bowlder they forced her to sit down they lamented with her Little by little the spectators melted away There remained only a few of the women comforters there remained the man clad in linen the impassive custodian who was awaiting the inquest The dog day sun poured down upon the strand and lent to the funeral sheet a dazzling whiteness Amidst the heat the promontory raised its desolate aridity straight upward from the tortuous chain of rocks The sea immense and green pursued its constant even breathing And it seemed as if the languid hour was destined never to come to an end Under shadow of the bowlder opposite the white sheet which was raised up by the rigid form of the corpse beneath the mother continued her monody in the rhythm rendered sacred by all the sorrows past and present of her race And it seemed as if her lamentation was destined never to come to an end TO AN IMPROMPTU OF CHOPIN When thou upon my breast art sleeping I hear across the midnight gray I hear the muffled note of weeping So near so sad so far away All night I hear the teardrops falling Each drop by drop my heart must weep I hear the falling blood drops lonely Whilst thou dost sleep whilst thou dost sleep From The Triumph of Death INDIA India whose enameled page unrolled Like autumn s gilded pageant neath a sun That withers not for ancient kings undone Or gods decaying in their shrines of gold Where were thy vaunted princes that of old Trod thee with thunder of thy saints was none To rouse thee when the onslaught was begun That shook the tinseled sceptre from thy hold Dead though behind thy gloomy citadels The fountains lave their baths of porphyry Dead though the rose trees of thy myriad dells Breathe as of old their speechless ecstasy Dead though within thy temples courts and cells Their countless lamps still supplicate for thee Translated by Thomas Walsh for A Library of the World s Best Literature ANTAR About five hundred fifty six hundred fifteen BY EDWARD S HOLDEN Arabia was opened to English readers first by Sale s translation of the Kuran in seventeen thirty four and by English versions of the Arabian Nights from seventeen twelve onward The latter were derived from Galland s translation of the Thousand and One Nights which began to appear in French in seventeen oh four Next to nothing was generally known of Oriental literature from that time until the end of the eighteenth century The East India Company fostered the study of the classics of the extreme Orient and the first Napoleon opened Egypt his savans marched in the centre of the invading squares The flagship of the English fleet which blockaded Napoleon s army carried an Austro German diplomatist and scholar Baron von Hammer Purgstall part of whose mission was to procure a complete manuscript of the Arabian Nights It was then supposed that these tales were the daily food of all Turks Arabians and Syrians To the intense surprise of Von Hammer he learned that they were never recited in the coffee houses of Constantinople and that they were not to be found at all outside of Egypt His dismay and disappointment were soon richly compensated however by the discovery of the Arabian romance of Antar the national classic hitherto unknown in Europe except for an enthusiastic notice which had fallen by chance into the hands of Sir William Jones The entire work was soon collected It is of interminable length in the original being often found in thirty or forty manuscript volumes in quarto in seventy or eighty in octavo Portions of it have been translated into English German and French English readers can consult it best in Antar a Bedouin romance translated from the Arabic by Terrick Hamilton in four volumes eightvo London eighteen twenty Hamilton s translation now rare covers only a portion of the original and a new translation suitably abridged is much needed The book purports to have been written more than a thousand years ago in the golden prime of the Caliph Harun al Rashid seven hundred eighty six eight hundred nine and of his sons and successors Amin eight hundred nine eight hundred thirteen and Mamun eight hundred thirteen eight hundred thirty four by the famous As Asmai born seven hundred forty one died about eight hundred thirty It is in fact a later compilation probably of the twelth century Baron von Hammer s MS was engrossed in the year fourteen sixty six Whatever the exact date may have been it was probably not much later than A D twelve hundred The main outlines of Antar s life are historical Many particulars are derived from historic accounts of the lives of other Arabian heroes Duraid and others and are transferred bodily to the biography of Antar They date back to the sixth century Most of the details must be imaginary but they are skillfully contrived by a writer who knew the life of the desert Arab at first hand The verses with which the volumes abound are in many cases undoubtedly Antar s They are printed in italics in what follows In any event the book in its present form has been the delight of all Arabians for many centuries Every wild Bedouin of the desert knew much of the tale by heart and listened to its periods and to its poems with quivering interest His more cultivated brothers of the cities possessed one or many of its volumes Every coffee house in Aleppo Bagdad or Constantinople had a narrator who night after night recited it to rapt audiences The unanimous opinion of the East has always placed the romance of Antar at the summit of such literature As one of their authors well says The Thousand and One Nights is for the amusement of women and children Antar is a book for men From it they learn lessons of eloquence of magnanimity of generosity and of statecraft Even the prophet Muhammad well known foe to poetry and to poets instructed his disciples to relate to their children the traditions concerning Antar for these will steel their hearts harder than stone The book belongs among the great national classics like the Shah nameh and the Nibelungen Lied It has a direct relation to Western culture and opinion also Antar was the father of knighthood He was the preux chevalier the champion of the weak and oppressed the protector of women the impassioned lover poet the irresistible and magnanimous knight European chivalry in a marked degree is the child of the chivalry of his time which traveled along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and passed with the Moors into Spain seven hundred ten Another current flowed from Arabia to meet and to modify the Greeks of Constantinople and the early Crusaders and still another passed from Persia into Palestine and Europe These fertilized Provencal poetry the French romance the early Italian epic The Shah nameh of Firdausi that model of a heroic poem was written early in the eleventh century Antar in its present form probably preceded the romances of chivalry so common in the twelfth century in Italy and France Antarah ben Shedad el Absi Antar the Lion the Son of Shedad of the tribe of Abs the historic Antar was born about the middle of the sixth century of our era and died about the year six hundred fifteen forty five years after the birth of the prophet Muhammad and seven years before the Hijra the Flight to Medina with which the Muhammadan era begins His father was a noble Absian knight The romance makes him the son of an Abyssinian slave who is finally discovered to be a powerful princess His skin was black He was despised by his father and family and set to tend their camels His extraordinary strength and valor and his remarkable poetic faculty soon made him a marked man in a community in which personal valor failed of its full value if it were not celebrated in brilliant verse His love for the beautiful Ibla Ablah in the usual modern form the daughter of his uncle was proved in hundreds of encounters and battles by many adventurous excursions in search of fame and booty by thousands of verses in her honor The historic Antar is the author of one of the seven suspended poems The common explanation of this term is that these seven poems were judged by the assemblage of all the Arabs worthy to be written in golden letters whence their name of the golden odes and to be hung on high in the sacred Kaabah at Mecca Whether this be true is not certain They are at any rate accepted models of Arabic style Antar was one of the seven greatest poets of his poetic race These suspended poems can now be studied in the original and in translation by the help of a little book published in London in eighteen ninety four The Seven Poems by Captain F E Johnson R A The Antar of the romance is constantly breaking into verse which is passionately admired by his followers None of its beauties of form are preserved in the translation and indeed this is true of the prose forms also It speaks volumes for the manly vigor of the original that it can be transferred to an alien tongue and yet preserve great qualities To the Arab the work is a masterpiece both in form and content Its prose is in balanced rhythmic sentences ending in full or partial rhymes This cadence of the cooing dove is pure music to an Eastern ear If any reader is interested in Arabic verse he can readily satisfy his curiosity An introduction to the subject is given in the Terminal Essay of Sir Richard Burton s Arabian Nights Lady Burton s edition Vol vi page three hundred forty The same subject is treated briefly and very clearly in the introduction to Lyall s Ancient Arabian Poetry a book well worth consulting on other accounts The story itself appeals to the Oriental s deepest feelings passions ideals To realize the impetuous feelings of the Arab says Von Hammer you must have heard these tales narrated to a circle of Bedouins crowded about the orator of the desert It is a veritable drama in which the spectators are the actors as well If the hero is threatened with imminent danger they shudder and cry aloud No no no Allah forbid that cannot be If he is in the midst of tumult and battle mowing down rank after rank of the enemy with his sword they seize their own weapons and rise to fly to his rescue If he falls into the snares of treachery their foreheads contract with angry indignation and they exclaim The curse of Allah be on the traitor If the hero at last sinks under the superior forces of the enemy a long and ardent sigh escapes from their breasts with the farewell blessing Allah s compassion be with him may he rest in peace Descriptions of the beauties of nature especially of the spring are received with exclamations Nothing equals the delight which sparkles in every eye when the narrator draws a picture of feminine beauty The question as to the exact relation of the chivalry of Europe to the earlier chivalry of Arabia and of the East is a large one and one which must be left to scholars It is certain that Spenser and Sir Philip Sidney owe far more to Saladin than we commonly suppose The tales of Boccaccio thirteen fifty show that the Italians of that day still held the Arabs to be their teachers in chivalry and at least their equals in art science and civilization and the Italy of thirteen hundred was a century in advance of the rest of Europe In twelve sixty eight two brothers of the King of Castile with eight hundred other Spanish gentlemen were serving under the banners of the Muslim in Tunis The knightly ideal of both Moors and Spaniards was to be Like steel among swords Like wax among ladies Hospitality generosity magnanimity the protection of the weak punctilious observance of the plighted faith pride of birth and lineage glory in personal valor these were the knightly virtues common to Arab and Christian warriors Antar and his knights Ibla and her maidens are the Oriental counterparts of Launcelot and Arthur of Guinevere and Iseult The primary duty of the early Arab was blood revenge An insult to himself or an injury to the tribe must be wiped out with the blood of the offender Hence arose the multitude of tribal feuds It was Muhammad who first checked the private feud by fixing the price of blood to be paid by the aggressor or by his tribe In the time of Antar revenge was the foremost duty Ideals of excellence change as circumstances alter Virtues go out of fashion like the magnificence of Aristotle or acquire an entirely new importance as veracity since England became a trading nation Some day we may possess a natural history of the virtues The service of the loved one by the early Arab was a passion completely different from the vain gallantry of the mediaeval knight of Europe He sought for the complete possession of his chosen mistress and was eager to earn it by multitudes of chivalric deeds but he could not have understood the sentimentalities of the Troubadours The systematic fantasies of the Courts of Love would have seemed cold follies to Arab chivalry as indeed they are though they have led to something better In generosity in magnanimity the Arab knight far surpassed his European brother Hospitality was a point of honor to both As to the noble Arabs of those days when any one demanded their protection no one ever inquired what was the matter for if he asked any questions it would be said of him that he was afraid The poets have thus described them in verse They rise when any one calls out to them and they haste before asking any questions they aid him against his enemies that seek his life and they return honored to their families The Arab was the knight of the tent and the desert His deeds were immediately known to his fellows discussed and weighed in every household of his tribe The Christian knight of the Middle Ages living isolated in his stronghold was less immediately affected by the opinions of his class Tribal allegiance was developed in the first case independence in the second Scholars tell us that the romance of Antar is priceless for faithful pictures of the times before the advent of Muhammad which are confirmed by all that remains of the poetry of the days of ignorance To the general reader its charm lies in its bold and simple stories of adventure in its childlike enjoyment of the beauty of Nature in its pictures of the elemental passions of ambition pride love hate revenge Antar was a poet a lover a warrior a born leader From a keeper of camels he rose to be the protector of the tribe of Abs and the pattern of chivalry by virtue of great natural powers and in the face of every obstacle He won possession of his Ibla and gave her the dower of a queen by adventures the like of which were never known before There were no Ifrits or Genii to come to his aid as in the Thousand Nights and a Night Antar is the epic of success crowning human valor the tales in the Arabian Nights at their best are the fond fancies of the fatalist whose best endeavor is at the mercy of every capricious Jinni The Arabian Nights contains one tale of the early Arabs the story of Gharib and his brother Ajib which repeats some of the exploits of Antar a tale far inferior to the romance The excellences of the Arabian Nights are of another order We must look for them in the pompous enchantments of the City of Brass or in the tender constancy of Aziz and Azizah or in the tale of Hasan of Bassorah with its lovely study of the friendship of a foster sister and its wonderful presentment of the magic surroundings of the country of the Jann To select specimens from Antar is like selecting from Robinson Crusoe In the romance Antar s adventures go on and on and the character of the hero develops before one s eyes It may be that the leisure of the desert is needed fully to appreciate this master work Illustration Signature EDWARD S HOLDEN THE VALOR OF ANTAR Now Antar was becoming a big boy and grew up and used to accompany his mother Zebeeba to the pastures and he watched the cattle and this he continued to do till he increased in stature He used to walk and run about to harden himself till at length his muscles were strengthened his frame altogether more robust his bones more firm and solid and his speech correct His days were passed in roaming about the mountain sides and thus he continued till he attained his tenth year He now kills a wolf which had attacked his father s flocks and breaks into verse to celebrate his victory O thou wolf eager for death I have left thee wallowing in dust and spoiled of life thou wouldst have the run of my flocks but I have left thee dyed with blood thou wouldst disperse my sheep and thou knowest I am a lion that never fears This is the way I treat thee thou dog of the desert Hast thou ever before seen battle and wars His next adventure brought him to the notice of the chief of the tribe King Zoheir A slave of Prince Shas insulted a poor feeble woman who was tending her sheep on which Antar dashed him against the ground And his length and breadth were all one mass This deed won for Antar the hatred of Prince Shas the friendship of the gentle Prince Malik and the praise of the king their father This valiant fellow said the king has defended the honor of women From that day both King Zoheir and his son Malik conceived a great affection for Antar and as Antar returned home the women all collected around him to ask him what had happened among them were his aunts and his cousin whose name was Ibla Now Ibla was younger than Antar and a merry lass She was lovely as the moon at its full and perfectly beautiful and elegant One day he entered the house of his uncle Malik and found his aunt combing his cousin Ibla s hair which flowed down her back dark as the shades of night Antar was quite surprised he was greatly agitated and could pay no attention to anything he was anxious and thoughtful and his anguish daily became more oppressive Meeting her at a feast he addressed her in verse The lovely virgin has struck my heart with the arrow of a glance for which there is no cure Sometimes she wishes for a feast in the sandhills like a fawn whose eyes are full of magic She moves I should say it was the branch of the Tamarisk that waves its branches to the southern breeze She approaches I should say it was the frightened fawn when a calamity alarms it in the waste When Ibla heard from Antar this description of her charms she was in astonishment But Antar continued in this state for days and nights his love and anguish ever increasing Antar resolves to be either tossed upon the spear heads or numbered among the noble and he wanders into the plain of lions As soon as Antar found himself in it he said to himself Perhaps I shall now find a lion and I will slay him Then behold a lion appeared in the middle of the valley he stalked about and roared aloud wide were his nostrils and fire flashed from his eyes the whole valley trembled at every gnash of his fangs he was a calamity and his claws more dreadful than the deadliest catastrophe thunder pealed as he roared vast was his strength and his force dreadful broad were his paws and his head immense Just at that moment Shedad and his brothers came up They saw Antar address the lion and heard the verses that he repeated he sprang forward like a hailstorm and hissed at him like a black serpent he met the lion as he sprang and outroared his bellow then giving a dreadful shriek he seized hold of his mouth with his hand and wrenched it open to his shoulders and he shouted aloud the valley and the country round echoed back the war Those who were watching were astonished at his prowess and began to fear Antar The horsemen now set off to attack the tribe of Temeem leaving the slaves to guard the women Antar was in transports on seeing Ibla appear with the other women She was indeed like an amorous fawn and when Antar was attending her he was overwhelmed in the ocean of his love and became the slave of her sable tresses They sat down to eat and the wine cups went merrily round It was the spring of the year when the whole land shone in all its glory the vines hung luxuriantly in the arbors the flowers shed around ambrosial fragrance every hillock sparkled in the beauty of its colors the birds in responsive melody sang sweetly from each bush and harmony issued from their throats the ground was covered with flowers and herbs while the nightingales filled the air with their softest notes While the maidens were singing and sporting lo on a sudden appeared a cloud of dust walling the horizon and a vast clamor arose A troop of horses and their riders some seventy in number rushed forth to seize the women and made them prisoners Antar instantly rescues Ibla from her captors and engages the enemy He rushed forward to meet them and harder than flint was his heart and in his attack was their fate and destiny He returned home taking with him five and twenty horses and all the women and children Now the hatred of Semeeah his stepmother was converted into love and tenderness and he became dearer to her than sleep He had thenceforward a powerful ally in her a fervent friend in Prince Malik a wily counselor in his brother Shiboob And Antar made great progress in Ibla s heart from the verses that he spoke in her praise such verses as these I love thee with the love of a noble born hero and I am content with thy imaginary phantom Thou art my sovereign in my very blood and my mistress and in thee is all my confidence Antar s astonishing valor gained him the praise of the noble Absian knights and he was emboldened to ask his father Shedad to acknowledge him for his son that he might become a chief among the Arabs Shedad enraged drew his sword and rushed upon Antar to kill him but was prevented by Semeeah Antar in the greatest agony of spirit was ashamed that the day should dawn on him after this refusal or that he should remain any longer in the country He mounted his horse put on his armor and traveled on till he was far from the tents and he knew not whither he was going Antar had proceeded some way when lo a knight rushed out from the ravines in the rocks mounted on a dark colored colt beautiful and compact and of a race much prized among the Arabs his hoofs were as flat as the beaten coin when he neighed he seemed as if about to speak and his ears were like quills his sire was Wasil and his dam Hemama When Antar cast his eye upon the horse and observed his speed and his paces he felt that no horse could surpass him so his whole heart and soul longed for him And when the knight perceived that Antar was making toward him he spurred his horse and it fled beneath him for this was a renowned horseman called Harith the son of Obad and he was a valiant hero By various devices Antar became possessed of the noble horse Abjer whose equal no prince or emperor could boast of His mettle was soon tried in an affray with the tribe of Maan headed by the warrior Nakid who was ferocious as a lion When Nakid saw the battle of Antar and how alone he stood against five thousand and was making them drink of the cup of death and perdition he was overwhelmed with astonishment at his deeds Thou valiant slave he cried how powerful is thine arm how strong thy wrist And he rushed down upon Antar And Antar presented himself before him for he was all anxiety to meet him O thou base born cried Nakid But Antar permitted him not to finish his speech before he assaulted him with the assault of a lion and roared at him he was horrified and paralyzed at the sight of Antar Antar attacked him thus scared and petrified and struck him with his sword on the head and cleft him down the back and he fell cut in twain from the horse and he was split in two as if by a balance and as Antar dealt the blow he cried out Oh by Abs oh by Adnan I am ever the lover of Ibla No sooner did the tribe of Maan behold Antar s blow than every one was seized with fear and dismay The whole five thousand made an attack like the attack of a single man but Antar received them as the parched ground receives the first of the rain His eyeballs were fiery red and foam issued from his lips whenever he smote he cleft the head every warrior he assailed he annihilated he tore a rider from the back of his horse he heaved him on high and whirling him in the air he struck down another with him and the two instantly expired By thine eyes Ibla he cried to day will I destroy all this race Thus he proceeded until he terrified the warriors and hurled them into woe and disgrace hewing off their arms and their joints At the moment of Antar s victory his friends arrive to see his triumph On his way back with them he celebrates his love for Ibla in verses When the breezes blow from Mount Saadi their freshness calms the fire of my love and transports Her throat complains of the darkness of her necklaces Alas the effects of that throat and that necklace Will fortune ever O daughter of Malik ever bless me with thy embrace that would cure my heart of the sorrows of love If my eye could see her baggage camels and her family I would rub my cheeks on the hoofs of her camels I will kiss the earth where thou art mayhap the fire of my love and ecstasy may be quenched I am the well known Antar the chief of his tribe and I shall die but when I am gone histories shall tell of me From that day forth Antar was named Abool fawaris that is to say the father of horsemen His sword Dhami the trenchant was forged from a meteor that fell from the sky it was two cubits long and two spans wide If it were presented to Nushirvan King of Persia he would exalt the giver with favors or if it were presented to the Emperor of Europe one would be enriched with treasures of gold and silver As soon as Gheidac saw the tribe of Abs and Antar the destroyer of horsemen his heart was overjoyed and he cried out This is a glorious morning to day will I take my revenge So he assailed the tribe of Abs and Adnan and his people attacked behind him like a cloud when it pours forth water and rains And the Knight of Abs assaulted them likewise anxious to try his sword the famous Dhami And Antar fought with Gheidac and wearied him and shouted at him and filled him with horror then assailed him so that stirrup grated stirrup and he struck him on the head with Dhami He cleft his visor and wadding and his sword played away between the eyes passing through his shoulders down to the back of the horse even down to the ground and he and his horse made four pieces and to the strictest observer it would appear that he had divided them with scales And God prospered Antar in all that he did so that he slew all he aimed at and overthrew all he touched Nobility said Antar among liberal men is the thrust of the spear the blow of the sword and patience beneath the battle dust I am the physician of the tribe of Abs in sickness their protector in disgrace the defender of their wives when they are in trouble their horseman when they are in glory and their sword when they rush to arms This was Antar s speech to Monzar King of the Arabs when he was in search of Ibla s dowry He found it in the land of Irak where the magnificent Chosroe was ready to reward him even to the half of his kingdom for his victory over the champion of the Emperor of Europe All this grandeur and all these gifts said Antar have no value to me no charm in my eyes Love of my native land is the fixed passion of my soul Do not imagine said Chosroe that we have been able duly to recompense you What we have given you is perishable as everything human is but your praises and your poems will endure forever Antar s wars made him a Nocturnal Calamity to the foes of his tribe He was its protector and the champion of its women for Antar was particularly solicitous in the cause of women His generosity knew no bounds Antar immediately presented the whole of the spoil to his father and his uncles and all the tribe of Abs were astonished at his noble conduct and filial love His hospitality was universal his magnanimity without limit Do not bear malice O Shiboob Renounce it for no good ever came of malice Violence is infamous its result is ever uncertain and no one can act justly when actuated by hatred Let my heart support every evil and let my patience endure till I have subdued all my foes Time after time he won new dowries for Ibla even bringing the treasures of Persia to her feet Treacheries without count divided him from his promised bride Over and over again he rescued her from the hands of the enemy and not only her but her father and her hostile kinsmen At last in the fourth volume on the fourteen hundred and fifty third page Antar makes his wedding feasts I wish to make at Ibla s wedding five separate feasts I will feed the birds and the beasts the men and the women the girls and the boys and not a single person shall remain in the whole country but shall eat at Ibla s marriage festival Antar was at the summit of his happiness and delight congratulating himself on his good fortune and perfect felicity all trouble and anxiety being now banished from his heart Praise be to God the dispenser of all grief from the hearts of virtuous men The three hundred and sixty tribes of the Arabs were invited to the feast and on the eighth day the assembled chiefs presented their gifts horses armor slaves perfumes gold velvet camels The number of slaves Antar received that day was five and twenty hundred to each of whom he gave a damsel a horse and weapons And they all mounted when he rode out and halted when he halted Now when all the Arab chiefs had presented their offerings each according to his circumstances Antar rose and called out to Mocriul Wahsh O Knight of Syria said he let all the he and she camels high priced horses and all the various rarities I have received this day be a present from me to you But the perfumes of ambergris and fragrant musk belong to my cousin Ibla and the slaves shall form my army and troops And the Arab chiefs marveled at his generosity And now Ibla was clothed in the most magnificent garments and superb necklaces they placed the coronet of Chosroe on her head and tiaras round her forehead They lighted brilliant and scented candles before her the perfumes were scattered the torches blazed and Ibla came forth in state All present gave a shout while the malicious and ill natured cried aloud What a pity that one so beautiful and fair should be wedded to one so black The selections are from Hamilton s translation Two long episodes in Antar are especially noteworthy the famous horse race between the champions of the tribes of Abs and Fazarah Vol iv Chapter thirty three and the history of Khalid and Jaida Vol ii Chapter eleven LUCIUS APULEIUS Second Century A D Lucius Apuleius author of the brilliant Latin novel The Metamorphoses also called The Golden Ass and more generally known under that title will be remembered when many greater writers shall have been forgotten The downfall of Greek political freedom brought a period of intellectual development fertile in prose story telling short fables and tales novels philosophic and religious historical and satiric novels of love novels of adventure Yet strange to say while the instinct was prolific in the Hellenic domain of the Roman Empire it was for the most part sterile in Italy though Roman life was saturated with the influence of Greek culture Its only two notable examples are Petronius Arbiter and Apuleius both of whom belong to the first two centuries of the Christian epoch Illustration Apuleius The suggestion of the plan of the novel familiarly known as The Golden Ass was from a Greek source Lucius of Patrae The original version was still extant in the days of Photius Patriarch of the Greek Church in the ninth century Lucian the Greek satirist also utilized the same material in a condensed form in his Lucius or the Ass But Apuleius greatly expanded the legend introduced into it numerous episodes and made it the background of a vivid picture of the manners and customs of a corrupt age Yet underneath its lively portraiture there runs a current of mysticism at variance with the naive rehearsal of the hero s adventures and this has tempted critics to find a hidden meaning in the story Bishop Warburton in his Divine Legation of Moses professes to see in it a defense of Paganism at the expense of struggling Christianity While this seems absurd it is fairly evident that the mind of the author was busied with something more than the mere narration of rollicking adventure more even than a satire on Roman life The transformation of the hero into an ass at the moment when he was plunging headlong into a licentious career and the recovery of his manhood again through divine intervention suggest a serious symbolism The beautiful episode of Cupid and Psyche which would lend salt to a production far more corrupt is also suggestive Apuleius perfected this wild flower of ancient folk lore into a perennial plant that has blossomed ever since along the paths of literature and art The story has been accepted as a fitting embodiment of the struggle of the soul toward a higher perfection yet strange to say the episode is narrated with as brutal a realism as if it were a satire of Lucian and its style is belittled with petty affectations of rhetoric It is the enduring beauty of the conception that has continued to fascinate Hence we may say of The Golden Ass in its entirety that whether readers are interested in esoteric meanings to be divined or in the author s vivid sketches of his own period the novel has a charm which long centuries have failed to dim Apuleius was of African birth and of good family his mother having come of Plutarch s blood The second century of the Roman Empire when he lived he was born at Madaura about A D one hundred thirty nine was one of the most brilliant periods in history brilliant in its social gayety in its intellectual activities and in the splendor of its achievements The stimulus of the age spurred men far in good and evil Apuleius studied at Carthage and afterward at Rome both philosophy and religion though this bias seems not to have dulled his taste for worldly pleasure Poor in purse he finally enriched himself by marrying a wealthy widow and inheriting her property Her will was contested on the ground that this handsome and accomplished young literary man had exercised magic in winning his elderly bride The successful defense of Apuleius before his judges a most diverting composition so jaunty and full of witty impertinences that it is evident he knew the hard headed Roman judges would dismiss the prosecution as a farce is still extant under the name of The Apology or Concerning Magic This in after days became oddly jumbled with the story of The Golden Ass and its transformations so that saint Augustine was inclined to believe Apuleius actually a species of professional wizard The plot of The Golden Ass is very simple Lucius of Madaura a young man of property sets out on his travels to sow his wild oats He pursues this pleasant occupation with the greatest zeal according to the prevailing mode he is no moralist The partner of his first intrigue is the maid of a woman skilled in witchcraft The curiosity of Lucius being greatly exercised about the sorceress and her magic he importunes the girl to procure from her mistress a magic salve which will transform him at will into an owl By mistake he receives the wrong salve and instead of the bird metamorphosis which he had looked for he undergoes an unlooked for change into an ass In this guise and in the service of various masters he has opportunities of observing the follies of men from a novel standpoint His adventures are numerous and he hears many strange stories the latter being chronicled as episodes in the record of his experiences At last the goddess Isis appears in a dream and obligingly shows him the way to effect his second metamorphosis by aid of the high priest of her temple where certain mysteries are about to be celebrated Lucius is freed from his disguise and is initiated into the holy rites The Golden Ass is full of dramatic power and variety The succession of incident albeit grossly licentious at times engages the interest without a moment s dullness The main narrative indeed is no less entertaining than the episodes The work became a model for story writers of a much later period even to the times of Fielding and Smollett Boccaccio borrowed freely from it at least one of the many humorous exploits of Cervantes s Don Quixote can be attributed to an adventure of Lucius while Gil Blas abounds in reminiscences of the Latin novel The student of folk lore will easily detect in the tasks imposed by Venus on her unwelcome daughter in law in the episode of Cupid and Psyche the possible original from which the like fairy tales of Europe drew many a suggestion Probably Apuleius himself was indebted to still earlier Greek sources Scarcely any Latin production was more widely known and studied from the beginning of the Italian Renaissance to the middle of the seventeenth century In its style however it is far from classic It is full of archaisms and rhetorical conceits In striving to say things finely the author frequently failed to say them well This fault however largely disappears in the translation and whatever may be the literary defects of the novel it offers rich compensation in the liveliness humor and variety of its substance In addition to The Golden Ass the extant writings of Apuleius include Florida an anthology from his own works The God of Socrates The Philosophy of Plato and Concerning the World a treatise once attributed to Aristotle The best modern edition of his complete works is that of Hildebrand Leipzig eighteen forty two of the Metamorphoses that of Eyssenhardt Berlin eighteen sixty nine There have been many translations into the modern languages The best English versions are those of T Taylor London eighteen twenty two of Sir G Head somewhat expurgated London eighteen fifty one and an unsigned translation published in the Bohn Library which has been drawn on for this work but greatly rewritten as too stiff and prolix and in the conversations often wholly unnatural A very pretty edition in French with many illustrations is that of Savalete Paris eighteen seventy two THE TALE OF ARISTOMENES THE COMMERCIAL TRAVELER From The Metamorphoses I am a native of AEgina and I travel in Thessaly AEtolia and Boeotia to purchase honey of Hypata cheese and other articles used in cookery Having heard that at Hypata the principal city of Thessaly fine flavored new cheese was for sale cheap I made the best of my way there to buy it all up But as usual happening to start left foot foremost which is unlucky all my hopes of profit came to nothing for a fellow named Lupus a merchant who does things on a big scale had bought the whole of it the day before Weary with my hurried journey to no purpose I was going early in the evening to the public baths when to my surprise I espied an old companion of mine named Socrates He was sitting on the ground half covered with a rag tag cloak and looking like somebody else he was so miserably wan and thin in fact just like a street beggar so that though he used to be my friend and close acquaintance I had two minds about speaking to him How now friend Socrates said I what does this mean Why are you tricked out like this What crime have you been guilty of Why you look as though your family had given you up for dead and held your funeral long ago the probate judge had appointed guardians for your children and your wife disfigured by her long mourning having cried herself almost blind was being worried by her parents to sit up and take notice of things and look for a new marriage Yet now all of a sudden here you come before us like a wretched ghost from the dead to turn everything upside down O Aristomenes said he it s clear that you don t know the slippery turns the freaks and the never ending tricks of fortune As he said this he hid his face crimson with shame in his one garment of patches and tatters I could not bear such a miserable sight and tried to raise him from the ground But he kept saying with his head all covered up Let me alone let me alone let Fortune have her way with me However I finally persuaded him to go with me and at the same time pulling off one of my own garments I speedily clothed him or at any rate covered him I next took him to a bath scrubbed and oiled him myself and laboriously rubbed the matted dirt off him Having done all I could though tired out myself I supported his feeble steps and with great difficulty brought him to my inn There I made him lie down on a bed gave him plenty of food braced him up with wine and entertained him with the news of the day Pretty soon our conversation took a merry turn we cracked jokes and grew noisy as we chattered All of a sudden heaving a bitter sigh from the bottom of his chest and striking his forehead violently with his right hand he said Miserable wretch that I am to have got into such a predicament while having a good time at a gladiatorial show As you know I went to Macedonia on business it took me ten months I was on my way home with a very neat sum of money and had nearly reached Larissa which I included in my route in order to see the show I mentioned when I was attacked by robbers in a lonely valley and only escaped after losing everything I had In my distress I betook myself to a certain woman named Meroe who kept a tavern and who though rather old was very good looking and told her about my long absence my earnest desire to reach home and my being robbed that very day She treated me with the greatest kindness gave me a good supper for nothing and then let me make love to her But from the very moment that I was such a fool as to dally with her my mind seemed to desert me I even gave her the clothes which the robbers in common decency had left me and the little earnings I made there by working as cloakmaker so long as I was in good physical condition until at length this kind friend and bad luck together reduced me to the state you just now found me in By Pollux then said I you deserve to suffer the very worst misfortunes if there be anything worse than the worst for having preferred a wrinkled old reprobate to your home and children Hush hush said he putting his forefinger on his lips and looking round with a terror stricken face to see if we were alone Beware of reviling a woman skilled in the black art for fear of doing yourself a mischief Say you so said I What kind of a woman is this innkeeper so powerful and dreadful She is a sorceress he replied and possessed of magic powers she can draw down the heavens make the earth heave harden the running water dissolve mountains raise the shades of the dead dethrone the gods extinguish the stars and set the very depths of Tartarus ablaze Come come said I end this tragic talk fold up your theatrical drop scenes and let us hear your story in every day language Should you like said he to hear of one or two yes or a great many of her performances Why to make not only her fellow countrymen but the Indians the Ethiopians or even the Antipodeans love her to distraction are only the easy lessons of her art as it were and mere trifles Listen to what she has done before many witnesses By a single word she changed a lover into a beaver because he had gone to another flame She changed an innkeeper a neighbor of hers she was envious of into a frog and now the old fellow swimming about in a cask of his own wine or buried in the dregs croaks hoarsely to his old customers quite in the way of business She changed another person a lawyer from the Forum into a ram because he had conducted a suit against her to this very day that ram is always butting about Finally however public indignation was aroused by so many people coming to harm through her arts and the very next day had been fixed upon to wreak a fearful vengeance on her by stoning her to death She frustrated the design by her enchantments You remember how Medea having got Creon to allow her just one day before her departure burned his whole palace with himself and his daughter in it by means of flames issuing from a garland Well this sorceress having performed certain deadly incantations in a ditch she told me so herself in a drunken fit confined everybody in the town each in his own house for two whole days by a secret spell of the demons The bars could not be wrenched off nor the doors taken off the hinges nor even a breach made in the walls At last by common consent the people all swore they would not lift a hand against her and would come to her defense if any one else did She then liberated the whole city But in the middle of the night she conveyed the author of the conspiracy with all his house close barred as it was the walls the very ground and even the foundations to another city a hundred miles off on the top of a craggy mountain and so without water And as the houses of the inhabitants were built so close together that there was not room for the new comer she threw down the house before the gate of the city and took her departure You narrate marvelous things said I my good Socrates and no less terrible than marvelous In fact you have excited no small anxiety indeed I may say fear in me too not a mere grain of apprehension but a piercing dread for fear this old hag should come to know our conversation in the same way by the help of some demon Let us get to bed without delay and when we have rested ourselves by a little sleep let us fly as far as we possibly can before daylight While I was still advising him thus the worthy Socrates overcome by more wine than he was used to and by his fatigue had fallen asleep and was snoring loudly I shut the door drew the bolts and placing my bed close against the hinges tossed it up well and lay down on it I lay awake some time through fear but closed my eyes at last a little before midnight I had just fallen asleep when suddenly the door was burst open with such violence that it was evidently not done by robbers the hinges were absolutely broken and wrenched off and it was thrown to the ground The small bedstead minus one foot and rotten was also upset by the shock and falling upon me who had been rolled out on the floor it completely covered and hid me Then I perceived that certain emotions can be excited by exactly opposite causes for as tears often come from joy so in spite of my terror I could not help laughing to see myself turned from Aristomenes into a tortoise As I lay on the floor completely covered by the bed and peeping out to see what was the matter I saw two old women one carrying a lighted lamp and the other a sponge and a drawn sword plant themselves on either side of Socrates who was fast asleep The one with the sword said to the other This sister Panthea is my dear Endymion my Ganymede who by day and by night has laughed my youth to scorn This is he who despising my passion not only defames me with abusive language but is preparing also for flight and I forsooth deserted through the craft of this Ulysses like another Calypso am to be left to lament in eternal loneliness Then extending her right hand and pointing me out to her friend Panthea And there said she is his worthy counselor Aristomenes who was the planner of this flight and who now half dead is lying flat on the ground under the bedstead and looking at all that is going on while he fancies that he is to tell scandalous stories of me with impunity I ll take care however that some day aye and before long too this very instant in fact he shall repent of his recent chatter and his present curiosity On hearing this I felt myself streaming with cold perspiration and my heart began to throb so violently that even the bedstead danced on my back Well sister said the worthy Panthea shall we hack him to pieces at once like the Bacchanals or tie his limbs and mutilate him To this Meroe replied and I saw from what was happening as well as from what Socrates had told how well the name fitted her Rather let him live if only to cover the body of this wretched creature with a little earth Then moving Socrates s head to one side she plunged the sword into his throat up to the hilt catching the blood in a small leathern bottle so carefully that not a drop of it was to be seen All this I saw with my own eyes The worthy Meroe in order I suppose not to omit any due observance in the sacrifice of the victim then thrust her right hand through the wound and drew forth the heart of my unhappy companion His windpipe being severed he emitted a sort of indistinct gurgling noise and poured forth his breath with his bubbling blood Panthea then stopped the gaping wound with a sponge exclaiming Beware O sea born sponge how thou dost pass through a river When she had said this they lifted my bed from the ground and dashed over me a mass of filth Hardly had they passed over the threshold when the door resumed its former state The hinges settled back on the panels the posts returned to the bars and the bolts flew back to their sockets again I lay prostrate on the ground in a squalid plight terrified naked cold and drenched Indeed I was half dead though still alive and pursued a train of reflections like one already in the grave or to say the least on the way to the cross to which I was surely destined What said I will become of me when this man is found in the morning with his throat cut If I tell the truth who will believe a word of the story You ought at least they will say to have called for help if as strong a man as you are could not withstand a woman Is a man s throat to be cut before your eyes and you keep silence Why was it that you were not assassinated too How did the villains come to spare you a witness of the murder They would naturally kill you if only to put an end to all evidence of the crime Since your escape from death was against reason return to it I said these things to myself over and over again while the night was fast verging toward day It seemed best to me therefore to escape on the sly before daylight and pursue my journey though I was all in a tremble I took up my bundle put the key in the door and drew back the bolts But this good and faithful door which had opened of its own accord in the night would not open now till I had tried the key again and again Hallo porter said I where are you Open the gate I want to be off before daybreak The porter who was lying on the ground behind the door only grunted Why do you want to begin a journey at this time of night Don t you know the roads are infested by robbers You may have a mind to meet your death perhaps your conscience stings you for some crime you have committed but I haven t a head like a pumpkin that I should die for your sake It isn t very far from daybreak said I and besides what can robbers take from a traveler in utter poverty Don t you know you fool that a naked man can t be stripped by ten athletes The drowsy porter turned over and answered And how am I to know but what you have murdered that fellow traveler of yours that you came here with last night and are running away to save yourself And now I remember that I saw Tartarus through a hole in the earth just at that hour and Cerberus looking ready to eat me up Then I came to the conclusion that the worthy Meroe had not spared my throat out of pity but to reserve me for the cross So on returning to my chamber I thought over some speedy method of putting an end to myself but fortune had provided me with no weapon for self destruction except the bedstead Now bedstead said I most dear to my soul partner with me in so many sorrows fully conscious and a spectator of this night s events and whom alone when accused I can adduce as a witness of my innocence do thou supply me who would fain hasten to the shades below a welcome instrument of death Thus saying I began to undo the bed cord I threw one end of it over a small beam projecting above the window fastened it there and made a slip knot at the other end Then I mounted on the bed and thus elevated for my own destruction put my head into the noose and kicked away my support with one foot so that the noose tightened about my throat by the strain of my weight might stop my breath But the rope which was old and rotten broke in two and falling from aloft I tumbled heavily upon Socrates who was lying close by and rolled with him on the floor Lo and behold at that very instant the porter burst into the room bawling out Where are you you who were in such monstrous haste to be off at midnight and now lie snoring rolled up in the bed clothes At these words whether awakened by my fall or by the rasping voice of the porter I know not Socrates was the first to start up and he exclaimed Evidently travelers have good reason for detesting these hostlers This nuisance here breaking in without being asked most likely to steal something has waked me out of a sound sleep by his outrageous bellowing On hearing him speak I jumped up briskly in an ecstasy of unhoped for joy Faithfulest of porters I exclaimed my friend my own father and my brother behold him whom you in your drunken fit falsely accuse me of having murdered So saying I embraced Socrates and was for loading him with kisses but he repulsed me with considerable violence Get out with you he cried Sorely confused I trumped up some absurd story on the spur of the moment to give another turn to the conversation and taking him by the right hand Why not be off said I and enjoy the freshness of the morning on our journey So I took my bundle and having paid the innkeeper for our night s lodging we started on our road We had gone some little distance and now everything being illumined by the beams of the rising sun I keenly and attentively examined that part of my companion s neck into which I had seen the sword plunged Foolish man said I to myself buried in your cups you certainly have had a most absurd dream Why look here s Socrates safe sound and hearty Where is the wound Where is the sponge Where is the scar of a gash so deep and so recent Addressing myself to him I remarked No wonder the doctors say that hideous and ominous dreams come only to people stuffed with food and liquor My own case is a good instance I went beyond moderation in my drinking last evening and have passed a wretched night full of shocking and dreadful visions so that I still fancy myself spattered and defiled with human gore It is not gore he replied with a smile that you are sprinkled with And yet in my sleep I thought my own throat was being cut and felt some pain in my neck and fancied that my very heart was being plucked out Even now I am quite faint my knees tremble I stagger as I go and feel in want of some food to hearten me up Look cried I here is breakfast all ready for you So saying I lifted my wallet from my shoulders handed him some bread and cheese and said Let us sit down near that plane tree We did so and I helped myself to some refreshment While looking at him more closely as he was eating with a voracious appetite I saw that he was faint and of a hue like boxwood His natural color in fact had so forsaken him that as I recalled those nocturnal furies to my frightened imagination the very first piece of bread I put in my mouth though exceedingly small stuck in the middle of my throat and would pass neither downward nor upward Besides the number of people passing along increased my fears for who would believe that one of two companions could meet his death except at the hands of the other Presently after having gorged himself with food he began to be impatient for some drink for he had bolted the larger part of an excellent cheese Not far from the roots of the plane tree a gentle stream flowed slowly along like a placid lake rivaling silver or crystal Look said I drink your fill of the water of this stream bright as the Milky Way He arose and wrapping himself in his cloak with his knees doubled under him knelt down upon the shelving bank and bent greedily toward the water Scarcely had he touched its surface with his lips when the wound in his throat burst open and the sponge rolled out a few drops of blood with it and his lifeless body would have fallen into the river had I not laid hold of one of his feet and dragged him with great difficulty and labor to the top of the bank There having mourned my hapless comrade as much as there was time I buried him in the sandy soil that bordered the stream Then trembling and terror stricken I fled through various unfrequented places and as though guilty of homicide abandoned my country and my home embraced a voluntary exile and now dwell in AEtolia where I have married another wife Translated for A Library of the World s Best Literature THE AWAKENING OF CUPID The radical difference in the constituent parts of the Golden Ass is startling and is well illustrated by the selection given previously and that which follows The story of the drummer comports exactly with the modern idea of realism in fiction a vivid and unflinching picture of manners and morals full of broad coarse humor and worldly wit The story of Cupid and Psyche is the purest daintiest most poetic of fancies in essence a fairy tale that might be told of an evening by the fire light in the second century or the nineteenth but embodying also a high and beautiful allegory and treated with a delicate art which is in extreme contrast with the body of the Golden Ass The difference is almost as striking as between Gray s lampoon on Jemmy Twitcher and his Bard or Elegy or between Aristophanes s revels in filth and his ecstatic soarings into the heavenliest regions of poetry The contrast is even more rasping when we remember that the tale is not put into the mouth of a girl gazing dreamily into the glowing coals on the hearth or of some elegant reciter amusing a social group in a Roman drawing room or garden but of a grizzled hag who is maid of all work in a robbers cave She tells it to divert the mind of a lovely young bride held for ransom It begins like a modern fairy tale with a great king and queen who had three daughters of remarkable beauty the loveliest being the peerless Psyche Even Venus becomes envious of the honors paid to Psyche s charms and summons Cupid to wing one of his shafts which shall cause her to be seized with the most burning love for the lowest of mankind so as to disgrace and ruin her Cupid undertakes the task but instead falls in love with her himself Meanwhile an oracle from Apollo instigated by Venus dooms her to be sacrificed in marriage to some unknown aerial monster who must find her alone on a naked rock She is so placed awaiting her doom in terror but the zephyrs bear her away to the palace of Love Cupid hides her there lest Venus wreak vengeance on them both and there half terrified but soon soothed in the darkness of night she hears from Cupid that he her husband is no monster but the fairest of immortals He will not disclose his identity however not only so but he tenderly warns her that she must not seek to discover it or even to behold him till he gives permission unless she would bring hopeless disaster on both Nor must she confide in her two sisters lest their unwisdom or sudden envy cause harm The simple hearted and affectionate girl however in her craving for sympathy cannot resist the temptation to boast of her happiness to her sisters She invites them to pass a day in her magnificent new home and tells contradictory stories about her husband Alas they depart bitterly envious and plotting to make her ruin her own joy out of fear and curiosity What are we to say sister said one to the other of the monstrous lies of that silly creature At one time her husband is a young man with the down just showing itself on his chin at another he is of middle age and his hair begins to be silvered with gray You may depend upon it sister either the wretch has invented these lies to deceive us or else she does not know herself how her husband looks Whichever is the case she must be deprived of these riches as soon as possible And yet if she is really ignorant of her husband s appearance she must no doubt have married a god and who knows what will happen At all events if which heaven forbid she does become the mother of a divine infant I shall instantly hang myself Meanwhile let us return to our parents and devise some scheme based on what we have just been saying The sisters thus inflamed with jealousy called on their parents in a careless and disdainful manner and after being kept awake all night by the turbulence of their spirits made all haste at morning to the rock whence by the wonted assistance of the breeze they descended swiftly to Psyche and with tears squeezed out by rubbing their eyelids thus craftily addressed her Happy indeed are you and fortunate in your very ignorance of so heavy a misfortune There you sit without a thought of danger while we your sisters who watch over your interests with the most vigilant care are in anguish at your lost condition For we have learned as truth and as sharers in your sorrows and misfortunes cannot conceal it from you that it is an enormous serpent gliding along in many folds and coils with a neck swollen with deadly venom and prodigious gaping jaws that secretly sleeps with you by night Remember the Pythian Oracle Besides a great many of the husbandmen who hunt all round the country and ever so many of the neighbors have observed him returning home from his feeding place in the evening All declare too that he will not long continue to pamper you with delicacies but will presently devour you Will you listen to us who are so anxious for your precious safety and avoiding death live with us secure from danger or die horribly But if you are fascinated by your country home or by the endearments of a serpent we have at all events done our duty toward you like affectionate sisters Poor simple tender hearted Psyche was aghast with horror at this dreadful story and quite bereft of her senses lost all remembrance of her husband s admonitions and of her own promises and hurled herself headlong into the very abyss of calamity Trembling therefore with pale and livid cheeks and an almost lifeless voice she faltered out these broken words Dearest sisters you have acted toward me as you ought and with your usual affectionate care and indeed it appears to me that those who gave you this information have not invented a falsehood For in fact I have never yet beheld my husband s face nor do I know at all whence he comes I only hear him speak in an undertone by night and have to bear with a husband of an unknown appearance and one that has an utter aversion to the light of day He may well therefore be some monster or other Besides he threatens some shocking misfortune as the consequence of indulging any curiosity to view his features So then if you are able to give any aid to your sister in this perilous emergency don t delay a moment One of them replies Since the ties of blood oblige us to disregard peril when your safety is to be insured we will tell you the only means of safety We have considered it over and over again On that side of the bed where you are used to lie conceal a very sharp razor and also hide under the tapestry a lighted lamp well trimmed and full of oil Make these preparations with the utmost secrecy After the monster has glided into bed as usual when he is stretched out at length fast asleep and breathing heavily as you slide out of bed go softly along with bare feet and on tiptoe and bring out the lamp from its hiding place then having the aid of its light raise your right hand bring down the weapon with all your might and cut off the head of the creature at the neck Then we will bring you away with all these things and if you wish will wed you to a human creature like yourself They then depart fearing for themselves if they are near when the catastrophe happens But Psyche now left alone except so far as a person who is agitated by maddening Furies is not alone fluctuated in sorrow like a stormy sea and though her purpose was fixed and her heart was resolute when she first began to make preparations for the impious work her mind now wavered and feared She hurried she procrastinated now she was bold now tremulous now dubious now agitated by rage and what was the most singular thing of all in the same being she hated the beast and loved the husband Nevertheless as the evening drew to a close she hurriedly prepared the instruments of her enterprise The night came and with it her husband After he fell asleep Psyche to whose weak body and spirit the cruel influence of fate imparted unusual strength uncovered the lamp and seized the knife with the courage of a man But the instant she advanced she beheld the very gentlest and sweetest of all creatures even Cupid himself the beautiful God of Love there fast asleep at sight of whom the joyous flame of the lamp shone with redoubled vigor and the sacrilegious dagger repented the keenness of its edge But Psyche losing the control of her senses faint deadly pale and trembling all over fell on her knees and made an attempt to hide the blade in her own bosom and this no doubt she would have done had not the blade dreading the commission of such a crime glided out of her rash hand And now faint and unnerved as she was she felt herself refreshed at heart by gazing upon the beauty of those divine features She looked upon the genial locks of his golden head teeming with ambrosial perfume the circling curls that strayed over his milk white neck and roseate cheeks and fell gracefully entangled some before and some behind causing the very light of the lamp itself to flicker by their radiant splendor On the shoulders of the god were dewy wings of brilliant whiteness and though the pinions were at rest yet the tender down that fringed the feathers wantoned to and fro in tremulous unceasing play The rest of his body was smooth and beautiful and such as Venus could not have repented of giving birth to At the foot of his bed lay his bow his quiver and his arrows the auspicious weapons of the mighty god While with insatiable wonder and curiosity Psyche is examining and admiring her husband s weapons she draws one of the arrows out of the quiver and touches the point with the tip of her thumb to try its sharpness but happening to press too hard for her hand still trembled she punctured the skin so that some tiny drops of rosy blood oozed forth And thus did Psyche without knowing it fall in love with Love Then burning more and more with desire for Cupid gazing passionately on his face and fondly kissing him again and again her only fear was lest he should wake too soon But while she hung over him bewildered with delight so overpowering the lamp whether from treachery or baneful envy or because it longed to touch and to kiss as it were so beautiful an object spirted a drop of scalding oil from the summit of its flame upon the right shoulder of the god The god thus scorched sprang from the bed and seeing the disgraceful tokens of forfeited fidelity started to fly away without a word from the eyes and arms of his most unhappy wife But Psyche the instant he arose seized hold of his right leg with both hands and hung on to him a wretched appendage to his flight through the regions of the air till at last her strength failed her and she fell to the earth Translation of Bohn Library revised THOMAS AQUINAS twelve twenty six twelve seventy four BY EDWIN A PACE Thomas Aquinas philosopher and theologian was born in twelve twenty six at or near Aquino in Southern Italy He received his early training from the Benedictines of Monte Cassino Tradition says he was a taciturn and seemingly dull boy derisively nicknamed by his fellows the dumb ox but admired by his teachers He subsequently entered the University of Naples While studying there he joined the Dominican Order and was sent later on to Cologne where he became a pupil of Albertus Magnus In twelve fifty one he went to Paris took his degrees in theology and began his career as a teacher in the University His academic work there was continued with slight interruptions till twelve sixty one The eleven years which followed were spent partly in Rome where Thomas enjoyed the esteem of Urban IV and Clement IV and partly in the cities of Northern Italy which he visited in the interest of his Order During this period he produced the greatest of his works and won such repute as a theologian that the leading universities made every effort to secure him as a teacher He was appointed to a professorship at Naples where he remained from twelve seventy two until the early part of twelve seventy four Summoned by Gregory X to take part in the Council of Lyons he set out on his journey northward but was compelled by illness to stop at Fossa Nuova Here he died March seventh twelve seventy four He was canonized in thirteen twenty three and was proclaimed a doctor of the Church by Pius V in fifteen sixty seven Illustration THOMAS AQUINAS These honors were merited by a remarkable combination of ability and virtue To an absolute purity of life saint Thomas added an earnest love of truth and of labor Calm in the midst of discussion he was equally proof against the danger of brilliant success As the friend of popes and princes he might have attained the highest dignities but these he steadfastly declined devoting himself so far as his duty permitted to scientific pursuits Judged by his writings he was intense yet thoroughly objective firm in his own position but dispassionate in treating the opinions of others Conclusions reached by daring speculation and faultless logic are stated simply impersonally Keen replies are given without bitterness and the boldest efforts of reason are united with the submissiveness of faith His works fill twenty five large quarto volumes of the Parma edition This is so far the most complete collection though various portions have been edited from time to time with the commentaries of learned theologians like Cajetan and Sylvius Partial translations have also been made into several modern languages but as yet there is no complete English edition of saint Thomas Turning to the Latin text the student cannot but notice the contrast between the easy diction of modern philosophical writers and the rugged conciseness of the mediaeval Schoolman On the other hand disappointment awaits those who quit the pages of Cicero for the less elegant Latinity of the Middle Ages What can be said in favor of scholastic style is that it expresses clearly and tersely the subtle shades of thought which had developed through thirteen centuries and which often necessitated a sacrifice of classic form With the Schoolmen as with modern writers on scientific subjects precision was the first requisite and terminology was of more consequence than literary beauty Similar standards must be kept in view when we pass judgment upon the technique of saint Thomas In his presentation we find neither the eloquence nor the rhetoric of the Fathers He quotes them continually and in some of his works adopts their division into books and chapters But his exposition is more compact consisting at times of clear cut arguments in series without an attempt at transition at other times of sustained reasoning processes in which no phrase is superfluous and no word ambiguous Elsewhere he uses the more rigid mold which was peculiar to the Scholastic Period and had been fashioned chiefly by Alexander Hales Each subject is divided into so many questions and each question into so many articles The article begins with the statement of objections then discusses various opinions establishes the author s position and closes with a solution of the difficulties which that position may encounter This method had its advantages It facilitated analysis and obliged the writer to examine every aspect of a problem It secured breadth of view and thoroughness of treatment It was especially a transparent medium for reason unbiased by either sentiment or verbiage If such qualities of style and presentation were encouraged by the environment in which Aquinas pursued his earlier studies they were also helpful in the task which he chose as his life work This was the construction of a system in which all the elements of knowledge should be harmoniously united An undertaking so vast necessitated a long preparation the study of all available sources and the elucidation of many detailed problems Hence a considerable portion of saint Thomas s works is taken up with the explanation of Peter Lombard s Sententiae with Commentaries on Aristotle with Expositions of Sacred Scripture collections from the Fathers and various opuscula or studies on special subjects Under the title Quaestiones Disputatae numerous problems in philosophy and theology are discussed at length But the synthetic power of Aquinas is shown chiefly in the Contra Gentes and the Summa Theologica the former being a defense of Christian belief with special reference to Arabian philosophy and the latter a masterly compendium of rational and revealed truth The conception of the Summa was not altogether original From the earliest days of the Church men of genius had insisted on the reasonableness of Christian belief by showing that though supernatural in its origin it did not conflict with either the facts or the laws of human knowledge And as these had found their highest expression in Greek philosophy it was natural that this philosophy should serve as a basis for the elucidation of revealed truth The early Fathers turned to Plato not only because his teaching was so spiritual but also because it could be so readily used as a framework for those theological concepts which Christianity had brought into the world Thus adopted by men who were recognized authorities in the Church especially men like Augustine and the Areopagite Platonism endured for centuries as the rational element in dogmatic exposition Scholasticism inaugurated a new era Patristic erudition had gathered a wealth of theological knowledge which the Schoolmen fully appreciated But the same truths were to receive another setting and be treated by different methods Speculation changed its direction Aristotle taking the place of his master The peripatetic system found able exponents in the earlier Scholastics but Aquinas surpassed them alike in the mastery of the philosopher s principles and in his application of these principles to Christian doctrine His Commentaries on Aristotle adhere strictly to the text dissecting its meaning and throwing into relief the orderly sequence of ideas In his other works he develops the germs of thought which he had gathered from the Stagirite and makes them the groundwork of his philosophical and theological speculations With the subtlety of a metaphysician saint Thomas combined a vast erudition Quotations from the Fathers appear on nearly every page of his writings serving either as a keynote to the discussion which follows or as an occasion for solving objections Toward saint Augustine he shows the deepest reverence though their methods differ so widely and his brief but lucid comments throw light on difficult sayings of the great Doctor His familiarity with patristic theology is shown particularly in the Catena Aurea where he links with passages from the Sacred Text numerous extracts from the older commentators His respect for these interpretations did not prevent him from making a thorough search of Scripture itself With characteristic clearness and depth he interpreted various books of the Bible insisting chiefly on the doctrinal meaning The best of his work in this line was devoted to the Pauline Epistles and to the Book of Job but his mastery of each text is no less evident where he takes the authority of Scripture as the starting point in theological argument or makes it the crowning evidence at the close of a philosophical demonstration The materials gathered from Philosophy Tradition and Scripture were the fruit of analysis the final synthesis had yet to be accomplished This was the scope of the Summa Theologica a work which though it was not completed is the greatest production of Thomas Aquinas In the prologue he says Since the teacher of Catholic truth should instruct not only those who are advanced but also those who are beginning it is our purpose in this work to treat subjects pertaining to the Christian religion in a manner adapted to the instruction of beginners For we have considered that young students encounter various obstacles in the writings of different authors partly because of the multiplication of useless questions articles and arguments partly because the essentials of knowledge are dealt with not in scientific order but according as the explanation of books required or an occasion for disputing offered partly because the frequent repetition of the same things begets weariness and confusion in the hearer s mind Endeavoring therefore to avoid these defects and others of a like nature we shall try with confidence in the Divine assistance to treat of sacred science briefly and clearly so far as the subject matter will allow The work intended for novices in theology and so unpretentiously opened is then portioned out in these words Whereas the chief aim of this science is to impart a knowledge of God not only as existing in Himself but also as the origin and end of all things and especially of rational creatures we therefore shall treat first of God second of the rational creature s tendency toward God third of Christ who as man is the way whereby we approach unto God Concerning God we shall consider one those things which pertain to the Divine Essence two those which regard the distinction of persons three those which concern the origin of creatures from Him As to the Divine Essence we shall inquire one whether God exists two what is or rather what is not the manner of His existence three how He acts through His knowledge will and power Under the first heading we shall ask whether God s existence is self evident whether it can be demonstrated and whether God does exist Similar subdivisions precede each question as it comes up for discussion so that the student is enabled to take a comprehensive view and perceive the bearing of one problem on another as well as its place in the wide domain of theology As a consequence those who are familiar with the Summa find in it an object lesson of breadth proportion and orderly thinking Its chief merit however lies in the fact that it is the most complete and systematic exhibition of the harmony between reason and faith In it more than in any other of his works is displayed the mind of its author It determines his place in the history of thought and closes what may be called the second period in the development of Christian theology Scholasticism the high point of intellectual activity in the Church reached its culmination in Thomas Aquinas His works have been a rich source of information for Catholic theologians and his opinions have always commanded respect The polemics of the sixteenth century brought about a change in theological methods the positive and critical elements becoming more prominent Modern rationalism however has intensified the discussion of those fundamental problems which saint Thomas handled so thoroughly As his writings furnish both a forcible statement of the Catholic position and satisfactory replies to many current objections the Thomistic system has recently been restored The neo scholastic movement was initiated by Leo XIII in his Encyclical AEterni Patris dated August fourth eighteen seventy nine and its rapid growth has made Aquinas the model of Catholic thought in the nineteenth century as he certainly was in the thirteenth The subjoined extracts show his views on some questions of actual importance with regard not alone to mediaeval controversies but to the problems of the universe which will press on the minds of men twenty five hundred years in the future as they did twenty five hundred years in the past Illustration Signature Edw A Pace ON THE VALUE OF OUR CONCEPTS OF THE DEITY Part I From the Summa Theologica It is obvious that terms implying negation or extrinsic relation in no way signify the divine substance but simply the removal of some attribute from Him or His relation with other beings or rather the relation of other beings with Him As to appellations that are absolute and positive such as good wise and the like various opinions have been entertained It was held by some that these terms though used affirmatively were in reality devised for the purpose of elimination and not with the intent of positive attribution Hence they claimed when we say that God is a living being we mean that God s existence is not that of inanimate things and so on for other predicates This was the position of Rabbi Moses According to another view these terms are employed to denote a relation between God and creatures so that for instance when we say God is good we mean God is the cause of goodness in all things Both interpretations however are open to a threefold objection For in the first place neither can offer any explanation of the fact that certain terms are applied to the Deity in preference to others As He is the source of all good so He is the cause of all things corporeal consequently if by affirming that God is good we merely imply that He is the cause of goodness we might with equal reason assert that He is a corporeal being Again the inference from these positions would be that all terms applied to God have only a secondary import such for instance as we give to the word healthy as applied to medicine whereby we signify that it is productive of health in the organism while the organism itself is said properly and primarily to be healthy In the third place these interpretations distort the meaning of those who employ such terms in regard to the Deity For when they declare that He is the living God they certainly mean something else than that He is the cause of our life or that He is different from inanimate bodies We are obliged therefore to take another view and to affirm that such terms denote the substantial nature of God but that at the same time their representative force is deficient They express the knowledge which our intellect has of God and since this knowledge is gotten from created things we know Him according to the measure in which creatures represent Him Now God absolutely and in all respects perfect possesses every perfection that is found in His creatures Each created thing therefore inasmuch as it has some perfection resembles and manifests the Deity not as a being of the same species or genus with itself but as a supereminent source from which are derived its effects They represent Him in a word just as the energy of the terrestrial elements represents the energy of the sun Our manner of speech therefore denotes the substance of God yet denotes it imperfectly because creatures are imperfect manifestations of Him When we say that God is good we do not mean that He is the cause of goodness or that He is not evil Our meaning is this What we call goodness in creatures preexists in God in a far higher way Whence it follows not that God is good because He is the source of good but rather because He is good He imparts goodness to all things else as saint Augustine says Inasmuch as He is good we are HOW CAN THE ABSOLUTE BE A CAUSE From the Quaestiones Disputatae The relations which are spoken of as existing between God and creatures are not really in Him A real relation is that which exists between two things It is mutual or bilateral then only when its basis in both correlates is the same Such is the case in all quantitive relations Quantity being essentially the same in all quanta gives rise to relations which are real in both terms in the part for instance and in the whole in the unit of measurement and in that which is measured But where a relation originates in causation as between that which is active and that which is passive it does not always concern both terms True that which is acted upon or set in motion or produced must be related to the source of these modifications since every effect is dependent upon its cause And it is equally true that such causes or agencies are in some cases related to their effects namely when the production of those effects redounds in some way to the well being of the cause itself This is evidently what happens when like begets like and thereby perpetuates so far as may be its own species There are cases nevertheless in which a thing without being related has other things related to it The cognizing subject is related to that which is the object of cognition to a thing which is outside the mind But the thing itself is in no way affected by this cognition since the mental process is confined to the mind and therefore does not bring about any change in the object Hence the relation established by the act of knowing cannot be in that which is known The same holds good of sensation For though the physical object sets up changes in the sense organ and is related to it as other physical agencies are related to the things on which they act still the sensation implies over and above the organic change a subjective activity of which the external activity is altogether devoid Likewise we say that a man is at the right of a pillar because with his power of locomotion he can take his stand at the right or the left before or behind above or below But obviously these relations vary them as we will imply nothing in the stationary pillar though they are real in the man who holds or changes his position Once more a coin has nothing to do with the action that gives it its value since this action is a human convention and a man is quite apart from the process which produces his image Between a man and his portrait there is a relation but this is real in the portrait only Between the coin and its current value there is a relation but this is not real in the coin Now for the application God s action is not to be understood as going out from Him and terminating in that which He creates His action is Himself consequently altogether apart from the genus of created being whereby the creature is related to Him And again he gains nothing by creating or as Avicenna puts it His creative action is in the highest degree generous It is also manifest that His action involves no modification of His being without changing He causes the changeable Consequently though creatures are related to Him as effects to their cause He is not really related to them ON THE PRODUCTION OF LIVING THINGS From the Quaestiones Disputatae According to Augustine the passage Let the earth bring forth the green herb means not that plants were then actually produced in their proper nature but that a germinative power was given the earth to produce plants by the work of propagation so that the earth is then said to have brought forth the green herb and the fruit yielding tree inasmuch as it received the power of producing them This position is strengthened by the authority of Scripture general ii four These are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth and every plant in the field before it sprang up in the earth and every herb in the ground before it grew From this text we infer first that all the works of the six days were created in the day that God made heaven and earth and every plant of the field and consequently that all plants which are said to have been created on the third day were produced at the same time that God created heaven and earth The second inference is that plants were then produced not actually but only according to causal virtues in that the power to produce them was given to the earth And this is meant when it is said that He produced every plant of the field before it actually arose upon the earth by His dispositive action and every herb of the earth before it actually grew Hence before they came forth in reality they were made causally in the earth This view moreover is supported by reason For in those first days God made the creature either in its cause or in its origin or in its actuality by the work from which He afterward rested He nevertheless works even till now in the administration of things created by the work of propagation To this latter process belongs the actual production of plants from the earth because all that is needed to bring them forth is the energy of the heavenly bodies as their father so to say and the power of the earth in place of a mother Plants therefore were produced on the third day not actually but causally After the six days however they were actually brought forth according to their proper species and in their proper nature by the work of administration THE ARABIAN NIGHTS BY RICHARD GOTTHEIL The Arabian Nights or more accurately The Thousand Nights and a Night Alf Leilah wa leilah have gained a popularity in Europe since they were first turned into a modern language by Galland in seventeen oh four which rivals if it does not exceed their regard in the East They opened up to Europe a wealth of anecdote a fertility of daring fancy which has not ceased to amuse and to interest It is not their value as literature which has placed them so high in the popular esteem both in the East and in the West for they are written in a style not a little slovenly the same scenes figures and expressions are repeated to monotony and the poetical extracts which are interwoven are often of very uncertain excellence Some of the modern translations as by Payne and Burton have improved upon the original and have often given it a literary flavor which it certainly has not in the Arabic For this reason native historians and writers seldom range the stories in their literary chronicles or even deign to mention them by name The Nights have become popular from the very fact that they affect little that they are contes pure and simple picturing the men and the manners of a certain time without any attempt to gloss over their faults or to excuse their foibles so that the doings of the ancients become a lesson to those that follow after that men look upon the admonitory events that have happened to others and take warning All classes of men are to be found there Harun al Rashid and his viziers as well as the baker the cobbler the merchant the courtesan The very coarseness is a part of the picture though it strikes us more forcibly than it did those to whom the tales were told and for whom they were written down It is a kaleidoscope of the errors and failings and virtues of the men whose daily life it records it is also a picture of the wonderfully rich fantasy of the Oriental mind Illustration In the better texts i e of Boulak and Calcutta there are no less than about two hundred and fifty stories some long others short There is no direct order in which they follow one upon the other The chief story may at any moment suggest a subordinate one and as the work proceeds the looseness and disconnectedness of the parts increase The whole is held together by a frame a device which has passed into the epic of Ariosto Orlando Furioso xxviii and which is not unlike that used by Boccaccio Decameron and Chaucer Canterbury Tales This frame is in short A certain king of India Shahriyar aroused by his wife s infidelity determines to make an end of all the women in his kingdom As often as he takes a wife on the morrow he orders her slain Shahrzad the daughter of his Vizier takes upon herself the task of ridding the king of his evil intent On the night of her marriage to the king she together with her sister Dunyazad so engrosses his mind with her stories that the king seeks their continuance night after night thus she wards off her fate for nearly three years At the end of that time she has borne the king three male children and has by the sprightliness of her mind gradually drawn all the conceit out of him so that his land is at rest The tales told within this frame may be divided into a Histories or long romances which are often founded upon historical facts b Anecdotes and short stories which deal largely with the caliphs of the house of Abbas c Romantic fiction which though freely mingled with supernatural intervention may also be purely fictitious contes fantastiques d Fables and Apologues e Tales which serve the teller as the peg upon which to hang and to exhibit his varied learning In addition to this frame there is a thread running through the whole for the grand theme which is played with so many variations is the picturing of love in the palace and in the hovel in the city and in the desert The scenes are laid in all the four corners of the globe but especially in the two great centres of Muhammadan activity Bagdad and Cairo It is not a matter of chance that Harun al Rashid is the Caliph to whom the legends of the Nights have given a crown so very different from the one which he really wore Though his character was often far from that which is pictured here he was still a patron of art and of literature His time was the heyday of Muhammadan splendor and his city was the metropolis to which the merchants and the scholars flocked from the length and breadth of Arab dominion To unravel the literary history of such a collection is difficult indeed for it has drawn upon all civilizations and all literatures But since Hammer Purgstall and De Sacy began to unwind the skein many additional turns have been given The idea of the frame in general comes undoubtedly from India and such stories as The Barber s Fifth Brother The Prince and the Afrit s Mistress have been traced back to the Hitopadesa Panchatantra and Katha Sarit Sagara The Story of the King his Seven Viziers his Son and his Favorite is but a late version through the Pahlavi of the Indian Sindibad Romance of the time of Alexander the Great A number of fables are easily paralleled by those in the famous collection of Bidpai see the list in Jacobs s The Fables of Bidpai London eighteen eighty eight lxviii This is probably true of the whole little collection of beast fables in the One Hundred and Forty sixth Night for such fables are based upon the different reincarnations of the Buddha and the doctrine of metempsychosis The story of Jali ad and the Vizier Shammas is distinctly reported to have been translated from the Persian into Arabic Even Greek sources have not been left untouched if the picture of the cannibal in the adventures of Sindbad the Sailor be really a reflex of the story of Odysseus and Polyphemus Arabic historians such as Tabari Masudi Kazwini al Jauzi and the Kitab al Aghani have furnished innumerable anecdotes and tales while such old Arabic poets as Imr al Kais Alkamah Nabhighah et cetera have contributed occasional verses It is manifest that such a mass of tales and stories was not composed at any one time or in any one place Many must have floated around in drinking rooms and in houses of revelry for a long time before they were put into one collection Even to this day the story of Ali Baba is current among the Bedouins in Sinai Whenever the digest was first made it is certain that stories were added at a later time This is evident from the divergences seen in the different manuscripts and by the additional stories collected by Payne and Burton But in their present form everything points to the final redaction of the Nights in Egypt Of all the cities mentioned Cairo is described the most minutely the manners and customs of the personae are those of Egyptian society say from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century For this we have the warrant of mister Lane than whom no one is to be heard upon this subject with greater respect That such stories as these were popular in Egypt seems to follow from the fact that the only mention of them is found in Makrisi s Description of Cairo fourteen hundred and in Abu al Mahasin another historian of Egypt fourteen seventy The collection cannot have been made later than fifteen forty eight the date placed by a reader on the manuscript used by Galland But that its date is not much earlier is shown by various chance references The mention of coffee discovered in the fourteenth century of cannon first mentioned in Egypt in thirteen eighty three of the wearing of different colored garments by Muslims Jews and Christians instituted in thirteen oh one by Muhammad ibn Kelauen of the order of Carandaliyyah which did not exist until the thirteenth century of Sultani peaches the city Sultaniyyah was founded in the middle of the thirteenth century point to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries as the approximate date of the final composition of the Nights This is supported by the mention of the office of the Sheikh al Islam an office not created before the year fourteen fifty three Additions such as the Story of Abu Ker and Abu Zer were made as late as the sixteenth century and tobacco which is mentioned was not introduced into Europe until the year fifteen sixty The thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth centuries are a period of the revival of letters in Egypt which might well have induced some Arab lover of folk lore to write down a complete copy of these tales The Emperor Salah al din eleven sixty nine is the last historical personage mentioned and there is absolutely no trace of Shiite heresy to be found in the whole collection This omission would be impossible had they been gathered up at the time of the heretical Fatimide dynasty nine hundred eleven seventy one But it seems equally certain that the Nights did not originate altogether in the land of the Nile The figure of Harun al Rashid the many doings in the City of Peace Bagdad lead us irresistibly over to the Eastern capital of the Muhammadan Empire The genii and Afrits and much of the gorgeous picturing remind one of Persia or at least of Persian influence The Arabs were largely indebted to Persia for literature of a kind like this and we know that during the ninth and tenth centuries many books were translated from the Pahlavi and Syriac Thus Ibn al Mukaffah seven hundred sixty gave the Arabs the Kholanamah the Amirnamah Mirror of Princes Kalilah and Dimnan et cetera The historian Masudi nine hundred forty three expressly refers the story of the Thousand and One Nights to a Persian original The first who composed such tales and made use of them were the ancient Persians The Arabs translated them and made others like them He then continues Prairies d Or ed De Meynard and mentions the book Hezar Afsane which means a thousand tales a book popularly called the Thousand and One Nights and containing the story of the king and his vizier and of his daughter Shirazaad and her slave girl Dinazad Other books of the same kind are the book of Simas containing stories of Indian kings and viziers the book of Sindibad et cetera See also Hanzae Ispahanensis Annalium ed Gottwaldt eighteen forty four page forty one A similar statement is made by Abu Yakub al Nadim nine hundred eighty seven in the Fihrist ed Fluegel page three hundred four This book Hezar Afsane is said to have been written by the Princess Homai or Homain daughter of Bahman It comprises a Thousand Nights but less than two hundred stories for a night story often was related in a number of nights I have seen it many times complete but it is in truth a meagre and uninteresting publication A translation of the Hezar Afsane was made into Arabic and it is again mentioned in the middle of the twelfth century by Abdulhec al Hazraji but neither it nor the original Pahlavi has yet been found It thus remains a matter of speculation as to how much of the Hezar Afsane has found its way into the Nights It is evident that to it they are indebted for the whole general idea for many of the principal names and probably for the groundwork of a great many of the stories The change of the title from The Thousand to The Thousand and One is due to the fact that the Arabs often expressed a large number by this second cipher But the Nights cannot be a translation from the Persian for the other two books mentioned by Masudi are in the Arabic collection Lane supposes the relationship to be that of the AEneid to the Odyssey But it is probably closer one fifth of the collection which according to Payne is common to all manuscripts will doubtless be found to be based on the Pahlavi original That the dependence is not greater is evident from the absence of the great heroes of the Persian Epos Feridun Zer Isfandyar et cetera The heroes are all Arabs the life depicted is wholly Arabic The original Persian Nights must be quite old Homai the Persian Semiramis is mentioned in the Avesta and in Firdausi she is the daughter and the wife of Artaxerxes Longimanus B C four hundred sixty five four hundred twenty five Her mother was a Jewess Shahrazaad one of the captives brought from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar she afterward delivered her nation from captivity Tabari calls Esther of Old Testament fame the mother of Bahman and Professor de Goeje de Gids eighteen eighty six iii three hundred eighty five has cleverly identified the Homai of the old Nights not only with Shahrazaad of the Arabian but also with Esther of the Bible That his argument holds good is seen from its acceptance by Kuenen Hist Krit Einleitung one two page two hundred twenty two August Mueller Deutsche Rundschau eighteen eighty seven and Darmesteter Actes du Huitieme Congres des Orientalistes eighteen ninety three ii one hundred

eighteen eighty five eighteen eighty eight Lane s and Burton s translations are enriched by copious notes of great value Illustration Signature Richard Gottheil FROM THE STORY OF THE CITY OF BRASS Part of Nights five hundred sixty six and five hundred seventy eight Translation of E W Lane There was in olden time and in an ancient age and period in Damascus of Syria a King one of the Khaleefehs named Abd El Melik the son of Marwan and he was sitting one day having with him the great men of his empire consisting of Kings and Sultans when a discussion took place among them respecting the traditions of former nations They called to mind the stories of our lord Suleyman the son of Daood on both of whom be peace and the dominion and authority which God whose name be exalted had bestowed upon him over mankind and the Jinn and the birds and the wild beasts and other things and they said We have heard from those who were before us that God whose perfection be extolled and whose name be exalted bestowed not upon any one the like of that which He bestowed upon our lord Suleyman and that he attained to that to which none other attained so that he used to imprison the Jinn and the Marids and the Devils in bottles of brass and pour molten lead over them and seal this cover over them with his signet And the Prince of the Faithful Abd El Melik the son of Marwan wondered at these words and said Extolled be the perfection of God Suleyman was endowed with a mighty dominion And among those who were present in that assembly was En Fabighah Edh Dhubyanee and he said Talib hath spoken truth in that which he hath related and the proof of his veracity is the saying of the Wise the First thus versified And consider Suleyman when the Deity said to him Perform the office of Khaleefeh and govern with diligence And whoso obeyeth thee honor him for doing so and whoso disobeyeth thee imprison him forever He used to put them into bottles of brass and to cast them into the sea And the Prince of the Faithful approved of these words and said By Allah I desire to see some of these bottles So Talib the son of Sahl replied O Prince of the Faithful thou art able to do so and yet remain in thy country Send to thy brother Abd El Azeez the son of Marwan desiring him to bring them to thee from the Western Country that he may write orders to Moosa to journey from the Western Country to this mountain which we have mentioned and to bring thee what thou desirest of these bottles for the furthest tract of his province is adjacent to this mountain And the Prince of the Faithful approved of his advice and said O Talib thou has spoken truth in that which thou hast said and I desire that thou be my messenger to Moosa the son of Nuseyr for this purpose and thou shalt have a white ensign together with what thou shalt desire of wealth or dignity or other things and I will be thy substitute to take care of thy family To this Talib replied Most willingly O Prince of the Faithful And the Khaleefeh said to him Go in dependence on the blessing of God and his aid So Talib went forth on his way to Egypt and to Upper Egypt until they came to the Emeer Moosa the son of Nuseyr and when he knew of his approach he went forth to him and met him and rejoiced at his arrival and Talib handed to him the letter So he took it and read it and understood its meaning and he put it upon his head saying I hear and obey the command of the Prince of the Faithful He determined to summon his great men and they presented themselves and he inquired of them respecting that which had been made known to him by the letter whereupon they said O Emeer if thou desire him who will guide thee to that place have recourse to the sheykh Abd Es Samad the son of Abd El Kuddoos Es Sa moodee for he is a knowing man and hath traveled much and he is acquainted with the deserts and wastes and the seas and their inhabitants and their wonders and the countries of their districts Have recourse therefore to him and he will direct thee to the object of thy desire Accordingly he gave orders to bring him and he came before him and lo he was a very old man whom the vicissitudes of years and times had rendered decrepit The Emeer Moosa saluted him and said to him O sheykh Abd Es Samad our lord the Prince of the Faithful Abd El Melik the son of Marwan hath commanded us thus and thus and I possess little knowledge of that land and it hath been told me that thou art acquainted with that country and the routes Hast thou then a wish to accomplish the affair of the Prince of the Faithful The sheykh replied Know O Emeer that this route is difficult far extending with few tracks The Emeer said to him How long a period doth it require He answered It is a journey of two years and some months going and the like returning and on the way are difficulties and horrors and extraordinary and wonderful things Moreover thou art a warrior for the defense of the faith and our country is near unto the enemy so perhaps the Christians may come forth during our absence it is expedient therefore that thou leave in thy province one to govern it He replied Well And he left his son Haroon as his substitute in his province exacted an oath of fidelity to him and commanded the troops that they should not oppose him but obey him in all that he should order them to do And they heard his words and obeyed him His son Haroon was of great courage an illustrious hero and a bold champion and the sheykh Abd Es Samad pretended to him that the place in which were the things that the Prince of the Faithful desired was four months journey distant on the shore of the sea and that throughout the whole route were halting places adjacent one to another and grass and springs And he said God will assuredly make this affair easy to us through the blessing attendant upon thee O Viceroy of the Prince of the Faithful Then the Emeer Moosa said Knowest thou if any one of the Kings have trodden this land before us He answered him Yes O Emeer this land belonged to the King of Alexandria Darius the Greek The cavalcade fare on and soon reach a first extraordinary and wonderful thing the palace tomb of great Koosh the son of Sheddad full of impressive mortuary inscriptions that set the party all a weeping Thence The soldiers proceeded with the sheykh Abd Es Samad before them showing them the way until all the first day had passed and the second and the third They then came to a high hill at which they looked and lo upon it was a horseman of brass on the top of whose spear was a wide and glistening head that almost deprived the beholder of sight and on it was inscribed O thou who comest unto me if thou know not the way that leadeth to the City of Brass rub the hand of the horseman and he will turn and then will stop and in whatsoever direction he stoppeth thither proceed without fear and without difficulty for it will lead thee to the City of Brass And when the Emeer Moosa had rubbed the hand of the horseman it turned like the blinding lightning and faced a different direction from that in which they were traveling The party therefore turned thither and journeyed on and it was the right way They took that route and continued their course the same day and the next night until they had traversed a wide tract of country And as they were proceeding one day they came to a pillar of black stone wherein was a person sunk to his arm pits and he had two huge wings and four arms two of them like those of the sons of Adam and two like the forelegs of lions with claws He had hair upon his head like the tails of horses and two eyes like two burning coals and he had a third eye in his forehead like the eye of the lynx from which there appeared sparks of fire He was black and tall and he was crying out Extolled be the perfection of my Lord who hath appointed me this severe affliction and painful torture until the day of resurrection When the party beheld him their reason fled from them and they were stupefied at the sight of his form and retreated in flight and the Emeer Moosa said to the sheykh Abd Es Samad What is this He answered I know not what he is And the Emeer said Draw near to him and investigate his case perhaps he will discover it and perhaps thou wilt learn his history The sheykh Abd Es Samad replied May God amend the state of the Emeer Verily we fear him Fear ye not rejoined the Emeer for he is withheld from injuring you and others by the state in which he is So the sheykh Abd Es Samad drew near to him and said to him O thou person what is thy name and what is thy nature and what hath placed thee here in this manner And he answered him As to me I am an Efreet of the Jinn and my name is Dahish the son of El Amash and I am restrained here by the majesty confined by the power of God tormented as long as God to whom be ascribed might and glory willeth Then the Emeer Moosa said O sheykh Abd Es Samad ask him what is the cause of his confinement in this pillar He therefore asked respecting that and the Efreet answered him Verily my story is wonderful and it is this The Evil Spirit narrates to them his history being part of the famous war between Solomon and the Jinn The party therefore wondered at him and at the horrible nature of his form and the Emeer Moosa said There is no deity but God Suleyman was endowed with a mighty dominion And the sheykh Abd Es Samad said to the Efreet O thou I ask thee concerning a thing of which do thou inform us The Efreet replied Ask concerning what thou wilt And the sheykh said Are there in this place any of the Efreets confined in bottles of brass from the time of Suleyman on whom be peace He answered Yes in the Sea of El Karkar where are a people of the descendants of Nooh on whom be peace whose country the deluge reached not and they are separated there from the rest of the sons of Adam And where said the sheykh is the way to the City of Brass and the place wherein are the bottles What distance is there between us and it The Efreet answered It is near So the party left him and proceeded and there appeared to them a great black object with two seeming fires corresponding with each other in position in the distance in that black object whereupon the Emeer Moosa said to the sheykh What is this great black object and what are these two corresponding fires The guide answered him Be rejoiced O Emeer for this is the City of Brass and this is the appearance of it that I find described in the Book of Hidden Treasures that its wall is of black stones and it hath two towers of brass of El Andalus which the beholder seeth resembling two corresponding fires and thence it is named the City of Brass They ceased not to proceed until they arrived at it and lo it was lofty strongly fortified rising high into the air impenetrable the height of its walls was eighty cubits and it had five and twenty gates none of which would open but by means of some artifice and there was not one gate to it that had not within the city one like it such was the beauty of the construction and architecture of the city They stopped before it and endeavored to discover one of its gates but they could not and the Emeer Moosa said to the sheykh Abd Es Samad O sheykh I see not to this city any gate The sheykh replied O Emeer thus do I find it described in the Book of Hidden Treasures that it hath five and twenty gates and that none of its gates may be opened but from within the city And how said the Emeer can we contrive to enter it and divert ourselves with a view of its wonders Then the Emeer Moosa ordered one of his young men to mount a camel and ride round the city in the hope that he might discover a trace of a gate or a place lower than that to which they were opposite So one of his young men mounted and proceeded around it for two days with their nights prosecuting his journey with diligence and not resting and when the third day arrived he came in sight of his companions and he was astounded at that which he beheld of the extent of the city and its height Then he said O Emeer the easiest place in it is this place at which ye have alighted And thereupon the Emeer Moosa took Talib the son of Sahl and the sheykh Abd Es Samad and they ascended a mountain opposite the city and overlooking it and when they had ascended that mountain they saw a city than which eyes had not beheld any greater Its pavilions were lofty and its domes were shining its mansions were in good condition and its rivers were running its trees were fruitful and its gardens bore ripe produce It was a city with impenetrable gates empty still without a voice or a cheering inhabitant but the owl hooting in its quarters and birds skimming in circles in its areas and the raven croaking in its districts and its great thoroughfare streets and bewailing those who had been in it The Emeer Moosa paused sorrowing for its being devoid of inhabitants and its being despoiled of people and dwellers and he said Extolled be the perfection of Him whom ages and times change not the Creator of the creation by his power And while he was extolling the perfection of God to whom be ascribed might and glory he happened to look aside and lo there were seven tablets of white marble appearing from a distance So he approached them and behold they were sculptured and inscribed and he ordered that their writing should be read therefore the sheykh Abd Es Samad advanced and examined them and read them and they contained admonition and matter for example and restraint unto those endowed with faculties of discernment Upon the first tablet was inscribed in the ancient Greek character O son of Adam how heedless art thou of the case of him who hath been before thee Thy years and age have diverted thee from considering him Knowest thou not that the cup of death will be filled for thee and that in a short time thou wilt drink it Look then to thyself before entering thy grave Where are those who possessed the countries and abased the servants of God and led armies Death hath come upon them and God is the terminator of delights and the separator of companions and the devastator of flourishing dwellings so He hath transported them from the amplitude of palaces to the straightness of the graves And in the lower part of the tablet were inscribed these verses Where are the Kings and the peoplers of the earth They have quitted that which they have built and peopled And in the grave they are pledged for their past actions there after destruction they have become putrid corpses Where are the troops They repelled not nor profited And where is that which they collected and hoarded The decree of the Lord of the Throne surprised them Neither riches nor refuge saved them from it And the Emeer Moosa fainted his tears ran down upon his cheeks and he said By Allah indifference to the world is the most appropriate and the most sure course Then he caused an inkhorn and a paper to be brought and he wrote the inscription of the first tablet after which he drew near to the second tablet and the third and the fourth and having copied what was inscribed on them he descended from the mountain and the world had been pictured before his eyes And when he came back to the troops they passed the day devising means of entering the city and the Emeer Moosa said to his Wezeer Talib the son of Sahl and to those of his chief officers who were around him How shall we contrive to enter the city that we may see its wonders Perhaps we shall find in it something by which we may ingratiate ourselves with the Prince of the Faithful Talib the son of Sahl replied May God continue the prosperity of the Emeer Let us make a ladder and mount upon it and perhaps we shall gain access to the gate from within And the Emeer said This is what occurred to my mind and excellent is the advice Then he called to the carpenters and blacksmiths and ordered them to make straight some pieces of wood and to construct a ladder covered with plates of iron And they did so and made it strong They employed themselves in constructing it a whole month and many men were occupied in making it And they set it up and fixed it against the wall and it proved to be equal to the wall in height as though it had been made for it before that day So the Emeer Moosa wondered at it and said God bless you It seemeth from the excellence of your work as though ye had adapted it by measurement to the wall He then said to the people Which of you will ascend this ladder and mount upon the wall and walk along it and contrive means of descending into the city that he may see how the case is and then inform us of the mode of opening the gate And one of them answered I will ascend it O Emeer and descend and open the gate The Emeer therefore replied Mount God bless thee Accordingly the man ascended the ladder until he reached the top of it when he stood and fixed his eyes towards the city clapped his hands and cried out with his loudest voice saying Thou art beautiful Then he cast himself down into the city and his flesh became mashed with his bones So the Emeer Moosa said This is the action of the rational How then will the insane act If we do thus with all our companions there will not remain of them one and we shall be unable to accomplish our affair and the affair of the Prince of the Faithful Depart ye for we have no concern with this city But one of them said Perhaps another than this may be more steady than he And a second ascended and a third and a fourth and a fifth and they ceased not to ascend by that ladder to the top of the wall one after another until twelve men of them had gone acting as acted the first Therefore the sheykh Abd Es Samad said There is none for this affair but myself and the experienced is not like the inexperienced But the Emeer Moosa said to him Thou shalt not do that nor will I allow thee to ascend to the top of this wall for shouldst thou die thou wouldst be the cause of the death of us all and there would not remain of us one since thou art the guide of the party The sheykh however replied Perhaps the object will be accomplished by my means through the will of God whose name be exalted And thereupon all the people agreed to his ascending Then the sheykh Abd Es Samad arose and encouraged himself and having said In the name of God the Compassionate the Merciful he ascended the ladder repeating the praises of God whose name be exalted and reciting the Verses of Safety until he reached the top of the wall when he clapped his hands and fixed his eyes The people therefore all called out to him and said O sheykh Abd Es Samad do it not and cast not thyself down And they said Verily to God we belong and verily unto him we return If the sheykh Abd Es Samad fall we all perish Then the sheykh Abd Es Samad laughed immoderately and sat a long time repeating the praises of God whose name be exalted and reciting the Verses of Safety after which he rose with energy and called out with his loudest voice O Emeer no harm shall befall you for God to whom be ascribed might and glory hath averted from me the effect of the artifice and fraudulence of the Devil through the blessing resulting from the utterance of the words In the name of God the Compassionate the Merciful So the Emeer said to him What hast thou seen O sheykh He answered When I reached the top of the wall I beheld ten damsels like moons who made a sign with their hands as though they would say Come to us And it seemed to me that beneath me was a sea or great river of water whereupon I desired to cast myself down as our companions did but I beheld them dead so I withheld myself from them and recited some words of the Book of God whose name be exalted whereupon God averted from me the influence of those damsels artifice and they departed from me therefore I cast not myself down and God repelled from me the effect of their artifice and enchantment There is no doubt that this is an enchantment and an artifice which the people of this city contrived in order to repel from it every one who should desire to look down upon it and wish to obtain access to it and these our companions are laid dead He then walked along the wall till he came to the two towers of brass when he saw that they had two gates of gold without locks upon them or any sign of the means of opening them Therefore the sheykh paused as long as God willed and looking attentively he saw in the middle of one of the gates a figure of a horseman of brass having one hand extended as though he were pointing with it and on it was an inscription which the sheykh read and lo it contained these words Turn the pin that is in the middle of the front of the horseman s body twelve times and then the gate will open So he examined the horseman and in the middle of the front of his body was a pin strong firm well fixed and he turned it twelve times whereupon the gate opened immediately with a noise like thunder and the sheykh Abd Es Samad entered He was a learned man acquainted with all languages and characters And he walked on until he entered a long passage whence he descended some steps and he found a place with handsome wooden benches on which were people dead and over their heads were elegant shields and keen swords and strung bows and notched arrows And behind the next gate were a bar of iron and barricades of wood and locks of delicate fabric and strong apparatus Upon this the sheykh said within himself Perhaps the keys are with these people Then he looked and lo there was a sheykh who appeared to be the oldest of them and he was upon a high wooden bench among the dead men So the sheykh Abd Es Samad said May not the keys of the city be with this sheykh Perhaps he was the gate keeper of the city and these were under his authority He therefore drew near to him and lifted up his garments and lo the keys were hung to his waist At the sight of them the sheykh Abd Es Samad rejoiced exceedingly his reason almost fled from him in consequence of his joy and he took the keys approached the gate opened the locks and pulled the gate and the barricades and other apparatus which opened and the gate also opened with a noise like thunder by reason of its greatness and terribleness and the enormousness of its apparatus Upon this the sheykh exclaimed God is most great and the people made the same exclamation with him rejoicing at the event The Emeer Moosa also rejoiced at the safety of the sheykh Abd Es Samad and at the opening of the gate of the city the people thanked the sheykh for that which he had done and all the troops hastened to enter the gate But the Emeer Moosa cried out to them saying to them O people if all of us enter we shall not be secure from some accident that may happen Half shall enter and half shall remain behind The Emeer Moosa then entered the gate and with him half of the people who bore their weapons of war And the party saw their companions lying dead so they buried them They saw also the gate keepers and servants and chamberlains and lieutenants lying upon beds of silk all of them dead And they entered the market of the city and beheld a great market with lofty buildings none of which projected beyond another the shops were open and the scales hung up and the utensils of brass ranged in order and the khans were full of all kinds of goods And they saw the merchants dead in their shops their skins were dried and their bones were carious and they had become examples to him who would be admonished They saw likewise four markets of particular shops filled with wealth And they left this place and passed on to the silk market in which were silks and brocades interwoven with red gold and white silver upon various colours and the owners were dead lying upon skins and appearing almost as though they would speak Leaving these they went on to the market of jewels and pearls and jacinths and they left it and passed on to the market of the money changers whom they found dead with varieties of silks beneath them and their shops were filled with gold and silver These they left and they proceeded to the market of the perfumers and lo their shops were filled with varieties of perfumes and bags of musk and ambergris and aloes wood and nedd and camphor and other things and the owners were all dead not having with them any food And when they went forth from the market of the perfumers they found near unto it a palace decorated and strongly constructed and they entered it and found banners unfurled and drawn swords and strung bows and shields hung up by chains of gold and silver and helmets gilded with red gold And in the passages of that palace were benches of ivory ornamented with plates of brilliant gold and with silk on which were men whose skins had dried upon the bones the ignorant would imagine them to be sleeping but from the want of food they had died and tasted mortality Upon this the Emeer Moosa paused extolling the perfection of God whose name be exalted and his holiness and contemplating the beauty of that palace They find the palace a marvel of splendor but as awfully silent and mausoleum like as the rest of the city and soon reach a magnificent hall in which lies the dead body of Jedmur the Daughter of the King of the Amalekites magnificently laid in state and magically preserved and protected Talib unwisely and covetously attempts to rob the corpse of jewels and is instantly beheaded by its enchanted guards The Emeer Moosa and the sage Abd Es Samad however leave the place in safety return to Upper Egypt and Syria by way of the Country of the Blacks succeed in securing twelve of the wonderful bottles containing Jinn and the tale concludes with the Emeer Moosa s resignation of his throne that he may die in Jerusalem so profoundly has he been affected by the adventure FROM THE HISTORY OF KING OMAR BEN ENNUMAN AND HIS SONS SHERKAN AND ZOULMEKAN Nights fifteen sixteen seventeen and eighteen Translation of Professor John Payne THE MEETING OF PRINCE SHERKAN AND PRINCESS ABRIZEH There reigned once in the City of Peace Bagdad before the Khalifate of Abdulmelik ben Merwan a king called Omar ben Ennuman who was of the mighty giants and had subdued the kings of Persia and the emperors of the East for none could warm himself at his fire nor cope with him in battle and when he was angry there came sparks out of his nostrils He had gotten him dominion over all countries and God had subjected unto him all creatures his commands were obeyed in all the great cities and his armies penetrated the most distant lands the East and West came under his rule with the regions between them Hind and Sind and China and Hejaz and Yemen and the islands of India and China Syria and Mesopotamia and the lands of the blacks and the islands of the ocean and all the famous rivers of the earth Jaxartes and Bactrus and Nile and Euphrates He sent his ambassadors to the farthest parts of the earth to fetch him true report and they returned with tidings of justice and peace bringing him assurance of loyalty and obedience and invocations of blessings on his head for he was a right noble king and there came to him gifts and tribute from all parts of the world He had a son called Sherkan who was one of the prodigies of the age and the likest of all men to his father who loved him with an exceeding love and had appointed him to be king after him The prince grew up till he reached man s estate and was twenty years old and God subjected all men to him for he was gifted with great might and prowess in battle humbling the champions and destroying all who made head against him So before long this Sherkan became famous in all quarters of the world and his father rejoiced in him and his might waxed till he passed all bounds and magnified himself taking by storm the citadels and strong places The Prince being sent to assist King Afridoun of the Greeks against an enemy is intrusted with an army of ten thousand soldiers and leaves Bagdad in military state Then they loaded the beasts and beat the drums and blew the clarions and unfurled the banners and the standards whilst Sherkan mounted with the Vizier Dendan by his side and the standards waving over them and the army set out and fared on with the Greek ambassadors in the van till the day departed and the night came when they halted and encamped for the night On the morrow as soon as God brought in the day they took horse and continued their march nor did they cease to press onward guided by the ambassadors for the space of twenty days On the twenty first day at nightfall they came to a wide and fertile valley whose sides were thickly wooded and covered with grass and there Sherkan called a three days halt So they dismounted and pitched their tents dispersing right and left in the valley whilst the Vizier Dendan and the ambassadors alighted in the midst As for Sherkan when he had seen the tents pitched and the troops dispersed on either side and had commanded his officers and attendants to camp beside the Vizier Dendan he gave reins to his horse being minded to explore the valley and himself to mount guard over the army having regard to his father s injunctions and to the fact that they had reached the frontier of the Land of Roum and were now in the enemy s country So he rode on alone along the valley till a fourth part of the night was past when he grew weary and sleep overcame him so that he could no longer spur his horse Now he was used to sleep on horseback so when drowsiness got the better of him he fell asleep and the horse paced on with him half the night and entered a forest but Sherkan awoke not till the steed smote the earth with his hoof Then he started from sleep and found himself among trees and the moon arose and lighted the two horizons He was troubled at finding himself alone in this place and spoke the words which whoso says shall never be confounded that is to say There is no power and no virtue but in GOD the most High the Supreme But as he rode on in fear of the wild beasts behold the trees thinned out and the moon shone out upon a meadow as it were one of the meads of paradise and he heard therein the noise of talk and pleasant laughter such as ravishes the wit of men So King Sherkan dismounted and tying his horse to a tree fared on a little further till he espied a stream of running water and heard a woman talking and saying in Arabic By the virtue of the Messiah this is not handsome of you But whoso speaks the word I will throw her down and bind her with her girdle He followed in the direction of the voice and saw gazelles frisking and wild cattle pasturing and birds in their various voices expressing joy and gladness and the earth was embroidered with all manner flowers and green herbs even as says of it the poet in the following verses Earth has no fairer sight to show than this its blossom time With all the gently running streams that wander o er its face It is indeed the handiwork of God Omnipotent The Lord of every noble gift and Giver of all grace Midmost the meadow stood a monastery and within the inclosure a citadel that rose high into the air in the light of the moon The stream passed through the midst of the monastery and therenigh sat ten damsels like moons high bosomed maids clad in dresses and ornaments that dazzled the eyes as says of them the poet The meadow glitters with the troops Of lovely ones that wander there Its grace and beauty doubled are By these that are so passing fair Virgins that with their swimming gait The hearts of all that see ensnare Along whose necks like trails of grapes Stream down the tresses of their hair Proudly they walk with eyes that dart The shafts and arrows of despair And all the champions of the world Are slain by their seductive air Sherkan looked at the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at its full with ringleted and shining forehead great black eyes and curling brow locks perfect in person and attributes as says the poet Her beauty beamed on me with glances wonder bright The slender Syrian spears are not so straight and slight She laid her veil aside and lo her cheeks rose red All manner of loveliness was in their sweetest sight The locks that o er her brow fell down were like the night From out of which there shines a morning of delight Then Sherkan heard her say to the girls Come on that I may wrestle with you ere the moon set and the dawn come So they came up to her one after another and she overthrew them one by one and bound their hands behind them with their girdles When she had thrown them all there turned to her an old woman who was before her and said as if she were wroth with her O shameless dost thou glory in overthrowing these girls Behold I am an old woman yet have I thrown them forty times So what hast thou to boast of But if thou have strength to wrestle with me stand up that I may grip thee and put thy head between thy feet The young lady smiled at her words although her heart was full of anger against her and said O my lady Dhat ed Dewahi wilt indeed wrestle with me or dost thou jest with me I mean to wrestle with thee in very deed replied she Stand up to me then said the damsel if thou have strength to do so When the old woman heard this she was sore enraged and her hair stood on end like that of a hedgehog Then she sprang up whilst the damsel confronted her and they took hold of one another whilst Sherkan raised his eyes to heaven and prayed to God that the damsel might conquer the old hag Presently the old woman strove to free herself and in the struggle wriggled out of the girl s hands and fell on her back and behold the young lady throwing over her a veil of fine silk helped her to dress herself making excuses to her and saying O my lady Dhat ed Dewahi I did not mean to throw thee so roughly but thou wriggledst out of my hands so praised be God for safety She returned her no answer but rose in her confusion and walked away out of sight leaving the young lady standing alone by the other girls thrown down and bound Then said Sherkan To every fortune there is a cause Sleep fell not on me nor did the steed bear me hither but for my good fortune for of a surety this damsel and what is with her shall be my prize So he turned back and mounted and drew his scimitar then he gave his horse the spur and he started off with him like an arrow from a bow whilst he brandished his naked blade and cried out God is most great When the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and running to the bank of the river which was there six cubits wide made a spring and landed on the other side where she turned and standing cried out in a loud voice Who art thou sirrah that breakest in on our pasture as if thou wert charging an army Whence comest thou and whither art thou bound Speak the truth and it shall profit thee and do not lie for lying is of the losel s fashion Doubtless thou hast strayed this night from thy road that thou hast happened on this place So tell me what thou seekest if thou wouldst have us set thee in the right road we will do so or if thou seek help we will help thee When Sherkan heard her words he replied I am a stranger of the Muslims who am come out by myself in quest of booty and I have found no fairer purchase this moonlit night than these ten damsels so I will take them and rejoin my comrades with them Quoth she I would have thee to know that thou hast not yet come at the booty and as for these ten damsels by Allah they are no purchase for thee Indeed the fairest purchase thou canst look for is to win free of this place for thou art in a mead where if we gave one cry there would be with us anon four thousand knights Did I not tell thee that lying is shameful And he said The fortunate man is he to whom God sufficeth and who hath no need of other than him By the virtue of the Messiah replied she did I not fear to have thy death at my hand I would give a cry that would fill the meadow on thee with horse and foot but I have pity on the stranger so if thou seek booty I require of thee that thou dismount from thy horse and swear to me by thy faith that thou wilt not approach me with aught of arms and we will wrestle I and thou If thou throw me lay me on thy horse and take all of us to thy booty and if I throw thee thou shalt be at my commandment Swear this to me for I fear thy perfidy since experience has it that as long as perfidy is in men s natures to trust in every one is weakness But if thou wilt swear I will come over to thee Quoth Sherkan Impose on me whatever oath thou deemest binding and I will swear not to draw near thee until thou hast made thy preparations and sayest Come wrestle with me If thou throw me I have wealth wherewith to ransom myself and if I throw thee I shall get fine purchase Then said she Swear to me by Him who hath lodged the soul in the body and given laws to mankind that thou wilt not hurt me with aught of violence save in the way of wrestling else mayest thou die out of the pale of Islam By Allah exclaimed Sherkan if a Cadi should swear me though he were Cadi of the Cadis he would not impose on me the like of this oath Then he took the oath she required and tied his horse to a tree sunken in the sea of reverie and saying in himself Glory to Him who fashioned her Then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling and said to her Cross the stream to me Quoth she It is not for me to come to thee if thou wilt do thou cross over to me I cannot do that replied he and she said O boy I will come to thee So she gathered her skirts and making a spring landed on the other side of the river by him whereupon he drew near to her wondering at her beauty and grace and saw a form that the hand of Omnipotence had turned with the leaves of Jinn and which had been fostered by divine solicitude a form on which the zephyrs of fair fortune had blown and over whose creation favorable planets had presided Then she called out to him saying O Muslim come and wrestle before the daybreak and tucked up her sleeves showing a fore arm like fresh curd the whole place was lighted up by its whiteness and Sherkan was dazzled by it Then he bent forward and clapped his hands and she did the like and they took hold and gripped each other He laid his hands on her slender waist and fell a trembling like the Persian reed in the hurricane So she lifted him up and throwing him to the ground sat down on his breast Then she said to him O Muslim it is lawful among you to kill Christians what sayest thou to my killing thee O my lady replied he as for killing me it is unlawful for our Prophet whom God bless and preserve hath forbidden the slaying of women and children and old men and monks Since this was revealed unto your prophet rejoined she it behooves us to be even with him therein so rise I give thee thy life for beneficence is not lost upon men Then she got up and he rose and brushed the earth from his head and she said to him Be not abashed but indeed one who enters the land of the Greeks in quest of booty and to succor kings against kings how comes it that there is no strength in him to defend himself against a woman It was not lack of strength in me replied he nor was it thy strength that overthrew me but thy beauty so if thou wilt grant me another bout it will be of thy favor She laughed and said I grant thee this but these damsels have been long bound and their arms and shoulders are weary and it were fitting I should loose them since this next bout may peradventure be a long one Then she went up to the girls and unbinding them said to them in the Greek tongue Go and put yourselves in safety till I have brought to naught this Muslim So they went away whilst Sherkan looked at them and they gazed at him and the young lady Then he and she drew near again and set to But again by admiration of her beauty his strength failed him and she feeling this lifted him in her hands swifter than the blinding lightning and threw him to the ground He fell on his back and she said to him Rise I give thee thy life a second time I spared thee before for the sake of thy prophet for that he forbade the killing of women and I do so this second time because of thy weakness and tender age and strangerhood but I charge thee if there be in the army sent by King Omar ben Ennuman a stronger than thou send him hither and tell him of me By Allah O my lady replied Sherkan and indeed he was greatly incensed against her it was not by thy strength that thou overthrewest me but by thy beauty so that nor wit nor foresight was left in me But now if thou have a mind to try another fall with me with my wits about me I have a right to this one bout more by the rules of the game for my presence of mind has now returned to me Hast thou not had enough of wrestling O conquered one rejoined she However come if thou wilt but know that this bout must be the last Then they took hold of each other and he set to in earnest and warded himself against being thrown down so they wrestled awhile and the damsel found in him strength such as she had not before observed and said to him O Muslim thou art on thy guard Yes replied he thou knowest that there remaineth but this bout and after each of us will go his own way She laughed and he laughed too then she seized the opportunity to bore in upon him unawares and gripping him by the thigh threw him to the ground so that he fell on his back She laughed at him and said Thou art surely an eater of bran for thou art like a Bedouin bonnet that falls off at a touch or a child s toy that a puff of air overturns Out on thee thou poor creature Go back to the army of the Muslims and send us other than thyself for thou lackest thews and cry as among the Arabs and Persians and Turks and Medes Whoso has might in him let him come to us Then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the stream and said to Sherkan laughing It goes to my heart to part with thee get thee to thy friends O my lord before the morning lest the knights come upon thee and take thee on the points of their lances Thou hast not strength enough to defend thee against women so how couldst thou make head against men and cavaliers And she turned to go back to the monastery Sherkan was confounded and called out to her saying O my lady Wilt thou go away and leave the wretched stranger the broken hearted slave of love So she turned to him laughing and said What wouldst thou I grant thy prayer Have I set foot in thy country and tasted the sweetness of thy favors replied Sherkan and shall I return without eating of thy victual and tasting of thy hospitality Indeed I am become one of thy servitors Quoth she None but the base refuses hospitality on my head and eyes be it Do me the favor to mount and ride along the stream abreast of me for thou art my guest At this Sherkan rejoiced and hastening back to his horse mounted and rode along the river bank keeping abreast of her till he came to a drawbridge that hung by pulleys and chains of steel made fast with hooks and padlocks Here stood the ten damsels awaiting the lady who spoke to one of them in the Greek tongue and said to her Go to him take his horse s rein and bring him over into the monastery They went on till they reached a vaulted gate arched over with marble This she opened and entered with Sherkan into a long vestibule vaulted with ten arches from each of which hung a lamp of crystal shining like the rays of the sun The damsels met her at the end of the vestibule bearing perfumed flambeaux and having on their heads kerchiefs embroidered with all manner of jewels and went on before her till they came to the inward of the monastery where Sherkan saw couches set up all around facing one another and overhung with curtains spangled with gold The floor was paved with all kinds of variegated marbles and in the midst was a basin of water with four and twenty spouts of gold around it from which issued water like liquid silver whilst at the upper end stood a throne covered with silks of royal purple Then said the damsel O my lord mount this throne So he seated himself on it and she withdrew and when she had been absent awhile he asked the servants of her and they said She hath gone to her sleeping chamber but we will serve thee as thou shalt order So they set before him rare meats and he ate till he was satisfied when they brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver and he washed his hands Then his mind reverted to his troops and he was troubled knowing not what had befallen them in his absence and thinking how he had forgotten his father s injunctions so that he abode oppressed with anxiety and repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the day appeared when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in the sea of melancholy repeating the following verses I lack not of prudence and yet in this case I ve been fooled so what shift shall avail unto me If any could ease me of love and its stress Of my might and my virtue I d set myself free But alas my heart s lost in maze of desire And no helper save God in my strait can I see Hardly had he finished when up came more than twenty damsels like moons encompassing the young lady who appeared among them as the full moon among stars She was clad in royal brocade and girt with a woven girdle set with various kinds of jewels that straitly clasped her waist On her head she wore a network of pearls gemmed with various kinds of jewels and she moved with a coquettish swimming gait swaying wonder gracefully whilst the damsels held up her skirts She fixed her eyes on him and considered him awhile till she was assured of him when she came up to him and said Indeed the place is honored and illumined with thy presence O Sherkan How didst thou pass the night O hero after we went away and left thee Verily lying is a defect and a reproach in kings especially in great kings and thou art Sherkan son of King Omar ben Ennuman so henceforth tell me naught but truth and strive not to keep the secret of thy condition for falsehood engenders hatred and enmity The arrow of destiny hath fallen upon thee and it behooves thee to show resignation and submission When Sherkan heard what she said he saw nothing for it but to tell her the truth so he said I am indeed Sherkan son of Omar ben Ennuman whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this place so now do whatsoever thou wilt FROM SINDBAD THE SEAMAN AND SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN Portions of Nights five hundred thirty six to five hundred forty two presenting the Introduction and the first of the seven Voyages Translation of Captain Sir Richard Burton There lived in the city of Bagdad during the reign of the Commander of the Faithful Harun al Rashid a man named Sindbad the Hammal Porter one in poor case who bore burdens on his head for hire It happened to him one day of great heat that whilst he was carrying a heavy load he became exceeding weary and sweated profusely the heat and the weight alike oppressing him Presently as he was passing the gate of a merchant s house before which the ground was swept and watered and where the air was temperate he sighted a broad bench beside the door so he set his load thereon to take rest and smell the air And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say NOW WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVENTH NIGHT She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Hammal set his load upon the bench to take rest and smell the air there came out upon him from the court door a pleasant breeze and a delicious fragrance He sat down on the edge of the bench and at once heard from within the melodious sound of lutes and other stringed instruments and mirth exciting voices singing and reciting together with the song of birds warbling and glorifying Almighty Allah in various tunes and tongues turtles mockingbirds merles nightingales cushats and stone curlews whereat he marveled in himself and was moved to mighty joy and solace Then he went up to the gate and saw within a great flower garden wherein were pages and black slaves and such a train of servants and attendants and so forth as is found only with Kings and Sultans and his nostrils were greeted with the savory odors of all manner meats rich and delicate and delicious and generous wines So he raised his eyes heavenwards and said Glory to Thee O Lord O Creator and Provider who providest whomso Thou wilt without count or stint O mine Holy One I cry Thee pardon for all sins and turn to Thee repenting of all offenses O Lord there is no gainsaying Thee in Thine ordinance and Thy dominion neither wilt Thou be questioned of that Thou dost for Thou indeed over all things art Almighty Extolled be Thy perfection whom Thou wilt Thou makest poor and whom Thou wilt Thou makest rich Whom Thou wilt Thou exaltest and whom Thou wilt Thou abasest and there is no god but Thou How mighty is Thy majesty and how enduring Thy dominion and how excellent Thy government Verily Thou favorest whom Thou wilt of Thy servants whereby the owner of this place abideth in all joyance of life and delighteth himself with pleasant scents and delicious meats and exquisite wines of all kinds For indeed Thou appointest unto Thy creatures that which Thou wilt and that which Thou hast foreordained unto them wherefore are some weary and others are at rest and some enjoy fair fortune and affluence whilst others suffer the extreme of travail and misery even as I do And he fell to reciting How many by my labors that evermore endure All goods of life enjoy and in cooly shade recline Each morn that dawns I wake in travail and in woe And strange is my condition and my burden gars me pine Many others are in luck and from miseries are free And Fortune never loads them with loads the like o mine They live their happy days in all solace and delight Eat drink and dwell in honor mid the noble and the digne All living things were made of a little drop of sperm Thine origin is mine and my provenance is thine Yet the difference and distance twixt the twain of us are far As the difference of savor twixt vinegar and wine But at Thee O God All wise I venture not to rail Whose ordinance is just and whose justice cannot fail When Sindbad the Porter had made an end of reciting his verses he bore up his burden and was about to fare on when there came forth to him from the gate a little foot page fair of face and shapely of shape and dainty of dress who caught him by the hand saying Come in and speak with my lord for he calleth for thee The Porter would have excused himself to the page but the lad would take no refusal so he left his load with the doorkeeper in the vestibule and followed the boy into the house which he found to be a goodly mansion radiant and full of majesty till he brought him to a grand sitting room wherein he saw a company of nobles and great lords seated at tables garnished with all manner of flowers and sweet scented herbs besides great plenty of dainty viands and fruits dried and fresh and confections and wines of the choicest vintages There also were instruments of music and mirth and lovely slave girls playing and singing All the company was ranged according to rank and in the highest place sat a man of worshipful and noble aspect whose beard sides hoariness had stricken and he was stately of stature and fair of favor agreeable of aspect and full of gravity and dignity and majesty So Sindbad the Porter was confounded at that which he beheld and said in himself By Allah this must be either a piece of Paradise or some king s palace Then he saluted the company with much respect praying for their prosperity and kissing ground before them stood with his head bowed down in humble attitude And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say NOW WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHTH NIGHT FIRST VOYAGE OF SINDBAD HIGHT THE SEAMAN My father was a merchant one of the notables of my native place a moneyed man and ample of means who died whilst I was yet a child leaving me much wealth in money and lands and farmhouses When I grew up I laid hands on the whole and ate of the best and drank freely and wore rich clothes and lived lavishly companioning and consorting with youths of my own age and considering that this course of life would continue for ever and ken no change Thus did I for a long time but at last I awoke from my heedlessness and returning to my senses I found my wealth had become unwealth and my condition ill conditioned and all I once hent had left my hand And recovering my reason I was stricken with dismay and confusion and bethought me of a saying of our lord Solomon son of David upon whom be Peace which I had heard aforetime from my father Three things are better than other three the day of death is better than the day of birth a live dog is better than a dead lion and the grave is better than want Then I got together my remains of estates and property and sold all even my clothes for three thousand dirhams with which I resolved to travel to foreign parts remembering the saying of the poet By means of toil man shall scale the height Who to fame aspires mustn t sleep o night Who seeketh pearl in the deep must dive Winning weal and wealth by his main and might And who seeketh Fame without toil and strife Th impossible seeketh and wasteth life So taking heart I bought me goods merchandise and all needed for a voyage and impatient to be at sea I embarked with a company of merchants on board a ship bound for Bassorah There we again embarked and sailed many days and nights and we passed from isle to isle and sea to sea and shore to shore buying and selling and bartering everywhere the ship touched and continued our course till we came to an island as it were a garth of the garden of Paradise Here the captain cast anchor and making fast to the shore put out the landing planks So all on board landed and made furnaces and lighting fires therein busied themselves in various ways some cooking and some washing whilst other some walked about the island for solace and the crew fell to eating and drinking and playing and sporting I was one of the walkers but as we were thus engaged behold the master who was standing on the gunwale cried out to us at the top of his voice saying Ho there passengers run for your lives and hasten back to the ship and leave your gear and save yourselves from destruction Allah preserve you For this island whereon ye stand is no true island but a great fish stationary a middlemost of the sea whereon the sand hath settled and trees have sprung up of old time so that it is become like unto an island but when ye lighted fires on it it felt the heat and moved and in a moment it will sink with you into the sea and ye will all be drowned So leave your gear and seek your safety ere ye die And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say NOW WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINTH NIGHT She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the ship master cried to the passengers Leave your gear and seek safety ere ye die all who heard him left gear and goods clothes washed and unwashed fire pots and brass cooking pots and fled back to the ship for their lives and some reached it while others among whom was I did not for suddenly the island shook and sank into the abysses of the deep with all that were thereon and the dashing sea surged over it with clashing waves I sank with the others down down into the deep but Almighty Allah preserved me from drowning and threw in my way a great wooden tub of those that had served the ship s company for tubbing I gripped it for the sweetness of life and bestriding it like one riding paddled with my feet like oars whilst the waves tossed me as in sport right and left Meanwhile the captain made sail and departed with those who had reached the ship regardless of the drowning and the drowned and I ceased not following the vessel with my eyes till she was hid from sight and I made sure of death Darkness closed in upon me while in this plight and the winds and waves bore me on all that night and the next day till the tub brought to with me under the lee of a lofty island with trees overhanging the tide I caught hold of a branch and by its aid clambered up on to the land after coming nigh upon death but when I reached the shore I found my legs cramped and numbed and my feet bore traces of the nibbling of fish upon their soles withal I had felt nothing for excess of anguish and fatigue I threw myself down on the island ground like a dead man and drowned in desolation swooned away nor did I return to my senses till next morning when the sun rose and revived me But I found my feet swollen so made shift to move by shuffling on my breech and crawling on my knees for in that island were found store of fruit and springs of sweet water I ate of the fruits which strengthened me and thus I abode days and nights till my life seemed to return and my spirits began to revive and I was better able to move about So after due consideration I fell to exploring the island and diverting myself with gazing upon all things that Allah Almighty had created there and rested under the trees from one of which I cut me a staff to lean upon One day as I walked along the marge I caught sight of some object in the distance and thought it a wild beast or one of the monster creatures of the sea but as I drew near it looking hard the while I saw that it was a noble mare tethered on the beach Presently I went up to her but she cried out against me with a great cry so that I trembled for fear and turned to go away when there came forth a man from under the earth and followed me crying out and saying Who and whence art thou and what caused thee to come hither O my lord answered I I am in very sooth a waif a stranger and was left to drown with sundry others by the ship we voyaged in but Allah graciously sent me a wooden tub so I saved myself thereon and it floated with me till the waves cast me up on this island When he heard this he took my hand and saying Come with me carried me into a great Sardab or underground chamber which was spacious as a saloon He made me sit down at its upper end then he brought me somewhat of food and being anhungered I ate till I was satisfied and refreshed And when he had put me at mine ease he questioned me of myself and I told him all that had befallen me from first to last And as he wondered at my adventure I said By Allah O my lord excuse me I have told thee the truth of my case and the accident which betided me And now I desire that thou tell me who thou art and why thou abidest here under the earth and why thou hast tethered yonder mare on the brink of the sea Answered he Know that I am one of the several who are stationed in different parts of this island and we are of the grooms of King Mihrjan and under our hand are all his horses And Inshallah I will bear thee to King Mihrjan And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say NOW WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTIETH NIGHT She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Syce said to Sindbad the Seaman I will bear thee to King Mihrjan and show thee our country And know that hadst thou not happened on us thou hadst perished miserably and none had known of thee but I will be the means of the saving of thy life and of thy return to thine own land I called down blessings on him and thanked him for his kindness and courtesy After this we sat awhile till the rest of the grooms came up each leading a mare and seeing me with their fellow Syce questioned me of my case and I repeated my story to them Thereupon they drew near me and spreading the table ate and invited me to eat so I ate with them after which they took horse and mounting me on one of the mares set out with me and fared on without ceasing till we came to the capital city of King Mihrjan and going in to him acquainted him with my story Then he sent for me and when they set me before him and salams had been exchanged he gave me a cordial welcome and wishing me long life bade me tell him my tale So I related to him all that I had seen and all that had befallen me from first to last whereat he marveled and said to me By Allah O my son thou hast indeed been miraculously preserved Were not the term of thy life a long one thou hadst not escaped from these straits but praised be Allah for safety Then he spoke cheerily to me and entreated me with kindness and consideration moreover he made me his agent for the port and registrar of all ships that entered the harbor I attended him regularly to receive his commandments and he favored me and did me all manner of kindness and invested me with costly and splendid robes Indeed I was high in credit with him as an intercessor for the folk and an intermediary between them and him when they wanted aught of him I abode thus a great while and as often as I passed through the city to the port I questioned the merchants and travelers and sailors of the city of Baghdad so haply I might hear of an occasion to return to my native land but could find none who knew it or knew any who resorted thither At this I was chagrined for I was weary of long strangerhood and my disappointment endured for a time till one day going in to King Mihrjan I found with him a company of Indians I saluted them and they returned my salam and politely welcomed me and asked me of my country And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say NOW WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIRST NIGHT She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Sindbad the Seaman said When they asked me of my country I questioned them of theirs and they told me that they were of various castes some being called Shakiriyah who are the noblest of their castes and neither oppress nor offer violence to any and other Brahmans a folk who abstain from wine but live in delight and solace and merriment and own camels and horses and cattle Moreover they told me that the people of India are divided into two and seventy castes and I marveled at this with exceeding marvel Amongst other things that I saw in King Mihrjan s dominions was an island called Kasil wherein all night is heard the beating of drums and tabrets but we were told by the neighboring islanders and by travelers that the inhabitants are people of diligence and judgment In this sea I saw also a fish two hundred cubits long and the fishermen fear it so they strike together pieces of wood and put it to flight I also saw another fish with a head like that of an owl besides many other wonders and rarities which it would be tedious to recount I occupied myself thus in visiting the islands till one day as I stood in the port with a staff in my hand according to my custom behold a great ship wherein were many merchants came sailing for the harbor When it reached the small inner port where ships anchor under the city the master furled his sails and making fast to the shore put out the landing planks whereupon the crew fell to breaking bulk and landing cargo whilst I stood by taking written note of them They were long in bringing the goods ashore so I asked the master Is there aught left in thy ship and he answered O my lord there are divers bales of merchandise in the hold whose owner was drowned from amongst us at one of the islands on our course so his goods remained in our charge by way of trust and we propose to sell them and note their price that we may convey it to his people in the city of Baghdad the Home of Peace What was the merchant s name quoth I and quoth he Sindbad the Seaman whereupon I straitly considered him and knowing him cried out to him with a great cry saying O captain I am that Sindbad the Seaman who traveled with other merchants and when the fish heaved and thou calledst to us some saved themselves and others sank I being one of them But Allah Almighty threw in my way a great tub of wood of those the crew had used to wash withal and the winds and waves carried me to this island where by Allah s grace I fell in with King Mihrjan s grooms and they brought me hither to the King their master When I told him my story he entreated me with favor and made me his harbor master and I have prospered in his service and found acceptance with him These bales therefore are mine the goods which God hath given me And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say NOW WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY SECOND NIGHT She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Sindbad the Seaman said to the captain These bales are mine the goods which Allah hath given me the other exclaimed There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Verily there is neither conscience nor good faith left among men Said I O Rais what mean these words seeing that I have told thee my case And he answered Because thou heardest me say that I had with me goods whose owner was drowned thou thinkest to take them without right but this is forbidden by law to thee for we saw him drown before our eyes together with many other passengers nor was one of them saved So how canst thou pretend that thou art the owner of the goods O captain said I listen to my story and give heed to my words and my truth will be manifest to thee for lying and leasing are the letter marks of the hypocrites Then I recounted to him all that had befallen me since I sailed from Baghdad with him to the time when we came to the fish island where we were nearly drowned and I reminded him of certain matters which had passed between us whereupon both he and the merchants were certified of the truth of my story and recognized me and gave me joy of my deliverance saying By Allah we thought not that thou hadst escaped drowning But the Lord hath granted thee new life Then they delivered my bales to me and I found my name written thereon nor was aught thereof lacking So I opened them and making up a present for King Mihrjan of the finest and costliest of the contents caused the sailors to carry it up to the palace where I went in to the King and laid my present at his feet acquainting him with what had happened especially concerning the ship and my goods whereat he wondered with exceeding wonder and the truth of all that I had told him was made manifest to him His affection for me redoubled after that and he showed me exceeding honor and bestowed on me a great present in return for mine Then I sold my bales and what other matters I owned making a great profit on them and bought me other goods and gear of the growth and fashion of the island city When the merchants were about to start on their homeward voyage I embarked on board the ship all that I possessed and going in to the King thanked him for all his favors and friendship and craved his leave to return to my own land and friends He farewelled me and bestowed upon me great store of the country stuffs and produce and I took leave of him and embarked Then we set sail and fared on nights and days by the permission of Allah Almighty and Fortune served us and Fate favored us so that we arrived in safety at Bassorah city where I landed rejoiced at my safe return to my natal soil After a short stay I set out for Baghdad the House of Peace with store of goods and commodities of great price Reaching the city in due time I went straight to my own quarter and entered my house where all my friends and kinsfolk came to greet me Then I bought me eunuchs and concubines servants and negro slaves till I had a large establishment and I bought me houses and lands and gardens till I was richer and in better case than before and returned to enjoy the society of my friends and familiars more assiduously than ever forgetting all I had suffered of fatigue and hardship and strangerhood and every peril of travel and I applied myself to all manner joys and solaces and delights eating the daintiest viands and drinking the deliciousest wines and my wealth allowed this state of things to endure This then is the story of my first voyage and to morrow Inshallah I will tell you the tale of the second of my seven voyages Saith he who telleth the tale Then Sindbad the Seaman made Sindbad the Landsman sup with him and bade give him an hundred gold pieces saying Thou hast cheered us with thy company this day The Porter thanked him and taking the gift went his way pondering that which he had heard and marveling mightily at what things betide mankind CONCLUSION OF THE THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT Translation of Captain Sir Richard F Burton Now during this time Shahrazad had borne the King three boy children so when she had made an end of the story of Ma aruf she rose to her feet and kissing ground before him said O King of the time and unique one of the age and the tide I am thine handmaid and these thousand nights and a night have I entertained thee with stories of folk gone before and admonitory instances of the men of yore May I then make bold to crave a boon of thy highness He replied Ask O Shahrazad and it shall be granted to thee Whereupon she cried out to the nurses and the eunuchs saying Bring me my children So they brought them to her in haste and they were three boy children one walking one crawling and one sucking She took them and setting them before the King again kissed ground and said O King of the Age these are thy children and I crave that thou release me from the doom of death as a dole to these infants for an thou kill me they will become motherless and will find none among women to rear them as they should be reared When the King heard this he wept and straining the boys to his bosom said By Allah O Shahrazad I pardoned thee before the coming of these children for that I found thee chaste pure ingenuous and pious Allah bless thee and thy father and thy mother and thy root and thy branch I take the Almighty to witness against me that I exempt thee from aught that can harm thee So she kissed his hands and feet and rejoiced with exceeding joy saying The Lord make thy life long and increase thee in dignity and majesty presently adding Thou marveledst at which befell thee on the part of women yet there betided the Kings of the Chosroes before thee greater mishaps and more grievous than that which hath befallen thee and indeed I have set forth unto thee that which happened to Caliphs and Kings and others with their women but the relation is longsome and hearkening groweth tedious and in this is all sufficient warning for the man of wits and admonishment for the wise Then she ceased to speak and when King Shahryar heard her speech and profited by that which she had said he summoned up his reasoning powers and cleansed his heart and caused his understanding to revert and turned to Allah Almighty and said to himself Since there befell the Kings of the Chosroes more than that which hath befallen me never whilst I live shall I cease to blame myself for the past As for this Shahrazad her like is not found in the lands so praise be to Him Who appointed her a means for delivering His creatures from oppression and slaughter Then he arose from his seance and kissed her head whereat she rejoiced she and her sister Dunyazad with exceeding joy When the morning morrowed the King went forth and sitting down on the throne of the Kingship summoned the Lords of his land whereupon the Chamberlains and Nabobs and Captains of the host went in to him and kissed ground before him He distinguished the Wazir Shahrazad s sire with special favor and bestowed on him a costly and splendid robe of honor and entreated him with the utmost kindness and said to him Allah protect thee for that thou gavest me to wife thy noble daughter who hath been the means of my repentance from slaying the daughters of folk Indeed I have found her pure and pious chaste and ingenuous and Allah hath vouchsafed me by her three boy children wherefore praised be He for His passing favor Then he bestowed robes of honor upon his Wazirs and Emirs and Chief Officers and he set forth to them briefly that which had betided him with Shahrazad and how he had turned from his former ways and repented him of what he had done and proposed to take the Wazir s daughter Shahrazad to wife and let draw up the marriage contract with her When those who were present heard this they kissed ground before him and blessed him and his betrothed Shahrazad and the Wazir thanked her Then Shahryar made an end of his sitting in all weal whereupon the folk dispersed to their dwelling places and the news was bruited abroad that the King proposed to marry the Wazir s daughter Shahrazad Then he proceeded to make ready the wedding gear and presently he sent after his brother King Shah Zaman who came and King Shahryar went forth to meet him with the troops Furthermore they decorated the city after the goodliest fashion and diffused scents from censers and burnt aloes wood and other perfumes in all the markets and thoroughfares and rubbed themselves with saffron what while the drums beat and the flutes and pipes sounded and mimes and mountebanks played and plied their arts and the King lavished on them gifts and largesse and in very deed it was a notable day When they came to the palace King Shahryar commanded to spread the table with beasts roasted whole and sweetmeats and all manner of viands and bade the crier cry to the folk that they should come up to the Diwan and eat and drink and that this should be a means of reconciliation between him and them So high and low great and small came up unto him and they abode on that wise eating and drinking seven days with their nights Then the King shut himself up with his brother and related to him that which had betided him with the Wazir s daughter Shahrazad during the past three years and told him what he had heard from her of proverbs and parables chronicles and pleasantries quips and jests stories and anecdotes dialogues and histories and elegies and other verses whereat King Shah Zaman marveled with the utmost marvel and said Fain would I take her younger sister to wife so we may be two brothers german to two sisters german and they on like wise be sisters to us for that the calamity which befell me was the cause of our discovering that which befell thee and all this time of three years past I have taken no delight in woman but now I desire to marry thy wife s sister Dunyazad When King Shahryar heard his brother s words he rejoiced with joy exceeding and arising forthright went in to his wife Shahrazad and acquainted her with that which his brother purposed namely that he sought her sister Dunyazad in wedlock whereupon she answered O King of the Age we seek of him one condition to wit that he take up his abode with us for that I cannot brook to be parted from my sister an hour because we were brought up together and may not endure separation each from another If he accept this pact she is his handmaid King Shahryar returned to his brother and acquainted him with that which Shahrazad had said and he replied Indeed this is what was in my mind for that I desire nevermore to be parted from thee one hour As for the kingdom Allah the Most High shall send to it whomso He chooseth for that I have no longer a desire for the kingship When King Shahryar heard his brother s words he rejoiced exceedingly and said Verily this is what I wished O my brother So Alhamdolillah Praised be Allah who hath brought about union between us Then he sent after the Kazis and Olema Captains and Notables and they married the two brothers to the two sisters The contracts were written out and the two Kings bestowed robes of honor of silk and satin on those who were present whilst the city was decorated and the rejoicings were renewed The King commanded each Emir and Wazir and Chamberlain and Nabob to decorate his palace and the folk of the city were gladdened by the presage of happiness and contentment King Shahryar also bade slaughter sheep and set up kitchens and made bride feasts and fed all comers high and low and he gave alms to the poor and needy and extended his bounty to great and small

none	none	Then Shahrazad entered she and her sister Dunyazad and they cleansed their heads and clipped their hair When they came forth of the Hammam bath they donned raiment and ornaments such as men were wont prepare for the Kings of the Chosroes and among Shahrazad s apparel was a dress purfled with red gold and wrought with counterfeit presentments of birds and beasts And the two sisters encircled their necks with necklaces of jewels of price in the like whereof Iskander rejoiced not for therein were great jewels such as amazed the wit and dazzled the eye and the imagination was bewildered at their charms for indeed each of them was brighter than the sun and the moon Before them they lighted brilliant flambeaux of wax in candelabra of gold but their faces outshone the flambeaux for that they had eyes sharper than unsheathed swords and the lashes of their eyelids bewitched all hearts

supplicate Him for a goodly and a godly end ARABIC LITERATURE BY RICHARD GOTTHEIL Of no civilization is the complexion of its literary remains so characteristic of its varying fortunes as is that of the Arabic The precarious conditions of desert life and of the tent the more certain existence in settled habitations the grandeur of empire acquired in a short period of enthusiastic rapture the softening influence of luxury and unwonted riches are so faithfully portrayed in the literature of the Arabs as to give us a picture of the spiritual life of the people which no mere massing of facts can ever give Well aware of this themselves the Arabs at an early date commenced the collection and preservation of their old literary monuments with a care and a studious concern which must excite within us a feeling of wonder For the material side of life must have made a strong appeal to these people when they came forth from their desert homes Pride in their own doings pride in their own past must have spurred them on yet an ardent feeling for the beautiful in speech is evident from the beginning of their history The first knowledge that we have of the tribes scattered up and down the deserts and oases of the Arabian peninsula comes to us in the verses of their poets The early Teuton bards the rhapsodists of Greece were not listened to with more rapt attention than was the simple Bedouin who seated on his mat or at the door of his tent gave vent to his feelings of joy or sorrow in such manner as nature had gifted him As are the ballads for Scottish history so are the verses of these untutored bards the record of the life in which they played no mean part Nor could the splendors of court life at Damascus Bagdad or Cordova make their rulers insensible to the charms of poetry that beautiful poetry with which Allah has adorned the Muslim A verse happily said could always charm a satire well pointed could always incite and the true Arab of to day will listen to those so adorned with the same rapt attention as did his fathers of long ago This gift of the desert otherwise so sparing of its favors has not failed to leave its impression upon the whole Arabic literature Though it has produced some prose writers of value writing as an art to charm and to please has always sought the measured cadence of poetry or the unmeasured symmetry of rhymed prose Its first lispings are in the trembling rajaz metre iambics rhyming in the same syllable throughout impromptu verses in which the poet expressed the feelings of the moment a measure which the Arabs say matches the trembling trot of the she camel It is simple in its character coming so near to rhymed prose that Khalil born seven hundred eighteen the great grammarian would not willingly admit that such lines could really be called poetry Some of these verses go back to the fourth and fifth centuries of our era But a growing sense of the poet s art was incompatible with so simple a measure and a hundred years before the appearance of the Prophet many of the canonical sixteen metres were already in vogue Even the later complete poems bear the stamp of their origin in the loose connection with which the different parts stand to each other The Kasidah poem is built upon the principle that each verse must be complete in itself there being no stanzas and separable from the context which has made interpolations and omissions in the older poems a matter of ease The classical period of Arabic poetry which reaches from the beginning of the sixth century to the beginning of the eighth is dominated by this form of the Kasidah Tradition refers its origin to one al Muhalhel ibn Rabi a of the tribe of Taghlib about one hundred and fifty years before Muhammad though as is usual this honor is not uncontested The Kasidah is composed of distichs the first two of which only are to rhyme though every line must end in the same syllable It must have at least seven or ten verses and may reach up to one hundred or over In nearly every case it deals with a tribe or a single person the poet himself or a friend and may be either a panegyric a satire an elegy or a eulogy That which it is the aim of the poet to bring out comes last the greater part of the poem being of the nature of a captatio benevolentia Here he can show his full power of expression He usually commences with the description of a deserted camping ground where he sees the traces of his beloved He then adds the erotic part and describes at length his deeds of valor in the chase or in war in order then to lead over to the real object he has in view Because of this disposition of the material which is used by the greater poets of this time the general form of the Kasidah became in a measure stereotyped No poem was considered perfect unless molded in this form Arabic poetry is thus entirely lyrical There was too little among these tribes of the common national life which forms the basis for the Epos The Semitic genius is too subjective and has never gotten beyond the first rude attempts at dramatic composition Even in its lyrics Arabic poetry is still more subjective than the Hebrew of the Bible It falls generally into the form of an allocution even where it is descriptive It is the poet who speaks and his personality pervades the whole poem He describes nature as he finds it with little of the imaginative in dim grand outlines of a picture which must be filled up by the reader guided only by a few glorious touches powerfully standing out A native quickness of apprehension and intense feeling nurtured this poetic sentiment among the Arabs The continuous enmity among the various tribes produced a sort of knight errantry which gave material to the poet and the richness of his language put a tongue in his mouth which could voice forth the finest shades of description or sentiment Al Damari has wisely said Wisdom has alighted upon three things the brain of the Franks the hands of the Chinese and the tongues of the Arabs The horizon which bounded the Arab poet s view was not far drawn out He describes the scenes of his desert life the sand dunes the camel antelope wild ass and gazelle his bow and arrow and his sword his loved one torn from him by the sudden striking of the tents and departure of her tribe The virtues which he sings are those in which he glories love of freedom independence in thought and action truthfulness largeness of heart generosity and hospitality His descriptions breathe the freshness of his outdoor life and bring us close to nature his whole tone rings out a solemn note which is even in his lighter moments grave and serious as existence itself was for those sons of the desert who had no settled habitation and who more than any one depended upon the bounty of Allah Although these Kasidahs passed rapidly from mouth to mouth little would have been preserved for us had there not been a class of men who led on some by desire some by necessity made it their business to write down the compositions and to keep fresh in their memory the very pronunciation of each word Every poet had such a Rawiah Of one Hammad it is said that he could recite one hundred Kasidahs rhyming on each letter of the alphabet each Kasidah having at least one hundred verses Abu Tammam eight hundred five the author of the Hamasah is reported to have known by heart fourteen thousand pieces of the metre rajaz It was not however until the end of the first century of the Hijrah that systematic collections of this older literature were commenced It was this very Hammad died seven hundred seventy seven who put together seven of the choicest poems of the early Arabs He called them Mu allakat the hung up in a place of honor in the estimation of the people The authors of these seven poems were Imr al Kais Tarafa Zuheir Labid five hundred seventy Antara Amr and al Harith The common verdict of their countrymen has praised the choice made by Hammad The seven remained the great models to which later poets aspired in description of love those of Imr al Kais and Antara in that of the camel and the horse Labid of battle Amr in the praise of arms Harith in wise maxims Zuheir To these must be added al Nabighah Alkamah Urwa ibn al Ward Hassan ibn Thabit al A sha Aus ibn Hajar and as Shanfarah whose poem has been called the most magnificent of old Arabic poems In addition to the single poems found in the Mu allakat and elsewhere nearly all of these composed whole series of poems which were at a later time put in the form of collections and called Diwans Some of these poets have left us as many as four hundred verses Such collections were made by grammarians and antiquarians of a later age In addition to the collections made around the name of a single poet others were made fashioned upon a different principle The Mufaddaliyat the most excellent poems put together by al Mufaddal seven hundred sixty one the Diwan of the poets of the tribe of Hudheil the Hamasah Bravery so called from the subject of the first of the ten books into which the collection is divided of Abu Tammam The best anthology of these poems is The Great Book of Songs put together by Abu al Faraj al Ispa hani died nine hundred sixty seven With these poets Arabic literature reached its highest development They are the true expression of the free Arabic spirit Most of them lived before or during the time of the appearance of Muhammad His coming produced a great change in the life of the simple Bedouins Though they could not be called heathen their religion expressed itself in the simple feeling of dependence upon higher powers without attempting to bring this faith into a close connection with their daily life Muhammad introduced a system into which he tried to mold all things He wished to unite the scattered tribes to one only purpose He was thus cutting away that untrammeled spirit and that free life which had been the making of Arabic poetry He knew this well He knew also the power the poets had over the people His own Qur an Koran was but a poor substitute for the elegant verses of his opponents Imr al Kais he said is the finest of all poets and their leader into everlasting fire On another occasion he is reported to have called out Verily a belly full of matter is better than a belly full of poetry Even when citing verses he quoted them in such a manner as to destroy the metre Abu Bekr very properly remarked Truly God said in the Qur an We have not taught him poetry and it suits him not In thus decrying the poets of barbarism and in setting up the Qur an as the greatest production of Arabic genius Muhammad was turning the national poetry to its decline Happily his immediate successors were unable or unwilling to follow him strictly Ali himself his son in law is said to have been a poet nor did the Umayyid Caliphs of Damascus very heathens in their carnal part bring the new spirit to its full bloom as did the Abbassides of Bagdad And yet the old spirit was gradually losing ground The consolidation of the empire brought greater security the riches of Persia and Syria produced new types of men The centre of Arab life was now in the city with all its trammels its forced politeness its herding together The simplicity which characterized the early caliphs was going in its place was come a court court life court manners court poets The love of poetry was still there but the poet of the tent had become the poet of the house and the palace Like those troubadours who had become jongleurs they lived upon the crumbs which fell from the table of princes Such crumbs were often not to be despised Many a time and oft the bard tuned his lyre merely for the price of his services We know that he was richly rewarded Harun gave a dress worth four hundred thousand pieces of gold to Ja far ibn Yahya at his death Ibn Ubeid al Buchtari eight hundred sixty five left one hundred complete suits of dress two hundred shirts and five hundred turbans all of which had been given him for his poems The freshness of olden times was fading little by little the earnestness of the Bedouin poet was making way for a lightness of heart In this intermediate period few were born so happily and yet so imbued with the new spirit as was Umar ibn Rabi a six hundred forty four the man of pleasure as well as the man of literature Of rich parentage gifted with a love of song which moved him to speak in verses he was able to keep himself far from both prince and palace He was of the family of Kureish in whose Muhammad all the glories of Arabia had centred with one exception the gift of poetry And now this Don Juan of Mecca this Ovid of Arabia was to wipe away that stain He was the Arabian Minnesinger whom Friedrich Rueckert called the greatest love poet the Arabs have produced A man of the city the desert had no attractions for him But he sang of love as he made love with utter disregard of holy place or high station in an erotic strain strange to the stern Umayyids No wonder they warned their children against reading his compositions The greatest sin committed against Allah are the poems of Umar ibn Rabi a they said With the rise of the Abbassides seven hundred fifty that God favored dynasty Arabic literature entered upon its second great development a development which may be distinguished from that of the Umayyids which was Arabian as in very truth Muhammadan With Bagdad as the capital it was rather the non Arabic Persians who held aloft the torch than the Arabs descended from Kureish It was a bold move this attempt to weld the old Persian civilization with the new Muhammadan Yet so great was the power of the new faith that it succeeded The Barmecide major domo ably seconded his Abbasside master the glory of both rests upon the interest they took in art literature and science The Arab came in contact with a new world Under Mansur seven hundred fifty four Harun al Rashid seven hundred eighty six and Ma mun eight hundred thirteen the wisdom of the Greeks in philosophy and science the charms of Persia and India in wit and satire were opened up to enlightened eyes Upon all of these whatever their nationality Islam had imposed the Arab tongue pride in the faith and in its early history Qur an exegesis philosophy law history and science were cultivated under the very eyes and at the bidding of the Palace And at least for several centuries Europe was indebted to the culture of Bagdad for what it knew of mathematics astronomy and philosophy The Arab muse profited with the rest of this revival History and philosophy as a study demanded a close acquaintance with the products of early Arab genius The great philologian al Asmai seven hundred forty eight hundred thirty one collected the songs and tales of the heroic age and a little later with other than philological ends in view Abu Tammam and al Buchturi eight hundred sixteen nine hundred thirteen made the first anthologies of the old Arabic literatures Hamasah Poetry was already cultivated and amid the hundreds of wits poets and singers who thronged the entrance to the court there are many who claim real poetic genius Among them are al Ahtal died seven hundred thirteen a Christian Umar ibn Rabi a died seven hundred twenty eight Jarir al Farazdak died seven hundred twenty eight and Muslim ibn al Walid died eight hundred twenty eight But it is rather the Persian spirit which rules the spirit of the Shahnameh and Firdausi charming elegance servile court flattery and graceful wit In none are the characteristics so manifest as in Abu Nuwas seven hundred sixty two eight hundred nineteen the Poet Laureate of Harun the Imr al Kais of his time His themes are wine and love Everything else he casts to the wind and like his modern counterpart Heine he drives the wit of his satire deep into the holiest feelings of his people I would that all which Religion and Law forbids were permitted me and if I had only two years to live that God would change me into a dog at the Temple in Mecca so that I might bite every pilgrim in the leg he is reported to have said When he himself did once make the required pilgrimage he did so in order to carry his loves up to the very walls of the sacred house Jovial adventure loving devil may care irreligious in all he did yet neither the Khalif nor the whole Muhammadan world were incensed In spite of all they petted him and pronounced his wine songs the finest ever written full of thought and replete with pictures rich in language and true to every touch of nature There are no poems on wine equal to my own and to my amatory compositions all others must yield he himself has said He was poor and had to live by his talents But wherever he went he was richly rewarded He was content only to be able to live in shameless revelry and to sing As he lived so he died in a half drunken group cut to pieces by those who thought themselves offended by his lampoons At the other end of the Muslim world the star of the Umayyids which had set at Damascus rose again at Cordova The union of two civilizations Indo Germanic and Semitic was as advantageous in the West as in the East The influence of the spirit of learning which reigned at Bagdad reached over to Spain and the two dynasties vied with each other in the patronage of all that was beautiful in literature and learned in science Poetry was cultivated and poets cherished with a like regard the Spanish innate love of the Muse joined hands with that of the Arabic It was the same kind of poetry in Umayyid Spain as in Abbasside Bagdad poetry of the city and of the palace But another element was added here the Western love for the softer beauties of nature and for their expression in finely worked out mosaics and in graceful descriptions It is this that brings the Spanish Arabic poetry nearer to us than the more splendid and glittering verses of the Abbassides or the cruder and less polished lines of the first Muhammadans The amount of poetry thus composed in Arab Spain may be gauged by the fact that an anthology made during the first half of the tenth century by Ibn Faraj contained twenty thousand verses Cordova under Abd al Rahman III and Hakim II was the counterpart of Bagdad under Harun The most learned prince that ever lived Hakim was so renowned a patron of literature that learned men wandered to him from all over the Arab Empire He collected a library of four hundred thousand volumes which had been gathered together by his agents in Egypt Syria and Persia the catalogue of which filled forty four volumes In Cordova he founded a university and twenty seven free schools What wonder that all the sciences Tradition Theology Jurisprudence and especially History and Geography flourished during his reign Of the poets of this period there may be mentioned Sa id ibn Judi the pattern of the Knight of those days the poet loved of women Yahyah ibn Hakam the gazelle Ahmad ibn Abd Rabbih the author of a commonplace book Ibn Abdun of Badjiz Ibn Hafajah of Xucar Ibn Sa id of Granada Kings added a new jewel to their crown and took an honored place among the bards as Abd al Rahman I and Mu tamid died ten ninety five the last King of Seville whose unfortunate life he himself has pictured in most beautiful elegies Although the short revival under the Almohades eleven eighty four eleven ninety eight produced such men as Ibn Roshd the commentator on Aristotle and Ibn Tofeil who wrote the first Robinson Crusoe story the sun was already setting When Ferdinand burned the books which had been so laboriously collected the dying flame of Arab culture in Spain went out During the third period from Ma mun eight hundred thirteen under whom the Turkish body guards began to wield their baneful influence until the break up of the Abbasside Empire in twelve fifty eight there are many names but few real poets to be mentioned The Arab spirit had spent itself and the Mogul cloud was on the horizon There were Abd allah ibn al Mu tazz died nine hundred eight Abu Firas died nine hundred sixty seven al Tughrai died eleven twenty al Busiri died twelve seventy nine author of the Burda poem in praise of Muhammad but al Mutanabbi died nine hundred sixty five alone deserves special mention The Prophet pretender for such his name signifies has been called by Von Hammer the greatest Arabian poet and there is no doubt that his Diwan with its two hundred and eighty nine poems was and is widely read in the East But it is only a depraved taste that can prefer such an epigene to the fresh desert music of Imr al Kais Panegyrics songs of war and of bloodshed are mostly the themes that he dilates upon He was in the service of Saif al Daulah of Syria and sang his victories over the Byzantine Kaiser He is the true type of the prince s poet Withal the taste for poetic composition grew though it produced a smaller number of great poets But it also usurped for itself fields which belong to entirely different literary forms Grammar lexicography philosophy and theology were expounded in verse but the verse was formal stiff and unnatural Poetic composition became a tour de force This is nowhere better seen than in that species of composition which appeared for the first time in the eleventh century and which so pleased and charmed a degenerate age as to make of the Makamat the most favorite reading Ahmad Abu Fadl al Hamadhani the wonder of all time died ten oh seven composed the first of such sessions Of his four hundred only a few have come down to our time Abu Muhammad al Hariri ten thirty eleven twenty one of Basra is certainly the one who made this species of literature popular he has been closely imitated in Hebrew by Charizi twelve eighteen and in Syriac by Ebed Yeshu twelve ninety Makamah means the place where one stands where assemblies are held then the discourses delivered or conversations held in such an assembly The word is used here especially to denote a series of discourses and conversations composed in a highly finished and ornamental style and solely for the purpose of exhibiting various kinds of eloquence and exemplifying the rules of grammar rhetoric and poetry Hariri himself speaks of These Makamat which contain serious language and lightsome And combine refinement with dignity of style And brilliancies with jewels of eloquence And beauties of literature with its rarities Besides quotations from the Qur an wherewith I adorned them And choice metaphors and Arab proverbs that I interspersed And literary elegancies and grammatical riddles And decisions upon ambiguous legal questions And original improvisations and highly wrought orations And plaintive discourses as well as jocose witticisms The design is thus purely literary The fifty sessions of Hariri which are written in rhymed prose interspersed with poetry contain oratorical poetical moral encomiastic and satirical discourses which only the merest thread holds together Each Makamah is a unit and has no necessary connection with that which follows The thread which so loosely binds them together is the delineation of the character of Abu Zeid the hero in his own words He is one of those wandering minstrels and happy improvisers whom the favor of princes had turned into poetizing beggars In each Makamah is related some ruse by means of which Abu Zeid because of his wonderful gift of speech either persuades or forces those whom he meets to pay for his sustenance and furnish the means for his debauches Not the least of those thus ensnared is his great admirer Hareth ibn Hammam the narrator of the whole who is none other than Hariri Wearied at last with his life of travel debauch and deception Abu Zeid retires to his native city and becomes an ascetic thus to atone in a measure for his past sins The whole might be called not improperly a tale a novel But the intention of the poet is to show forth the richness and variety of the Arabic language and his own power over this great mass brings the descriptive one might almost say the lexicographic side too much to the front A poem that can be read either backward or forward or which contains all the words in the language beginning with a certain letter may be a wonderful mosaic but is nothing more The merit of Hariri lies just in this that working in such cramped quarters with such intent and design continually guiding his pen he has often really done more He has produced rhymed prose and verses which are certainly elegant in diction and elevated in tone Such tales as these told as an exercise of linguistic gymnastics must not blind us to the presence of real tales told for their own sake Arabic literature has been very prolific in these They lightened the graver subjects discussed in the tent philosophy religion and grammar and they furnished entertainment for the more boisterous assemblies in the coffee houses and around the bowl For the Arab is an inveterate story teller and in nearly all the prose that he writes this character of the teller shimmers clearly through the work of the writer He is an elegant narrator Not only does he intersperse verses and lines more frequently than our own taste would license by nature he easily falls into the half hearted poetry of rhymed prose for which the rich assonances of his language predispose His own learning was further cultivated by his early contact with Persian literature through which the fable and the wisdom of India spoken from the mouths of dumb animals reached him In this more frivolous form of inculcating wisdom the Prophet scented danger to his strait laced demands men who bring sportive legends to lead astray from God s path without knowledge and to make a jest of it for such is shameful woe is written in the thirty first Surah In vain for in hours of relaxation such works as the Fables of Bidpai translated from the Persian in seven hundred fifty by Abd Allah ibn Mukaffah the Ten Viziers the Seven Wise Masters et cetera proved to be food too palatable Nor were the Arabs wanting in their own peculiar Romances influenced only in some portions of the setting by Persian ideas Such were the Story of Saif ibn dhi Yazan the Tale of al Zir the Romance of Dalhmah and especially the Romance of Antar and the Thousand Nights and A Night The last two romances are excellent commentaries on Arab life at its dawn and at its fullness among the roving chiefs of the desert and the homes of revelry in Bagdad As the rough hewn poetry of Imr al Kais and Zuheir is a clearer exponent of the real Arab mind roving at its own suggestion than the more perfect and softer lines of a Mutanabbi so is the Romance of Antar the full expression of real Arab hero worship And even in the cities of the Orient to day the loungers in their cups can never weary of following the exploits of this black son of the desert who in his person unites the great virtues of his people magnanimity and bravery with the gift of poetic speech Its tone is elevated its coarseness has as its origin the outspokenness of unvarnished man it does not peep through the thin veneer of licentious suggestiveness It is never trivial even in its long and wearisome descriptions in its ever recurring outbursts of love Its language suits its thought choice and educated and not descending as in the Nights to the common expressions of ordinary speech In this it resembles the Makamat of Hariri though much less artificial and more enjoyable It is the Arabic romance of chivalry and may not have been without influence on the spread of the romance of mediaeval Europe For though its central figure is a hero of pre Islamic times it was put together by the learned philologian al Asmai in the days of Harun the Just at the time when Charlemagne was ruling in Europe There exist in Arabic literature very few romances of the length of Antar Though the Arab delights to hear and to recount tales his tales are generally short and pithy It is in this shorter form that he delights to inculcate principles of morality and norms of character He is most adroit at repartee and at pungent replies He has a way of stating principles which delights while it instructs The anecdote is at home in the East many a favor is gained many a punishment averted by a quick answer and a felicitously turned expression Such anecdotes exist as popular traditions in very large numbers and he receives much consideration whose mind is well stocked with them Collections of anecdotes have been put to writing from time to time Those dealing with the early history of the caliphate are among the best prose that the Arabs have produced For pure prose was never greatly cultivated The literature dealing with their own history or with the geography and culture of the nations with which they came in contact is very large and as a record of facts is most important Ibn Hisham died seven hundred sixty seven Wakidi died eight hundred twenty two Tabari eight hundred thirty eight nine hundred twenty three Masudi died nine hundred fifty seven Ibn Athir died twelve thirty three Ibn Khaldun died fourteen oh six Makrisi died fourteen forty two Suyuti died fifteen oh five and Makkari died sixteen thirty one are only a few of those who have given us large and comprehensive histories Al Biruni died ten thirty eight writer mathematician and traveler has left us an account of the India of his day which has earned for him the title Herodotus of India though for careful observation and faithful presentation he stands far above the writer with whose name he is adorned But nearly all of these historical writers are mere chronologists dry and wearisome to the general reader It is only in the Preface or Exordium often the most elaborate part of the whole book viewed from a rhetorical standpoint that they attempt to rise above mere incidents and strive after literary form Besides the regard in which anecdotes are held it is considered a mark of education to insert in one s speech as often as possible a familiar saying a proverb a bon mot These are largely used in the moral addresses Khutbah made in the mosque or elsewhere addresses which take on also the form of rhymed prose A famous collection of such sayings is attributed to Ali the fourth successor of Muhammad In these the whole power of the Arab for subtle distinctions in matters of wordly wisdom and the truly religious feeling of the East are clearly manifested The propensity of the Arab mind for the tale and the anecdote has had a wider influence in shaping the religious and legal development of Muhammadanism than would appear at first sight The Qur an might well suffice as a directive code for a small body of men whose daily life was simple and whose organization was of the crudest kind But even Muhammad in his own later days was called on to supplement the written word by the spoken to interpret such parts of his book as were unintelligible to reconcile conflicting statements and to fit the older legislation to changed circumstances As the religious head of the community his dictum became law and these logia of the Prophet were handed around and handed down as the unwritten law by which his lieutenants were to be guided in matters not only religious but also legal For law to them was part and parcel of religion This hadith grew apace until in the third century of the Hijrah it was put to writing Nothing bears weight which has not the stamp of Muhammad s authority as reported by his near surroundings and his friends In such a mass of tradition great care is taken to separate the chaff from the wheat The chain of tradition Isnad must be given for each tradition for each anecdote But the friends of the Prophet are said to have numbered seven thousand five hundred and it has not been easy to keep out fraud and deception The subjects treated are most varied sometimes even trivial but dealing usually with recondite questions of law and morals Three great collections of the Hadith have been made by al Buchari eight hundred sixty nine Muslim eight hundred seventy four and al Tirmidhi eight hundred ninety two The first two only are considered canonical From these are derived the three great systems of jurisprudence which to this day hold good in the Muhammadan world The best presentation of the characteristics of Arabic poetry is by W Ahlwardt Ueber Poesie und Poetik der Araber Gotha eighteen fifty six of Arabic metres by G W Freytag Darstellung

the Mu allakat that of Imr al Kais The Wandering King Translation of C J Lyall O friend see the lightning there it flickered and now is gone as though flashed a pair of hands in the pillar of crowned cloud Now was it its blaze or the lamps of a hermit that dwells alone and pours o er the twisted wicks the oil from his slender cruse We sat there my fellows and I twixt Darij and al Udhaib and gazed as the distance gloomed and waited its oncoming The right of its mighty rain advanced over Katan s ridge the left of its trailing skirt swept Yadhbul and as Sitar Then over Kutaifah s steep the flood of its onset drave and headlong before its storm the tall trees were borne to ground And the drift of its waters passed o er the crags of al Kanan and drave forth the white legged deer from the refuge they sought therein And Taima it left not there the stem of a palm aloft nor ever a tower save ours firm built on the living rock And when first its misty shroud bore down upon Mount Thabir he stood like an ancient man in a gray streaked mantle wrapt The clouds cast their burdens down on the broad plain of al Ghabit as a trader from al Yaman unfolds from the bales his store And the topmost crest on the morrow of al Mujaimir s cairn was heaped with the flood borne wrack like wool on a distaff wound FROM THE MU ALLAKAT OF ZUHEIR A lament for the desertion through a war of his former home and the haunts of his tribe Translation of C J Lyall I Are they of Umm Aufa s tents these black lines that speak no word in the stony plain of al Mutathellam and al Darraj Yea and the place where his camp stood in ar Rakmatan is now like the tracery drawn afresh by the veins of the inner wrist The wild kine roam there large eyed and the deer pass to and fro and their younglings rise up to suck from the spots where they all lie round I stood there and gazed since I saw it last twenty years had flown and much I pondered thereon hard was it to know again The black stones in order laid in the place where the pot was set and the trench like a cistern s root with its sides unbroken still And when I knew it at last for his resting place I cried Good greeting to thee O house Fair peace in the morn to thee Look forth O friend canst thou see aught of ladies camel borne that journey along the upland there above Jurthum well Their litters are hung with precious stuffs and their veils thereon cast loosely their borders rose as though they were dyed in blood Sideways they sat as their beasts clomb the ridge of as Suban in them were the sweetness and grace of one nourished in wealth and ease They went on their way at dawn they started before sunrise straight did they make for the vale of ar Rass as hand for mouth Dainty and playful their mood to one who should try its worth and faces fair to an eye skilled to trace out loveliness And the tassels of scarlet wool in the spots where they gat them down glowed red like to ishrik seeds fresh fallen unbroken bright And then they reached the wells where the deep blue water lies they cast down their staves and set them to pitch the tents for rest On their right hand rose al Kanan and the rugged skirts thereof and in al Kanan how many are foes and friends of mine At eve they left as Suban then they crossed the ridge again borne on the fair fashioned litters all new and builded broad Certain cantos to the sixth one reproach the author of the treachery and quarrel that led to the war and migration Then follows a series of maxims as to human life and conduct VI Aweary am I of life s toil and travail he who like me has seen pass of years fourscore well may he be sick of life I know what To day unfolds what before it was Yesterday but blind do I stand before the knowledge To morrow brings I have seen the Dooms trample men as a blind beast at random treads whom they smote he died whom they missed he lived on to strengthless eld Who gathers not friends by help in many cases of need is torn by the blind beast s teeth or trodden beneath its foot And he who his honor shields by the doing of a kindly deed grows richer who shuts not the mouth of reviling it lights on him And he who is lord of wealth and niggardly with his hoard alone is he left by his kin naught have they for him but blame Who keeps faith no blame he earns and that man whose heart is led to goodness unmixed with guile gains freedom and peace of soul Who trembles before the Dooms yea him shall they surely seize albeit he set a ladder to climb the sky Who spends on unworthy men his kindness with lavish hand no praise doth he earn but blame and repentance the seed thereof Who will not yield to the spears when their feet turn to him in peace shall yield to the points thereof and the long flashing blades of steel Who holds not his foe away from his cistern with sword and spear it is broken and spoiled who uses not roughness him shall men wrong Who seeks far away from kin for housing takes foe for friend who honors himself not well no honor gains he from men Who makes of his soul a beast of burden to bear men s loads nor shields it one day from shame yea sorrow shall be his lot Whatso be the shaping of mind that a man is born withal though he think it lies hid from men it shall surely one day be known How many a man seemed goodly to thee while he held his peace whereof thou didst learn the more or less when he turned to speech The tongue is a man s one half the other the heart within besides these two naught is left but a semblance of flesh and blood If a man be old and a fool his folly is past all cure but a young man may yet grow wise and cast off his foolishness VII We asked and ye gave we asked again and ye gave again but the end of much asking must be that no giving shall follow it TARAFAH IBN AL ABD A rebuke to a mischief maker Translation of C J Lyall The craft of thy busy tongue has sundered from home and kin the cousins of both thy houses Amr Auf and Malik s son For thou to thy dearest art a wind of the bitter north that sweeps from the Syrian hills and wrinkles our cheeks and brows But balmy art thou and mild to strangers a gracious breeze that brings from the gulf shore showers and fills with its rain our streams And this of a truth I know no fancy it is of mine who holds mean his kith and kin the meanest of men is he And surely a foolish tongue when rules not its idle prate discretion but shows men where thou dwellest with none to guard LABID A lament for the afflictions of his tribe the Amir From the Diwan Translation of C J Lyall Yea the righteous shall keep the way of the righteous and to God turn the steps of all that abideth And to God ye return too with Him only rest the issues of things and all that they gather All that is in the Book of Knowledge is reckoned and before Him revealed lies all that is hidden Both the day when His gifts of goodness on those whom He exalts are as palms full freighted with sweetness Young burdened with fruit their heads bowed with clusters swelled to bursting the tallest e en as the lesser And the day when avails the sin spotted only prayer for pardon and grace to lead him to mercy And the good deed he wrought to witness before him and the pity of Him who is Compassion Yea a place in his shade the best to abide in and a heart still and steadfast right weening honest Is there aught good in life Yea I have seen it even I if the seeing bring aught of profit Long has Life been to me and this is its burthen lone against time abide Ti ar and Yaramram And Kulaf and Badi the mighty and Dalfa yea and Timar that towers aloft over Kubbah one And the Stars marching all night in procession drooping westwards as each hies forth to his setting Sure and steadfast their course the underworld draws them gently downwards as maidens encircling the Pillar And we know not whenas their lustre is vanished whether long be the ropes that bind them or little Lone is Amir and naught is left of her goodness in the meadows of al A raf but her dwellings Ruined shadows of tents and penfolds and shelters bough from bough rent and spoiled by wind and by weather Gone is Amir her ancients gone all the wisest none remain but a folk whose war mares are fillies Yet they slay them in every breach in our rampart yea and they that bestride them true hearted helpers They contemn not their kin when change comes upon them Nor do we scorn the ties of blood and of succor Now on Amir be peace and praises and blessing wherever be on earth her way or her halting Footnote one The five names foregoing are those of mountains A FAIR LADY From the Mu allakat of Antara Translation of E H Palmer Twas then her beauties first enslaved my heart Those glittering pearls and ruby lips whose kiss Was sweeter far than honey to the taste As when the merchant opes a precious box Of perfume such an odor from her breath Comes toward me harbinger of her approach Or like an untouched meadow where the rain Hath fallen freshly on the fragrant herbs That carpet all its pure untrodden soil A meadow where the fragrant rain drops fall Like coins of silver in the quiet pools And irrigate it with perpetual streams A meadow where the sportive insects hum Like listless topers singing o er their cups And ply their forelegs like a man who tries With maimed hand to use the flint and steel THE DEATH OF ABDALLAH AND WHAT MANNER OF MAN HE WAS From the original poem of Duraid son of as Simmah of Jusharn Translation of C J Lyall I warned them both Arid and the men who went Arid s way the house of the Black Mother yea ye are all my witnesses I said to them Think even now two thousand are on your track all laden with sword and spear their captains in Persian mail But when they would hearken not I followed their road though I knew well they were fools and that I walked not in Wisdom s way For am not I but one of the Ghaziyah and if they err I err with my house and if the Ghaziyah go right so I I read them my rede one day at Mun araj al Liwa the morrow at noon they saw my counsel as I had seen A shout rose and voices cried The horsemen have slain a knight I said Is it Abdallah the man whom you say is slain I sprang to his side the spears had riddled his body through as a weaver on outstretched web deftly plies the sharp toothed comb I stood as a camel stands with fear in her heart and seeks the stuffed skin with eager mouth and thinks is her youngling slain I plied spear above him till the riders had left their prey and over myself black blood flowed in a dusky tide I fought as a man who gives his life for his brother s life who knows that his time is short that Death s doom above him hangs But know ye if Abdallah be dead and his place a void no weakling unsure of hand and no holder back was he Alert keen his loins well girt his leg to the middle bare unblemished and clean of limb a climber to all things high No wailer before ill luck one mindful in all he did to think how his work to day would live in to morrow s tale Content to bear hunger s pain though meat lay beneath his hand to labor in ragged shirt that those whom he served might rest If Dearth laid her hand on him and Famine devoured his store he gave but the gladlier what little to him they spared He dealt as a youth with Youth until when his head grew hoar and age gathered o er his brow to lightness he said Begone Yea somewhat it soothes my soul that never I said to him thou liest nor grudged him aught of mine that he sought of me ASH SHANFARA OF AZD A picture of womanhood from the Mufaddaliyat Translation of C J Lyall Alas Umm Amr set her face to depart and went gone is she and when she sped she left with us no farewell Her purpose was quickly shaped no warning gave she to friends though there she had dwelt hard by her camels all day with ours Yea thus in our eyes she dwelt from morning to noon and eve she brought to an end her tale and fleeted and left us lone So gone is Umaimah gone and leaves here a heart in pain my life was to yearn for her and now its delight is fled She won me whenas shamefaced no maid to let fall her veil no wanton to glance behind she walked forth with steady tread Her eyes seek the ground as though they looked for a thing lost there she turns not to left or right her answer is brief and low She rises before day dawns to carry her supper forth to wives who have need dear alms when such gifts are few enow Afar from the voice of blame her tent stands for all to see when many a woman s tent is pitched in the place of scorn No gossip to bring him shame from her does her husband dread when mention is made of women pure and unstained is she The day done at eve glad comes he home to his eyes delight he needs not to ask of her Say where didst thou pass the day And slender is she where meet and full where it so beseems and tall and straight a fairy shape if such on earth there be And nightlong as we sat there methought that the tent was roofed above with basil sprays all fragrant in dewy eve Sweet basil from Halyah dale its branches abloom and fresh that fills all the place with balm no starveling of desert sands ZEYNAB AT THE KA BAH From Umar ibn Rabi a s Love Poems Translation of W Gifford Palgrave Ah for the throes of a heart sorely wounded Ah for the eyes that have smit me with madness Gently she moved in the calmness of beauty Moved as the bough to the light breeze of morning Dazzled my eyes as they gazed till before me All was a mist and confusion of figures Ne er had I sought her ne er had she sought me Fated the love and the hour and the meeting There I beheld her as she and her damsels Paced twixt the temple and outer inclosure Damsels the fairest the loveliest gentlest Passing like slow wandering heifers at evening Ever surrounding with comely observance Her whom they honor the peerless of women Omar is near let us mar his devotions Cross on his path that he needs must observe us Give him a signal my sister demurely Signals I gave but he marked not or heeded Answered the damsel and hasted to meet me Ah for that night by the vale of the sandhills Ah for the dawn when in silence we parted He whom the morn may awake to her kisses Drinks from the cup of the blessed in heaven THE UNVEILED MAID From Umar ibn Rabi a s Love Poems Translation of W Gifford Palgrave In the valley of Mohassib I beheld her where she stood Caution bade me turn aside but love forbade and fixed me there Was it sunlight or the windows of a gleaming mosque at eve Lighted up for festal worship or was all my fancy s dream Ah those earrings ah that necklace Naufel s daughter sure the maid Or of Hashim s princely lineage and the Servant of the Sun But a moment flashed the splendor as the o er hasty handmaids drew Round her with a jealous hand the jealous curtains of the tent Speech nor greeting passed between us but she saw me and I saw Face the loveliest of all faces hands the fairest of all hands Daughter of a better earth and nurtured by a brighter sky Would I ne er had seen thy beauty Hope is fled but love remains FROM THE DIWAN OF AL NABIGHAH A eulogy of the valor and culture of the men of Ghassan written in time of the poet s political exile from them Translation of C J Lyall Leave me alone O Umaimah alone with my sleepless pain alone with the livelong night and the wearily lingering stars It draws on its length of gloom methinks it will never end nor ever the Star herd lead his flock to their folds of rest Alone with a breast whose griefs that roamed far afield by day the darkness has brought all home in legions they throng around A favor I have with Amr a favor his father bore toward me of old a grace that carried no scorpion sting I swear and my word is true an oath that hath no reserve and naught in my heart is hid save fair thought of him my friend If these twain his fathers were who lie in their graves the one al Jillik the others al Saida by Harib s side And Harith of Jafnah s line the lord of his folk of old yea surely his might shall reach the home of his enemy In him hope is sure of help when men say The host is sped the horsemen of Ghassan s line unblemished no hireling herd His cousins all near of kin their chief Amr Amir s son a people are they whose might in battle shall never fail When goes forth the host to war above them in circles wheel battalions of eagles pointing the path to battalions more Their friendship is old and tried fast comrades in foray bred to look unafraid on blood as hounds to the chase well trained Behold them how they sit there behind where their armies meet watching with eyes askance like elders in gray furs wrapt Intent for they know full well that those whom they follow when the clash of the hosts shall come will bear off the victory Ay well is that custom known a usage that time has proved when lances are laid in rest on withers of steeds arow Of steeds in the spear play skilled with lips for the fight drawn back their bodies with wounds all scarred some bleeding and some half healed And down leap the riders where the battle is strait and stern and spring in the face of Death like stallions amid the herd Between them they give and take deep draughts of the wine of doom as their hands ply the white swords thin and keen in the smiting edge In shards fall the morions burst by the fury of blow on blow and down to the eyebrows cleft fly shattered the skulls beneath In them no defect is found save only that in their swords are notches a many gained from smiting of host on host An heirloom of old those blades from the fight of Halimah s day and many the mellay fierce that since has their temper proved Therewith do they cleave in twain the hauberk of double woof and kindle the rock beneath to fire ere the stroke is done A nature is theirs God gives the like to no other men a wisdom that never sleeps a bounty that never fails Their home is God s own land His chosen of old their faith is steadfast Their hope is set on naught but the world to come Their sandals are soft and fine and girded with chastity they welcome with garlands sweet the dawn of the Feast of Palms There greets them when they come home full many a handmaid fine and ready on trestles hang the mantles of scarlet silk Yea softly they wrap their limbs well knowing of wealth and ease in rich raiment white sleeved green at the shoulder in royal guise They look not on Weal as men who know not that Woe comes too they look not on evil days as though they would never mend Lo this was my gift to Ghassan what time I sought My people and all my paths were darkened and strait my ways NUSAIB The poem characterizes the separation of a wife and mother a slave from her family Translation of C J Lyall They said last night To morrow at first of dawning or maybe at eventide must Laila go My heart at the word lay helpless as lies a Kat a in net night long and struggles with fast bound wing Two nestlings she left alone in a nest far distant a nest which the winds smite tossing it to and fro They hear but the whistling breeze and stretch necks to greet her but she they await the end of her days is come So lies she and neither gains in the night her longing nor brings her the morning any release from pain VENGEANCE By al Find of the Zimman Tribe Translation of C J Lyall Forgiveness had we for Hind s sons We said The men our brothers are The days may bring that yet again They be the folk that once they were But when the Ill stood clear and plain And naked Wrong was bold to brave And naught was left but bitter Hate We paid them in the coin they gave We strode as stalks a lion forth At dawn a lion wrathful eyed Blows rained we dealing shame on shame And humbling pomp and quelling pride Too kind a man may be with fools And nerve them but to flout him more And Mischief oft may bring thee peace When Mildness works not Folly s cure PATIENCE From Ibrahim Son of Kunaif of Nabhan Translation of C J Lyall Be patient for free born men to bear is the fairest thing And refuge against Time s wrong or help from his hurt is none And if it availed man aught to bow him to fluttering Fear Or if he could ward off hurt by humbling himself to Ill To bear with a valiant front the full brunt of every stroke And onset of Fate were still the fairest and best of things But how much the more when none outruns by a span his Doom And refuge from God s decree nor was nor will ever be And sooth if the changing Days have wrought us their wonted way A lot mixed of weal and woe yet one thing they could not do They have not made soft or weak the stock of our sturdy spear They have not abased our hearts to doing of deeds of shame We offer to bear their weight a handful of noble souls Though laden beyond all weight of man they uplift the load So shield we with Patience fair our souls from the stroke of Shame Our honors are whole and sound though others be lean enow ABU SAKHR On a lost love From the Hamasah Translation of C J Lyall By him who brings weeping and laughter who deals Death and Life as He wills she left me to envy the wild deer that graze twain and twain without fear Oh love of her heighten my heart s pain and strengthen the pang every night oh comfort that days bring forgetting the last of all days be thy tryst I marveled how swiftly the time sped between us the moment we met but when that brief moment was ended how wearily dragged he his feet AN ADDRESS TO THE BELOVED By Abu l Ata of Sind From the Hamasah Translation of C J Lyall Of thee did I dream while spears between us were quivering and sooth of our blood full deep had drunken the tawny shafts I know not by Heaven I swear and here is the word I say this pang is it love sickness or wrought by a spell from thee If it be a spell then grant me grace of thy love longing if other the sickness be then none is the guilt of thine A FORAY By Ja far ibn Ulbah From the Hamasah Translation of C J Lyall That even when under Sabhal s twin peaks upon us drave the horsemen troop upon troop and the foeman pressed us sore They said to us Two things lie before you now must ye choose the points of the spears couched at ye or if ye will not chains We answered them Yea this thing may fall to you after the fight when men shall be left on ground and none shall arise again But we know not if we quail before the assault of Death how much may be left of life the goal is too dim to see We rode to the strait of battle there cleared us a space around the white swords in our right hands which the smiths had furbished fair On them fell the edge of my blade on that day of Sabhal date And mine was the share thereof wherever my fingers closed FATALITY By Katari ibn al Fuja ah ibn Ma zin From the Hamasah Translation of C J Lyall I said to her when she fled in amaze and breathless before the array of battle Why dost thou tremble Yea if but a day of Life thou shouldst beg with weeping beyond what thy Doom appoints thou wouldst not gain it Be still then and face the onset of Death high hearted for none upon earth shall win to abide forever No raiment of praise the cloak of old age and weakness none such for the coward who bows like a reed in the tempest The pathway of death is set for all men to travel the crier of Death proclaims through the earth his empire Who dies not when young and sound dies old and weary cut off in his length of days from all love and kindness And what for a man is left of delight of living past use flung away a worthless and worn out chattel IMPLACABILITY By al Fadl ibn al Abbas ibn Utbah From the Hamasah Translation of C J Lyall Sons of our uncle peace Cousins of ours be still drag not to light from its grave the strife that we buried there Hope not for honor from us while ye heap upon us shame or think that we shall forbear from vexing when ye vex us Sons of our uncle peace lay not our rancor raw walk now gently awhile as once ye were wont to go Ay God knows that we we love you not in sooth and that we blame ye not that ye have no love for us Each of us has his ground for the loathing his fellow moves a grace it is from the Lord that we hate ye ye us PARENTAL AFFECTION A poem by Hittan ibn al Mu alla of Tayyi From the Hamasah Translation of C J Lyall Fortune has brought me down her wonted way from stature high and great to low estate Fortune has rent away my plenteous store of all my wealth honor alone is left Fortune has turned my joy to tears how oft did Fortune make me laugh with what she gave But for these girls the kata s downy brood unkindly thrust from door to door as hard Far would I roam and wide to seek my bread in earth that has no lack of breadth and length Nay but our children in our midst what else but our hearts are they walking on the ground If but the breeze blow harsh on one of them mine eye says no to slumber all night long A TRIBESMAN S VALOR Poem by Sa d son of Malik of the Kais Tribe Translation of C J Lyall How evil a thing is war that bows men to shameful rest War burns away in her blaze all glory and boasting of men Naught stands but the valiant heart to face pain the hard hoofed steed The ring mail set close and firm the nail crowned helms and the spears And onset again after rout when men shrink from the serried array Then then fall away all the vile the hirelings and shame is strong War girds up her skirts before them and evil unmixed is bare For their hearts were for maidens veiled not for driving the gathered spoil Yea evil the heirs we leave sons of Yakshar and al Laksh But let flee her fires who will no flinching for me son of Kais O children of Kais stand firm before her gain peace or give Who seeks flight before her fear his Doom stands and bars the road Away Death allows no quitting of place and brands are bare What is life for us when the uplands and valleys are ours no more Ah where are the mighty now the spears and generous hands FROM THE QU RAN Translation of George Sale CHAPTER XXXV INTITLED THE CREATOR REVEALED AT MECCA In the name of the most merciful GOD Praise be unto GOD the creator of heaven and earth who maketh the angels his messengers furnished with two and three and four pair of wings GOD maketh what addition he pleaseth unto his creatures for GOD is almighty The mercy which GOD shall freely bestow on mankind there is none who can withhold and what he shall withhold there is none who can bestow besides him and he is the mighty the wise O men remember the favor of GOD towards you is there any creator besides GOD who provideth food for you from heaven and earth There is no GOD but he how therefore are ye turned aside from acknowledging his unity If they accuse thee of imposture apostles before thee have also been accused of imposture and unto GOD shall all things return O men verily the promise of GOD is true let not therefore the present life deceive you neither let the deceiver deceive you concerning GOD for Satan is an enemy unto you wherefore hold him for an enemy he only inviteth his confederates to be the inhabitants of hell For those who believe not there is prepared a severe torment but for those who shall believe and do that which is right is prepared mercy and a great reward Shall he therefore for whom his evil work hath been prepared and who imagineth it to be good be as he who is rightly disposed and discerneth the truth Verily GOD will cause to err whom he pleaseth and will direct whom he pleaseth Let not thy soul therefore be spent in sighs for their sakes on account of their obstinacy for GOD well knoweth that which they do It is God who sendeth the winds and raiseth a cloud and we drive the same unto a dead country and thereby quicken the earth after it hath been dead so shall the resurrection be Whoever desireth excellence unto GOD doth all excellence belong unto him ascendeth the good speech and the righteous work will he exalt But as for them who devise wicked plots they shall suffer a severe punishment and the device of those men shall be rendered vain GOD created you first of the dust and afterwards of seed and he hath made you man and wife No female conceiveth or bringeth forth but with his knowledge Nor is any thing added unto the age of him whose life is prolonged neither is any thing diminished from his age but the same is written in the book of God s decrees Verily this is easy with GOD The two seas are not to be held in comparison this is fresh and sweet pleasant to drink but that is salt and bitter yet out of each of them ye eat fish and take ornaments for you to wear Thou seest the ships also ploughing the waves thereof that ye may seek to enrich yourselves by commerce of the abundance of God peradventure ye will be thankful He causeth the night to succeed the day and he causeth the day to succeed the night and he obligeth the sun and the moon to perform their services each of them runneth an appointed course This is GOD your LORD his is the kingdom But the idols which ye invoke besides him have not the power even over the skin of a date stone if ye invoke them they will not hear your calling and although they should hear yet they would not answer you On the day of resurrection they shall disclaim your having associated them with God and none shall declare unto thee the truth like one who is well acquainted therewith O men ye have need of GOD but GOD is self sufficient and to be praised If he pleaseth he can take you away and produce a new creature in your stead neither will this be difficult with GOD A burdened soul shall not bear the burden of another and if a heavy burdened soul call on another to bear part of its burden no part thereof shall be borne by the person who shall be called on although he be ever so nearly related Thou shalt admonish those who fear their LORD in secret and are constant at prayer and whoever cleanseth himself from the guilt of disobedience cleanseth himself to the advantage of his own soul for all shall be assembled before GOD at the last day The blind and the seeing shall not be held equal neither darkness and light nor the cool shade and the scorching wind neither shall the living and the dead be held equal GOD shall cause him to hear whom he pleaseth but thou shalt not make those to hear who are in their graves Thou art no other than a preacher verily we have sent thee with truth a bearer of good tidings and a denouncer of threats There hath been no nation but a preacher hath in past times been conversant among them if they charge thee with imposture they who were before them likewise charged their apostles with imposture Their apostles came unto them with evident miracles and with divine writings and with the Enlightening Book afterwards I chastised those who were unbelievers and how severe was my vengeance Dost thou not see that GOD sendeth down rain from heaven and that we thereby produce fruits of various colors In the mountains also there are some tracts white and red of various colors and others are of a deep black and of men and beasts and cattle there are whose colors are in like manner various Such only of his servants fear GOD as are endued with understanding verily GOD is mighty and ready to forgive Verily they who read the book of GOD and are constant at prayer and give alms out of what we have bestowed on them both in secret and openly hope for a merchandise which shall not perish that God may fully pay them their wages and make them a superabundant addition of his liberality for he is ready to forgive the faults of his servants and to requite their endeavors That which we have revealed unto thee of the book of the Koran is the truth confirming the scriptures which were revealed before it for GOD knoweth and regardeth his servants And we have given the book of the Koran in heritage unto such of our servants as we have chosen of them there is one who injureth his own soul and there is another of them who keepeth the middle way and there is another of them who outstrippeth others in good works by the permission of GOD This is the great excellence They shall be introduced into gardens of perpetual abode they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls and their clothing therein shall be of silk and they shall say Praise be unto GOD who hath taken away sorrow from us verily our LORD is ready to forgive the sinners and to reward the obedient who hath caused us to take up our rest in a dwelling of eternal stability through his bounty wherein no labor shall touch us neither shall any weariness affect us But for the unbelievers is prepared the fire of hell it shall not be decreed them to die a second time neither shall any part of the punishment thereof be made lighter unto them Thus shall every infidel be rewarded And they shall cry out aloud in hell saying LORD take us hence and we will work righteousness and not what we have formerly wrought But it shall be answered them Did we not grant you lives of length sufficient that whoever would be warned might be warned therein and did not the preacher come unto you Taste therefore the pains of hell And the unjust shall have no protector Verily GOD knoweth the secrets both of heaven and earth for he knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men It is he who hath made you to succeed in the earth Whoever shall disbelieve on him be his unbelief and their unbelief shall only gain the unbelievers greater indignation in the sight of their LORD and their unbelief shall only increase the perdition of the unbelievers Say what think ye of your deities which ye invoke besides GOD Show me what part of the earth they have created Or had they any share in the creation of the heavens Have we given unto the idolaters any book of revelations so that they may rely on any proof therefrom to authorize their practice Nay but the ungodly make unto one another only deceitful promises Verily GOD sustaineth the heavens and the earth lest they fail and if they should fail none could support the same besides him he is gracious and merciful The Koreish swore by GOD with a most solemn oath that if a preacher had come unto them they would surely have been more willingly directed than any nation but now a preacher is come unto them it hath only increased in them their aversion from the truth their arrogance in the earth and their contriving of evil but the contrivance of evil shall only encompass the authors thereof Do they expect any other than the punishment awarded against the unbelievers of former times For thou shalt not find any change in the ordinance of GOD neither shalt thou find any variation in the ordinance of GOD Have they not gone through the earth and seen what hath been the end of those who were before them although they were more mighty in strength than they GOD is not to be frustrated by anything either in heaven or on earth for he is wise and powerful If GOD should punish men according to what they deserve he would not leave on the back of the earth so much as a beast but he respiteth them to a determined time and when their time shall come verily GOD will regard his servants CHAPTER LV INTITLED THE MERCIFUL REVEALED AT MECCA In the name of the most merciful GOD The Merciful hath taught his servant the Koran He created man he hath taught him distinct speech The sun and the moon run their courses according to a certain rule and the vegetables which creep on the ground and the trees submit to his disposition He also raised the heaven and he appointed the balance that ye should not transgress in respect to the balance wherefore observe a just weight and diminish not the balance And the earth hath he prepared for living creatures therein are various fruits and palm trees bearing sheaths of flowers and grain having chaff and leaves Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny He created man of dried clay like an earthen vessel but he created the genii of fire clear from smoke Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny He is the LORD of the east and the LORD of the west Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny He hath let loose the two seas that they meet each another between them is placed a bar which they cannot pass Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny From them are taken forth unions and lesser pearls Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny His also are the ships carrying their sails aloft in the sea like mountains Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny Every creature which liveth on the earth is subject to decay but the glorious and honorable countenance of thy LORD shall remain for ever Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny Unto him do all creatures which are in heaven and earth make petition every day is he employed in some new work Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny We will surely attend to judge you O men and genii at the last day Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny O ye collective body of genii and men if ye be able to pass out of the confines of heaven and earth pass forth ye shall not pass forth but by absolute power Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny A flame of fire without smoke and a smoke without flame shall be sent down upon you and ye shall not be able to defend yourselves therefrom Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny And when the heaven shall be rent in sunder and shall become red as a rose and shall melt like ointment Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny On that day neither man nor genius shall be asked concerning his sin Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny The wicked shall be known by their marks and they shall be taken by the forelocks and the feet and shall be cast into hell Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny This is hell which the wicked deny as a falsehood they shall pass to and fro between the same and hot boiling water Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny But for him who dreadeth the tribunal of his LORD are prepared two gardens Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny In each of them shall be two fountains flowing Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny In each of them shall there be of every fruit two kinds Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny They shall repose on couches the linings whereof shall be of thick silk interwoven with gold and the fruit of the two gardens shall be near at hand to gather Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny Therein shall receive them beauteous damsels refraining their eyes from beholding any besides their spouses whom no man shall have deflowered before them neither any Jinn Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny Having complexions like rubies and pearls Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny Shall the reward of good works be any other good Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny And besides these there shall be two other gardens Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny Of a dark green Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny In each of them shall be two fountains pouring forth plenty of water Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny In each of them shall be fruits and palm trees and pomegranates Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny Therein shall be agreeable and beauteous damsels Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny Whom no man shall have deflowered before their destined spouses nor any Jinn Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny Therein shall they delight themselves lying on green cushions and beautiful carpets Which therefore of your LORD S benefits will ye ungratefully deny Blessed be the name of thy LORD possessed of glory and honor CHAPTER LXXXIV INTITLED THE RENDING IN SUNDER REVEALED AT MECCA In the name of the most merciful GOD When the heaven shall be rent in sunder and shall obey its LORD and shall be capable thereof and when the earth shall be stretched out and shall cast forth that which is therein and shall remain empty and shall obey its LORD and shall be capable thereof O man verily laboring thou laborest to meet thy LORD and thou shalt meet him And he who shall have his book given into his right hand shall be called to an easy account and shall turn unto his family with joy but he who shall have his book given him behind his back shall invoke destruction to fall upon him and he shall be sent into hell to be burned because he rejoiced insolently amidst his family on earth Verily he thought he should never return unto God yea verily but his LORD beheld him Wherefore I swear by the redness of the sky after sunset and by the night and the animals which it driveth together and by the moon when she is in the full ye shall surely be transferred successively from state to state What aileth them therefore that they believe not the resurrection and that when the Koran is read unto them they worship not Yea the unbelievers accuse the same of imposture but GOD well knoweth the malice which they keep hidden in their breasts Wherefore denounce unto them a grievous punishment except those who believe and do good works for them is prepared a never failing reward THE PRAYER OF AL HARIRI From the Makamat of al Hariri of Basra Translation of Theodore Preston We praise thee O God For whatever perspicuity of language thou hast taught us And whatever eloquence thou hast inspired us with As we praise thee For the bounty which thou hast diffused And the mercy which thou hast spread abroad And we pray thee to guard us From extravagant expressions and frivolous superfluities As we pray Thee to guard us From the shame of incapacity and the disgrace of hesitation And we entreat thee to exempt us from temptation By the flattery of the admirer or connivance of the indulgent As we entreat thee to exempt us from exposure 
5649-40561-0000	train-other-500	To the slight of the detractor or aspersion of the defamer And we ask thy forgiveness Should our frailties betray us into ambiguities As we ask thy forgiveness Should our steps advance to the verge of improprieties
none	none	 And we beg thee freely to bestow Propitious succor to lead us aright And a heart turning in unison with truth And a language adorned with veracity And style supported by conclusiveness And accuracy that may exclude incorrectness And firmness of purpose that may overcome caprice 
5649-40561-0001	train-other-500	And sagacity whereby we may attain discrimination That thou wilt aid us by thy guidance unto right conceptions And enable us with thy help to express them with clearness And thou wilt guard us from error in narration
5649-40561-0002	train-other-500	And keep us from folly even in pleasantry So that we may be safe from the censure of sarcastic tongues And secure from the fatal effects of false ornament And may not resort to any improper source
5649-40561-0003	train-other-500	And occupy no position that would entail regret Nor be assailed by any ill consequences or blame Nor be constrained to apology for inconsideration O God fulfill for us this our desire
5649-40561-0004	train-other-500	And put us in possession of this our earnest wish And exclude us not from thy ample shade Nor leave us to become the prey of the devourer For we stretch to thee the hand of entreaty And profess entire submission to thee
none	none	 and contrition of spirit And seek with humble supplication and appliances of hope The descent of thy vast grace and comprehensive bounty THE WORDS OF HARETH IBN HAMMAM From the Makamat of al Hariri of Barra Translation of Theodore Preston On a night whose aspect displayed both light and shade And whose moon was like a magic circlet of silver I was engaged in evening conversation at Koufa With companions who had been nourished on the milk of eloquence 
5649-40561-0005	train-other-500	So the charms of conversation fascinated us While wakefulness still prevailed among us Until the moon had at length disappeared in the West But when the gloom of night had thus drawn its curtain And nothing but slumber remained abroad
5649-40561-0006	train-other-500	We heard from the door the low call of a benighted traveler And then followed the knock of one seeking admission And we answered
none	none	 Who comes here this darksome night 
5649-40561-0007	train-other-500	And the stranger replied Listen ye who here are dwelling May you so be kept from ill So may mischief ne er befall you Long as life your breast shall fill Gloom of dismal night and dreary Drives a wretch to seek your door
5649-40561-0008	train-other-500	Whose disheveled hoary tresses All with dust are sprinkled o er Who though destitute and lonely Far has roamed on hill and dale
none	none	 Till his form became thus crooked And his cheek thus deadly pale Who though faint as slender crescent Ventures here for aid to sue Hospitable meal and shelter Claiming first of all from you Welcome then to food and dwelling One so worthy both to share Sure to prove content and thankful Sure to laud your friendly care Fascinated then by the sweetness of his language and delivery And readily inferring what this prelude betokened 
5649-40561-0009	train-other-500	We hasted to open the door and received him with welcome Saying to the servant
none	none	 Hie Hie 
5649-40561-0010	train-other-500	Bring whatever is ready But the stranger said By Him who brought me to your abode I will not taste of your hospitality unless you pledge to me That you will not permit me to be an incumbrance to you
5649-40561-0011	train-other-500	Nor impose on yourselves necessity of eating on my account Now it was just as if he had been informed of our wishes Or had shot from the same bow as our sentiments So we gratified him by acceding to the condition
5649-40561-0012	train-other-500	And highly commended him for his accommodating disposition But when the servant had produced what was ready And the candle was lighted up in the midst of us I regarded him attentively and lo it was Abu Zeid
5649-40561-0013	train-other-500	Whereupon I addressed my companions in these words May you have joy of the guest who has repaired to you For though the moon of the heavens has set The full moon of poetry has arisen And though the moon of the eclipse has disappeared
5649-40561-0014	train-other-500	The full moon of eloquence has shone forth So the wine of joy infused itself into them
none	none	 And sleep flew away from the corners of their eyes 
5649-40561-0015	train-other-500	And they rejected the slumber which they had contemplated And began to resume the pleasantry which they had laid aside While Abu Zeid remained intent on the business in hand
none	none	 But as soon as he desired the removal of what was before him 
5649-40561-0016	train-other-500	I said to him Entertain us with one of thy strange anecdotes Or with an account of one of thy wonderful journeys And he said The result of long journeys brought me to this land Myself being in a state of hunger and distress
none	none	 And my wallet light as the heart of the mother of Moses So I arose when dark night had settled on the world Though with weary feet to seek a lodging or obtain a loaf Till being driven on by the instigation of hunger 
5649-40561-0017	train-other-500	And by fate so justly called the parent of adventures I stood at the door of a house and improvised these words Inmates of this abode all hail all hail
5649-40561-0018	train-other-500	Long may you live in plenty s verdant vale Oh grant your aid to one by toil opprest Way worn benighted destitute distrest Whose tortured entrails only hunger hold
5649-40561-0019	train-other-500	For since he tasted food two days are told A wretch who finds not where to lay his head Though brooding night her weary wing hath spread But roams in anxious hope a friend to meet
5649-40561-0020	train-other-500	Whose bounty like a spring of water sweet May heal his woes a friend who straight will say Come in Tis time thy staff aside to lay But there came out to me a boy in a short tunic who said
5649-40561-0021	train-other-500	By Him who hospitable rites ordained And first of all and best those rites maintained I swear that friendly converse and a home Is all we have for those who nightly roam And I replied
5649-40561-0022	train-other-500	What can I do with an empty house And a host who is himself thus utterly destitute But what is thy name boy for thy intelligence charms me He replied
none	none	 My name is Zeid 
5649-40561-0023	train-other-500	and I was reared at Faid And my mother Barrah who is such as her name implies Told me she married one of the nobles of Serong and Ghassan Who deserted her stealthily and there was an end of him
5649-40561-0024	train-other-500	Now I knew by these distinct signs that he was my child
none	none	 But my poverty deterred me from discovering myself to him Then we asked if he wished to take his son to live with him And he replied If only my purse were heavy enough It would be easy for me to undertake the charge of him So we severally undertook to contribute a portion of it 
5649-40561-0025	train-other-500	Whereupon he returned thanks for this our bounty And was so profusely lavish in his acknowledgments That we thought his expression of gratitude excessive
none	none	 And as soon as he had collected the coin into his scrip He looked at me as the deceiver looks at the deceived And laughed heartily and then indited these lines O thou who deceived By a tale hast believed A mirage to be truly a lake 
5649-40561-0026	train-other-500	Though I ne er had expected My fraud undetected Or doubtful my meaning to make
none	none	 I confess that I lied When I said that my bride And my first born were Barrah and Zeid But guile is my part And deception my art 
5649-40561-0027	train-other-500	And by these are my gains ever made Such schemes I devise That the cunning and wise Never practiced the like or conceived Nor Asmai nor Komait Any wonders relate Like those that my wiles have achieved
none	none	 But if these I disdain I abandon my gain And by fortune at once am refused Then pardon their use And accept my excuse Nor of guilt let my guile be accused Then he took leave of me and went away from me Leaving in my heart the embers of lasting regret THE CALIPH OMAR BIN ABD AL AZIZ AND THE POETS A Semi Poetical Tale Translation of Sir Richard Burton in Supplemental Nights to the Book of The Thousand Nights and A Night It is said that when the Caliphate devolved on Omar bin Abd al Aziz of whom Allah accept the poets resorted to him as they had been used to resort to the Caliphs before him and abode at his door days and days but he suffered them not to enter till there came to him Adi bin Artah who stood high in esteem with him Jarir another poet accosted him and begged him to crave admission for them to the presence so Adi answered Tis well and going in to Omar said to him The poets are at thy door and have been there days and days yet hast thou not given them leave to enter albeit their sayings abide and their arrows from the mark never fly wide Quoth Omar What have I to do with the poets And quoth Adi O Commander of the Faithful the Prophet Abhak was praised by a poet and gave him largesse and in him is an exemplar to every Moslem Quoth Omar And who praised him And quoth Adi Abbas bin Mirdas praised him and he clad him with a suit and said O Generosity Cut off from me his tongue Asked the Caliph Dost thou remember what he said And Adi answered Yes Rejoined Omar Then repeat it so Adi repeated I saw thee O thou best of the human race Bring out a book which brought to graceless grace Thou showedst righteous road to men astray From right when darkest wrong had ta en its place Thou with Islam didst light the gloomiest way Quenching with proof live coals of frowardness I own for Prophet my Mohammed s self and men s award upon his word we base Thou madest straight the path that crooked ran Where in old days foul growth o ergrew its face Exalt be thou in Joy s empyrean And Allah s glory ever grow apace And indeed continued Adi this Elegy on the Prophet Abhak is well known and to comment on it would be tedious Quoth Omar Who of the poets is at the door And quoth Adi Among them is Omar ibn Rabi ah the Korashi whereupon the Caliph cried May Allah show him no favor neither quicken him Was it not he who spoke impiously in praising his love Could I in my clay bed the grave with Ialma repose There to me were better than Heaven or Hell Had he not continued the Caliph been the enemy of Allah he had wished for her in this world so that he might after repent and return to righteous dealing By Allah he shall not come in to me Who is at the door other than he Quoth Adi Jamil bin Ma mar al Uzri is at the door And quoth Omar Tis he who saith in one of his love Elegies Would Heaven conjoint we lived and if I die Death only grant me a grave within her grave For I d no longer deign to live my life If told Upon her head is laid the pave Quoth Omar Away with him from me Who is at the door And quoth Adi Kutthayir Azzah whereupon Omar cried Tis he who saith in one of his impious Odes Some talk of faith and creed and nothing else And wait for pains of Hell in prayer seat But did they hear what I from Azzah heard They d make prostration fearful at her feet Leave the mention of him Who is at the door Quoth Adi Al Ahwas al Ansari Cried Omar Allah Almighty put him away and estrange him from His mercy Is it not he who said berhyming on a Medinite s slave girl so that she might outlive her master Allah be judge betwixt me and her lord Whoever flies with her and I pursue He shall not come in to me Who is at the door other than he Adi replied Hammam bin Ghalib al Farazdak And Omar said Tis he who glories in wickedness He shall not come in to me Who is at the door other than he Adi replied Al Akhtal al Taghlibi And Omar said He is the godless miscreant who saith in his singing Ramazan I ne er fasted in lifetime nay I ate flesh in public at undurn day Nor chid I the fair save in word of love Nor seek Meccah s plain in salvation way Nor stand I praying like rest who cry Hie salvation wards at the dawn s first ray By Allah he treadeth no carpet of mine Who is at the door other than he Said Adi Jarir Ibn al Khatafah And Omar cried Tis he who saith But for ill spying glances had our eyes espied Eyes of the antelope and ringlets of the Reems A Huntress of the eyes by night time came and I cried Turn in peace No time for visit this meseems But if it must be and no help admit Jarir So Adi went forth and admitted Jarir who entered saying Yea He who sent Mohammed unto men A just successor of Islam assigned His ruth and his justice all mankind embrace To daunt the bad and stablish well designed Verily now I look to present good for man hath ever transient weal in mind Quoth Omar O Jarir keep the fear of Allah before thine eyes and say naught save the sooth And Jarir recited these couplets How many widows loose the hair in far Yamamah land How many an orphan there abides feeble of voice and eye Since faredst thou who wast to them instead of father lost when they like nestled fledglings were sans power to creep or fly And now we hope since broke the clouds their word and troth with us Hope from the Caliph s grace to gain a rain that ne er shall dry When the Caliph heard this he said By Allah O Jarir Omar possesseth but an hundred dirhams Ho boy do thou give them to him Moreover he gifted Jarir with the ornaments of his sword and Jarir went forth to the other poets who asked him What is behind thee What is thy news and he answered A man who giveth to the poor and who denieth the poets and with him I am well pleased DOMINIQUE FRANCOIS ARAGO 
5649-40563-0001	train-other-500	seventeen eighty six eighteen fifty three BY EDWARD
none	none	 S HOLDEN Dominique Francois Arago was born February twenty sixth seventeen eighty six near Perpignan in the Eastern Pyrenees where his father held the position of Treasurer of the Mint He entered the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris after a brilliant examination and held the first places throughout the course In eighteen oh six he was sent to Valencia in Spain and to the neighboring island of Iviza to make the astronomical observations for prolonging the arc of the meridian from Dunkirk southward in order to supply the basis for the metric system Illustration D FR ARAGO Here begin his extraordinary adventures which are told with inimitable spirit and vigor in his Autobiography Arago s work required him to occupy stations on the summits of the highest peaks in the mountains of southeastern Spain The peasants were densely ignorant and hostile to all foreigners so that an escort of troops was required in many of his journeys At some stations he made friends of the bandits of the neighborhood and carried on his observations under their protection as it were In eighteen oh seven the tribunal of the Inquisition existed in Valencia and Arago was witness to the trial and punishment of a pretended sorceress and this as he says in one of the principal towns of Spain the seat of a celebrated university 
5649-40563-0003	train-other-500	Yet the worst criminals lived unmolested in the cathedrals for the right of asylum was still in force His geodetic observations were mysteries to the inhabitants
none	none	 and his signals on the mountain top were believed to be part of the work of a French spy Just at this time hostilities broke out between France and Spain and the astronomer was obliged to flee disguised as a Majorcan peasant carrying his precious papers with him His knowledge of the Majorcan language saved him and he reached a Spanish prison with only a slight wound from a dagger It is the first recorded instance he says of a fugitive flying to a dungeon for safety 
5649-40563-0004	train-other-500	In this prison under the care of Spanish officers Arago found sufficient occupation in calculating observations which he had made in reading the accounts in the Spanish journals of his own execution at Valencia
5649-40563-0005	train-other-500	and in listening to rumors that it was proposed by a Spanish monk to do away with the French prisoner by poisoning his food
none	none	 The Spanish officer in charge of the prisoners was induced to connive at the escape of Arago and M Berthemie an aide de camp of Napoleon and on the twenty eighth of July eighteen oh eight they stole away from the coast of Spain in a small boat with three sailors and arrived at Algiers on the threed of August Here the French consul procured them two false passports which transformed the Frenchmen into strolling merchants from Schwekat and Leoben They boarded an Algerian vessel and set off 
5649-40563-0007	train-other-500	Let Arago describe the crew and cargo The vessel belonged to the Emir of Seca The commander was a Greek captain named Spiro Calligero
none	none	 Among the passengers were five members of the family 
5649-40563-0008	train-other-500	superseded by the Bakri as kings of the Jews two Maroccan ostrich feather merchants Captain Krog from Bergen in Norway
none	none	 two lions sent by the Dey of Algiers as presents to the Emperor Napoleon 
5649-40563-0009	train-other-500	and a great number of monkeys
none	none	 As they entered the Golfe du Lion their ship was captured by a Spanish corsair and taken to Rosas 
5649-40563-0010	train-other-500	Worst of all a former Spanish servant of Arago s Pablo was a sailor in the corsair s crew At Rosas the prisoners were brought before an officer for interrogation It was now Arago s turn The officer begins
5649-40563-0011	train-other-500	Who are you A poor traveling merchant From whence do you come From a country where you certainly have never been Well from what country
5649-40563-0012	train-other-500	I feared to answer for the passports steeped in vinegar to prevent infection were in the officer s hands and I had entirely forgotten whether I was from Schwekat or from Leoben
none	none	 Finally I answered at a chance 
5649-40563-0013	train-other-500	I am from Schwekat fortunately this answer agreed with the passport You re from Schwekat about as much as I am said the officer you re a Spaniard and a Spaniard from Valencia to boot as I can tell by your accent
5649-40563-0014	train-other-500	Sir you are inclined to punish me simply because I have by nature the gift of languages I readily learn the dialects of the various countries where I carry on my trade For example I know the dialect of Iviza
5649-40563-0015	train-other-500	Well I will take you at your word Here is a soldier who comes from Iviza Talk to him Very well I will even sing the goat song
none	none	 The verses of this song if one may call them verses are separated by the imitated bleatings of the goat I began at once with an audacity which even now astonishes me to intone the song which all the shepherds in Iviza sing Ah graciada Senora Una canzo bouil canta Be be be be No sera gaiva pulida Nose si vos agradara Be be be be Upon which my Ivizan avouches in tears that I am certainly from Iviza The song had affected him as a Switzer is affected by the Ranz des Vaches I then said to the officer that if he would bring to me a person who could speak French he would find the same embarrassment in this case also An emigre of the Bourbon regiment comes forward for the new experiment and after a few phrases 
5649-40563-0016	train-other-500	affirms without hesitation that I am surely a Frenchman The officer begins to be impatient Have done with these trials they prove nothing
none	none	 I require you to tell me who you are 
5649-40563-0017	train-other-500	My foremost desire is to find an answer which will satisfy you I am the son of the innkeeper at Mataro I know that man you are not his son You are right
5649-40563-0018	train-other-500	I told you that I should change my answers till I found one to suit you I am a marionette player from Lerida A huge laugh from the crowd which had listened to the interrogatory put an end to the questioning
none	none	 Finally it was necessary for Arago to declare outright that he was French and to prove it by his old servant Pablo To supply his immediate wants he sold his watch and by a series of misadventures 
5649-40563-0019	train-other-500	this watch subsequently fell into the hands of his family and he was mourned in France as dead
none	none	 After months of captivity the vessel was released and the prisoner set out for Marseilles 
5649-40563-0020	train-other-500	A fearful tempest drove them to the harbor of Bougie an African port a hundred miles east of Algiers Thence they made the perilous journey by land to their place of starting
none	none	 and finally reached Marseilles eleven months after their voyage began 
5649-40563-0021	train-other-500	Eleven months to make a journey of four days The intelligence of the safe arrival after so many perils of the young astronomer with his packet of precious observations soon reached Paris He was welcomed with effusion
5649-40563-0022	train-other-500	Soon afterward at the age of twenty three years he was elected a member of the section of Astronomy of the Academy of Sciences and from this time forth he led the peaceful life of a savant

none	none	 Scientific men are usually too much engrossed in advancing science to spare time for expounding it to popular audiences The talent for such exposition is itself a special one Arago possessed it to the full 
5649-40563-0028	train-other-500	and his own original contributions to astronomy and physics enabled him to speak as an expert not merely as an expositor The extracts are from his admirable estimate of Laplace which he prepared in connection with the proposal
5649-40563-0029	train-other-500	before him and other members of a State Committee to publish a new and authoritative edition of the great astronomer s works The translation is mainly that of the Biographies of Distinguished Men cited above
5649-40563-0030	train-other-500	and much of the felicity of style is necessarily lost in translation but the substance of solid and lucid exposition from a master s hand remains Arago was a Deputy in eighteen thirty

farmers on the twenty eighth of March seventeen forty nine he died on the fifth of March eighteen twenty seven The first and second volumes of the Mecanique Celeste Mechanism of the Heavens were published in seventeen ninety nine the third volume appeared in eighteen oh two the fourth in eighteen oh five part of the fifth volume was published in eighteen twenty three further books in eighteen twenty four and the remainder in eighteen twenty five The Theorie des Probabilites was published in eighteen twelve We shall now present the history of the principal astronomical discoveries contained in these immortal works Astronomy is the science of which the human mind may justly feel proudest It owes this pre eminence to the elevated nature of its object to the enormous scale of its operations to the certainty the utility and the stupendousness of its results From the very beginnings of civilization the study of the heavenly bodies and their movements has attracted the attention of governments and peoples The greatest captains statesmen philosophers and orators of Greece and Rome found it a subject of delight Yet astronomy worthy of the name is a modern science it dates from the sixteenth century only Three great three brilliant phases have marked its progress In fifteen forty three the bold and firm hand of Copernicus overthrew the greater part of the venerable scaffolding which had propped the illusions and the pride of many generations The earth ceased to be the centre the pivot of celestial movements Henceforward it ranged itself modestly among the other planets its relative importance as one member of the solar system reduced almost to that of a grain of sand Twenty eight years had elapsed from the day when the Canon of Thorn expired while holding in his trembling hands the first copy of the work which was to glorify the name of Poland when Wuertemberg witnessed the birth of a man who was destined to achieve a revolution in science not less fertile in consequences and still more difficult to accomplish This man was Kepler Endowed with two qualities which seem incompatible a volcanic imagination and a dogged pertinacity which the most tedious calculations could not tire Kepler conjectured that celestial movements must be connected with each other by simple laws or to use his own expression by harmonic laws These laws he undertook to discover A thousand fruitless attempts the errors of calculation inseparable from a colossal undertaking did not hinder his resolute advance toward the goal his imagination descried Twenty two years he devoted to it and still he was not weary What are twenty two years of labor to him who is about to become the lawgiver of worlds whose name is to be ineffaceably inscribed on the frontispiece of an immortal code who can exclaim in dithyrambic language The die is cast I have written my book it will be read either in the present age or by posterity it matters not which it may well await a reader since God has waited six thousand years for an interpreter of his works These celebrated laws known in astronomy as Kepler s laws are three in number The first law is that the planets describe ellipses around the sun which is placed in their common focus the second that a line joining a planet and the sun sweeps over equal areas in equal times the third that the squares of the times of revolution of the planets about the sun are proportional to the cubes of their mean distances from that body The first two laws were discovered by Kepler in the course of a laborious examination of the theory of the planet Mars A full account of this inquiry is contained in his famous work De Stella Martis Of the Planet Mars published in sixteen oh nine The discovery of the third law was announced to the world in his treatise on Harmonics sixteen twenty eight To seek a physical cause adequate to retain the planets in their closed orbits to make the stability of the universe depend on mechanical forces and not on solid supports like the crystalline spheres imagined by our ancestors to extend to the heavenly bodies in their courses the laws of earthly mechanics such were the problems which remained for solution after Kepler s discoveries had been announced Traces of these great problems may be clearly perceived here and there among ancient and modern writers from Lucretius and Plutarch down to Kepler Bouillaud and Borelli It is to Newton however that we must award the merit of their solution This great man like several of his predecessors imagined the celestial bodies to have a tendency to approach each other in virtue of some attractive force and from the laws of Kepler he deduced the mathematical characteristics of this force He extended it to all the material molecules of the solar system and developed his brilliant discovery in a work which even at the present day is regarded as the supremest product of the human intellect The contributions of France to these revolutions in astronomical science consisted in seventeen forty in the determination by experiment of the spheroidal figure of the earth and in the discovery of the local variations of gravity upon the surface of our planet These were two great results but whenever France is not first in science she has lost her place This rank lost for a moment was brilliantly regained by the labors of four geometers When Newton giving to his discoveries a generality which the laws of Kepler did not suggest imagined that the different planets were not only attracted by the sun but that they also attracted each other he introduced into the heavens a cause of universal perturbation Astronomers then saw at a glance that in no part of the universe would the Keplerian laws suffice for the exact representation of the phenomena of motion that the simple regular movements with which the imaginations of the ancients were pleased to endow the heavenly bodies must experience numerous considerable perpetually changing perturbations To discover a few of these perturbations and to assign their nature and in a few rare cases their numerical value was the object which Newton proposed to himself in writing his famous book the Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy Notwithstanding the incomparable sagacity of its author the Principia contained merely a rough outline of planetary perturbations though not through any lack of ardor or perseverance The efforts of the great philosopher were always superhuman and the questions which he did not solve were simply incapable of solution in his time Five geometers Clairaut Euler D Alembert Lagrange and Laplace shared between them the world whose existence Newton had disclosed They explored it in all directions penetrated into regions hitherto inaccessible and pointed out phenomena hitherto undetected Finally and it is this which constitutes their imperishable glory they brought under the domain of a single principle a single law everything that seemed most occult and mysterious in the celestial movements Geometry had thus the hardihood to dispose of the future while the centuries as they unroll scrupulously ratify the decisions of science If Newton gave a complete solution of celestial movements where but two bodies attract each other he did not even attempt the infinitely more difficult problem of three The problem of three bodies this is the name by which it has become celebrated the problem of determining the movement of a body subjected to the attractive influence of two others was solved for the first time by our countryman Clairaut Though he enumerated the various forces which must result from the mutual action of the planets and satellites of our system even the great Newton did not venture to investigate the general nature of their effects In the midst of the labyrinth formed by increments and diminutions of velocity variations in the forms of orbits changes in distances and inclinations which these forces must evidently produce the most learned geometer would fail to discover a trustworthy guide Forces so numerous so variable in direction so different in intensity seemed to be incapable of maintaining a condition of equilibrium except by a sort of miracle Newton even suggested that the planetary system did not contain within itself the elements of indefinite stability He was of opinion that a powerful hand must intervene from time to time to repair the derangements occasioned by the mutual action of the various bodies Euler better instructed than Newton in a knowledge of these perturbations also refused to admit that the solar system was constituted so as to endure forever Never did a greater philosophical question offer itself to the inquiries of mankind Laplace attacked it with boldness perseverance and success The profound and long continued researches of the illustrious geometer completely established the perpetual variability of the planetary ellipses He demonstrated that the extremities of their major axes make the circuit of the heavens that independent of oscillation the planes of their orbits undergo displacements by which their intersections with the plane of the terrestrial orbit are each year directed toward different stars But in the midst of this apparant chaos there is one element which remains constant or is merely subject to small and periodic changes namely the major axis of each orbit and consequently the time of revolution of each planet This is the element which ought to have varied most on the principles held by Newton and Euler Gravitation then suffices to preserve the stability of the solar system It maintains the forms and inclinations of the orbits in an average position subject to slight oscillations only variety does not entail disorder the universe offers an example of harmonious relations of a state of perfection which Newton himself doubted This condition of harmony depends on circumstances disclosed to Laplace by analysis circumstances which on the surface do not seem capable of exercising so great an influence If instead of planets all revolving in the same direction in orbits but slightly eccentric and in planes inclined at but small angles toward each other we should substitute different conditions the stability of the universe would be jeopardized and a frightful chaos would pretty certainly result The discovery of the actual conditions excluded the idea at least so far as the solar system was concerned that the Newtonian attraction might be a cause of disorder But might not other forces combined with the attraction of gravitation produce gradually increasing perturbations such as Newton and Euler feared Known facts seemed to justify the apprehension A comparison of ancient with modern observations revealed a continual acceleration in the mean motions of the moon and of Jupiter and an equally striking diminution of the mean motion of Saturn These variations led to a very important conclusion In accordance with their presumed cause to say that the velocity of a body increased from century to century was equivalent to asserting that the body continually approached the centre of motion on the other hand when the velocity diminished the body must be receding from the centre Thus by a strange ordering of nature our planetary system seemed destined to lose Saturn its most mysterious ornament to see the planet with its ring and seven satellites plunge gradually into those unknown regions where the eye armed with the most powerful telescope has never penetrated Jupiter on the other hand the planet compared with which the earth is so insignificant appeared to be moving in the opposite direction so that it would ultimately be absorbed into the incandescent matter of the sun Finally it seemed that the moon would one day precipitate itself upon the earth There was nothing doubtful or speculative in these sinister forebodings The precise dates of the approaching catastrophes were alone uncertain It was known however that they were very distant Accordingly neither the learned dissertations of men of science nor the animated descriptions of certain poets produced any impression upon the public mind The members of our scientific societies however believed with regret the approaching destruction of the planetary system The Academy of Sciences called the attention of geometers of all countries to these menacing perturbations Euler and Lagrange descended into the arena Never did their mathematical genius shine with a brighter lustre Still the question remained undecided when from two obscure corners of the theories of analysis Laplace the author of the Mecanique Celeste brought the laws of these great phenomena clearly to light The variations in velocity of Jupiter Saturn and the moon were proved to flow from evident physical causes and to belong in the category of ordinary periodic perturbations depending solely on gravitation These dreaded variations in orbital dimensions resolved themselves into simple oscillations included within narrow limits In a word by the powerful instrumentality of mathematical analysis the physical universe was again established on a demonstrably firm foundation Having demonstrated the smallness of these periodic oscillations Laplace next succeeded in determining the absolute dimensions of the orbits What is the distance of the sun from the earth No scientific question has occupied the attention of mankind in a greater degree Mathematically speaking nothing is more simple it suffices as in ordinary surveying to draw visual lines from the two extremities of a known base line to an inaccessible object the remainder of the process is an elementary calculation Unfortunately in the case of the sun the distance is very great and the base lines which can be measured upon the earth are comparatively very small In such a case the slightest errors in the direction of visual lines exercise an enormous influence upon the results In the beginning of the last century Halley had remarked that certain interpositions of Venus between the earth and the sun or to use the common term the transits of the planet across the sun s disk would furnish at each observing station an indirect means of fixing the position of the visual ray much superior in accuracy to the most perfect direct measures Such was the object of the many scientific expeditions undertaken in seventeen sixty one and seventeen sixty nine years in which the transits of Venus occurred A comparison of observations made in the Southern Hemisphere with those of Europe gave for the distance of the sun the result which has since figured in all treatises on astronomy and navigation No government hesitated to furnish scientific academies with the means however expensive of establishing their observers in the most distant regions We have already remarked that this determination seemed imperiously to demand an extensive base for small bases would have been totally inadequate Well Laplace has solved the problem without a base of any kind whatever he has deduced the distance of the sun from observations of the moon made in one and the same place The sun is with respect to our satellite the moon the cause of perturbations which evidently depend on the distance of the immense luminous globe from the earth Who does not see that these perturbations must diminish if the distance increases and increase if the distance diminishes so that the distance determines the amount of the perturbations Observation assigns the numerical value of these perturbations theory on the other hand unfolds the general mathematical relation which connects them with the solar distance and with other known elements The determination of the mean radius of the terrestrial orbit of the distance of the sun then becomes one of the most simple operations of algebra Such is the happy combination by the aid of which Laplace has solved the great the celebrated problem of parallax It is thus that the illustrious geometer found for the mean distance of the sun from the earth expressed in radii of the terrestrial orbit a value differing but slightly from that which was the fruit of so many troublesome and expensive voyages The movements of the moon proved a fertile mine of research to our great geometer His penetrating intellect discovered in them unknown treasures With an ability and a perseverance equally worthy of admiration he separated these treasures from the coverings which had hitherto concealed them from vulgar eyes For example the earth governs the movements of the moon The earth is flattened in other words its figure is spheroidal A spheroidal body does not attract as does a sphere There should then exist in the movement I had almost said in the countenance of the moon a sort of impress of the spheroidal figure of the earth Such was the idea as it originally occurred to Laplace By means of a minutely careful investigation he discovered in its motion two well defined perturbations each depending on the spheroidal figure of the earth When these were submitted to calculation each led to the same value of the ellipticity It must be recollected that the ellipticity thus derived from the motions of the moon is not the one corresponding to such or such a country to the ellipticity observed in France in England in Italy in Lapland in North America in India or in the region of the Cape of Good Hope for the earth s crust having undergone considerable upheavals at different times and places the primitive regularity of its curvature has been sensibly disturbed thereby The moon and it is this which renders the result of such inestimable value ought to assign and has in reality assigned the general ellipticity of the earth in other words it has indicated a sort of average value of the various determinations obtained at enormous expense and with infinite labor as the result of long voyages undertaken by astronomers of all the countries of Europe Certain remarks of Laplace himself bring into strong relief the profound the unexpected the almost paradoxical character of the methods I have attempted to sketch What are the elements it has been found necessary to confront with each other in order to arrive at results expressed with such extreme precision On the one hand mathematical formulae deduced from the principle of universal gravitation on the other certain irregularities observed in the returns of the moon to the meridian An observing geometer who from his infancy had never quitted his study and who had never viewed the heavens except through a narrow aperture directed north and south to whom nothing had ever been revealed respecting the bodies revolving above his head except that they attract each other according to the Newtonian law of gravitation would still perceive that his narrow abode was situated upon the surface of a spheroidal body whose equatorial axis was greater than its polar by a three hundred and sixth part In his isolated fixed position he could still deduce his true distance from the sun Laplace s improvement of the lunar tables not only promoted maritime intercourse between distant countries but preserved the lives of mariners Thanks to an unparalleled sagacity to a limitless perseverance to an ever youthful and communicable ardor Laplace solved the celebrated problem of the longitude with a precision even greater than the utmost needs of the art of navigation demanded The ship the sport of the winds and tempests no longer fears to lose its way in the immensity of the ocean In every place and at every time the pilot reads in the starry heavens his distance from the meridian of Paris The extreme perfection of these tables of the moon places Laplace in the ranks of the world s benefactors In the beginning of the year sixteen eleven Galileo supposed that he found in the eclipses of Jupiter s satellites a simple and rigorous solution of the famous problem of the longitude and attempts to introduce the new method on board the numerous vessels of Spain and Holland at once began They failed because the necessary observations required powerful telescopes which could not be employed on a tossing ship Even the expectations of the serviceability of Galileo s methods for land calculations proved premature The movements of the satellites of Jupiter are far less simple than the immortal Italian supposed them to be The labors of three more generations of astronomers and mathematicians were needed to determine them and the mathematical genius of Laplace was needed to complete their labors At the present day the nautical ephemerides contain several years in advance the indications of the times of the eclipses and reappearances of Jupiter s satellites Calculation is as precise as direct observation Influenced by an exaggerated deference modesty timidity France in the eighteenth century surrendered to England the exclusive privilege of constructing her astronomical instruments Thus when Herschel was prosecuting his beautiful observations on the other side of the Channel we had not even the means of verifying them Fortunately for the scientific honor of our country mathematical analysis also is a powerful instrument The great Laplace from the retirement of his study foresaw and accurately predicted in advance what the excellent astronomer of Windsor would soon behold with the largest telescopes existing When in sixteen ten Galileo directed toward Saturn a lens of very low power which he had just constructed with his own hands although he perceived that the planet was not a globe he could not ascertain its real form The expression tri corporate by which the illustrious Florentine designated the appearance of the planet even implied a totally erroneous idea of its structure At the present day every one knows that Saturn consists of a globe about nine hundred times greater than the earth and of a ring This ring does not touch the ball of the planet being everywhere removed from it to a distance of twenty thousand English miles Observation indicates the breadth of the ring to be fifty four thousand miles The thickness certainly does not exceed two hundred and fifty miles With the exception of a black streak which divides the ring throughout its whole contour into two parts of unequal breadth and of different brightness this strange colossal bridge without foundations had never offered to the most experienced or skillful observers either spot or protuberance adapted for deciding whether it was immovable or endowed with a motion of rotation Laplace considered it to be very improbable if the ring was stationary that its constituent parts should be capable of resisting by mere cohesion the continual attraction of the planet A movement of rotation occurred to his mind as constituting the principle of stability and he deduced the necessary velocity from this consideration The velocity thus found was exactly equal to that which Herschel subsequently derived from a series of extremely delicate observations The two parts of the ring being at different distances from the planet could not fail to be given different movements of precession by the action of the sun Hence it would seem that the planes of both rings ought in general to be inclined toward each other whereas they appear from observation always to coincide It was necessary then that some physical cause capable of neutralizing the action of the sun should exist In a memoir published in February seventeen eighty nine Laplace found that this cause depended on the ellipticity of Saturn produced by a rapid movement of rotation of the planet a movement whose discovery Herschel announced in November of the same year If we descend from the heavens to the earth the discoveries of Laplace will appear not less worthy of his genius He reduced the phenomena of the tides which an ancient philosopher termed in despair the tomb of human curiosity to an analytical theory in which the physical conditions of the question figure for the first time Consequently to the immense advantage of coast navigation calculators now venture to predict in detail the time and height of the tides several years in advance Between the phenomena of the ebb and flow and the attractive forces of the sun and moon upon the fluid sheet which covers three fourths of the globe an intimate and necessary connection exists a connection from which Laplace deduced the value of the mass of our satellite the moon Yet so late as the year sixteen thirty one the illustrious Galileo as appears from his Dialogues was so far from perceiving the mathematical relations from which Laplace deduced results so beautiful so unequivocal and so useful that he taxed with frivolousness the vague idea which Kepler entertained of attributing to the moon s attraction a certain share in the production of the diurnal and periodical movements of the waters of the ocean Laplace did not confine his genius to the extension and improvement of the mathematical theory of the tide He considered the phenomenon from an entirely new point of view and it was he who first treated of the stability of the ocean He has established its equilibrium but upon the express condition which however has been amply proved to exist that the mean density of the fluid mass is less than the mean density of the earth Everything else remaining the same if we substituted an ocean of quicksilver for the actual ocean this stability would disappear The fluid would frequently overflow its boundaries to ravage continents even to the height of the snowy peaks which lose themselves in the clouds No one was more sagacious than Laplace in discovering intimate relations between phenomena apparently unrelated or more skillful in deducing important conclusions from such unexpected affinities For example toward the close of his days with the aid of certain lunar observations with a stroke of his pen he overthrew the cosmogonic theories of Buffon and Bailly which were so long in favor According to these theories the earth was hastening to a state of congelation which was close at hand Laplace never contented with vague statements sought to determine in numbers the rate of the rapid cooling of our globe which Buffon had so eloquently but so gratuitously announced Nothing could be more simple better connected or more conclusive than the chain of deductions of the celebrated geometer A body diminishes in volume when it cools According to the most elementary principles of mechanics a rotating body which contracts in dimensions must inevitably turn upon its axis with greater and greater rapidity The length of the day has been determined in all ages by the time of the earth s rotation if the earth is cooling the length of the day must be continually shortening Now there exists a means of ascertaining whether the length of the day has undergone any variation this consists in examining for each century the arc of the celestial sphere described by the moon during the interval of time which the astronomers of the existing epoch call a day in other words the time required by the earth to effect a complete rotation on its axis the velocity of the moon being in fact independent of the time of the earth s rotation Let us now following Laplace take from the standard tables the smallest values if you choose of the expansions or contractions which solid bodies experience from changes of temperature let us search the annals of Grecian Arabian and modern astronomy for the purpose of finding in them the angular velocity of the moon and the great geometer will prove by incontrovertible evidence founded upon these data that during a period of two thousand years the mean temperature of the earth has not varied to the extent of the hundredth part of a degree of the centigrade thermometer Eloquence cannot resist such a process of reasoning or withstand the force of such figures Mathematics has ever been the implacable foe of scientific romances The constant object of Laplace was the explanation of the great phenomena of nature according to inflexible principles of mathematical analysis No philosopher no mathematician could have guarded himself more cautiously against a propensity to hasty speculation No person dreaded more the scientific errors which cajole the imagination when it passes the boundary of fact calculation and analogy Once and once only did Laplace launch forward like Kepler like Descartes like Leibnitz like Buffon into the region of conjectures But then his conception was nothing less than a complete cosmogony All the planets revolve around the sun from west to east and in planes only slightly inclined to each other The satellites revolve around their respective primaries in the same direction Both planets and satellites having a rotary motion turn also upon their axes from west to east Finally the rotation of the sun also is directed from west to east Here then is an assemblage of forty three movements all operating alike By the calculus of probabilities the odds are four thousand millions to one that this coincidence in direction is not the effect of accident It was Buffon I think who first attempted to explain this singular feature of our solar system Wishing in the explanation of phenomena to avoid recourse to causes which are not to be found in nature the celebrated academician sought for a physical cause for what is common to the movements of so many bodies differing as they do in magnitude in form and in their distances from the centre of attraction He imagined that he had discovered such a physical cause by making this triple supposition a comet fell obliquely upon the sun it pushed before it a torrent of fluid matter this substance transported to a greater or less distance from the sun according to its density formed by condensation all the known planets The bold hypothesis is subject to insurmountable difficulties I proceed to indicate in a few words the cosmogonic system which Laplace substituted for it According to Laplace the sun was at a remote epoch the central nucleus of an immense nebula which possessed a very high temperature and extended far beyond the region in which Uranus now revolves No planet was then in existence The solar nebula was endowed with a general movement of rotation in the direction west to east As it cooled it could not fail to experience a gradual condensation and in consequence to rotate with greater and greater rapidity If the nebulous matter extended originally in the plane of its equator as far as the limit where the centrifugal force exactly counterbalanced the attraction of the nucleus the molecules situate at this limit ought during the process of condensation to separate from the rest of the atmospheric matter and to form an equatorial zone a ring revolving separately and with its primitive velocity We may conceive that analogous separations were effected in the remoter strata of the nebula at different epochs and at different distances from the nucleus and that they gave rise to a succession of distinct rings all lying in nearly the same plane and all endowed with different velocities This being once admitted it is easy to see that the permanent stability of the rings would have required a regularity of structure throughout their whole contour which is very improbable Each of them accordingly broke in its turn into several masses which were obviously endowed with a movement of rotation coinciding in direction with the common movement of revolution and which in consequence of their fluidity assumed spheroidal forms In order next that one of those spheroids may absorb all the others belonging to the same ring it is sufficient to suppose it to have a mass greater than that of any other spheroid of its group Each of the planets while in this vaporous condition to which we have just alluded would manifestly have a central nucleus gradually increasing in magnitude and mass and an atmosphere offering at its successive limits phenomena entirely similar to those which the solar atmosphere properly so called had exhibited We are here contemplating the birth of satellites and the birth of the ring of Saturn The Nebular Hypothesis of which I have just given an imperfect sketch has for its object to show how a nebula endowed with a general movement of rotation must eventually transform itself into a very luminous central nucleus a sun and into a series of distinct spheroidal planets situate at considerable distances from one another all revolving around the central sun in the direction of the original movement of the nebula how these planets ought also to have movements of rotation in similar directions how finally the satellites when any such are formed must revolve upon their axes and around their respective primaries in the direction of rotation of the planets and of their movement of revolution around the sun In all that precedes attention has been concentrated upon the Mecanique Celeste The Systeme du Monde and the Theorie Analytique des Probabilites also deserve description The Exposition of the System of the World is the Mecanique Celeste divested of that great apparatus of analytical formulae which must be attentively perused by every astronomer who to use an expression of Plato wishes to know the numbers which govern the physical universe It is from this work that persons ignorant of mathematics may obtain competent knowledge of the methods to which physical astronomy owes its astonishing progress Written with a noble simplicity of style an exquisite exactness of expression and a scrupulous accuracy it is universally conceded to stand among the noblest monuments of French literature The labors of all ages to persuade truth from the heavens are there justly clearly and profoundly analyzed Genius presides as the impartial judge of genius Throughout his work Laplace remained at the height of his great mission It will be read with respect so long as the torch of science illuminates the world The calculus of probabilities when confined within just limits concerns the mathematician the experimenter and the statesman From the time when Pascal and Fermat established its first principles it has rendered most important daily services This it is which after suggesting the best form for statistical tables of population and mortality teaches us to deduce from those numbers so often misinterpreted the most precise and useful conclusions This it is which alone regulates with equity insurance premiums pension funds annuities discounts et cetera This it is that has gradually suppressed lotteries and other shameful snares cunningly laid for avarice and ignorance Laplace has treated these questions with his accustomed superiority the Analytical Theory of Probabilities is worthy of the author of the Mecanique Celeste A philosopher whose name is associated with immortal discoveries said to his too conservative audience Bear in mind gentlemen that in questions of science the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual Two centuries have passed over these words of Galileo without lessening their value or impugning their truth For this reason it has been thought better rather to glance briefly at the work of Laplace than to repeat the eulogies of his admirers JOHN ARBUTHNOT sixteen sixty seven seventeen thirty five Arbuthnot s place in literature depends as much on his association with the wits of his day as on his own satirical and humorous productions Many of these have been published in the collections of Swift Gay Pope and others and cannot be identified The task of verifying them is rendered more difficult by the fact that his son repudiated a collection claiming to be his Miscellaneous Works published in seventeen fifty Illustration JOHN ARBUTHNOT John Arbuthnot was born in the manse near Arbuthnot Castle Kincardineshire Scotland April twenty ninth sixteen sixty seven He was the son of a Scotch Episcopal clergyman who was soon to be dispossessed of his parish by the Presbyterians in the Revolution of sixteen eighty eight His children who shared his Jacobite sentiments were forced to leave Scotland and John after finishing his university course at Aberdeen and taking his medical degree at saint Andrews went to London and taught mathematics He soon attracted attention by a keen and satirical Examination of doctor Woodward s Account of the Deluge published in sixteen ninety seven By a fortunate chance he was called to attend the Prince Consort Prince George of Denmark and in seventeen oh five was made Physician Extraordinary to Queen Anne If we may believe Swift the agreeable Scotchman at once became her favorite attendant His position at court was strengthened by his friendships with the great Tory statesmen Arbuthnot s best remembered work is The History of John Bull not because many people read or will ever read the book itself but because it fixed a typical name and a typical character ineffaceably in the popular fancy and memory He is credited with having been the first to use this famous sobriquet for the English nation he was certainly the first to make it universal and the first to make that burly choleric gross feeding hard drinking blunt spoken rather stupid and decidedly gullible but honest and straightforward character one of the stock types of the world The book appeared as four separate pamphlets the first being entitled Law is a Bottomless Pit Exemplified in the Case of Lord Strutt John Bull Nicholas Frog and Lewis Baboon Who Spent All They Had in a Law Suit the second John Bull in His Senses the third John Bull Still in His Senses and the fourth Lewis Baboon Turned Honest and John Bull Politician Published in seventeen twelve these were at once attributed to Swift But Pope says doctor Arbuthnot was the sole writer of John Bull and Swift gives us still more conclusive evidence by writing I hope you read John Bull It was a Scotch gentleman a friend of mine that writ it but they put it on to me In his humorous preface doctor Arbuthnot says When I was first called to the office of historiographer to John Bull he expressed himself to this purpose Sir Humphrey Polesworth I know you are a plain dealer it is for that reason I have chosen you for this important trust speak the truth and spare not That I might fulfill those his honorable intentions I obtained leave to repair to and attend him in his most secret retirements and I put the journals of all transactions into a strong box to be opened at a fitting occasion after the manner of the historiographers of some Eastern monarchs And now that posterity may not be ignorant in what age so excellent a history was written which would otherwise no doubt be the subject of its inquiries I think it proper to inform the learned of future times that it was compiled when Louis XIV was King of France and Philip his grandson of Spain when England and Holland in conjunction with the Emperor and the allies entered into a war against these two princes which lasted ten years under the management of the Duke of Marlborough and was put to a conclusion by the treaty of Utrecht under the ministry of the Earl of Oxford in the year seventeen thirteen The characters disguised are John Bull the English Nicholas Frog the Dutch Lewis Baboon the French king Lord Strutt the late King of Spain Philip Baboon the Duke of Anjou Esquire South the King of Spain Humphrey Hocus the Duke of Marlborough and Sir Roger Bold the Earl of Oxford The lawsuit was the War of the Spanish Succession John Bull s first wife was the late ministry and his second wife the Tory ministry To explain the allegory further John Bull s mother was the Church of England his sister Peg the Scotch nation and her lover Jack Presbyterianism That so witty a work so strong in typical freehand character drawing of permanent validity and remembrance should be unread and its author forgotten except by scholars is too curious a fact not to have a deep cause in its own character The cause is not hard to find it is one of the books which try to turn the world s current backward and which the world dislikes as offending its ideals of progress Stripped of its broad humor its object rubbed in with no great delicacy of touch was to uphold the most extreme and reactionary Toryism of the time and to jeer at political liberalism from the ground up Its theoretic loyalty is the non resistant Jacobitism of the Nonjurors which it is so hard for us now to distinguish from abject slavishness though like the principles of the casuists one must not confound theory with practice It seems the loyalty of a mujik or a Fiji dressed in cultivated modern clothes not that of a conceivable cultivated modern community as a whole but it would be very Philistine to pour wholesale contempt on a creed held by so many large minds and souls It was of course produced by the experience of what the reverse tenets had brought on a long civil war years of military despotism and immense social and moral disorganization In John Bull the fidelity of a subject to a king is made exactly correspondent both in theory and practice with the fidelity of a wife to her husband and her marriage vows and an elaborate parallel is worked out to show that advocating the right of resistance to a bad king is precisely the same on grounds of either logic or Scripture as advocating the right of adultery toward a bad husband This is not even good fooling and its local use past and no longer buoyed by personal liking for the author the book sinks back into the limbo of partisan polemics with many worse ones and perhaps some better ones dragging its real excellences down with it In seventeen fourteen the famous Scriblerus Club was organized having for its members Pope Swift Arbuthnot Gay Congreve Lord Oxford and Bishop Atterbury They agreed to write a series of papers ridiculing in the words of Pope all the false tastes in learning under the character of a man of capacity enough but that had dipped into every art and science but injudiciously in each The chronicle of this club was found in The Memoirs of the Extraordinary Life Works and Discoveries of Martinus Scriblerus which is thought to have been written entirely by Arbuthnot and which describes the education of a learned pedant s son Its humor may be appreciated by means of the citation given below The first book of Scriblerus appeared six years after Arbuthnot s death when it was included in the second volume of Alexander Pope s works seventeen forty one Pope said that from the Memoirs of Scriblerus Swift took his idea of Gulliver and the Dean himself writes to Arbuthnot July threed seventeen fourteen To talk of Martin in any hands but Yours is a Folly You every day give better hints than all of us together could do in a twelvemonth And to say the truth Pope who first thought of the Hint has no Genius at all to it in my mind Gay is too young Parnell has some ideas of it but is idle I could put together and lard and strike out well enough but all that relates to the Sciences must be from you Swift s opinion that Arbuthnot has more wit than we all have and his humanity is equal to his wit seems to have been the universal dictum and Pope honored him by publishing a dialogue in the Prologue to the Satires known first as The Epistle to doctor Arbuthnot which contains many affectionate personal allusions Aitken says in his biography Arbuthnot s attachment to Swift and Pope was of the most intimate nature and those who knew them best maintained that he was their equal at least in gifts He understood Swift s cynicism and their correspondence shows the unequaled sympathy that existed between the two Gay Congreve Berkeley Parnell were among Arbuthnot s constant friends and all of them were indebted to him for kindnesses freely rendered He was on terms of intimacy with Bolingbroke and Oxford Chesterfield Peterborough and Pulteney and among the ladies with whom he mixed were Lady Mary Wortley Montagu Lady Betty Germain missus Howard Lady Masham and missus Martha Blount He was too the trusted friend and physician of Queen Anne Most of the eminent men of science of the time including some who were opposed to him in politics were in frequent intercourse with him and it is pleasant to know that at least one of the greatest of the wits who were most closely allied to the Whig party Addison had friendly relations with him From the letters of Lord Chesterfield we learn that His imagination was almost inexhaustible and whatever subject he treated or was consulted upon he immediately overflowed with all that it could possibly produce It was at anybody s service for as soon as he was exonerated he did not care what became of it insomuch that his sons when young have frequently made kites of his scattered papers of hints which would have furnished good matter for folios Not being in the least jealous of his fame as an author he would neither take the time nor the trouble of separating the best from the worst he worked out the whole mine which afterward in the hands of skillful refiners produced a rich vein of ore As his imagination was always at work he was frequently absent and inattentive in company which made him both say and do a thousand inoffensive absurdities but which far from being provoking as they commonly are supplied new matter for conversation and occasioned wit both in himself and others Speaking to Boswell of the writers of Queen Anne s time doctor Johnson said I think doctor Arbuthnot the first man among them He was the most universal genius being an excellent physician a man of deep learning and a man of much humor He did not however think much of the Scriblerus papers and said they were forgotten because no man would be the wiser better or merrier for remembering them which is hard measure for the wit and divertingness of some of the travesties Cowper reviewing Johnson s Lives of the Poets declared that one might search these eight volumes with a candle to find a man and not find one unless perhaps Arbuthnot were he Thackeray too called him one of the wisest wittiest most accomplished gentlest of mankind Thus fortunate in his sunny spirit in his genius for friendship in his professional eminence and in his literary capacity doctor Arbuthnot saw his life flow smoothly to its close He died in London on February twenty seventh seventeen thirty five at the age of sixty eight still working and playing with youthful ardor and still surrounded with all the good things of life THE TRUE CHARACTERS OF JOHN BULL NIC FROG AND HOCUS From The History of John Bull Part I For the better understanding the following history the reader ought to know that Bull in the main was an honest plain dealing fellow choleric bold and of a very unconstant temper he dreaded not old Lewis either at backsword single falchion or cudgel play but then he was very apt to quarrel with his best friends especially if they pretended to govern him If you flattered him you might lead him like a child John s temper depended very much upon the air his spirits rose and fell with the weather glass John was quick and understood his business very well but no man alive was more careless in looking into his accounts or more cheated by partners apprentices and servants This was occasioned by his being a boon companion loving his bottle and his diversion for to say truth no man kept a better house than John nor spent his money more generously By plain and fair dealing John had acquired some plums and might have kept them had it not been for his unhappy lawsuit Nic Frog was a cunning sly fellow quite the reverse of John in many particulars covetous frugal minded domestic affairs would pinch his belly to save his pocket never lost a farthing by careless servants or bad debtors He did not care much for any sort of diversion except tricks of High German artists and legerdemain No man exceeded Nic in these yet it must be owned that Nic was a fair dealer and in that way acquired immense riches Hocus was an old cunning attorney and though this was the first considerable suit that ever he was engaged in he showed himself superior in address to most of his profession He kept always good clerks he loved money was smooth tongued gave good words and seldom lost his temper He was not worse than an infidel for he provided plentifully for his family but he loved himself better than them all The neighbors reported that he was henpecked which was impossible by such a mild spirited woman as his wife was HOW THE RELATIONS RECONCILED JOHN AND HIS SISTER PEG AND WHAT RETURN PEG MADE TO JOHN S MESSAGE From the History of John Bull Part I John Bull otherwise a good natured man was very hard hearted to his sister Peg chiefly from an aversion he had conceived in his infancy While he flourished kept a warm house and drove a plentiful trade poor Peg was forced to go hawking and peddling about the streets selling knives scissors and shoe buckles now and then carried a basket of fish to the market sewed spun and knit for a livelihood till her fingers ends were sore and when she could not get bread for her family she was forced to hire them out at journey work to her neighbors Yet in these her poor circumstances she still preserved the air and mien of a gentlewoman a certain decent pride that extorted respect from the haughtiest of her neighbors When she came in to any full assembly she would not yield the pas to the best of them If one asked her Are you not related to John Bull Yes says she he has the honor to be my brother So Peg s affairs went till all the relations cried out shame upon John for his barbarous usage of his own flesh and blood that it was an easy matter for him to put her in a creditable way of living not only without hurt but with advantage to himself seeing she was an industrious person and might be serviceable to him in his way of business Hang her jade quoth John I can t endure her as long as she keeps that rascal Jack s company They told him the way to reclaim her was to take her into his house that by conversation the childish humors of their younger days might be worn out These arguments were enforced by a certain incident It happened that John was at that time about making his will and entailing his estate the very same in which Nic Frog is named executor Now his sister Peg s name being in the entail he could not make a thorough settlement without her consent There was indeed a malicious story went about as if John s last wife had fallen in love with Jack as he was eating custard on horseback that she persuaded John to take his sister into the house the better to drive on the intrigue with Jack concluding he would follow his mistress Peg All I can infer from this story is that when one has got a bad character in the world people will report and believe anything of them true or false But to return to my story When Peg received John s message she huffed and stormed My brother John quoth she is grown wondrous kind hearted all of a sudden but I meikle doubt whether it be not mair for their own conveniency than for my good he draws up his writs and his deeds forsooth and I must set my hand to them unsight unseen I like the young man he has settled upon well enough but I think I ought to have a valuable consideration for my consent He wants my poor little farm because it makes a nook in his park wall You may e en tell him he has mair than he makes good use of he gangs up and down drinking roaring and quarreling through all the country markets making foolish bargains in his cups which he repents when he is sober like a thriftless wretch spending the goods and gear that his forefathers won with the sweat of their brows light come light go he cares not a farthing But why should I stand surety for his contracts The little I have is free and I can call it my own hame s hame let it be never so hamely I ken well enough he could never abide me and when he has his ends he ll e en use me as he did before I m sure I shall be treated like a poor drudge I shall be set to tend the bairns darn the hose and mend the linen Then there s no living with that old carline his mother she rails at Jack and Jack s an honester man than any of her kin I shall be plagued with her spells and her Paternosters and silly Old World ceremonies I mun never pare my nails on a Friday nor begin a journey on Childermas Day and I mun stand becking and binging as I gang out and into the hall Tell him he may e en gang his get I ll have nothing to do with him I ll stay like the poor country mouse in my awn habitation So Peg talked but for all that by the interposition of good friends and by many a bonny thing that was sent and many more that were promised Peg the matter was concluded and Peg taken into the house upon certain articles the Act of Toleration is referred to one of which was that she might have the freedom of Jack s conversation and might take him for better or for worse if she pleased provided always he did not come into the house at unseasonable hours and disturb the rest of the old woman John s mother OF THE RUDIMENTS OF MARTIN S LEARNING From Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus missus Scriblerus considered it was now time to instruct him in the fundamentals of religion and to that end took no small pains in teaching him his catechism But Cornelius looked upon this as a tedious way of instruction and therefore employed his head to find out more pleasing methods the better to induce him to be fond of learning He would frequently carry him to the puppet show of the creation of the world where the child with exceeding delight gained a notion of the history of the Bible His first rudiments in profane history were acquired by seeing of raree shows where he was brought acquainted with all the princes of Europe In short the old gentleman so contrived it to make everything contribute to the improvement of his knowledge even to his very dress He invented for him a geographical suit of clothes which might give him some hints of that science and likewise some knowledge of the commerce of different nations He had a French hat with an African feather Holland shirts Flanders lace English clothes lined with Indian silk his gloves were Italian and his shoes were Spanish he was made to observe this and daily catechized thereupon which his father was wont to call traveling at home He never gave him a fig or an orange but he obliged him to give an account from what country it came In natural history he was much assisted by his curiosity in sign posts insomuch that he hath often confessed he owed to them the knowledge of many creatures which he never found since in any author such as white lions golden dragons et cetera He once thought the same of green men but had since found them mentioned by Kercherus and verified in the history of William of Newburg His disposition to the mathematics was discovered very early by his drawing parallel lines on his bread and butter and intersecting them at equal angles so as to form the whole superficies into squares But in the midst of all these improvements a stop was put to his learning the alphabet nor would he let him proceed to the letter D till he could truly and distinctly pronounce C in the ancient manner at which the child unhappily boggled for near three months He was also obliged to delay his learning to write having turned away the writing master because he knew nothing of Fabius s waxen tables Cornelius having read and seriously weighed the methods by which the famous Montaigne was educated and resolving in some degree to exceed them resolved he should speak and learn nothing but the learned languages and especially the Greek in which he constantly eat and drank according to Homer But what most conduced to his easy attainment of this language was his love of gingerbread which his father observing caused to be stamped with the letters of the Greek alphabet and the child the very first day eat as far as Iota By his particular application to this language above the rest he attained so great a proficiency therein that Gronovius ingenuously confesses he durst not confer with this child in Greek at eight years old and at fourteen he composed a tragedy in the same language as the younger Pliny had done before him He learned the Oriental languages of Erpenius who resided some time with his father for that purpose He had so early a relish for the Eastern way of writing that even at this time he composed in imitation of it A Thousand and One Arabian Tales and also the Persian Tales which have been since translated into several languages and lately into our own with particular elegance by mister Ambrose Philips In this work of his childhood he was not a little assisted by the historical traditions of his nurse THE ARGONAUTIC LEGEND The legend of the Argonauts relates to the story of a band of heroes who sailed from Thessaly to AEa the region of the Sun god on the remotest shore of the Black Sea in quest of a Golden Fleece The ship Argo bore the heroes under the command of Jason to whom the task had been assigned by his uncle Pelias Pelias was the usurper of his nephew s throne and for Jason on his coming to man s estate he devised the perilous adventure of fetching the golden fleece of the Speaking Ram which many years before had carried Phrixus to AEa or Colchis Fifty of the most distinguished Grecian heroes came to Jason s aid while Argus the son of Phrixus under the guidance of Athena built the ship inserting in the prow for prophetic advice and furtherance a piece of the famous talking oak of Dodona Tiphys was the steersman and Orpheus joined the crew to enliven the weariness of their sea life with his harp The heroes came first to Lemnos where the women had risen in revolt and slain fathers brothers and husbands Here the voyagers lingered almost a year but at last having taken leave they came to the southern coast of Propontis where the Doliones dwelt under King Cyzicus Their kind entertainment among this people was marred by ill fate for having weighed anchor in the night they were driven back by a storm and being mistaken for foes were fiercely attacked Cyzicus himself fell by the hand of Jason They next touched at the country of the Bebrycians where the hero Pollux overcame the king in a boxing match and bound him to a tree and thence to Salmydessus to consult the soothsayer Phineus In gratitude for their freeing him from the Harpies who as often as his table was set descended out of the clouds upon his food and defiled it the prophet directed them safe to Colchis The heroes rowing with might thus passed the Symplegades two cliffs which opened and shut with such swift violence that a bird could scarce fly through the passage The rocks were held apart with the help of Athena and from that day they became fixed and harmless Further on they came in sight of Mount Caucasus saw the eagle which preyed on the vitals of Prometheus and heard the sufferer s woeful cries So their journey was accomplished and they arrived at AEa and the palace of King AEetes When the king heard the errand of the heroes he was moved against them and refused to give up the fleece except on terms which he thought Jason durst not comply with Two bulls snorting fire with feet of brass Jason was required to yoke and with them plow a field and sow the land with dragon s teeth Here the heavenly powers came to the hero s aid and Hera and Athena prayed Aphrodite to send the shaft of Cupid upon Medea the youthful daughter of the king Thus it came about that Medea conceived a great passion for the young hero and with the magic which she knew she made for him a salve The salve rendered his body invulnerable He yoked the bulls and ploughed the field and sowed the dragon s teeth A crop of armed men sprang from the sowing but Jason prepared for this marvel by Medea threw among them a stone which she had given him whereupon they fell upon and slew one another But AEetes still refused to fetch the fleece plotting secretly to burn the Argo and kill the heroic Argonauts Medea came to their succor and by her black art lulled to sleep the dragon which guarded the fleece They seized the pelt boarded the Argo and sailed away taking Medea with them When her father followed in pursuit in the madness of her love for Jason she slew her brother whom she had with her and strewed the fragments of his body upon the wave The king stopped to recover them and give them burial and thus the Argonauts escaped But the anger of the gods at this horrible murder led the voyagers in expiation a wearisome way homeward For they sailed through the waters of the Adriatic the Nile the circumfluous stream of the earth passed Scylla and Charybdis and the Island of the Sun to Crete and AEgina and many lands before the Argo rode once more in Thessalian waters The legend is one of the oldest and most familiar tales of Greece Whether it is all poetic myth or had a certain foundation in fact it is impossible now to say The date the geography the heroes are mythical and as in the Homeric poems the supernatural and seeming historical are so blended that the union is indissoluble by any analysis yet found The theme has touched the imagination of poets from the time of Apollonius Rhodius who wrote the Argonautica and went to Alexandria B C one hundred ninety four to take care of the great library there to William Morris who published his Life and Death of Jason in eighteen sixty seven mister Morris s version of the contest of Orpheus with the Sirens is given to illustrate the reality of the old legends to the Greeks themselves Jason s later life his putting away of Medea his marriage with Glauce and the revenge of the deserted princess furnish the story of the greatest of the plays of Euripides THE VICTORY OF ORPHEUS From The Life and Death of Jason The Sirens Oh happy seafarers are ye And surely all your ills are past And toil upon the land and sea Since ye are brought to us at last To you the fashion of the world Wide lands laid waste fair cities burned And plagues and kings from kingdoms hurled Are naught since hither ye have turned For as upon this beach we stand And o er our heads the sea fowl flit Our eyes behold a glorious land And soon shall ye be kings of it Orpheus A little more a little more O carriers of the Golden Fleece A little labor with the oar Before we reach the land of Greece E en now perchance faint rumors reach Men s ears of this our victory And draw them down unto the beach To gaze across the empty sea But since the longed for day is nigh And scarce a god could stay us now Why do ye hang your heads and sigh And still go slower and more slow The Sirens Ah had ye chanced to reach the home Your fond desires were set upon Into what troubles had ye come What barren victory had ye won But now but now when ye have lain Asleep with us a little while Beneath the washing of the main How calm shall be your waking smile For ye shall smile to think of life That knows no troublous change or fear No unavailing bitter strife That ere its time brings trouble near Orpheus Is there some murmur in your ears That all that we have done is naught And nothing ends our cares and fears Till the last fear on us is brought The Sirens Alas and will ye stop your ears In vain desire to do aught And wish to live mid cares and fears Until the last fear makes you naught Orpheus Is not the May time now on earth When close against the city wall The folk are singing in their mirth While on their heads the May flowers fall The Sirens Yes May is come and its sweet breath Shall well nigh make you weep to day And pensive with swift coming death Shall ye be satiate of the May Orpheus Shall not July bring fresh delight As underneath green trees ye sit And o er some damsel s body white The noon tide shadows change and flit The Sirens No new delight July shall bring But ancient fear and fresh desire And spite of every lovely thing Of July surely shall ye tire Orpheus And now when August comes on thee And mid the golden sea of corn The merry reapers thou mayst see Wilt thou still think the earth forlorn The Sirens Set flowers on thy short lived head And in thine heart forgetfulness Of man s hard toil and scanty bread And weary of those days no less Orpheus Or wilt thou climb the sunny hill In the October afternoon To watch the purple earth s blood fill The gray vat to the maiden s tune The Sirens When thou beginnest to grow old Bring back remembrance of thy bliss With that the shining cup doth hold And weary helplessly of this Orpheus Or pleasureless shall we pass by The long cold night and leaden day That song and tale and minstrelsy Shall make as merry as the May The Sirens List then to night to some old tale Until the tears o erflow thine eyes But what shall all these things avail When sad to morrow comes and dies Orpheus And when the world is born again And with some fair love side by side Thou wanderest twixt the sun and rain In that fresh love begetting tide Then when the world is born again And the sweet year before thee lies Shall thy heart think of coming pain Or vex itself with memories The Sirens Ah then the world is born again With burning love unsatisfied And new desires fond and vain And weary days from tide to tide Ah when the world is born again A little day is soon gone by When thou unmoved by sun or rain Within a cold straight house shall lie Therewith they ceased awhile as languidly The head of Argo fell off toward the sea And through the water she began to go For from the land a fitful wind did blow That dallying with the many colored sail Would sometimes swell it out and sometimes fail As nigh the east side of the bay they drew Then o er the waves again the music flew The Sirens Think not of pleasure short and vain Wherewith mid days of toil and pain With sick and sinking hearts ye strive To cheat yourselves that ye may live With cold death ever close at hand Think rather of a peaceful land The changeless land where ye may be Roofed over by the changeful sea Orpheus And is the fair town nothing then The coming of the wandering men With that long talked of thing and strange And news of how the kingdoms change The pointed hands and wondering At doers of a desperate thing Push on for surely this shall be Across a narrow strip of sea The Sirens Alas poor souls and timorous Will ye draw nigh to gaze at us And see if we are fair indeed For such as we shall be your meed There where our hearts would have you go And where can the earth dwellers show In any land such loveliness As that wherewith your eyes we bless O wanderers of the Minyae Worn toilers over land and sea Orpheus Fair as the lightning thwart the sky As sun dyed snow upon the high Untrodden heaps of threatening stone The eagle looks upon alone Oh fair as the doomed victim s wreath Oh fair as deadly sleep and death What will ye with them earthly men To mate your threescore years and ten Toil rather suffer and be free Betwixt the green earth and the sea The Sirens If ye be bold with us to go Things such as happy dreams may show Shall your once heavy lids behold About our palaces of gold Where waters neath the waters run And from o erhead a harmless sun Gleams through the woods of chrysolite There gardens fairer to the sight Than those of the Phaeacian king Shall ye behold and wondering Gaze on the sea born fruit and flowers And thornless and unchanging bowers Whereof the May time knoweth naught So to the pillared house being brought Poor souls ye shall not be alone For o er the floors of pale blue stone All day such feet as ours shall pass And twixt the glimmering walls of glass Such bodies garlanded with gold So faint so fair shall ye behold And clean forget the treachery Of changing earth and tumbling sea Orpheus Oh the sweet valley of deep grass Where through the summer stream doth pass In chain of shadow and still pool From misty morn to evening cool Where the black ivy creeps and twines O er the dark armed red trunked pines Whence clattering the pigeon flits Or brooding o er her thin eggs sits And every hollow of the hills With echoing song the mavis fills There by the stream all unafraid Shall stand the happy shepherd maid Alone in first of sunlit hours Behind her on the dewy flowers Her homespun woolen raiment lies And her white limbs and sweet gray eyes Shine from the calm green pool and deep While round about the swallows sweep Not silent and would God that we Like them were landed from the sea The Sirens Shall we not rise with you at night Up through the shimmering green twilight That maketh there our changeless day Then going through the moonlight gray Shall we not sit upon these sands To think upon the troublous lands Long left behind where once ye were When every day brought change and fear There with white arms about you twined And shuddering somewhat at the wind That ye rejoiced erewhile to meet Be happy while old stories sweet Half understood float round your ears And fill your eyes with happy tears Ah while we sing unto you there As now we sing with yellow hair Blown round about these pearly limbs While underneath the gray sky swims The light shell sailor of the waves And to our song from sea filled caves Booms out an echoing harmony Shall ye not love the peaceful sea Orpheus Nigh the vine covered hillocks green In days agone have I not seen The brown clad maidens amorous Below the long rose trellised house Dance to the querulous pipe and shrill When the gray shadow of the hill Was lengthening at the end of day Not shadowy or pale were they But limbed like those who twixt the trees Follow the swift of goddesses Sunburnt they are somewhat indeed To where the rough brown woolen weed Is drawn across their bosoms sweet Or cast from off their dancing feet But yet the stars the moonlight gray The water wan the dawn of day Can see their bodies fair and white As hers who once for man s delight Before the world grew hard and old Came o er the bitter sea and cold And surely those that met me there Her handmaidens and subjects were And shame faced half repressed desire Had lit their glorious eyes with fire That maddens eager hearts of men Oh would that I were with them when The risen moon is gathering light And yellow from the homestead white The windows gleam but verily This waits us o er a little sea The Sirens Come to the land where none grows old And none is rash or over bold Nor any noise there is or war Or rumor from wild lands afar Or plagues or birth and death of kings No vain desire of unknown things Shall vex you there no hope or fear Of that which never draweth near But in that lovely land and still Ye may remember what ye will And what ye will forget for aye So while the kingdoms pass away Ye sea beat hardened toilers erst Unresting for vain fame athirst Shall be at peace for evermore With hearts fulfilled of Godlike lore And calm unwavering Godlike love No lapse of time can turn or move There ages after your fair fleece Is clean forgotten yea and Greece Is no more counted glorious Alone with us alone with us Alone with us dwell happily Beneath our trembling roof of sea Orpheus Ah do ye weary of the strife And long to change this eager life For shadowy and dull hopelessness Thinking indeed to gain no less Than this to die and not to die To be as if ye ne er had been Yet keep your memory fresh and green To have no thought of good or ill Yet keep some thrilling pleasure still Oh idle dream Ah verily If it shall happen unto me That I have thought of anything When o er my bones the sea fowl sing And I lie dead how shall I pine For those fresh joys that once were mine On this green fount of joy and mirth The ever young and glorious earth Then helpless shall I call to mind Thoughts of the flower scented wind The dew the gentle rain at night The wonder working snow and white The song of birds the water s fall The sun that maketh bliss of all Yea this our toil and victory The tyrannous and conquered sea The Sirens Ah will ye go and whither then Will ye go from us soon to die To fill your threescore years and ten With many an unnamed misery And this the wretchedest of all That when upon your lonely eyes The last faint heaviness shall fall Ye shall bethink you of our cries Come back nor grown old seek in vain To hear us sing across the sea Come back come back come back again Come back O fearful Minyae Orpheus Ah once again ah once again The black prow plunges through the sea Nor yet shall all your toil be vain Nor ye forget O Minyae LUDOVICO ARIOSTO fourteen seventy four fifteen thirty three BY L OSCAR KUHNS 
5649-40567-0000	train-other-500	Among the smaller principalities of Italy during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries none was more brilliant than the court of Ferrara and none more intimately connected with the literature of the times Here on September eighth fourteen seventy four
5649-40567-0001	train-other-500	was born Ludovico Ariosto the great poet of the Renaissance Here like Boiardo before him and Tasso after him he lived and wrote
none	none	 and it was to the family of Este that he dedicated that poem 
5649-40567-0002	train-other-500	in which are seen as in a mirror the gay life the intellectual brilliancy and the sensuous love for beauty which mark the age At seventeen he began the study of the law which he soon abandoned for the charms of letters Most of his life was passed in the service
none	none	 first of Cardinal d Este 
5649-40567-0003	train-other-500	and afterward of the Duke of Ferrara But the courtier never overcame the poet
none	none	 who is said to have begun the famous Orlando Furioso at the age of thirty and never to have ceased the effort to improve it 
5649-40567-0004	train-other-500	The literary activity of Ariosto showed itself in the composition of comedies and satires as well as in that of his immortal epic
none	none	 The comedies were written for the court theatre of Ferrara to which he seems to have had some such relation as that of Goethe to the theatre at Weimar 
5649-40567-0005	train-other-500	The later comedies are much better than the early ones which are but little more than translations from Plautus and Terence In general however the efforts of Ariosto in this direction are far less important than the Orlando or the Satires
none	none	 At the first appearance of his plays they were enormously successful and the poet was hailed as a great dramatic genius But these comedies are interesting to day chiefly from the fact that Ariosto was one of the very first of the writers of modern comedy 
5649-40567-0006	train-other-500	and was the leader of that movement in Italy and France which prepared the way for Moliere Of more importance than the comedies and second only in interest to the Orlando are the Satires seven in number the first written in fifteen seventeen
none	none	 and the last in fifteen thirty one thus representing the maturer life of the poet Nearly everything we know of Ariosto s character is taken from this source He reveals himself in them as a man who excites neither our highest admiration nor our contempt He was not born to be a statesman nor a courtier 
5649-40567-0007	train-other-500	nor a man of affairs and his life as ambassador of Cardinal Ippolito
none	none	 and as captain of Garafagno 
5649-40567-0008	train-other-500	was not at all to his liking
none	none	 His one longing through all the busy years of his life was for a quiet home where he could live in liberty and enjoy the comforts of cultured leisure A love of independence was a marked trait of his character and it must often have galled him to play the part he did at the court of Ferrara As a satirist he was no Juvenal or Persius 
5649-40567-0009	train-other-500	He was not stirred to profound indignation by the evils about him of which there were enough in that brilliant but corrupt age He discussed in easy familiar style the foibles of his fellow men and especially the events of his own life
5649-40567-0010	train-other-500	and the traits of his own character The same views of life the same tolerant temper which are seen in the Satires form an important part of the Orlando Furioso where they take the form of little dissertations
5649-40567-0011	train-other-500	introduced at the beginning of a canto or scattered through the body of the poem These reflections are full of practical sense and wisdom and remind us of the familiar conversation with the reader which forms so great a charm in Thackeray s novels
5649-40567-0012	train-other-500	In the Italian Renaissance there is a curious mingling of classical and romantic influences and the generation which gave itself up passionately to the study of Greek and Latin still read with delight
5649-40567-0013	train-other-500	the stories of the Paladins of Charlemagne and the Knights of the Round Table What Sir Thomas Malory had done in English prose Boiardo did in Latin poetry When Ariosto entered the service of Cardinal Ippolito
none	none	 every one was reading the Orlando Innamorato and the young poet soon fell under the charm of these stories so that when the inward impulse which all great poets feel toward the work of creation came to him he took the material already at hand and continued the story of Orlando With a certain skill and inventiveness Boiardo had mingled together the epic cycles of Arthur and Charlemagne He had shown the Saracen host 
5649-40567-0014	train-other-500	under King Agramante driving the army of Charlemagne before them until the Christians had finally been shut up within the walls of Paris It was at this critical moment in his poem that Boiardo died
5649-40567-0015	train-other-500	Ariosto took up the story where he had left it and carried it on until the final defeat of Agramante and his death at the hands of Orlando
none	none	 in the desert island Illustration LODOVICO ARIOSTO But we must not think that the Orlando Furioso has one definite plot At first reading we are confused by the multiplicity of incident by the constant change of scene and by the breaking off of one story to make place for another In a single canto the scene changes from France to Africa 
5649-40567-0016	train-other-500	and by means of winged horses tremendous distances are traveled over in a day On closer examination we find that this confusion is only apparent The poet himself is never confused but with sure hand
5649-40567-0017	train-other-500	he manipulates the many colored threads which are wrought into the fabric of the poem
none	none	 The war between the Saracens and the Christians is a sort of background or stage a rallying point for the characters In reality it attracts but slightly our attention or interest Again Orlando s love for Angelica and his madness although the latter gave the title to the book 
5649-40567-0018	train-other-500	and both afford some of the finest episodes have no organic connection with the whole The real subject if any there be is the loves of Ruggiero and Bradamante
none	none	 These are the supposed ancestors of the house of Este 
5649-40567-0019	train-other-500	and it is with their final union after many vicissitudes that the poem ends But the real purpose of Ariosto was to amuse the reader by countless stories of romantic adventure It was not as a great creative genius
none	none	 as the inventor of new characters as the earnest and philosophical reformer that he appears to mankind but as the supreme artist Ariosto represents in its highest development 
5649-40567-0020	train-other-500	that love for form that perfection of style which is characteristic of the Latin races as distinguished from the Teutonic It is this that makes the Orlando Furioso the great epic of the Renaissance
5649-40567-0021	train-other-500	and that caused Galileo to bestow upon the poet the epithet divine For nearly thirty years Ariosto changed and polished these lines
5649-40567-0022	train-other-500	so that the edition of fifteen thirty two is quite different from that of fifteen sixteen The stanzas in which the poem is written are smooth and musical the language is so chosen as always to express the exact shade of thought
5649-40567-0023	train-other-500	the interest never flags What seems the arbitrary breaking off of a story before its close is really the art of the poet for he knows were each episode to be told by itself we should have only a string of novelle
none	none	 and not the picture he desired to paint that of the world of chivalry with its knights errant in search of adventures its damsels in distress its beautiful gardens and lordly palaces its hermits and magicians 
5649-40567-0024	train-other-500	its hippogriffs and dragons and all the paraphernalia of magic art Ariosto s treatment of chivalry is peculiar to himself Spenser in the sixteenth century and Lord Tennyson in our own day
none	none	 pictured its virtues and noble aspirations In his immortal Don Quixote Cervantes held its extravagances up to ridicule In Ariosto s day no one believed any longer in the heroes or the ideals of chivalry 
5649-40567-0025	train-other-500	nor did the poet himself hence there is an air of unreality about the poem The figures that pass before us although they have certain characteristics of their own are not real beings but those that dwell in a land of fancy
none	none	 As the poet tells these stories of a bygone age a smile of irony plays upon his face he cannot take them seriously and while he never goes so far as to turn into ridicule the ideals of chivalry yet in such episodes as the prodigious exploits of Rodomonte within the walls of Paris 
5649-40567-0026	train-other-500	and the voyage of Astolfo to the moon he does approach dangerously near to the burlesque We are not inspired by large and noble thoughts in reading the Orlando Furioso
none	none	 We are not deeply stirred by pity or terror 
5649-40567-0027	train-other-500	No lofty principles are inculcated Even the pathetic scenes such as the death of Zerbino and Isabella stir no real emotion in us but we experience a sense of the artistic effect of a poetic death It is not often
none	none	 in these days of the making of many books of which there is no end that one has time to read a poem which is longer than the Iliad and the Odyssey together But there is a compelling charm about the Orlando and he who sits down to read it 
5649-40567-0028	train-other-500	with serious purpose will soon find himself under the spell of an attraction which comes from unflagging interest and from perfection of style and construction No translation can convey an adequate sense of this beauty of color and form
none	none	 but the versions of William Stewart Rose here cited suggest the energy invention and intensity of the epic In fifteen thirty two Ariosto published his final edition of the poem now enlarged to forty six cantos and retouched from beginning to end He died not long afterward in fifteen thirty three and was buried in the church of San Benedetto where a magnificent monument marks his resting place Illustration Signature L OSCAR KUHNS THE FRIENDSHIP OF MEDORO AND CLORIDANE From Orlando Furioso Cantos eighteen and nineteen Two Moors among the Paynim army were From stock obscure in Ptolomita grown Of whom the story an example rare Of constant love is worthy to be known Medore and Cloridane were named the pair Who whether Fortune pleased to smile or frown Served Dardinello with fidelity And late with him to France had crost the sea Of nimble frame and strong was Cloridane Throughout his life a follower of the chase A cheek of white suffused with crimson grain Medoro had in youth a pleasing grace Nor bound on that emprize mid all the train Was there a fairer or more jocund face Crisp hair he had of gold and jet black eyes And seemed an angel lighted from the skies These two were posted on a rampart s height With more to guard the encampment from surprise When mid the equal intervals at night Medoro gazed on heaven with sleepy eyes In all his talk the stripling woeful wight Here cannot choose but of his lord devise The royal Dardinel and evermore Him left unhonored on the field deplore Then turning to his mate cries Cloridane I cannot tell thee what a cause of woe It is to me my lord upon the plain Should lie unworthy food for wolf or crow Thinking how still to me he was humane Meseems if in his honor I forego This life of mine for favors so immense I shall but make a feeble recompense That he may not lack sepulture will I Go forth and seek him out among the slain And haply God may will that none shall spy Where Charles s camp lies hushed Do thou remain That if my death be written in the sky Thou may saint the deed be able to explain So that if Fortune foil so far a feat The world through Fame my loving heart may weet Amazed was Cloridane a child should show Such heart such love and such fair loyalty And fain would make the youth his thought forego Whom he held passing dear but fruitlessly Would move his steadfast purpose for such woe Will neither comforted nor altered be Medoro is disposed to meet his doom Or to inclose his master in the tomb Seeing that naught would bend him naught would move I too will go was Cloridane s reply In such a glorious act myself will prove As well such famous death I covet I What other thing is left me here above Deprived of thee Medoro mine To die With thee in arms is better on the plain Than afterwards of grief shouldst thou be slain And thus resolved disposing in their place Their guard s relief depart the youthful pair Leave fosse and palisade and in small space Are among ours who watch with little care Who for they little fear the Paynim race Slumber with fires extinguished everywhere Mid carriages and arms they lie supine Up to the eyes immersed in sleep and wine A moment Cloridano stopt and cried Not to be lost are opportunities This troop by whom my master s blood was shed Medoro ought not I to sacrifice Do thou lest any one this way be led Watch everywhere about with ears and eyes For a wide way amid the hostile horde I offer here to make thee with my sword So said he and his talk cut quickly short Coming where learned Alpheus slumbered nigh Who had the year before sought Charles s court In med cine magic and astrology Well versed but now in art found small support Or rather found that it was all a lie He had foreseen that he his long drawn life Should finish on the bosom of his wife And now the Saracen with wary view Had pierced his weasand with the pointed sword Four others he near that Diviner slew Nor gave the wretches time to say a word Sir Turpin in his

where round King Charles s pavilion Are tented warlike paladin and peer Guarding the side that each is camped upon When in good time the Paynims backward steer And sheathe their swords the impious slaughter done Deeming impossible in such a number But they must light on one who does not slumber And though they might escape well charged with prey To save themselves they think sufficient gain Thither by what he deems the safest way Medoro following him went Cloridane Where in the field mid bow and falchion lay And shield and spear in pool of purple stain Wealthy and poor the king and vassal s corse And overthrown the rider and his horse The silvery splendor glistened yet more clear There where renowned Almontes s son lay dead Faithful Medoro mourned his master dear Who well agnized the quartering white and red With visage bathed in many a bitter tear For he a rill from either eyelid shed And piteous act and moan that might have whist The winds his melancholy plaint to list But with a voice supprest not that he aught Regards if any one the noise should hear Because he of his life takes any thought Of which loathed burden he would fain be clear But lest his being heard should bring to naught The pious purpose which has brought them here The youths the king upon their shoulders stowed And so between themselves divide the load Hurrying their steps they hastened as they might Under the cherished burden they conveyed And now approaching was the lord of light To sweep from heaven the stars from earth the shade When good Zerbino he whose valiant sprite Was ne er in time of need by sleep down weighed From chasing Moors all night his homeward way Was taking to the camp at dawn of day He has with him some horsemen in his train That from afar the two companions spy Expecting thus some spoil or prize to gain They every one toward that quarter hie Brother behoves us cried young Cloridane To cast away the load we bear and fly For twere a foolish thought might well be said To lose two living men to save one dead And dropt the burden weening his Medore Had done the same by it upon his side But that poor boy who loved his master more His shoulders to the weight alone applied Cloridane hurrying with all haste before Deeming him close behind him or beside Who did he know his danger him to save A thousand deaths instead of one would brave The closest path amid the forest gray To save himself pursued the youth forlorn But all his schemes were marred by the delay Of that sore weight upon his shoulders borne The place he knew not and mistook the way And hid himself again in sheltering thorn Secure and distant was his mate that through The greenwood shade with lighter shoulders flew So far was Cloridane advanced before He heard the boy no longer in the wind But when he marked the absence of Medore It seemed as if his heart was left behind Ah how was I so negligent the Moor Exclaimed so far beside myself and blind That I Medoro should without thee fare Nor know when I deserted thee or where So saying in the wood he disappears Plunging into the maze with hurried pace And thither whence he lately issued steers And desperate of death returns in trace Cries and the tread of steeds this while he hears And word and threat of foeman as in chase Lastly Medoro by his voice is known Disarmed on foot mid many horse alone A hundred horsemen who the youth surround Zerbino leads and bids his followers seize The stripling like a top the boy turns round And keeps him as he can among the trees Behind oak elm beech ash he takes his ground Nor from the cherished load his shoulders frees Wearied at length the burden he bestowed Upon the grass and stalked about his load As in her rocky cavern the she bear With whom close warfare Alpine hunters wage Uncertain hangs about her shaggy care And growls in mingled sound of love and rage To unsheath her claws and blood her tushes bare Would natural hate and wrath the beast engage Love softens her and bids from strife retire And for her offspring watch amid her ire Cloridane who to aid him knows not how And with Medoro willingly would die But who would not for death this being forego Until more foes than one should lifeless lie Ambushed his sharpest arrow to his bow Fits and directs it with so true an eye The feathered weapon bores a Scotchman s brain And lays the warrior dead upon the plain Together all the others of the band Turned thither whence was shot the murderous reed Meanwhile he launched another from his stand That a new foe might by the weapon bleed Whom while he made of this and that demand And loudly questioned who had done the deed The arrow reached transfixed the wretch s throat And cut his question short in middle note Zerbino captain of those horse no more Can at the piteous sight his wrath refrain In furious heat he springs upon Medore Exclaiming Thou of this shalt bear the pain One hand he in his locks of golden ore Enwreaths and drags him to himself amain But as his eyes that beauteous face survey Takes pity on the boy and does not slay To him the stripling turns with suppliant cry And By thy God sir knight exclaims I pray Be not so passing cruel nor deny That I in earth my honored king may lay No other grace I supplicate nor I This for the love of life believe me say So much no longer space of life I crave As may suffice to give my lord a grave And if you needs must feed the beast and bird Like Theban Creon let their worst be done Upon these limbs so that by me interred In earth be those of good Almontes s son Medoro thus his suit with grace preferred And words to move a mountain and so won Upon Zerbino s mood to kindness turned With love and pity he all over burned This while a churlish horseman of the band Who little deference for his lord confest His lance uplifting wounded overhand The unhappy suppliant in his dainty breast Zerbino who the cruel action scanned Was deeply stirred the rather that opprest And livid with the blow the churl had sped Medoro fell as he was wholly dead The Scots pursue their chief who pricks before Through the deep wood inspired by high disdain When he has left the one and the other Moor This dead that scarce alive upon the plain There for a mighty space lay young Medore Spouting his life blood from so large a vein He would have perished but that thither made A stranger as it chanced who lent him aid THE SAVING OF MEDORO From Orlando Furioso Canto nineteen By chance arrived a damsel at the place Who was though mean and rustic was her wear Of royal presence and of beauteous face And lofty manners sagely debonnair Her have I left unsung so long a space That you will hardly recognize the fair Angelica in her if known not scan The lofty daughter of Catay s great khan Angelica when she had won again The ring Brunello had from her conveyed So waxed in stubborn pride and haught disdain She seemed to scorn this ample world and strayed Alone and held as cheap each living swain Although amid the best by fame arrayed Nor brooked she to remember a gallant In Count Orlando or King Sacripant And above every other deed repented That good Rinaldo she had loved of yore And that to look so low she had consented As by such choice dishonored grieved her sore Love hearing this such arrogance resented And would the damsel s pride endure no more Where young Medoro lay he took his stand And waited her with bow and shaft in hand When fair Angelica the stripling spies Nigh hurt to death in that disastrous fray Who for his king that there unsheltered lies More sad than for his own misfortune lay She feels new pity in her bosom rise Which makes its entry in unwonted way Touched was her naughty heart once hard and curst And more when he his piteous tale rehearsed And calling back to memory her art For she in Ind had learned chirurgery Since it appears such studies in that part Worthy of praise and fame are held to be And as an heirloom sires to sons impart With little aid of books the mystery Disposed herself to work with simples juice Till she in him should healthier life produce And recollects an herb had caught her sight In passing thither on a pleasant plain What whether dittany or pancy hight I know not fraught with virtue to restrain The crimson blood forth welling and of might To sheathe each perilous and piercing pain She found it near and having pulled the weed Returned to seek Medoro on the mead Returning she upon a swain did light Who was on horseback passing through the wood Strayed from the lowing herd the rustic wight A heifer missing for two days pursued Him she with her conducted where the might Of the faint youth was ebbing with his blood Which had the ground about so deeply dyed Life was nigh wasted with the gushing tide Angelica alights upon the ground And he her rustic comrade at her best She hastened twixt two stones the herb to pound Then took it and the healing juice exprest With this did she foment the stripling s wound And even to the hips his waist and breast And with such virtue was the salve endued It stanched his life blood and his strength renewed And into him infused such force again That he could mount the horse the swain conveyed But good Medoro would not leave the plain Till he in earth had seen his master laid He with the monarch buried Cloridane And after followed whither pleased the maid Who was to stay with him by pity led Beneath the courteous shepherd s humble shed Nor would the damsel quit the lowly pile So she esteemed the youth till he was sound Such pity first she felt when him erewhile She saw outstretched and bleeding on the ground Touched by his mien and manners next a file She felt corrode her heart with secret wound She felt corrode her heart and with desire By little and by little warmed took fire The shepherd dwelt between two mountains hoar In goodly cabin in the greenwood shade With wife and children in short time before The brand new shed had builded in the glade Here of his grisly wound the youthful Moor Was briefly healed by the Catayan maid But who in briefer space a sorer smart Than young Medoro s suffered at her heart She pines for love of him and at length makes her love known They solemnize their marriage and remain a month there with great happiness Amid such pleasures where with tree o ergrown Ran stream or bubbling fountain s wave did spin On bark or rock if yielding were the stone The knife was straight at work or ready pin And there without in thousand places lone And in as many places graved within Medoro and Angelica were traced In divers ciphers quaintly interlaced When she believed they had prolonged their stay More than enow the damsel made design In India to revisit her Catay And with its crown Medoro s head entwine She had upon her wrist an armlet gay With costly gems in witness and in sign Of love to her by Count Orlando borne And which the damsel for long time had worn No love which to the paladin she bears But that it costly is and wrought with care This to Angelica so much endears That never more esteemed was matter rare This she was suffered in the isle of tears I know not by what privilege to wear When naked to the whale exposed for food By that inhospitable race and rude She not possessing wherewithal to pay The kindly couple s hospitality Served by them in their cabin from the day She there was lodged with such fidelity Unfastened from her arm the bracelet gay And bade them keep it for her memory Departing hence the lovers climb the side Of hills which fertile France from Spain divide THE MADNESS OF ORLANDO From Orlando Furioso Canto twenty three The course in pathless woods which without rein The Tartar s charger had pursued astray Made Roland for two days with fruitless pain Follow him without tidings of his way Orlando reached a rill of crystal vein On either bank of which a meadow lay Which stained with native hues and rich he sees And dotted o er with fair and many trees The mid day fervor made the shelter sweet To hardy herd as well as naked swain So that Orlando well beneath the heat Some deal might wince opprest with plate and chain He entered for repose the cool retreat And found it the abode of grief and pain And place of sojourn more accursed and fell On that unhappy day than tongue can tell Turning him round he there on many a tree Beheld engraved upon the woody shore What as the writing of his deity He knew as soon as he had marked the lore This was a place of those described by me Whither oft times attended by Medore From the near shepherd s cot had wont to stray The beauteous lady sovereign of Catay In a hundred knots amid these green abodes In a hundred parts their ciphered names are dight Whose many letters are so many goads Which Love has in his bleeding heart core pight He would discredit in a thousand modes That which he credits in his own despite And would perforce persuade himself that rind Other Angelica than his had signed And yet I know these characters he cried Of which I have so many read and seen By her may this Medoro be belied And me she figured in the name may mean Feeding on such like phantasies beside The real truth did sad Orlando lean Upon the empty hope though ill contented Which he by self illusions had fomented But stirred and aye rekindled it the more That he to quench the ill suspicion wrought Like the incautious bird by fowler s lore Hampered in net or lime which in the thought To free its tangled pinions and to soar By struggling is but more securely caught Orlando passes thither where a mountain O erhangs in guise of arch the crystal fountain Here from his horse the sorrowing county lit And at the entrance of the grot surveyed A cloud of words which seemed but newly writ And which the young Medoro s hand had made On the great pleasure he had known in it This sentence he in verses had arrayed Which to his tongue I deem might make pretense To polished phrase and such in ours the sense Gay plants green herbage rill of limpid vein And grateful with cool shade thou gloomy cave Where oft by many wooed with fruitless pain Beauteous Angelica the child of grave King Galaphron within my arms has lain For the convenient harborage you gave I poor Medoro can but in my lays As recompense forever sing your praise And any loving lord devoutly pray Damsel and cavalier and every one Whom choice or fortune hither shall convey Stranger or native to this crystal run Shade caverned rock and grass and plants to say Benignant be to you the fostering sun And moon and may the choir of nymphs provide That never swain his flock may hither guide In Arabic was writ the blessing said Known to Orlando like the Latin tongue Who versed in many languages best read Was in this speech which oftentimes from wrong And injury and shame had saved his head What time he roved the Saracens among But let him boast not of its former boot O erbalanced by the present bitter fruit Three times and four and six the lines impressed Upon the stone that wretch perused in vain Seeking another sense than was expressed And ever saw the thing more clear and plain And all the while within his troubled breast He felt an icy hand his heart core strain With mind and eyes close fastened on the block At length he stood not differing from the rock Then well nigh lost all feeling so a prey Wholly was he to that o ermastering woe This is a pang believe the experienced say Of him who speaks which does all griefs outgo His pride had from his forehead passed away His chin had fallen upon his breast below Nor found he so grief barred each natural vent Moisture for tears or utterance for lament Stifled within the impetuous sorrow stays Which would too quickly issue so to abide Water is seen imprisoned in the vase Whose neck is narrow and whose swell is wide What time when one turns up the inverted base Toward the mouth so hastes the hurrying tide And in the strait encounters such a stop It scarcely works a passage drop by drop He somewhat to himself returned and thought How possibly the thing might be untrue That some one so he hoped desired and sought To think his lady would with shame pursue Or with such weight of jealousy had wrought To whelm his reason as should him undo And that he whosoe er the thing had planned Had counterfeited passing well her hand With such vain hope he sought himself to cheat And manned some deal his spirits and awoke Then prest the faithful Brigliadoro s seat As on the sun s retreat his sister broke Not far the warrior had pursued his beat Ere eddying from a roof he saw the smoke Heard noise of dog and kine a farm espied And thitherward in quest of lodging hied Languid he lit and left his Brigliador To a discreet attendant one undrest His limbs one doffed the golden spurs he wore And one bore off to clean his iron vest This was the homestead where the young Medore Lay wounded and was here supremely blest Orlando here with other food unfed Having supt full of sorrow sought his bed Little availed the count his self deceit For there was one who spake of it unsought The shepherd swain who to allay the heat With which he saw his guest so troubled thought The tale which he was wonted to repeat Of the two lovers to each listener taught A history which many loved to hear He now without reserve gan tell the peer How at Angelica s persuasive prayer He to his farm had carried young Medore Grievously wounded with an arrow where In little space she healed the angry sore But while she exercised this pious care Love in her heart the lady wounded more And kindled from small spark so fierce a fire She burnt all over restless with desire Nor thinking she of mightiest king was born Who ruled in the East nor of her heritage Forced by too puissant love had thought no scorn To be the consort of a poor foot page His story done to them in proof was borne The gem which in reward for harborage To her extended in that kind abode Angelica at parting had bestowed In him forthwith such deadly hatred breed That bed that house that swain he will not stay Till the morn break or till the dawn succeed Whose twilight goes before approaching day In haste Orlando takes his arms and steed And to the deepest greenwood wends his way And when assured that he is there alone Gives utterance to his grief in shriek and groan Never from tears never from sorrowing He paused nor found he peace by night or day He fled from town in forest harboring And in the open air on hard earth lay He marveled at himself how such a spring Of water from his eyes could stream away And breath was for so many sobs supplied And thus oft times amid his mourning cried I am not am not what I seem to sight What Roland was is dead and under ground Slain by that most ungrateful lady s spite Whose faithlessness inflicted such a wound Divided from the flesh I am his sprite Which in this hell tormented walks its round To be but in its shadow left above A warning to all such as trust in love All night about the forest roved the count And at the break of daily light was brought By his unhappy fortune to the fount Where his inscription young Medoro wrought To see his wrongs inscribed upon that mount Inflamed his fury so in him was naught But turned to hatred frenzy rage and spite Nor paused he more but bared his falchion bright Cleft through the writing and the solid block Into the sky in tiny fragments sped Woe worth each sapling and that caverned rock Where Medore and Angelica were read So scathed that they to shepherd or to flock Thenceforth shall never furnish shade or bed And that sweet fountain late so clear and pure From such tempestous wrath was ill secure So fierce his rage so fierce his fury grew That all obscured remained the warrior s sprite Nor for forgetfulness his sword he drew Or wondrous deeds I trow had wrought the knight But neither this nor bill nor axe to hew Was needed by Orlando s peerless might He of his prowess gave high proofs and full Who a tall pine uprooted at a pull He many others with as little let As fennel wall wort stem or dill uptore And ilex knotted oak and fir upset And beech and mountain ash and elm tree hoar He did what fowler ere he spreads his net Does to prepare the champaign for his lore By stubble rush and nettle stalk and broke Like these old sturdy trees and stems of oak The shepherd swains who hear the tumult nigh Leaving their flocks beneath the greenwood tree Some here some there across the forest hie And hurry thither all the cause to see But I have reached such point my history If I o erpass this bound may irksome be And I my story will delay to end Rather than by my tediousness offend ARISTOPHANES B C four hundred forty eight three hundred eighty BY PAUL SHOREY The birth year of Aristophanes is placed about four hundred forty eight B C on the ground that he is said to have been almost a boy when his first comedy was presented in four hundred twenty seven His last play the Plutus was produced in three hundred eighty eight and there is no evidence that he long survived this date Little is known of his life beyond the allusions in the Parabases of the Acharnians Knights and Wasps to his prosecution by Cleon to his own or his father s estate at Aegina and to his premature baldness He left three sons who also wrote comedies Aristophanes is the sole extant representative of the so called Old Comedy of Athens a form of dramatic art which developed obscurely under the shadow of Attic Tragedy in the first half of the fifth century B C out of the rustic revelry of the Phallic procession and Comus song of Dionysus perhaps with some outside suggestions from the Megarian farce and its Sicilian offshoot the mythological court comedy of Epicharmus The chief note of this older comedy for the ancient critics was its unbridled license of direct personal satire and invective Eupolis Cratinus and Aristophanes says Horace assailed with the utmost freedom any one who deserved to be branded with infamy This old political Comedy was succeeded in the calmer times that followed the Peloponnesian War by the so called Middle Comedy three hundred ninety three hundred twenty of Alexis Antiphanes Strattis and some minor men which insensibly passed into the New Comedy three hundred twenty two hundred fifty of Menander and Philemon known to us in the reproductions of Terence And this new comedy which portrayed types of private life instead of satirizing noted persons by name and which as Aristotle says produced laughter by innuendo rather than by scurrility was preferred to the terrible graces of her elder sister by the gentle and refined Plutarch or the critic who has usurped his name in the Comparison of Aristophanes and Menander The old Attic Comedy has been variously compared to Charivari Punch the comic opera of Offenbach and a Parisian revue de fin d annee There is no good modern analogue It is not our comedy of manners plot and situation nor yet is it mere buffoonery It is a peculiar mixture of broad political social and literary satire and polemical discussion of large ideas with the burlesque and licentious extravagances that were deemed the most acceptable service at the festival of the laughter loving tongue loosening god of the vine Illustration ARISTOPHANES The typical plan of an Aristophanic comedy is very simple The protagonist undertakes in all apparent seriousness to give a local habitation and a body to some ingenious fancy airy speculation or bold metaphor as for example the procuring of a private peace for a citizen who is weary of the privations of war or the establishment of a city in Cloud Cuckoo Land where the birds shall regulate things better than the featherless biped man or the restoration of the eyesight of the proverbially blind god of Wealth The attention of the audience is at once enlisted for the semblance of a plot by which the scheme is put into execution The design once effected the remainder of the play is given over to a series of loosely connected scenes ascending to a climax of absurdity in which the consequences of the original happy thought are followed out with a Swiftian verisimilitude of piquant detail and a Rabelaisian license of uproarious mirth It rests with the audience to take the whole as pure extravaganza or as a reductio ad absurdum or playful defense of the conception underlying the original idea In the intervals between the scenes the chorus sing rollicking topical songs or bits of exquisite lyric or in the name of the poet directly exhort and admonish the audience in the so called Parabasis Of Aristophanes s first two plays the Banqueters of Hercules four hundred twenty seven and the Babylonians four hundred twenty six only fragments remain The impolitic representation in the latter of the Athenian allies as branded Babylonian slaves was the ground of Cleon s attack in the courts upon Aristophanes or Callistratus in whose name the play was produced The extant plays are the following The Acharnians B C four hundred twenty five shortly after the Athenian defeat at Delium The worthy countryman Dicaeopolis weary of being cooped up within the Long Walls and disgusted with the shameless jobbery of the politicians sends to Sparta for samples of peace the Greek word means also libations of different vintages The Thirty Years brand smells of nectar and ambrosia He accepts it concludes a private treaty for himself and friends and proceeds to celebrate the rural Dionysia with wife and child soothing by an eloquent plea pronounced in tattered tragic vestments borrowed from Euripides the anger of the chorus of choleric Acharnian charcoal burners exasperated at the repeated devastation of their deme by the Spartans He then opens a market to which a jolly Boeotian brings the long lost thrice desired Copaic eel while a starveling Megarian to the huge delight of the Athenian groundlings sells his little daughters disguised as pigs for a peck of salt Finally Dicaeopolis goes forth to a wedding banquet from which he returns very mellow in the company of two flute girls while Lamachus the head of the war party issues forth to do battle with the Boeotians in the snow and comes back with a bloody coxcomb This play was successfully given in Greek by the students of the University of Pennsylvania in the spring of eighteen eighty six and interestingly discussed in the Nation of May sixth by Professor Gildersleeve The Knights B C four hundred twenty four named from the chorus of young Athenian cavaliers who abet the sausage seller Agoracritus egged on by the discontented family servants the generals Nicias and Demosthenes to outbid with shameless flattery the rascally Paphlagonian steward Cleon and supplant him in the favor of their testy bean fed old master Demos or People At the close Demos recovers his wits and his youth and is revealed sitting enthroned in his glory in the good old Marathonian Athens of the Violet Crown The prolongation of the billingsgate in the contest between Cleon and the sausage seller grows wearisome to modern taste but the portrait of the Demagogue is for all time The Clouds B C four hundred twenty three an attack on Socrates unfairly taken as an embodiment of the deleterious and unsettling new learning both in the form of Sophistical rhetoric and meteorological speculation Worthy Strepsiades eager to find a new way to pay the debts in which the extravagance of his horse racing son Pheidippides has involved him seeks to enter the youth as a student in the Thinking shop or Reflectory of Socrates that he may learn to make the worse appear the better reason and so baffle his creditors before a jury The young man after much demur and the ludicrous failure of his father who at first matriculates in his stead consents He listens to the pleas of the just and unjust argument in behalf of the old and new education and becomes himself such a proficient that he demonstrates in flawless reasoning that Euripides is a better poet than Aeschylus and that a boy is justified in beating his father for affirming the contrary Strepsiades thereupon cured of his folly undertakes a subtle investigation into the timbers of the roof of the Reflectory with a view to smoking out the corrupters of youth Many of the songs sung by or to the clouds the patron deities of Socrates s misty lore are extremely beautiful Socrates is made to allude to these attacks of comedy by Plato in the Apology and on his last day in prison in the Phaedo In the Symposium or Banquet of Plato Aristophanes bursts in upon a company of friends with whom Socrates is feasting and drinks with them till morning while Socrates forces him and the tragic poet Agathon both of them very sleepy to admit that the true dramatic artist will excel in both tragedy and comedy The Wasps B C four hundred twenty two a jeu d esprit turning on the Athenian passion for litigation Young Bdelucleon hate Cleon can keep his old father Philocleon love Cleon out of the courts only by instituting a private court in his own house The first culprit the house dog is tried for stealing a Sicilian cheese and acquitted by Philocleon s mistaking the urn of acquittal for that of condemnation The old man is inconsolable at the first escape of a victim from his clutches but finally renouncing his folly takes lessons from his exquisite of a son in the manners and deportment of a fine gentleman He then attends a dinner party where he betters his instructions with comic exaggeration and returns home in high feather singing tipsy catches and assaulting the watch on his way The chorus of Wasps the visible embodiment of a metaphor found also in Plato s Republic symbolizes the sting used by the Athenian jurymen to make the rich disgorge a portion of their gathered honey The Plaideurs of Racine is an imitation of this play and the motif of the committal of the dog is borrowed by Ben Jonson in the Staple of News The Peace B C four hundred twenty one in support of the Peace of Nicias ratified soon afterward Grote s History of Greece Vol vi page four hundred ninety two Trygaeus an honest vine dresser yearning for his farm in parody of the Bellerophon of Euripides ascends to heaven on a dung beetle He there hauls Peace from the bottom of the well into which she had been cast by Ares and brings her home in triumph to Greece when she inaugurates a reign of plenty and uproarious jollity and celebrates the nuptials of Trygaeus and her handmaid Opora Harvest home The Birds B C four hundred fourteen Peisthetaerus Plausible and Euelpides Hopeful whose names and deeds are perhaps a satire on the unbounded ambition that brought ruin on Athens at Syracuse journey to Birdland and persuade King Hoopoe to induce the birds to build Nephelococcygia or Cloud Cuckoo Burgh in the air between the gods and men starve out the gods with a Melian famine and rule the world themselves The gods their supplies of incense cut off are forced to treat and Peisthetaerus receives in marriage Basileia Sovereignty the daughter of Zeus The mise en scene with the gorgeous plumage of the bird chorus must have been very impressive and many of the choric songs are exceedingly beautiful There is an interesting account by Professor Jebb in the Fortnightly Review Vol xli of a performance of The Birds at Cambridge in eighteen eighty four Two plays B C four hundred eleven one at the Lenaea The Lysistrata in which the women of Athens and Sparta by a secession from bed and board compel their husbands to end the war two The Thesmophoriazusae or Women s Festival of Demeter a licentious but irresistibly funny assault upon Euripides The tragedian learning that the women in council assembled are debating on the punishment due to his misogyny implores the effeminate poet Agathon to intercede for him That failing he dispatches his kinsman Mnesilochus disguised with singed beard and woman s robes a sight to shake the midriff of despair with laughter to plead his cause The advocate s excess of zeal betrays him he is arrested and the remainder of the play is occupied by the ludicrous devices borrowed or parodied from well known Euripidean tragedies by which the poet endeavors to rescue his intercessor The Frogs B C four hundred five in the brief respite of hope between the victory of Arginusae and the final overthrow of Athens at AEgospotami Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides are dead The minor bards are a puny folk and Dionysus is resolved to descend to Hades in quest of a truly creative poet one capable of a figure like my star god s glow worm or His honor rooted in dishonor stood After many surprising adventures by the way and in the outer precincts of the underworld accompanied by his Sancho Panza Xanthias he arrives at the court of Pluto just in time to be chosen arbitrator of the great contest between Aeschylus and Euripides for the tragic throne in Hades The comparisons and parodies of the styles of Aeschylus and Euripides that follow constitute in spite of their comic exaggeration one of the most entertaining and discriminating chapters of literary criticism extant and give us an exalted idea of the intelligence of the audience that appreciated them Dionysus decides for AEschylus and leads him back in triumph to the upper world The Ecclesiazusae or Ladies in Parliament B C three hundred ninety three apparently a satire on the communistic theories which must have been current in the discussions of the schools before they found definite expression in Plato s Republic The ladies of Athens rise betimes purloin their husbands hats and canes pack the Assembly and pass a measure to intrust the reins of government to women An extravagant and licentious communism is the result The Plutus B C three hundred eighty eight a second and much altered edition of a play represented for the first time in four hundred eight With the Ecclesiazusae it marks the transition to the Middle Comedy there being no parabasis and little of the exuberant verve of the older pieces The blind god of Wealth recovers his eyesight by sleeping in the temple of AEsculapius and proceeds to distribute the gifts of fortune more equitably The assignment of the dates and restoration of the plots of the thirty two lost plays of which a few not very interesting fragments remain belong to the domain of conjectural erudition Aristophanes has been regarded by some critics as a grave moral censor veiling his high purpose behind the grinning mask of comedy by others as a buffoon of genius whose only object was to raise a laugh Both sides of the question are ingeniously and copiously argued in Browning s Aristophanes Apology and there is a judicious summing up of the case of Aristophanes vs Euripides in Professor Jebb s lectures on Greek poetry The soberer view seems to be that while predominantly a comic artist obeying the instincts of his genius he did frequently make his comedy the vehicle of an earnest conservative polemic against the new spirit of the age in Literature Philosophy and Politics He pursued Euripides with relentless ridicule because his dramatic motives lent themselves to parody and his lines were on the lips of every theatre goer but also because he believed that Euripides had spoiled the old stately heroic art of Aeschylus and Sophocles by incongruous infusions of realism and sentimentalism and had debased the large utterance of the early gods by an unhallowed mixture of colloquialism dialectic and chicane Aristophanes travestied the teachings of Socrates because his ungainly figure and the oddity atopia attributed to him even by Plato made him an excellent butt yet also because he felt strongly that it was better for the young Athenian to spend his days in the Palaestra or where the elm tree whispers to the plane than in filing a contentious tongue on barren logomachies That Socrates in fact discussed only ethical problems and disclaimed all sympathy with speculations about things above our heads made no difference he was the best human embodiment of a hateful educational error And similarly the assault upon Cleon the pun pelleting of demagogues from Pnux was partly due to the young aristocrat s instinctive aversion to the coarse popular leader and to the broad mark which the latter presented to the shafts of satire but equally perhaps to a genuine patriotic revolt at the degradation of Athenian politics in the hands of the successors of Pericles But Aristophanes s ideas interest us less than his art and humor We have seen the nature of his plots In such a topsy turvy world there is little opportunity for nice delineation of character His personages are mainly symbols or caricatures Yet they are vividly if broadly sketched and genuine touches of human nature lend verisimilitude to their most improbable actions One or two traditional comic types appear for the first time apparently on his stage the alternately cringing and familiar slave or valet of comedy in his Xanthias and Karion and in Dicaeopolis Strepsiades Demos Trygaeus and Dionysus the sensual jovial shrewd yet naive and credulous middle aged bourgeois gentilhomme or Sganarelle who is not ashamed to avow his poltroonery and yet can on occasion maintain his rights with sturdy independence But the chief attraction of Aristophanes is the abounding comic force and verve of his style It resembles an impetuous torrent whose swift rush purifies in its flow the grossness and obscenity inseparable from the origin of comedy and buoys up and sweeps along on the current of fancy and improvisation the chaff and dross of vulgar jests puns scurrilous personalities and cheap gags allowing no time for chilling reflections or criticism Jests which are singly feeble combine to induce a mood of extravagant hilarity when huddled upon us with such impossible conveyance This vivida vis animi can hardly be reproduced in a translation and disappears altogether in an attempt at an abstract enumeration of the poet s inexhaustible devices for comic effect He himself repeatedly boasts of the fertility of his invention and claims to have discarded the coarse farce of his predecessors for something more worthy of the refined intelligence of his clever audience Yet it must be acknowledged that much even of his wit is the mere filth throwing of a naughty boy or at best the underbred jocularity of the funny column the topical song or the minstrel show There are puns on the names of notable personages a grotesque fantastic punning fauna flora and geography of Greece a constant succession of surprises effected by the sudden substitution of low or incongruous terms in proverbs quotations and legal or religious formulas scenes in dialect scenes of excellent fooling in the vein of Uncle Toby and the Clown girds at the audience personalities that for us have lost their point about Cleonymus the caster away of shields or Euripides s herb selling mother and everywhere unstinted service to the great gods Priapus and Cloacina A finer instrument of comic effect is the parody The countless parodies of the lyric and dramatic literature of Greece are perhaps the most remarkable testimony extant to the intelligence of an Athenian audience Did they infallibly catch the allusion when Dicaeopolis welcomed back to the Athenian fish market the long lost Copaic eel in high AEschylean strain Of fifty nymphs Copaic alderliefest queen and then his voice breaking with the intolerable pathos of Admetus s farewell to the dying Alcestis added Yea even in death Thou lieutenant bide with me embalmed and beet bestewed Did they recognize the blasphemous Pindaric pun in Helle s holy straits for a tight place and appreciate all the niceties of diction metre and dramatic art discriminated in the comparison between Aeschylus and Euripides in the Frogs At any rate no Athenian could miss the fun of Dicaeopolis like Hector s baby scared at the dazzling plume and nodding crest of the swashbuckler Lamachus of Philocleon clinging to his ass s belly like Odysseus escaping under the ram from the Cyclops s cave of the baby in the Thesmophoriazusae seized as a Euripidean hostage and turning out a wine bottle in swaddling clothes of light foot Iris in the role of a saucy frightened soubrette of the heaven defying AEschylean Prometheus hiding under an umbrella from the thunderbolts of Zeus And they must have felt instinctively what only a laborious erudition reveals to us the sudden subtle modulations of the colloquial comic verse into mock heroic travesty of high tragedy or lyric Euripides the chief victim of Aristophanes s genius for parody was so burlesqued that his best known lines became by words and his most ardent admirers the very Balaustions and Euthukleses must have grinned when they heard them like a pair of augurs If we conceive five or six Shakespearean comedies filled from end to end with ancient Pistols hallooing to pampered jades of Asia and doctor Caiuses chanting of a thousand vagrom posies we may form some idea of Aristophanes s handling of the notorious lines The tongue has sworn the mind remains unsworn Thou lovest life thy sire loves it too Who knows if life and death be truly one But the charm of Aristophanes does not lie in any of these things singly but in the combination of ingenious and paradoxical fancy with an inexhaustible flow of apt language by which they are held up and borne out His personages are ready to make believe anything Nothing surprises them long They enter into the spirit of each new conceit and can always discover fresh analogies to bear it out The very plots of his plays are realized metaphors or embodied conceits And the same concrete vividness of imagination is displayed in single scenes and episodes The Better and the Worse Reason plead the causes of the old and new education in person Cleon and Brasidas are the pestles with which War proposes to bray Greece in a mortar the triremes of Athens in council assembled declare that they will rot in the docks sooner than yield their virginity to musty fusty Hyperbolus The fair cities of Greece stand about waiting for the recovery of Peace from her Well with dreadful black eyes poor things Armisticia and Harvest Home tread the stage in the flesh and Nincompoop and Defraudation are among the gods The special metaphor or conceit of each play attracts appropriate words and images and creates a distinct atmosphere of its own In the Knights the air fairly reeks with the smell of leather and the tanyard The Birds transport us to a world of trillings and pipings and beaks and feathers There is a buzzing and a humming and a stinging throughout the Wasps The Clouds drip with mist and are dim with aerial vaporous effects Aristophanes was the original inventor of Bob Acres s style of oath the so called referential or sentimental swearing Dicaeopolis invokes Ecbatana when Shamartabas struts upon the stage Socrates in the Clouds swears by the everlasting vapors King Hoopoe s favorite oath is Odds nets and birdlime And the vein of humor that lies in over ingenious elaborate and sustained metaphor was first worked in these comedies All these excellences are summed up in the incomparable wealth and flexibility of his vocabulary He has a Shakespearean mastery of the technicalities of every art and mystery an appalling command of billingsgate and of the language of the cuisine and would tire Falstaff and Prince Hal with base comparisons And not content with the existing resources of the Greek vocabulary he coins grotesque or beautiful compounds exquisite epithets like Botruodoere bestower of the vine heliomanes drunk with sunlight myriad flagoned phrases untranslatable port manteaus like plouthugieia health and wealthfulness and Gargantuan agglomerations of syllables like the portentous olla podrida at the end of the Ecclesiazusae The great comic writer as the example of Moliere proves need not be a poet But the mere overflow of careless poetic power which is manifested by Aristophanes would have sufficed to set up any ordinary tragedian or lyrist In plastic mastery of language only two Greek writers can vie with him Plato and Homer In the easy grace and native harmony of his verse he outsings all the tragedians even that Aeschylus whom he praised as the man who had written the most exquisite songs of any poet of the time In his blank verse he easily strikes every note from that of the urbane unaffected colloquial Attic to parody of high or subtle tragic diction hardly distinguishable from its model He can adapt his metres to the expression of every shade of feeling He has short snapping fiery trochees like sparks from their own holm oak to represent the choler of the Acharnians eager joyous glyconics to bundle up a sycophant and hustle him off the stage or for the young knights of Athens celebrating Phormio s sea fights and chanting horse taming Poseidon Pallas guardian of the State and Victory companion of the dance the quickstep march of the trochaic tetrameter to tell how the Attic wasps true children of the soil charged the Persians at Marathon and above all the chosen vehicle of his wildest conceits his most audacious fancies and his strongest appeals to the better judgment of the citizens the anapaestic tetrameter that resonant and triumphant metre of which even mister Swinburne s anapaests can reproduce only a faint and far off echo But he has more than the opulent diction and the singing voice of the poet He has the key to fairy land a feeling for nature which we thought romantic and modern and in his lyrics the native wood notes wild of his own Mousa lochmaia the muse of the coppice The chorus of the Mystae in the Frogs the rustic idyl of the Peace the songs of the girls in the Lysistrata the call of the nightingale the hymns of the Clouds the speech of the Just Reason and the grand chorus of birds reveal Aristophanes as not only the first comic writer of Greece but as one of the very greatest of her poets Among the many editions of Aristophanes those most useful to the student and the general reader are doubtless the text edited by Bergk two vols eighteen sixty seven and the translations of the five most famous plays by John Hookham Frere to be found in his complete works Illustration Signature PAUL SHOREY THE ORIGIN OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR From The Acharnians Frere s Translation DICAEOPOLIS Be not surprised most excellent spectators If I that am a beggar have presumed To claim an audience upon public matters Even in a comedy for comedy Is conversant in all the rules of justice And can distinguish betwixt right and wrong The words I speak are bold but just and true Cleon at least cannot accuse me now That I defame the city before strangers For this is the Lenaean festival And here we meet all by ourselves alone No deputies are arrived as yet with tribute No strangers or allies but here we sit A chosen sample clean as sifted corn With our own denizens as a kind of chaff First I detest the Spartans most extremely And wish that Neptune the Taenarian deity Would bury them in their houses with his earthquakes For I ve had losses losses let me tell ye Like other people vines cut down and injured But among friends for only friends are here Why should we blame the Spartans for all this For people of ours some people of our own Some people from among us here I mean But not the People pray remember that I never said the People but a pack Of paltry people mere pretended citizens Base counterfeits went laying informations And making a confiscation of the jerkins Imported here from Megara pigs moreover Pumpkins and pecks of salt and ropes of onions Were voted to be merchandise from Megara Denounced and seized and sold upon the spot Well these might pass as petty local matters But now behold some doughty drunken youths Kidnap and carry away from Megara The courtesan Simaetha Those of Megara In hot retaliation seize a brace Of equal strumpets hurried forth perforce From Dame Aspasia s house of recreation So this was the beginning of the war All over Greece owing to these three strumpets For Pericles like an Olympian Jove With all his thunder and his thunderbolts Began to storm and lighten dreadfully Alarming all the neighborhood of Greece And made decrees drawn up like drinking songs In which it was enacted and concluded That the Megarians should remain excluded From every place where commerce was transacted With all their ware like old Care in the ballad And this decree by land and sea was valid Then the Megarians being all half starved Desired the Spartans to desire of us Just to repeal those laws the laws I mentioned Occasioned by the stealing of those strumpets And so they begged and prayed us several times And we refused and so they went to war THE POET S APOLOGY From The Acharnians Frere s Translation Our poet has never as yet Esteemed it proper or fit To detain you with a long Encomiastic song On his own superior wit But being abused and accused And attacked of late As a foe of the State He makes an appeal in his proper defense To your voluble humor and temper and sense With the following plea Namely that he Never attempted or ever meant To scandalize In any wise Your mighty imperial government Moreover he says That in various ways He presumes to have merited honor and praise Exhorting you still to stick to your rights And no more to be fooled with rhetorical flights Such as of late each envoy tries On the behalf of your allies That come to plead their cause before ye With fulsome phrase and a foolish story Of violet crowns and Athenian glory With sumptuous Athens at every word Sumptuous Athens is always heard Sumptuous ever a suitable phrase For a dish of meat or a beast at graze He therefore affirms In confident terms That his active courage and earnest zeal Have usefully served your common weal He has openly shown The style and tone Of your democracy ruling abroad He has placed its practices on record The tyrannical arts the knavish tricks That poison all your politics Therefore shall we see this year The allies with tribute arriving here Eager and anxious all to behold Their steady protector the bard so bold The bard they say that has dared to speak To attack the strong to defend the weak His fame in foreign climes is heard And a singular instance lately occurred It occurred in the case of the Persian king Sifting and cross examining The Spartan envoys He demanded Which of the rival States commanded The Grecian seas He asked them next Wishing to see them more perplexed Which of the two contending powers Was chiefly abused by this bard of ours For he said Such a bold so profound an adviser By dint of abuse would render them wiser More active and able and briefly that they Must finally prosper and carry the day Now mark the Lacedaemonian guile Demanding an insignificant isle AEgina they say for a pledge of peace As a means to make all jealousy cease Meanwhile their privy design and plan Is solely to gain this marvelous man Knowing his influence on your fate By obtaining a hold on his estate Situate in the isle aforesaid Therefore there needs to be no more said You know their intention and know that you know it You ll keep to your island and stick to the poet And he for his part Will practice his art With a patriot heart With the honest views That he now pursues And fair buffoonery and abuse Not rashly bespattering or basely beflattering Not pimping or puffing or acting the ruffian Not sneaking or fawning But openly scorning All menace and warning All bribes and suborning He will do his endeavor on your behalf He will teach you to think he will teach you to laugh So Cleon again and again may try I value him not nor fear him I His rage and rhetoric I defy His impudence his politics His dirty designs his rascally tricks No stain of abuse on me shall fix Justice and right in his despite Shall aid and attend me and do me right With these to friend I ne er will bend Nor descend To a humble tone Like his own As a sneaking loon A knavish slavish poor poltroon THE APPEAL OF THE CHORUS From The Knights Frere s Translation If A veteran author had wished to engage Our assistance to day for a speech from the stage We scarce should have granted so bold a request But this author of ours as the bravest and best Deserves an indulgence denied to the rest For the courage and vigor the scorn and the hate With which he encounters the pests of the State A thoroughbred seaman intrepid and warm Steering outright in the face of the storm But now for the gentle reproaches he bore On the part of his friends for refraining before To embrace the profession embarking for life In theatrical storms and poetical strife He begs us to state that for reasons of weight He has lingered so long and determined so late For he deemed the achievements of comedy hard The boldest attempt of a desperate bard The Muse he perceived was capricious and coy Though many were courting her few could enjoy And he saw without reason from season to season Your humor would shift and turn poets adrift Requiting old friends with unkindness and treason Discarded in scorn as exhausted and worn Seeing Magnes s fate who was reckoned of late For the conduct of comedy captain and head That so oft on the stage in the flower of his age Had defeated the Chorus his rivals had led With his sounds of all sort that were uttered in sport With whims and vagaries unheard of before With feathers and wings and a thousand gay things That in frolicsome fancies his Choruses wore When his humor was spent did your temper relent To requite the delight that he gave you before We beheld him displaced and expelled and disgraced When his hair and his wit were grown aged and hoar Then he saw for a sample the dismal example Of noble Cratinus so splendid and ample Full of spirit and blood and enlarged like a flood Whose copious current tore down with its torrent Oaks ashes and yew with the ground where they grew And his rivals to boot wrenched up by the root And his personal foes who presumed to oppose All drowned and abolished dispersed and demolished And drifted headlong with a deluge of song And his airs and his tunes and his songs and lampoons Were recited and sung by the old and the young At our feasts and carousals what poet but he And The fair Amphibribe and The Sycophant Tree Masters and masons and builders of verse Those were the tunes that all tongues could rehearse But since in decay you have cast him away Stript of his stops and his musical strings Battered and shattered a broken old instrument Shoved out of sight among rubbishy things His garlands are faded and what he deems worst His tongue and his palate are parching with thirst And now you may meet him alone in the street Wearied and worn tattered and torn All decayed and forlorn in his person and dress Whom his former success should exempt from distress With subsistence at large at the general charge And a seat with the great at the table of State There to feast every day and preside at the play In splendid apparel triumphant and gay Seeing Crates the next always teased and perplexed With your tyrannous temper tormented and vexed That with taste and good sense without waste or expense From his snug little hoard provided your board With a delicate treat economic and neat Thus hitting or missing with crowns or with hissing Year after year he pursued his career For better or worse till he finished his course These precedents held him in long hesitation He replied to his friends with a just observation That a seaman in regular order is bred To the oar to the helm and to look out ahead With diligent practice has fixed in his mind The signs of the weather and changes of wind And when every point of the service is known Undertakes the command of a ship of his own For reasons like these If your judgment agrees That he did not embark Like an ignorant spark Or a troublesome lout To puzzle and bother and blunder about Give him a shout At his first setting out And all pull away With a hearty huzza For success to the play Send him away Smiling and gay Shining and florid With his bald forehead THE CLOUD CHORUS From The Clouds Andrew Lang s Translation SOCRATES SPEAKS Hither come hither ye Clouds renowned and unveil yourselves here Come though ye dwell on the sacred crests of Olympian snow Or whether ye dance with the Nereid Choir in the gardens clear Or whether your golden urns are dipped in Nile s overflow Or whether you dwell by Maeotis mere Or the snows of Mimas arise appear And hearken to us and accept our gifts ere ye rise and go THE CLOUDS SING Immortal Clouds from the echoing shore Of the father of streams from the sounding sea Dewy and fleet let us rise and soar Dewy and gleaming and fleet are we Let us look on the tree clad mountain crest On the sacred earth where the fruits rejoice On the waters that murmur east and west On the tumbling sea with his moaning voice For unwearied glitters the Eye of the Air And the bright rays gleam Then cast we our shadows of mist and fare In our deathless shapes to glance everywhere From the height of the heaven on the land and air And the Ocean Stream Let us on ye Maidens that bring the Rain Let us gaze on Pallas s citadel In the country of Cecrops fair and dear The mystic land of the holy cell Where the Rites unspoken securely dwell And the gifts of the gods that know not stain And a people of mortals that know not fear For the temples tall and the statues fair And the feasts of the gods are holiest there The feasts of Immortals the chaplets of flowers And the Bromian mirth at the coming of spring And the musical voices that fill the hours And the dancing feet of the maids that sing GRAND CHORUS OF BIRDS From The Birds Swinburne s Translation Come on then ye dwellers by nature in darkness and like to the leaves generations That are little of might that are molded of mire unenduring and shadowlike nations Poor plumeless ephemerals comfortless mortals as visions of shadows fast fleeing Lift up your mind unto us that are deathless and dateless the date of our being Us children of heaven us ageless for aye us all of whose thoughts are eternal That ye may from henceforth having heard of us all things aright as to matters supernal Of the being of birds and beginning of gods and of streams and the dark beyond reaching Trustfully knowing aright in my name bid Prodicus pack with his preaching It was Chaos and Night at the first and the blackness of darkness and Hell s broad border Earth was not nor air neither heaven when in depths of the womb of the dark without order First thing first born of the black plumed Night was a wind egg hatched in her bosom Whence timely with seasons revolving again sweet Love burst out as a blossom Gold wings glittering forth of his back like whirlwinds gustily turning He after his wedlock with Chaos whose wings are of darkness in Hell broad burning For his nestlings begat him the race of us first and upraised us to light new lighted And before this was not the race of the gods until all things by Love were united And of kind united in kind with communion of nature the sky and the sea are Brought forth and the earth and the race of the gods everlasting and blest So that we are Far away the most ancient of all things blest And that we are of Love s generation There are manifest manifold signs We have wings and with us have the Loves habitation And manifold fair young folk that forswore love once ere the bloom of them ended Have the men that pursued and desired them subdued by the help of us only befriended With such baits as a quail a flamingo a goose or a cock s comb staring and splendid All best good things that befall men come from us birds as is plain to all reason For first we proclaim and make known to them spring and the winter and autumn in season Bid sow when the crane starts clanging for Afric in shrill voiced emigrant number And calls to the pilot to hang up his rudder again for the season and slumber And then weave a cloak for Orestes the thief lest he strip men of theirs if it freezes And again thereafter the kite reappearing announces a change in the breezes And that here is the season for shearing your sheep of their spring wool Then does the swallow Give you notice to sell your great coat and provide something light for the heat that s to follow Thus are we as Ammon or Delphi unto you Dodona nay Phoebus Apollo For as first ye come all to get auguries of birds even such is in all things your carriage Be the matter a matter of trade or of earning your bread or of any one s marriage And all things ye lay to the charge of a bird that belong to discerning prediction Winged fame is a bird as you reckon you sneeze and the sign s as a bird for conviction All tokens are birds with you sounds too and lackeys and donkeys Then must it not follow That we are to you all as the manifest godhead that speaks in prophetic Apollo A RAINY DAY ON THE FARM From The Peace Frere s Translation How sweet it is to see the new sown cornfield fresh and even With blades just springing from the soil that only ask a shower from heaven Then while kindly rains are falling indolently to rejoice Till some worthy neighbor calling cheers you with his hearty voice Well with weather such as this let us hear Trygaeus tell us What should you and I be doing You re the king of us good fellows Since it pleases heaven to prosper your endeavors friend and mine Let us have a merry meeting with some friendly talk and wine In the vineyard there s your lout hoeing in the slop and mud Send the wench and call him out this weather he can do no good Dame take down two pints of meal and do some fritters in your way Boil some grain and stir it in and let us have those figs I say Send a servant to my house any one that you can spare Let him fetch a beestings pudding two gherkins and the pies of hare There should be four of them in all if the cat has left them right We heard her racketing and tearing round the larder all last night Boy bring three of them to us take the other to my father Cut some myrtle for our garlands sprigs in flower or blossoms rather Give a shout upon the way to Charinades our neighbor To join our drinking bout to day since heaven is pleased to bless our labor THE HARVEST From The Peace Translation in the Quarterly Review Oh tis sweet when fields are ringing With the merry cricket s singing Oft to mark with curious eye If the vine tree s time be nigh Here is now the fruit whose birth Cost a throe to Mother Earth Sweet it is too to be telling How the luscious figs are swelling Then to riot without measure In the rich nectareous treasure While our grateful voices chime Happy season blessed time THE CALL TO THE NIGHTINGALE From The Birds Frere s Translation Awake awake Sleep no more my gentle mate With your tiny tawny bill Wake the tuneful echo shrill On vale or hill Or in her airy rocky seat Let her listen and repeat The tender ditty that you tell The sad lament The dire event To luckless Itys that befell Thence the strain Shall rise again And soar amain Up to the lofty palace gate Where mighty Apollo sits in state In Jove s abode with his ivory lyre Hymning aloud to the heavenly choir While all the gods shall join with thee In a celestial symphony THE BUILDING OF CLOUD CUCKOO TOWN From The Birds Frere s Translation Enter Messenger quite out of breath and speaking in short snatches Messenger Where is he Where Where is he Where Where is he The president Peisthetairus Peisthetairus coolly Here am I Mess in a gasp of breath Your fortification s finished Peis Well that s well Mess A most amazing astonishing work it is So that Theagenes and Proxenides Might flourish and gasconade and prance away Quite at their ease both of them four in hand Driving abreast upon the breadth of wall Each in his own new chariot Peis You surprise me Mess And the height for I made the measurement myself Is exactly a hundred fathoms Peis Heaven and earth How could it be such a mass who could have built it Mess The Birds no creature else no foreigners Egyptian bricklayers workmen or masons But they themselves alone by their own efforts Even to my surprise as an eye witness The Birds I say completed everything There came a body of thirty thousand cranes I won t be positive there might be more With stones from Africa in their craws and gizzards Which the stone curlews and stone chatterers Worked into shape and finished The sand martens And mud larks too were busy in their department Mixing the mortar while the water birds As fast as it was wanted brought the water To temper and work it Peis in a fidget But who served the masons Who did you get to carry it Mess To carry it Of course the carrion crows and carrying pigeons Peis in a fuss which he endeavors to conceal Yes yes but after all to load your hods How did you manage that Mess Oh capitally I promise you There were the geese all barefoot Trampling the mortar and when all was ready They handed it into the hods so cleverly With their flat feet Peis a bad joke as a vent for irritation They footed it you mean Come it was handily done though I confess Mess Indeed I assure you it was a sight to see them And trains of ducks there were clambering the ladders With their duck legs like bricklayers prentices All dapper and handy with their little trowels Peis In fact then it s no use engaging foreigners Mere folly and waste we ve all within ourselves Ah well now come But about the woodwork Heh Who were the carpenters Answer me that Mess The woodpeckers of course and there they were Laboring upon the gates driving and banging With their hard hatchet beaks and such a din Such a clatter as they made hammering and hacking In a perpetual peal pelting away Like shipwrights hard at work in the arsenal And now their work is finished gates and all Staples and bolts and bars and everything The sentries at their posts patrols appointed The watchman in the barbican the beacons Ready prepared for lighting all their signals Arranged but I ll step out just for a moment To wash my hands You ll settle all the rest CHORUS OF WOMEN From the Thesmophoriazusae Collins s Translation They re always abusing the women As a terrible plague to men They say we re the root of all evil And repeat it again and again Of war and quarrels and bloodshed All mischief be what it may And pray then why do you marry us If we re all the plagues you say And why do you take such care of us And keep us so safe at home And are never easy a moment If ever we chance to roam When you ought to be thanking heaven That your Plague is out of the way You all keep fussing and fretting Where is my Plague to day If a Plague peeps out of the window Up go the eyes of men If she hides then they all keep staring Until she looks out again CHORUS OF MYSTAE IN HADES

none	none	ARISTOTLE B C three hundred eighty four three hundred twenty two BY THOMAS DAVIDSON The Stagirite called by Eusebius Nature s private secretary and by Dante the master of those that know the greatest thinker of the ancient world and the most influential of all time was born of Greek parents at Stagira in the mountains of Macedonia in B C three hundred eighty four Of his mother Phaestis almost nothing is known His father Nicomachus belonged to a medical family and acted as private physician to Amyntas grandfather of Alexander the Great whence it is probable that Aristotle s boyhood was passed at or near the Macedonian court Losing both his parents while a mere boy he was taken charge of by a relative Proxenus Atarneus and sent at the age of seventeen to Athens to study Here he entered the school of Plato where he remained twenty years as pupil and as teacher During this time he made the acquaintance of the leading contemporary thinkers read omnivorously amassed an amount of knowledge that seems almost fabulous schooled himself in systematic thought and being well off collected a library perhaps the first considerable private library in the world Having toward the end felt obliged to assume an independent attitude in thought he was not at the death of Plato three hundred forty seven appointed his successor in the Academy as might have been expected Not wishing at that time to set up a rival school he retired to the court of a former fellow pupil Hermias then king of Assos and Atarneus whom he greatly respected and whose adopted daughter Pythias he later married Here he remained pursuing his studies for three years and left only when his patron was treacherously murdered by the Persians Having retired to Mitylene he soon afterward received an invitation from Philip of Macedonia to undertake the education of his son Alexander then thirteen years old Aristotle willingly obeyed this summons and retiring with his royal pupil to Mieza a town southwest of Pella imparted his instruction in the Nymphaeum which he had arranged in imitation of Plato s garden school Alexander remained with him three years and was then called by his father to assume important State duties Whether Aristotle s instruction continued after that is uncertain but the two men remained fast friends and there can be no doubt that much of the nobility self control largeness of purpose and enthusiasm for culture which characterized Alexander s subsequent career were due to the teaching of the philosopher What Aristotle was in the world of thought Alexander became in the world of action Illustration ARISTOTLE Aristotle remained in Macedonia ten years giving instruction to young Macedonians and continuing his own studies He then returned to Athens and opened a school in the peripatos or promenade of the Lyceum the gymnasium of the foreign residents a school which from its location was called the Peripatetic Here he developed a manifold activity He pursued all kinds of studies logical rhetorical physical metaphysical ethical political and aesthetic gave public exoteric and private esoteric instruction and composed the bulk of the treatises which have made his name famous These treatises were composed slowly in connection with his lectures and subjected to frequent revision He likewise endeavored to lead an ideal social life with his friends and pupils whom he gathered under a common roof to share meals and elevated converse in common Thus affairs went on for twelve fruitful years and might have gone on longer but for the sudden death of Alexander his friend and patron Then the hatred of the Athenians to the conqueror showed itself in hostility to his old master and sought for means to put him out of the way How hard it was to find a pretext for so doing is shown by the fact that they had to fix upon the poem which he had written on the death of his friend Hermias many years before and base upon it as having the form of the paean sacred to Apollo a charge of impiety Aristotle recognizing the utter flimsiness of the charge and being unwilling as he said to allow the Athenians to sin a second time against philosophy retired beyond their reach to his villa at Chalcis in Euboea where he died of stomach disease the year after three hundred twenty two In the later years of his life the friendship between him and his illustrious pupil had owing to certain outward circumstances become somewhat cooled but there never was any serious breach His body was carried to Stagira which he had induced Philip to restore after it had been destroyed and whose inhabitants therefore looked upon him as the founder of the city As such he received the religious honors accorded to heroes an altar was erected to him at which an annual festival was celebrated in the month named after him We may sum up the character of Aristotle by saying that he was one of the sanest and most rounded men that ever lived As a philosopher he stands in the front rank No time says Hegel has a man to place by his side Nor was his moral character inferior to his intellect No one can read his Ethics or his will the text of which is extant without feeling the nobleness simplicity purity and modernness of his nature In his family relations especially he seems to have stood far above his contemporaries The depth of his aesthetic perception is attested by his poems and his Poetics The unsatisfactory and fragmentary condition in which Aristotle s works have come down to us makes it difficult to judge of his style Many of them seem mere collections of notes and jottings for lectures without any attempt at style The rest are distinguished by brevity terseness and scientific precision No other man ever enriched philosophic language with so many original expressions We know from the testimony of most competent judges such as Cicero that his popular writings dialogues et cetera were written in an elegant style casting even that of Plato into the shade and this is borne fully out by some extant fragments Greek philosophy culminates in Aristotle Setting out with a naive acceptance of the world as being what it seemed and trying to reduce this Being to some material principle such as water air et cetera it was gradually driven by force of logic to distinguish Being from Seeming and to see that while the latter was dependent on the thinking subject the former could not be anything material This result was reached by both the materialistic and spiritualistic schools and was only carried one step further by the Sophists who maintained that even the being of things depended on the thinker This necessarily led to skepticism individualism and disruption of the old social and religious order Then arose Socrates greatest of the Sophists who seeing that the outer world had been shown to depend on the inner adopted as his motto Know Thyself and devoted himself to the study of mind By his dialectic method he showed that skepticism and individualism so far as anarchic can be overcome by carrying out thought to its implications when it proves to be the same for all and to bring with it an authority binding on all and replacing that of the old external gods Thus Socrates discovered the principle of human liberty a principle necessarily hostile to the ancient State which absorbed the man in the citizen Socrates was accordingly put to death as an atheist and then Plato with good intentions but prejudiced insight set to work to restore the old tyranny of the State This he did by placing truth or reality which Socrates had found in complete thought internal to the mind outside of both thought and nature and making it consist of a group of eternal schemes or forms of which natural things are merely transient phantoms and which can be reached by only a few aristocratic souls born to rule the rest On the basis of this distortion he constructed his Republic in which complete despotism is exercised by the philosophers through the military man is reduced to a machine his affections and will being disregarded community of women and of property is the law and science is scouted Aristotle s philosophy may be said to be a protest against this view and an attempt to show that reality is embodied in nature which depends on a supreme intelligence and may be realized in other intelligences or thought centres such as the human mind In other words according to Aristotle truth is actual in the world and potential in all minds which may by experience put on its forms Thus the individualism of the Sophists and the despotism of Plato are overcome while an important place is made for experience or science Aristotle accepting the world of common sense tried to rationalize it that is to realize it in himself First among the Greeks he believed it to be unique uncreated and eternal and gave his reasons Recognizing that the phenomenal world exists in change he investigated the principle and method of this Change he conceives as a transition from potentiality to actuality and as always due to something actualized communicating its form to something potential Looking at the world as a whole and picturing it as limited globular and constructed like an onion with the earth in the centre and round about it nine concentric spheres carrying the planets and stars he concludes that there must be at one end something purely actual and therefore unchanging that is pure form or energy and at the other something purely potential and therefore changing that is pure matter or latency The pure actuality is at the circumference pure matter at the centre Matter however never exists without some form Thus nature is an eternal circular process between the actual and the potential The supreme Intelligence God being pure energy changelessly thinks himself and through the love inspired by his perfection moves the outmost sphere which would move all the rest were it not for inferior intelligences fifty six in number who by giving them different directions diversify the divine action and produce the variety of the world The celestial world is composed of eternal matter or aether whose only change is circular motion the sublunary world is composed of changing matter in four different but mutually transmutable forms fire air water earth movable in two opposite directions in straight lines under the ever varying influence of the celestial spheres Thus the world is an organism making no progress as a whole but continually changing in its various parts In it all real things are individuals not universals as Plato thought And forms pass from individual to individual only Peleus not humanity is the parent of Achilles the learned man only can teach the ignorant In the world process there are several distinct stages to each of which Aristotle devotes a special work or series of works Beginning with the four elements and their changes he works up through the mineral vegetable and animal worlds to man and thence through the spheral intelligences to the supreme divine intelligence on which the Whole depends Man stands on the dividing line between the temporal and the eternal belonging with his animal part to the former with his intelligence which enters from without to the latter He is an intelligence of the same nature as the sphere movers but individuated by mutable matter in the form of a body matter being in all cases the principle of individuation As intelligence he becomes free takes the guidance of his life into his own hand and first through ethics politics and aesthetics the forms of his sensible or practical activity and second through logic science and philosophy the forms of his intellectual activity he rises to divine heights and plays the immortal His supreme activity is contemplation This the eternal energy of God is possible for man only at rare intervals Aristotle by placing his eternal forms in sensible things as their meaning made science possible and necessary Not only is he the father of scientific method inductive and deductive but his actual contributions to science place him in the front rank of scientists His Zooelogy Psychology Logic Metaphysics Ethics Politics and Aesthetics are still highly esteemed and extensively studied At the same time by failing to overcome the dualism and supernaturalism of Plato by adopting the popular notions about spheres and sphere movers by separating intelligence from sense by conceiving matter as independent and the principle of individuation and by making science relate only to the universal he paved the way for astrology alchemy magic and all the forms of superstition retarding the advance of several sciences as for example astronomy and chemistry for many hundred years After Aristotle s death his school was continued by a succession of studious and learned men but did not for many centuries deeply affect contemporary life At last in the fifth century A D his thought found its way into the Christian schools giving birth to rationalism and historical criticism At various times its adherents were condemned as heretics and banished mostly to Syria Here at Edessa and Nisibis they established schools of learning which for several centuries were the most famous in the world The entire works of Aristotle were turned into Syriac among them several spurious ones of Neo Platonic origin notably the famous Liber de Causis and the Theology of Aristotle Thus a Neo Platonic Aristotle came to rule Eastern learning On the rise of Islam this Aristotle was borrowed by the Muslims and became ruler of their schools at Bagdad Basra and other places schools which produced many remarkable men On the decay of these he passed in the twelfth century into the schools of Spain and here ruled supreme until Arab philosophy was suppressed shortly before twelve hundred From the Arabs he passed into the Christian Church about this date and though at first resisted was finally accepted and became the philosopher of the schools and the inspirer of Dante The Reformers though decrying him were forced to have recourse to him but his credit was not re established until the present century when thanks to Hegel Trendelenburg Brandis and the Berlin Academy his true value was recognized and his permanent influence insured The extant works of Aristotle covering the whole field of science may be classified as follows A Logical or Formal dealing with the form rather than the matter of science Categories treating of Being and its determination which being regarded ontologically bring the work into the metaphysical sphere On Interpretation dealing with the proposition Former Analytics theory of the syllogism Later Analytics theory of proof Topics probable proofs Sophistical proofs fallacies These works were later united by the Stoics under the title Organon or Instrument of science B Scientific or Philosophical dealing with the matter of science These may be subdivided into three classes a Theoretical b Practical c Creative a The Theoretical has further subdivisions a Metaphysical b Physical c Mathematical a The Metaphysical works include the incomplete collection under the name Metaphysics b The Physical works include Physics On the Heavens On Generation and Decay On the Soul with eight supplementary tracts on actions of the soul as combined with the body viz On Sense and Sensibles On Memory and Reminiscence On Sleep and Waking On Dreams On Divination from Dreams On Length and Shortness of Life On Life and Death On Respiration Meteorologics Histories of Animals Zooegraphy On the Parts of Animals On the Generation of Animals On the Motion of Animals Problems largely spurious On the Cosmos Physiognomies On Wonderful Auditions On Colors The Mathematical works include On Indivisible Lines Mechanics b The Practical works are Nicomachean Ethics Endemean Ethics Great Ethics Magna Moralia really different forms of the same work Politics Constitutions originally one hundred and fifty eight in number now represented only by the recently discovered Constitution of Athens On Virtues and Vices Rhetoric to Alexander Oeconomics c Of Creative works we have only the fragmentary Poetics To these may be added a few poems one of which is given here Besides the extant works of Aristotle we have titles fragments and some knowledge of the contents of a large number more Among these are the whole of the exoteric works including nineteen Dialogues A list of his works as arranged in the Alexandrian Library apparently is given by Diogenes Laertius in his Life of Aristotle printed in the Berlin and Paris editions of Aristotle a list in which it is not easy to identify the whole of the extant works The Fragments appear in both the editions just named Some of the works named above are almost certainly spurious e g the Rhetoric to Alexander the Oeconomics et cetera The chief editions of Aristotle s works exclusive of the Constitution of Athens are that of the Berlin Academy Im Bekker containing text scholia Latin translation and Index in Greek five vols square fourto and the Paris or Didot Duebner Bussemaker Heitz containing text Latin translation and very complete Index in Latin five vols fourto Of the chief works the best editions are Organon Waitz Metaphysics Schwegler Bonitz Physics Prantl Meteorologies Ideler On the Generation of Animals Aubert and Wimmer Psychology Trendelenburg Torstrik Wallace with English translation Nicomachean Ethics Grant Ramsauer Susemihl Politics Stahr Susemihl Constitution of Athens Kenyon Sandys Poetics Susemihl Vahlen Butcher with English translation There are few good English translations of Aristotle s works but among these may be mentioned Peter s Nicomachean Ethics Jowett s and Welldon s Politics and Poste s Constitution of Athens There is a fair French translation of the principal works by Barthelemy saint Hilaire The Berlin Academy is now eighteen ninety six publishing the ancient Greek commentaries on Aristotle in thirty five quarto volumes The best work on Aristotle is that by E Zeller in Vol iii of his Philosophie der Griechen The English works by Lewes and Grote are inferior For Bibliography the student may consult Ueberweg Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophic Vol i pages one hundred ninety six seq Illustration Signature THOMAS DAVIDSON THE NATURE OF THE SOUL From On the Soul Book iii Chapter six Concerning that part of the soul however by which the soul knows and is prudentially wise whether it is separable or not separable according to magnitude but according to reason it must be considered what difference it possesses and how intellectual perception is produced If therefore to perceive intellectually is the same thing as to perceive sensibly it will either be to suffer something from the intelligible or something else of this kind It is necessary however that it should be impassive but capable of receiving form and in capacity a thing of this kind but not this and also that as the sensitive power is to sensibles so should intellect be to intelligibles It is necessary therefore since it understands all things that it should be unmingled as Anaxagoras says that it may predominate but this is that it may know for that which is foreign at the same time presenting itself to the view impedes and obstructs Hence neither is there any other nature of it than this that it is possible That therefore which is called the intellect of soul I mean the intellect by which the soul energizes dianoetically and hypoleptically is nothing in energy of beings before it intellectually perceives them Hence neither is it reasonable that it should be mingled with body for thus it would become a thing with certain quality would be hot or cold and would have a certain organ in the same manner as the sensitive power Now however there is no organ of it In a proper manner therefore do they speak who say that the soul is the place of forms except that this is not true of the whole soul but of that which is intellective nor is it forms in entelecheia but in capacity But that the impassivity of the sensitive and intellective power is not similar is evident in the sensoria and in sense For sense cannot perceive from a vehement sensible object as for instance sounds from very loud sounds nor from strong odors and colors can it either see or smell but intellect when it understands anything very intelligible does not less understand inferior concerns but even understands them in a greater degree for the sensitive power is not without body but intellect is separate from body When however it becomes particulars in such a manner as he is said to possess scientific knowledge who scientifically knows in energy and this happens when it is able to energize through itself then also it is similarly in a certain respect in capacity yet not after the same manner as before it learnt or discovered and it is then itself able to understand itself By the sensitive power therefore it distinguishes the hot and the cold and those things of which flesh is a certain reason but by another power either separate or as an inflected line subsists with reference to itself when it is extended it distinguishes the essence of flesh Further still in those things which consist in ablation the straight is as the flat nose for it subsists with the continued Some one however may question if intellect is simple and impassive and has nothing in common with anything as Anaxagoras says how it can perceive intellectually if to perceive intellectually is to suffer something for so far as something is common to both the one appears to act but the other to suffer Again it may also be doubted whether intellect is itself intelligible For either intellect will also be present with other things if it is not intelligible according to another thing but the intelligible is one certain thing in species or it will have something mingled which will make it to be intelligible in the same manner as other things Or shall we say that to suffer subsists according to something common On which account it was before observed that intellect is in capacity in a certain respect intelligibles but is no one of them in entelecheia before it understands or perceives intellectually But it is necessary to conceive of it as of a table in which nothing is written in entelecheia which happens to be the case in intellect But in those things which have matter each of the intelligibles is in capacity only Hence intellect will not be present with them for the intellect of such things is capacity without matter But with intellect the intelligible will be present Since however in every nature there is something which is matter to each genus and this because it is all those in capacity and something which is the cause and affective because it produces all things in such a manner as art is affected with respect to matter it is necessary that these differences should also be inherent in the soul And the one is an intellect of this kind because it becomes all things but the other because it produces all things as a certain habit such for instance as light For in a certain respect light also causes colors which are in capacity to be colors in energy And this intellect is separate unmingled and impassive since it is in its essence energy for the efficient is always more honorable than the patient and the principle than matter Science also in energy is the same as the thing which is scientifically known But science which is in capacity is prior in time in the one to science in energy though in short neither is capacity prior to energy in time It does not however perceive intellectually at one time and at another time not but separate intellect is alone this very thing which it is and this alone is immortal and eternal We do not however remember because this is impassive but the passive intellect is corruptible and without this the separate intellect understands nothing ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HISTORY AND POETRY AND HOW HISTORICAL MATTER SHOULD BE USED IN POETRY From the Poetics Chapter nine But it is evident from what has been said that it is not the province of a poet to relate things which have happened but such as might have happened and such things as are possible according to probability or which would necessarily have happened For a historian and a poet do not differ from each other because the one writes in verse and the other in prose for the history of Herodotus might be written in verse and yet it would be no less a history with metre than without metre But they differ in this that the one speaks of things which have happened and the other of such as might have happened Hence poetry is more philosophic and more deserving of attention than history For poetry speaks more of universals but history of particulars But universal consists indeed in relating or performing certain things which happen to a man of a certain description either probably or necessarily to which the aim of poetry is directed in giving names but particular consists in narrating what for example Alcibiades did or what he suffered In comedy therefore this is now become evident For comic poets having composed a fable through things of a probable nature they thus give whatever names they please to their characters and do not like iambic poets write poems about particular persons But in tragedy they cling to real names The cause however of this is that the possible is credible Things therefore which have not yet been done we do not yet believe to be possible but it is evident that things which have been done are possible for they would not have been done if they were impossible Not indeed but that in some tragedies there are one or two known names and the rest are feigned but in others there is no known name as for instance in The Flower of Agatho For in this tragedy the things and the names are alike feigned and yet it delights no less Hence one must not seek to adhere entirely to traditional fables which are the subjects of tragedy For it is ridiculous to make this the object of search because even known subjects are known but to a few though at the same time they delight all men From these things therefore it is evident that a poet ought rather to be the author of fables than of metres inasmuch as he is a poet from imitation and he imitates actions Hence though it should happen that he relates things which have happened he is no less a poet For nothing hinders but that some actions which have happened are such as might both probably and possibly have happened and by the narration of such he is a poet But of simple plots and actions the episodic are the worst But I call the plot episodic in which it is neither probable nor necessary that the episodes follow each other Such plots however are composed by bad poets indeed through their own want of ability but by good poets on account of the players For introducing dramatic contests and extending the plot beyond its capabilities they are frequently compelled to distort the connection of the parts But tragedy is not only an imitation of a perfect action but also of actions which are terrible and piteous and actions principally become such and in a greater degree when they happen contrary to opinion on account of each other For thus they will possess more of the marvelous than if they happened from chance and fortune since also of things which are from fortune those appear to be most admirable which seem to happen as it were by design Thus the statue of Mityus at Argos killed him who was the cause of the death of Mityus by falling as he was surveying it For such events as these seem not to take place casually Hence it is necessary that fables of this kind should be more beautiful ON PHILOSOPHY Quoted in Cicero s Nature of the Gods If there were men whose habitations had been always under ground in great and commodious houses adorned with statues and pictures furnished with everything which they who are reputed happy abound with and if without stirring from thence they should be informed of a certain divine power and majesty and after some time the earth should open and they should quit their dark abode to come to us where they should immediately behold the earth the seas the heavens should consider the vast extent of the clouds and force of the winds should see the sun and observe his grandeur and beauty and perceive that day is occasioned by the diffusion of his light through the sky and when night has obscured the earth they should contemplate the heavens bespangled and adorned with stars the surprising variety of the moon in her increase and wane the rising and setting of all the stars and the inviolable regularity of their courses when says he they should see these things they would undoubtedly conclude that there are gods and that these are their mighty works ON ESSENCES From The Metaphysics Book xi Chapter I The subject of theory or speculative science is essence In it are investigated the principles and causes of essences The truth is if the All be regarded as a whole essence is its first or highest part Also if we consider the natural order of the categories essence stands at the head of the list then comes quality then quantity It is true that the other categories such as qualities and movements are not in any absolute sense at all and the same is true of negatives such as not white or not straight Nevertheless we use such expressions as Not white is Moreover no one of the other categories is separable or independent This is attested by the procedure of the older philosophers for it was the principles elements and causes of essence that were the objects of their investigations The thinkers of the present day to be sure are rather inclined to consider universals as essence For genera are universals and these they hold to be principles and essences mainly because their mode of investigation is a logical one The older philosophers on the other hand considered particular things to be essences e g fire and earth not body in general There are three essences Two of these are sensible one being eternal and the other transient The latter is obvious to all in the form of plants and animals with regard to the former there is room for discussion as to whether its elements are one or many The third differing from the other two is immutable and is maintained by certain persons to be separable Some make two divisions of it whereas others class together as of one nature ideas and mathematical entities and others again admit only the latter The first two essences belong to physical science for they are subject to change the last belongs to another science if there is no principle common to all ON COMMUNITY OF STUDIES From The Politics Book eight No one therefore can doubt that the legislator ought principally to attend to the education of youth For in cities where this is neglected the politics are injured For every State ought to be governed according to its nature since the appropriate manners of each polity usually preserve the polity and establish it from the beginning Thus appropriate democratic manners preserve and establish a democracy and oligarchic an oligarchy Always however the best manners are the cause of the best polity Further still in all professions and arts there are some things which ought previously to be learnt and to which it is requisite to be previously accustomed in order to the performance of their several works so that it is evident that it is also necessary in the practice of virtue Since however there is one purpose to every city it is evident that the education must necessarily be one and the same in all cities and that the attention paid to this should be common At the same time also no one ought to think that any person takes care of the education of his children separately and privately teaches them that particular discipline which appears to him to be proper But it is necessary that the studies of the public should be common At the same time also no one ought to think that any citizen belongs to him in particular but that all the citizens belong to the city for each individual is a part of the city The care and attention however which are paid to each of the parts naturally look to the care and attention of the whole And for this some one may praise the Lacedaemonians for they pay very great attention to their children and this in common It is evident therefore that laws should be established concerning education and that it should be made common HYMN TO VIRTUE Virtue to men thou bringest care and toil Yet art thou life s best fairest spoil O virgin goddess for thy beauty s sake To die is delicate in this our Greece Or to endure of pain the

nineteen at Hof Akagastroend in Iceland where his father Arm Illugason was clergyman After completing the course at the Bessastad Latin School at that time the most famous school in Iceland he took his first position as librarian of the so called Stiptbokasafn Islands since eighteen eighty one called the National Library which office he held till eighteen eighty seven when he asked to be relieved from his official duties During this period he had been also the first librarian of the Reykjavik branch of the Icelandic Literary Society a teacher and the custodian of the library at the Latin School which in the mean time had been moved from Bessastad to Reykjavik secretary of the bishop Helgi Thordersen and custodian of the growing collection of Icelandic antiquities which has formed the nucleus of a national museum He had found time besides during these years for considerable literary work and apart from several valuable bibliographies had alone and in collaboration made important contributions to his native literature He died at Reykjavik in eighteen eighty eight His principal literary work and that by which alone he is known outside of Iceland is the collection of folk tales that appeared in Iceland in eighteen sixty two sixty four in two volumes with the title Islenzkar Thoosoegur og AEfintyri Icelandic Popular Legends and Tales A small preliminary collection called Islenzk AEfintyri Icelandic Tales made in collaboration with Magnus Grimsson had been published in eighteen fifty two Subsequently Jon Arnason went to work single handed to make an exhaustive collection of the folk tales of the country which by traveling and correspondence he drew from every nook and corner of Iceland No effort was spared to make the collection complete and many years were spent in this undertaking The results were in every way valuable No more important collection of folk tales exists in the literature of any nation and the work has become both a classic at home and a most suggestive link in the comparative study of folk lore elsewhere Arnason thus performed for his native land what the Grimms did for Germany and what Asbjoernsen and Moe did for Norway He has frequently been called the Grimm of Iceland The stories of the collection have since found their way all over the world many of them having been translated into English German French and Danish In his transcription of the tales Arnason has followed even more conscientiously the plan of the Grimms in adhering to the local or individual form in which the story had come to him in writing or by oral transmission We get in this way a perfect picture of the national spirit and a better knowledge of life and environment in Iceland than from any other source In these stories there is much to say of elves and trolls of ghosts and fetches of outlaws and the devil Magic plays an important part and there is the usual lore of beasts and plants Many of them are but variants of folk tales that belong to the race Others however are as plainly local evolutions which in their whole conception are as weird and mysterious as the environment that has produced them All the stories are from Icelandic Legends Translation of Powell and Magnusson THE MERMAN Long ago a farmer lived at Vogar who was a mighty fisherman and of all the farms about not one was so well situated with regard to the fisheries as his One day according to custom he had gone out fishing and having cast down his line from the boat and waited awhile found it very hard to pull up again as if there were something very heavy at the end of it Imagine his astonishment when he found that what he had caught was a great fish with a man s head and body When he saw that this creature was alive he addressed it and said Who and whence are you A merman from the bottom of the sea was the reply The farmer then asked him what he had been doing when the hook caught his flesh The other replied I was turning the cowl of my mother s chimney pot to suit it to the wind So let me go again will you Not for the present said the fisherman You shall serve me awhile first So without more words he dragged him into the boat and rowed to shore with him When they got to the boat house the fisherman s dog came to him and greeted him joyfully barking and fawning on him and wagging his tail But his master s temper being none of the best he struck the poor animal whereupon the merman laughed for the first time Having fastened the boat he went toward his house dragging his prize with him over the fields and stumbling over a hillock which lay in his way cursed it heartily whereupon the merman laughed for the second time When the fisherman arrived at the farm his wife came out to receive him and embraced him affectionately and he received her salutations with pleasure whereupon the merman laughed for the third time Then said the farmer to the merman You have laughed three times and I am curious to know why you have laughed Tell me therefore Never will I tell you replied the merman unless you promise to take me to the same place in the sea wherefrom you caught me and there to let me go free again So the farmer made him the promise Well said the merman I laughed the first time because you struck your dog whose joy at meeting you was real and sincere The second time because you cursed the mound over which you stumbled which is full of golden ducats And the third time because you received with pleasure your wife s empty and flattering embrace who is faithless to you and a hypocrite And now be an honest man and take me out to the sea whence you brought me The farmer replied Two things that you have told me I have no means of proving namely the faithfulness of my dog and the faithlessness of my wife But the third I will try the truth of and if the hillock contain gold then I will believe the rest Accordingly he went to the hillock and having dug it up found therein a great treasure of golden ducats as the merman had told him After this the farmer took the merman down to the boat and to that place in the sea whence he had brought him Before he put him in the latter said to him Farmer you have been an honest man and I will reward you for restoring me to my mother if only you have skill enough to take possession of property that I shall throw in your way Be happy and prosper Then the farmer put the merman into the sea and he sank out of sight It happened that not long after seven sea gray cows were seen on the beach close to the farmer s land These cows appeared to be very unruly and ran away directly the farmer approached them So he took a stick and ran after them possessed with the fancy that if he could burst the bladder which he saw on the nose of each of them they would belong to him He contrived to hit the bladder on the nose of one cow which then became so tame that he could easily catch it while the others leaped into the sea and disappeared The farmer was convinced that this was the gift of the merman And a very useful gift it was for better cow was never seen nor milked in all the land and she was the mother of the race of gray cows so much esteemed now And the farmer prospered exceedingly but never caught any more mermen As for his wife nothing further is told about her so we can repeat nothing THE FISHERMAN OF GOeTUR It is told that long ago a peasant living at Goetur in Myrdalur went out fishing round the island of Dyrholar In returning from the sea he had to cross a morass It happened once that on his way home after nightfall he came to a place where a man had lost his horse in the bog and was unable to recover it without help The fisherman to whom this man was a stranger aided him in freeing his horse from the peat When the animal stood again safe and sound upon the dry earth the stranger said to the fisherman I am your neighbor for I live in Hvammsgil and am returning from the sea like you But I am so poor that I cannot pay you for this service as you ought to be paid I will promise you however this much that you shall never go to sea without catching fish nor ever if you will take my advice return with empty hands But you must never put to sea without having first seen me pass your house as if going toward the shore Obey me in this matter and I promise you that you shall never launch your boat in vain The fisherman thanked him for this advice and sure enough it was that for three years afterward never putting to sea till he had first seen his neighbor pass his door he always launched his boat safely and always came home full handed But at the end of the three years it fell out that one day in the early morning the fisherman looking out from his house saw the wind and weather favorable and all other fishers hurrying down to the sea to make the best of so good a time But though he waited hour after hour in the hope of seeing his neighbor pass the man of Hvammsgil never came At last losing his patience he started out without having seen him go by When he came down to the shore he found that all the boats were launched and far away Before night the wind rose and became a storm and every boat that had that day put to sea was wrecked and every fisher drowned the peasant of Goetur alone escaping for he had been unable to go out fishing The next night he had a strange dream in which his neighbor from Hvammsgil came to him and said Although you did not yesterday follow my advice I yet so far felt kindly toward you that I hindered you from going out to sea and saved you thus from drowning but look no more forth to see me pass for we have met for the last time And never again did the peasant see his neighbor pass his door THE MAGIC SCYTHE A certain day laborer once started from his home in the south to earn wages for hay cutting in the north country In the mountains he was suddenly overtaken by a thick mist and sleet storm and lost his way Fearing to go on further he pitched his tent in a convenient spot and taking out his provisions began to eat While he was engaged upon his meal a brown dog came into the tent so ill favored dirty wet and fierce eyed that the poor man felt quite afraid of it and gave it as much bread and meat as it could devour This the dog swallowed greedily and ran off again into the mist At first the man wondered much to see a dog in such a wild place where he never expected to meet with a living creature but after a while he thought no more about the matter and having finished his supper fell asleep with his saddle for a pillow At midnight he dreamed that he saw a tall and aged woman enter his tent who spoke thus to him I am beholden to you good man for your kindness to my daughter but am unable to reward you as you deserve Here is a scythe which I place beneath your pillow it is the only gift I can make you but despise it not It will surely prove useful to you as it can cut down all that lies before it Only beware of putting it into the fire to temper it Sharpen it however as you will but in that way never So saying she was seen no more When the man awoke and looked forth he found the mist all gone and the sun high in heaven so getting all his things together and striking his tent he laid them upon the pack horses saddling last of all his own horse But on lifting his saddle from the ground he found beneath it a small scythe blade which seemed well worn and was rusty On seeing this he at once recalled to mind his dream and taking the scythe with him set out once more on his way He soon found again the road which he had lost and made all speed to reach the well peopled district to which he was bound When he arrived at the north country he went from house to house but did not find any employment for every farmer had laborers enough and one week of hay harvest was already past He heard it said however that one old woman in the district generally thought by her neighbors to be skilled in magic and very rich always began her hay cutting a week later than anybody else and though she seldom employed a laborer always contrived to finish it by the end of the season When by any chance and it was a rare one she did engage a workman she was never known to pay him for his work Now the peasant from the south was advised to ask this old woman for employment having been warned of her strange habits He accordingly went to her house and offered himself to her as a day laborer She accepted his offer and told him that he might if he chose work a week for her but must expect no payment Except she said you can cut more grass in the whole week than I can rake in on the last day of it To these terms he gladly agreed and began mowing And a very good scythe he found that to be which the woman had given him in his dream for it cut well and never wanted sharpening though he worked with it for five days unceasingly He was well content too with his place for the old woman was kind enough to him One day entering the forge next to her house he saw a vast number of scythe handles and rakes and a big heap of blades and wondered beyond measure what the old lady could want with all these It was the fifth day the Friday and when he was asleep that night the same elf woman whom he had seen upon the mountains came again to him and said Large as are the meadows you have mown your employer will easily be able to rake in all that hay to morrow and if she does so will as you know drive you away without paying you When therefore you see yourself worsted go into the forge take as many scythe handles as you think proper fit their blades to them and carry them out into that part of the land where the hay is yet uncut There you must lay them on the ground and you shall see how things go This said she disappeared and in the morning the laborer getting up set to work as usual at his mowing At six o clock the old witch came out bringing five rakes with her and said to the man A goodly piece of ground you have mowed indeed And so saying she spread the rakes upon the hay Then the man saw to his astonishment that though the one she held in her hand raked in great quantities of hay the other four raked in no less each all of their own accord and with no hand to wield them At noon seeing that the old woman would soon get the best of him he went into the forge and took out several scythe handles to which he fixed their blades and bringing them out into the field laid them down upon the grass which was yet standing Then all the scythes set to work of their own accord and cut down the grass so quickly that the rakes could not keep pace with them And so they went on all the rest of the day and the old woman was unable to rake in all the hay which lay in the fields After dark she told him to gather up his scythes and take them into the house again while she collected her rakes saying to him You are wiser than I took you to be and you know more than myself so much the better for you for you may stay as long with me as you like He spent the whole summer in her employment and they agreed very well together mowing with mighty little trouble a vast amount of hay In the autumn she sent him away well laden with money to his own home in the south The next summer and more than one summer following he spent in her employ always being paid as his heart could desire at the end of the season After some years he took a farm of his own in the south country and was always looked upon by all his neighbors as an honest man a good fisherman and an able workman in whatever he might put his hand to He always cut his own hay never using any scythe but that which the elf woman had given him upon the mountains nor did any of his neighbors ever finish their mowing before him One summer it chanced that while he was fishing one of his neighbors came to his house and asked his wife to lend him her husband s scythe as he had lost his own The farmer s wife looked for one but could only find the one upon which her husband set such store This however a little loth she lent to the man begging him at the same time never to temper it in the fire for that she said her good man never did So the neighbor promised and taking it with him bound it to a handle and began to work with it But sweep as he would and strain as he would and sweep and strain he did right lustily not a single blade of grass fell Wroth at this the man tried to sharpen it but with no avail Then he took it into his forge intending to temper it for thought he what harm could that possibly do but as soon as the flames touched it the steel melted like wax and nothing was left but a little heap of ashes Seeing this he went in haste to the farmer s house where he had borrowed it and told the woman what had happened she was at her wits end with fright and shame when she heard it for she knew well enough how her husband set store by this scythe and how angry he would be at its loss And angry indeed he was when he came home and he beat his wife well for her folly in lending what was not hers to lend But his wrath was soon over and he never again as he never had before laid the stick about his wife s shoulders THE MAN SERVANT AND THE WATER ELVES In a large house where all the chief rooms were paneled there lived once upon a time a farmer whose ill fate it was that every servant of his that was left alone to guard the house on Christmas Eve while the rest of the family went to church was found dead when the family returned home As soon as the report of this was spread abroad the farmer had the greatest difficulty in procuring servants who would consent to watch alone in the house on that night until at last one day a man a strong fellow offered him his services to sit up alone and guard the house The farmer told him what fate awaited him for his rashness but the man despised such a fear and persisted in his determination On Christmas Eve when the farmer and all his family except the new man servant were preparing for church the farmer said to him Come with us to church I cannot leave you here to die But the other replied I intend to stay here for it would be unwise in you to leave your house unprotected and besides the cattle and sheep must have their food at the proper time Never mind the beasts answered the farmer Do not be so rash as to remain in the house this night for whenever we have returned from church on this night we have always found every living thing in the house dead with all its bones broken But the man was not to be persuaded as he considered all these fears beneath his notice so the farmer and the rest of the servants went away and left him behind alone in the house As soon as he was by himself he began to consider how to guard against anything that might occur for a dread had stolen over him in spite of his courage that something strange was about to take place At last he thought that the best thing to do was first of all to light up the family room and then to find some place in which to hide himself As soon as he had lighted all the candles he moved two planks out of the wainscot at the end of the room and creeping into the space between it and the wall restored the planks to their places so that he could see plainly into the room and yet avoid being himself discovered He had scarcely finished concealing himself when two fierce and strange looking men entered the room and began looking about One of them said I smell a human being No replied the other there is no human being here Then they took a candle and continued their search until they found the man s dog asleep under one of the beds They took it up and having dashed it on the ground till every bone in its body was broken hurled it from them When the man servant saw this he congratulated himself on not having fallen into their hands Suddenly the room was filled with people who were laden with tables and all kinds of table furniture silver cloths and all which they spread out and having done so sat down to a rich supper which they had also brought with them They feasted noisily and spent the remainder of the night in drinking and dancing Two of them were appointed to keep guard in order to give the company due warning of the approach either of anybody or of the day Three times they went out always returning with the news that they saw neither the approach of any human being nor yet of the break of day But when the man servant suspected the night to be pretty far spent he jumped from his place of concealment into the room and clashing the two planks together with as much noise as he could make shouted like a madman The day the day the day On these words the whole company rose scared from their seats and rushed headlong out leaving behind them not only their tables and all the silver dishes but even the very clothes they had taken off for ease in dancing In the hurry of flight many were wounded and trodden under foot while the rest ran into the darkness the man servant after them clapping the planks together and shrieking The day the day the day until they came to a large lake into which the whole party plunged headlong and disappeared From this the man knew them to be water elves Then he returned home gathered the corpses of the elves who had been killed in the flight killed the wounded ones and making a great heap of them all burned them When he had finished this task he cleaned up the house and took possession of all the treasures the elves had left behind them On the farmer s return his servant told him all that had occurred and showed him the spoils The farmer praised him for a brave fellow and congratulated him on having escaped with his life The man gave him half the treasures of the elves and ever afterward prospered exceedingly This was the last visit the water elves ever paid to that house THE CROSSWAYS It is supposed that among the hills there are certain cross roads from the centre of which you can see four churches one at the end of each road If you sit at the crossing of these roads on Christmas Eve or as others say on New Year s Eve elves come from every direction and cluster round you and ask you with all sorts of blandishments and fair promises to go with them but you must continue silent Then they bring to you rarities and delicacies of every description gold silver and precious stones meats and wines of which they beg you to accept but you must neither move a limb nor accept a single thing they offer you If you get so far as this without speaking elf women come to you in the likeness of your mother your sister or any other relation and beg you to come with them using every art and entreaty but beware you neither move nor speak And if you can continue to keep silent and motionless all the night until you see the first streak of dawn then start up and cry aloud Praise be to God His daylight filleth the heavens As soon as you have said this the elves will leave you and with you all the wealth they have used to entice you which will now be yours But should you either answer or accept of their offers you will from that moment become mad On the night of one Christmas Eve a man named Fusi was out on the cross roads and managed to resist all the entreaties and proffers of the elves until one of them offered him a large lump of mutton suet and begged him to take a bite of it Fusi who had up to this time gallantly resisted all such offers as gold and silver and diamonds and such filthy lucre could hold out no longer and crying Seldom have I refused a bite of mutton suet he went mad ERNST MORITZ ARNDT seventeen sixty nine eighteen sixty Sprung from the sturdy peasant stock of the north to which patriotism is a chief virtue Ernst Moritz Arndt first saw the light at Schoritz Island of Ruegen then a dependency of Sweden December twenty ninth seventeen sixty nine His father once a serf had achieved a humble independence and he destined his clever son for the ministry the one vocation open to him which meant honor and advancement The young man studied theology at Greifswald and Jena but later turned his attention exclusively to history and literature His early life is delightfully described in his Stories and Recollections of Childhood His youth was molded by the influence of Goethe Klopstock Buerger and Voss After completing his university studies he traveled extensively in Austria Hungary and Northern Italy His account of these journeys published in eighteen oh two shows his keen observation of men and affairs Illustration ERNST ARNDT He began his long service to his country by his History of Serfdom in Pomerania and Sweden which contributed largely to the general abolition of the ancient abuse He became professor of history in the University of Greifswald in eighteen oh six and about that time began to publish the first series of the Spirit of the Times These were stirring appeals to rouse the Germans against the oppressions of Napoleon In consequence he was obliged to flee to Sweden After three years he returned under an assumed name and again took up his work at Greifswald In eighteen twelve after the occupation of Pomerania by the French his fierce denunciations again forced him to flee this time to Russia the only refuge open to him There he joined Baron von Stein who eagerly made use of him in his schemes for the liberation of Germany At this time his finest poems were written those kindling war songs that appealed so strongly to German patriotism when songs were sermons and sermons were songs The most famous of these What is the German s Fatherland The Song of the Field marshal and The God Who Made Earth s Iron Hoard still live as national lyrics Arndt was also constantly occupied in writing pamphlets of the most stirring nature as their titles show The Rhine Germany s River but Never Germany s Boundary The Soldier s Catechism and The Militia and the General Levy After the disasters of the French in Russia he returned to Germany unceasingly devoted to his task of rousing the people Though by birth a Swede he had become at heart a Prussian seeing in Prussia alone the possibility of German unity In eighteen seventeen he married Schleiermacher s sister and the following year was appointed professor of history in the newly established University of Bonn Shortly afterward suspended on account of his liberal views he was forced to spend twenty years in retirement His leisure gave opportunity for literary work however and he availed himself of it by producing several historical treatises and his interesting Reminiscences of My Public Life One of the first acts of Frederick William IV after his accession was to restore Arndt to his professorship at Bonn He took a lively interest in the events of eighteen forty eight and belonged to the deputation that offered the imperial crown to the King of Prussia He continued in the hope and the advocacy of German unity though he did not live to see it realized The ninetieth birthday of Father Arndt as he was fondly called by his countrymen was celebrated with general rejoicing throughout Germany He died shortly afterward on January twenty ninth eighteen sixty Arndt s importance as a poet is due to the stirring scenes of his earlier life and the political needs of Germany He was no genius He was not even a deep scholar His only great work is his war songs and patriotic ballads Germany honors his manly character and patriotic zeal in that stormy period of Liberation which led through many apparent defeats to the united Empire of to day The best German biographies are that of Schenkel eighteen sixty nine W Baur eighteen eighty two and Langenberg eighteen sixty nine the latter in eighteen seventy eight edited Arndt s Letters to a Friend J R Seeley s Life and Adventures of E M Arndt eighteen seventy nine is founded on the latter s Reminiscences of My Public Life WHAT IS THE GERMAN S FATHERLAND What is the German s fatherland Is it Prussia or the

skill in smooth and lucid verse early in life In eighteen fifty two when twenty years of age he won the Newdigate Prize at Oxford for a poem The Feast of Belshazzar Two years later after graduation with honors he was named second master of Edward the Sixth s School at Birmingham and a few years subsequent principal of the Government Sanskrit College at Poona in India In eighteen fifty six he published Griselda a Tragedy and after his return to London in eighteen sixty one translations from the Greek of Herodotus and the Sanskrit of the Indian classic Hitopadeca the latter under the name of The Book of Good Counsels There followed from his pen Education in India A History of the Administration in India under the Late Marquis of Dalhousie eighteen sixty two sixty four and The Poets of Greece a collection of fine passages eighteen sixty nine In addition to his other labors he has been one of the editors in chief of the London Daily Telegraph Saturated with the Orient familiar with every aspect of its civilization moral and religious life history and feeling Sir Edwin s literary work has attested his knowledge in a large number of smaller poetical productions and a group of religious epics of long and impressive extent Chiefest among them ranks that on the life and teachings of Buddha The Light of Asia or The Great Renunciation eighteen seventy nine It has passed through more than eighty editions in this country and almost as many in England In recognition of this work mister Arnold was decorated by the King of Siam with the Order of the White Elephant Two years after its appearance he published Mahabharata Indian Idylls and in eighteen eighty three Pearls of the Faith or Islam s Rosary Being the Ninety nine Beautiful Names of Allah with Comments in Verse from Various Oriental Sources In eighteen eighty six the Sultan conferred on him the Imperial Order of Osmanli and in eighteen eighty eight he was created Knight Commander of the Indian Empire by Queen Victoria Sa di in the Garden or The Book of Love eighteen eighty eight a poem turning on a part of the Bostani of the Persian poet Sa di brought Sir Edwin the Order of the Lion and Sun from the Shah of Persia In eighteen eighty eight he published also Poems National and Non Oriental Since then he has written The Light of the World Potiphar s Wife and Other Poems eighteen ninety two The Iliad and Odyssey of Asia and in prose India Revisited eighteen ninety one Seas and Lands Japonica which treats of life and things Japanese and Adzuma the Japanese Wife a Play in Four Acts eighteen ninety three During his travels in Japan the Emperor decorated him with the Order of the Rising Sun In eighteen ninety three Sir Edwin was chosen President of the Birmingham and Midland Institute His latest volume The Tenth Muse and Other Poems appeared in eighteen ninety five The Light of Asia the most successful of his works attracted instant attention on its appearance as a novelty of rich Indian local color In substance it is a graceful and dramatic paraphrase of the mass of more or less legendary tales of the life and spiritual career of the Buddha Prince Gautama and a summary of the principles of the great religious system originating with him It is lavishly embellished with Indian allusions and expresses incidentally the very spirit of the East In numerous cantos proceeding from episode to episode of its mystical hero s career its effect is that of a loftily ethical picturesque and fascinating biography in highly polished verse The metre selected is a graceful and dignified one especially associated with Paradise Lost and other of the foremost classics of English verse Sir Edwin says of the poem in his preface I have sought by the medium of an imaginary Buddhist votary to depict the life and character and indicate the philosophy of that noble hero and reformer Prince Gautama of India the founder of Buddhism and the poet has admirably if most flatteringly succeeded The poem has been printed in innumerable cheap editions as well as those de luxe and while it has been criticized as too complaisant a study of even primitive Buddhism it is beyond doubt a lyrical tract of eminent utility as well as seductive charm THE YOUTH OF BUDDHA From The Light of Asia This reverence Lord Buddha kept to all his schoolmasters Albeit beyond their learning taught in speech Right gentle yet so wise princely of mien Yet softly mannered modest deferent And tender hearted though of fearless blood No bolder horseman in the youthful band E er rode in gay chase of the shy gazelles No keener driver of the chariot In mimic contest scoured the palace courts Yet in mid play the boy would oft times pause Letting the deer pass free would oft times yield His half won race because the laboring steeds Fetched painful breath or if his princely mates Saddened to lose or if some wistful dream Swept o er his thoughts And ever with the years Waxed this compassionateness of our Lord Even as a great tree grows from two soft leaves To spread its shade afar but hardly yet Knew the young child of sorrow pain or tears Save as strange names for things not felt by kings Nor ever to be felt But it befell In the royal garden on a day of spring A flock of wild swans passed voyaging north To their nest places on Himala s breast Calling in love notes down their snowy line The bright birds flew by fond love piloted And Devadatta cousin of the Prince Pointed his bow and loosed a willful shaft Which found the wide wing of the foremost swan Broad spread to glide upon the free blue road So that it fell the bitter arrow fixed Bright scarlet blood gouts staining the pure plumes Which seeing Prince Siddartha took the bird Tenderly up rested it in his lap Sitting with knees crossed as Lord Buddha sits And soothing with a touch the wild thing s fright Composed its ruffled vans calmed its quick heart Caressed it into peace with light kind palms As soft as plantain leaves an hour unrolled And while the left hand held the right hand drew The cruel steel forth from the wound and laid Cool leaves and healing honey on the smart Yet all so little knew the boy of pain That curiously into his wrist he pressed The arrow s barb and winced to feel it sting And turned with tears to soothe his bird again Then some one came who said My Prince hath shot A swan which fell among the roses here He bids me pray you send it Will you send Nay quoth Siddartha If the bird were dead To send it to the slayer might be well But the swan lives my cousin hath but killed The godlike speed which throbbed in this white wing And Devadatta answered The wild thing Living or dead is his who fetched it down Twas no man s in the clouds but fallen tis mine Give me my prize fair cousin Then our Lord Laid the swan s neck beside his own smooth cheek And gravely spake Say no the bird is mine The first of myriad things which shall be mine By right of mercy and love s lordliness For now I know by what within me stirs That I shall teach compassion unto men And be a speechless world s interpreter Abating this accursed flood of woe Not man s alone but if the Prince disputes Let him submit this matter to the wise And we will wait their word So was it done In full divan the business had debate And many thought this thing and many that Till there arose an unknown priest who said If life be aught the savior of a life Owns more the living thing than he can own Who sought to slay the slayer spoils and wastes The cherisher sustains give him the bird Which judgment all found just but when the King Sought out the sage for honor he was gone And some one saw a hooded snake glide forth The gods come oft times thus So our Lord Buddha Began his works of mercy Yet not more Knew he as yet of grief than that one bird s Which being healed went joyous to its kind But on another day the King said Come Sweet son and see the pleasaunce of the spring And how the fruitful earth is wooed to yield Its riches to the reaper how my realm Which shall be thine when the pile flames for me Feeds all its mouths and keeps the King s chest filled Fair is the season with new leaves bright blooms Green grass and cries of plow time So they rode Into a land of wells and gardens where All up and down the rich red loam the steers Strained their strong shoulders in the creaking yoke Dragging the plows the fat soil rose and rolled In smooth dark waves back from the plow who drove Planted both feet upon the leaping share To make the furrow deep among the palms The tinkle of the rippling water rang And where it ran the glad earth broidered it With balsams and the spears of lemon grass Elsewhere were sowers who went forth to sow And all the jungle laughed with nesting songs And all the thickets rustled with small life Of lizard bee beetle and creeping things Pleased at the springtime In the mango sprays The sunbirds flashed alone at his green forge Toiled the loud coppersmith bee eaters hawked Chasing the purple butterflies beneath Striped squirrels raced the mynas perked and picked The nine brown sisters chattered in the thorn The pied fish tiger hung above the pool The egrets stalked among the buffaloes The kites sailed circles in the golden air About the painted temple peacocks flew The blue doves cooed from every well far off The village drums beat for some marriage feast All things spoke peace and plenty and the Prince Saw and rejoiced But looking deep he saw The thorns which grow upon this rose of life How the swart peasant sweated for his wage Toiling for leave to live and how he urged The great eyed oxen through the flaming hours Goading their velvet flanks then marked he too How lizard fed on ant and snake on him And kite on both and how the fish hawk robbed The fish tiger of that which it had seized The shrike chasing the bulbul which did chase The jeweled butterflies till everywhere Each slew a slayer and in turn was slain Life living upon death So the fair show Veiled one vast savage grim conspiracy Of mutual murder from the worm to man Who himself kills his fellow seeing which The hungry plowman and his laboring kine Their dewlaps blistered with the bitter yoke The rage to live which makes all living strife The Prince Siddartha sighed Is this he said That happy earth they brought me forth to see How salt with sweat the peasant s bread how hard The oxen s service in the brake how fierce The war of weak and strong i th air what plots No refuge e en in water Go aside A space and let me muse on what ye show So saying the good Lord Buddha seated him Under a jambu tree with ankles crossed As holy statues sit and first began To meditate this deep disease of life What its far source and whence its remedy So vast a pity filled him such wide love For living things such passion to heal pain That by their stress his princely spirit passed To ecstasy and purged from mortal taint Of sense and self the boy attained thereat Dhyana first step of the Path THE PURE SACRIFICE OF BUDDHA From The Light of Asia Onward he passed Exceeding sorrowful seeing how men Fear so to die they are afraid to fear Lust so to live they dare not love their life But plague it with fierce penances belike To please the gods who grudge pleasure to man Belike to balk hell by self kindled hells Belike in holy madness hoping soul May break the better through their wasted flesh O flowerets of the field Siddartha said Who turn your tender faces to the sun Glad of the light and grateful with sweet breath Of fragrance and these robes of reverence donned Silver and gold and purple none of ye Miss perfect living none of ye despoil Your happy beauty O ye palms which rise Eager to pierce the sky and drink the wind Blown from Malaya and the cool blue seas What secret know ye that ye grow content From time of tender shoot to time of fruit Murmuring such sun songs from your feathered crowns Ye too who dwell so merry in the trees Quick darting parrots bee birds bulbuls doves None of ye hate your life none of ye deem To strain to better by foregoing needs But man who slays ye being lord is wise And wisdom nursed on blood cometh thus forth In self tormentings While the Master spake Blew down the mount the dust of pattering feet White goats and black sheep winding slow their way With many a lingering nibble at the tufts And wanderings from the path where water gleamed Or wild figs hung But always as they strayed The herdsman cried or slung his sling and kept The silly crowd still moving to the plain A ewe with couplets in the flock there was Some hurt had lamed one lamb which toiled behind Bleeding while in the front its fellow skipped And the vexed dam hither and thither ran Fearful to lose this little one or that Which when our Lord did mark full tenderly He took the limping lamb upon his neck Saying Poor wooly mother be at peace Whither thou goest I will bear thy care Twere all as good to ease one beast of grief As sit and watch the sorrows of the world In yonder caverns with the priests who pray But spake he of the herdsmen wherefore friends Drive ye the flocks adown under high noon Since tis at evening that men fold their sheep And answer gave the peasants We are sent To fetch a sacrifice of goats fivescore And fivescore sheep the which our Lord the King Slayeth this night in worship of his gods Then said the Master I will also go So paced he patiently bearing the lamb Beside the herdsmen in the dust and sun The wistful ewe low bleating at his feet Whom when they came unto the river side A woman dove eyed young with tearful face And lifted hands saluted bending low Lord thou art he she said who yesterday Had pity on me in the fig grove here Where I live lone and reared my child but he Straying amid the blossoms found a snake Which twined about his wrist while he did laugh And teased the quick forked tongue and opened mouth Of that cold playmate But alas ere long He turned so pale and still I could not think Why he should cease to play and let my breast Fall from his lips And one said He is sick Of poison and another He will die But I who could not lose my precious boy Prayed of them physic which might bring the light Back to his eyes it was so very small That kiss mark of the serpent and I think It could not hate him gracious as he was Nor hurt him in his sport And some one said There is a holy man upon the hill Lo now he passeth in the yellow robe Ask of the Rishi if there be a cure For that which ails thy son Whereon I came Trembling to thee whose brow is like a god s And wept and drew the face cloth from my babe Praying thee tell what simples might be good And thou great sir didst spurn me not but gaze With gentle eyes and touch with patient hand Then draw the face cloth back saying to me Yea little sister there is that might heal Thee first and him if thou couldst fetch the thing For they who seek physicians bring to them What is ordained Therefore I pray thee find Black mustard seed a tola only mark Thou take it not from any hand or house Where father mother child or slave hath died It shall be well if thou canst find such seed Thus didst thou speak my lord The Master smiled Exceeding tenderly Yea I spake thus Dear Kisagotami But didst thou find The seed I went Lord clasping to my breast The babe grown colder asking at each hut Here in the jungle and toward the town I pray you give me mustard of your grace A tola black and each who had it gave For all the poor are piteous to the poor But when I asked In my friend s household here Hath any peradventure ever died Husband or wife or child or slave they said O sister what is this you ask the dead Are very many and the living few So with sad thanks I gave the mustard back And prayed of others but the others said Here is the seed but we have lost our slave Here is the seed but our good man is dead Here is some seed but he that sowed it died Between the rain time and the harvesting Ah sir I could not find a single house Where there was mustard seed and none had died Therefore I left my child who would not suck Nor smile beneath the wild vines by the stream To seek thy face and kiss thy feet and pray Where I might find this seed and find no death If now indeed my baby be not dead As I do fear and as they said to me My sister thou hast found the Master said Searching for what none finds that bitter balm I had to give thee He thou lovedst slept Dead on thy bosom yesterday to day Thou know saint the whole wide world weeps with thy woe The grief which all hearts share grows less for one Lo I would pour my blood if it could stay Thy tears and win the secret of that curse Which makes sweet love our anguish and which drives O er flowers and pastures to the sacrifice As these dumb beasts are driven men their lords I seek that secret bury thou thy child So entered they the city side by side The herdsmen and the Prince what time the sun Gilded slow Sona s distant stream and threw Long shadows down the street and through the gate Where the King s men kept watch But when these saw Our Lord bearing the lamb the guards stood back The market people drew their wains aside In the bazaar buyers and sellers stayed The war of tongues to gaze on that mild face The smith with lifted hammer in his hand Forgot to strike the weaver left his web The scribe his scroll the money changer lost His count of cowries from the unwatched rice Shiva s white bull fed free the wasted milk Ran o er the lota while the milkers watched The passage of our Lord moving so meek With yet so beautiful a majesty But most the women gathering in the doors Asked Who is this that brings the sacrifice So graceful and peace giving as he goes What is his caste whence hath he eyes so sweet Can he be Sakra or the Devaraj And others said It is the holy man Who dwelleth with the Rishis on the hill But the Lord paced in meditation lost Thinking Alas for all my sheep which have No shepherd wandering in the night with none To guide them bleating blindly toward the knife Of Death as these dumb beasts which are their kin Then some one told the King There cometh here A holy hermit bringing down the flock Which thou didst bid to crown the sacrifice The King stood in his hall of offering On either hand the white robed Brahmans ranged Muttered their mantras feeding still the fire Which roared upon the midmost altar There From scented woods flickered bright tongues of flame Hissing and curling as they licked the gifts Of ghee and spices and the Soma juice The joy of Indra Round about the pile A slow thick scarlet streamlet smoked and ran Sucked by the sand but ever rolling down The blood of bleating victims One such lay A spotted goat long horned its head bound back With munja grass at its stretched throat the knife Pressed by a priest who murmured This dread gods Of many yajnas cometh as the crown From Bimbasara take ye joy to see The spirted blood and pleasure in the scent Of rich flesh roasting mid the fragrant flames Let the King s sins be laid upon this goat And let the fire consume them burning it For now I strike But Buddha softly said Let him not strike great King and therewith loosed The victim s bonds none staying him so great His presence was Then craving leave he spake Of life which all can take but none can give Life which all creatures love and strive to keep Wonderful dear and pleasant unto each Even to the meanest yea a boon to all Where pity is for pity makes the world Soft to the weak and noble for the strong Unto the dumb lips of his flock he lent Sad pleading words showing how man who prays For mercy to the gods is merciless Being as god to those albeit all life Is linked and kin and what we slay have given Meek tribute of the milk and wool and set Fast trust upon the hands which murder them Also he spake of what the holy books Do surely teach how that at death some sink To bird and beast and these rise up to man In wanderings of the spark which grows purged flame So were the sacrifice new sin if so The fated passage of a soul be stayed Nor spake he shall one wash his spirit clean By blood nor gladden gods being good with blood Nor bribe them being evil nay nor lay Upon the brow of innocent bound beasts One hair s weight of that answer all must give For all things done amiss or wrongfully Alone each for himself reckoning with that The fixed arithmetic of the universe Which meteth good for good and ill for ill Measure for measure unto deeds words thoughts Watchful aware implacable unmoved Making all futures fruits of all the pasts Thus spake he breathing words so piteous With such high lordliness of ruth and right The priests drew back their garments o er the hands Crimsoned with slaughter and the King came near Standing with clasped palms reverencing Buddha While still our Lord went on teaching how fair This earth were if all living things be linked In friendliness of common use of foods Bloodless and pure the golden grain bright fruits Sweet herbs which grow for all the waters wan Sufficient drinks and meats Which when these heard The might of gentleness so conquered them The priests themselves scattered their altar flames And flung away the steel of sacrifice And through the land next day passed a decree Proclaimed by criers and in this wise graved On rock and column Thus the King s will is There hath been slaughter for the sacrifice And slaying for the meat but henceforth none Shall spill the blood of life nor taste of flesh Seeing that knowledge grows and life is one And mercy cometh to the merciful So ran the edict and from those days forth Sweet peace hath spread between all living kind Man and the beasts which serve him and the birds Of all those banks of Gunga where our Lord Taught with his saintly pity and soft speech THE FAITHFULNESS OF YUDHISTHIRA From The Great Journey in the Mahabharata Thenceforth alone the long armed monarch strode Not looking back nay not for Bhima s sake But walking with his face set for the mount And the hound followed him only the hound After the deathly sands the Mount and lo Sakra shone forth the God filling the earth And heavens with thunder of his chariot wheels Ascend he said with me Pritha s great son But Yudhisthira answered sore at heart For those his kinsfolk fallen on the way O Thousand eyed O Lord of all the gods Give that my brothers come with me who fell Not without them is Swarga sweet to me She too the dear and kind and queenly she Whose perfect virtue Paradise must crown Grant her to come with us Dost thou grant this The God replied In heaven thou shalt see Thy kinsman and the Queen these will attain And Krishna Grieve no longer for thy dead Thou chief of men their mortal covering stripped These have their places but to thee the gods Allot an unknown grace Thou shalt go up Living and in thy form to the immortal homes But the King answered O thou Wisest One Who know saint what was and is and is to be Still one more grace This hound hath ate with me Followed me loved me must I leave him now Monarch spake Indra thou art now as we Deathless divine thou art become a god Glory and power and gifts celestial And all the joys of heaven are thine for aye What hath a beast with these Leave here thy hound Yet Yudhisthira answered O Most High O Thousand eyed and wisest can it be That one exalted should seem pitiless Nay let me lose such glory for its sake I cannot leave one living thing I loved Then sternly Indra spake He is unclean And into Swarga such shall enter not The Krodhavasha s wrath destroys the fruits Of sacrifice if dogs defile the fire Bethink thee Dharmaraj quit now this beast That which is seemly is not hard of heart Still he replied Tis written that to spurn A suppliant equals in offense to slay A twice born wherefore not for Swarga s bliss Quit I Mahendra this poor clinging dog So without any hope or friend save me So wistful fawning for my faithfulness So agonized to die unless I help Who among men was called steadfast and just Quoth Indra Nay the altar flame is foul Where a dog passeth angry angels sweep The ascending smoke aside and all the fruits Of offering and the merit of the prayer Of him whom a hound toucheth Leave it here He that will enter heaven must enter pure Why didst thou quit thy brethren on the way And Krishna and the dear loved Draupadi Attaining firm and glorious to this Mount Through perfect deeds to linger for a brute Hath Yudhisthira vanquished self to melt With one poor passion at the door of bliss Stay saint thou for this who didst not stay for them Draupadi Bhima But the King yet spake Tis known that none can hurt or help the dead They the delightful ones who sank and died Following my footsteps could not live again Though I had turned therefore I did not turn But could help profit I had stayed to help There be four sins O Sakra grievous sins The first is making suppliants despair The second is to slay a nursing wife The third is spoiling Brahmans goods by force The fourth is injuring an ancient friend These four I deem not direr than the crime If one in coming forth from woe to weal Abandon any meanest comrade then Straight as he spake brightly great Indra smiled Vanished the hound and in its stead stood there The Lord of Death and Justice Dharma s self Sweet were the words which fell from those dread lips Precious the lovely praise O thou true King Thou that dost bring to harvest the good seed Of Pandu s righteousness thou that hast ruth As he before on all which lives O son I tried thee in the Dwaita wood what time They smote thy brothers bringing water then Thou prayedst for Nakula s life tender and just Nor Bhima s nor Arjuna s true to both To Madri as to Kunti to both queens Hear thou my word Because thou didst not mount This car divine lest the poor hound be shent Who looked to thee lo there is none in heaven Shall sit above thee King Bharata s son Enter thou now to the eternal joys Living and in thy form Justice and Love Welcome thee Monarch thou shalt throne with us HE AND SHE She is dead they said to him come away Kiss her and leave her thy love is clay They smoothed her tresses of dark brown hair On her forehead of stone they laid it fair Over her eyes that gazed too much They drew the lids with a gentle touch With a tender touch they closed up well The sweet thin lips that had secrets to tell About her brows and beautiful face They tied her veil and her marriage lace And drew on her white feet her white silk shoes Which were the whitest no eye could choose And over her bosom they crossed her hands Come away they said God understands And there was silence and nothing there But silence and scents of eglantere And jasmine and roses and rosemary And they said As a lady should lie lies she And they held their breath till they left the room With a shudder to glance at its stillness and gloom But he who loved her too well to dread The sweet the stately the beautiful dead He lit his lamp and took the key And turned it alone again he and she He and she but she would not speak Though he kissed in the old place the quiet cheek He and she yet she would not smile Though he called her the name she loved erewhile He and she still she did not move To any passionate whisper of love Then he said Cold lips and breasts without breath Is there no voice no language of death Dumb to the ear and still to the sense But to heart and to soul distinct intense See now I will listen with soul not ear What was the secret of dying dear Was it the infinite wonder of all That you ever could let life s flower fall Or was it a greater marvel to feel The perfect calm o er the agony steal Was the miracle greater to find how deep Beyond all dreams sank downward that sleep Did life roll back its record dear And show as they say it does past things clear And was it the innermost heart of the bliss To find out so what a wisdom love is O perfect dead O dead most dear I hold the breath of my soul to hear I listen as deep as to horrible hell As high as to heaven and you do not tell There must be pleasure in dying sweet To make you so placid from head to feet I would tell you darling if I were dead And twere your hot tears upon my brow shed I would say though the Angel of Death had laid His sword on my lips to keep it unsaid You should not ask vainly with streaming eyes Which of all deaths was the chiefest surprise The very strangest and suddenest thing Of all the surprises that dying must bring Ah foolish world O most kind dead Though he told me who will believe it was said Who will believe that he heard her say With the sweet soft voice in the dear old way The utmost wonder is this I hear And see you and love you and kiss you dear And am your angel who was your bride And know that though dead I have never died AFTER DEATH From Pearls of the Faith He made life and He takes it but instead Gives more praise the Restorer Al Mu hid He who died at Azan sends This to comfort faithful friends Faithful friends it lies I know Pale and white and cold as snow And ye say Abdullah s dead Weeping at my feet and head I can see your falling tears I can hear your cries and prayers Yet I smile and whisper this I am not that thing you kiss Cease your tears and let it lie It was mine it is not I Sweet friends what the women lave For its last bed in the grave Is a tent which I am quitting Is a garment no more fitting Is a cage from which at last Like a hawk my soul hath passed Love the inmate not the room The wearer not the garb the plume Of the falcon not the bars Which kept him from the splendid stars Loving friends be wise and dry Straightway every weeping eye What ye lift upon the bier Is not worth a wistful tear Tis an empty sea shell one Out of which the pearl is gone The shell is broken it lies there The pearl the all the soul is here Tis an earthen jar whose lid Allah sealed the while it hid That treasure of His treasury A mind which loved Him let it lie Let the shard be earth s once more Since the gold shines in His store Allah Mu hid Allah most good Now Thy grace is understood Now my heart no longer wonders What Al Barsakh is which sunders Life from death and death from Heaven Nor the Paradises Seven Which the happy dead inherit Nor those birds which bear each spirit Toward the Throne green birds and white Radiant glorious swift their flight Now the long long darkness ends Yet ye wail my foolish friends While the man whom ye call dead In unbroken bliss instead Lives and loves you lost tis true By any light which shines for you But in light ye cannot see Of unfulfilled felicity And enlarging Paradise Lives the life that never dies Farewell friends Yet not farewell Where I am ye too shall dwell I am gone before your face A heart beat s time a gray ant s pace When ye come where I have stepped Ye will marvel why ye wept Ye will know by true love taught That here is all and there is naught Weep awhile if ye are fain Sunshine still must follow rain Only not at death for death Now I see is that first breath Which our souls draw when we enter Life that is of all life centre Know ye Allah s law is love Viewed from Allah s Throne above Be ye firm of trust and come Faithful onward to your home La Allah illa Allah Yea Mu hid Restorer Sovereign say He who died at Azan gave This to those that made his grave SOLOMON AND THE ANT From Pearls of the Faith Say Ar Raheen call Him Compassionate For He is pitiful to small and great Tis written that the serving angels stand Beside God s throne ten myriads on each hand Waiting with wings outstretched and watchful eyes To do their Master s heavenly embassies Quicker than thought His high commands they read Swifter than light to execute them speed Bearing the word of power from star to star Some hither and some thither near and far And unto these naught is too high or low Too mean or mighty if He wills it so Neither is any creature great or small Beyond His pity which embraceth all Because His eye beholdeth all which are Sees without search and counteth without care Nor lies the babe nearer the nursing place Than Allah s smallest child to Allah s grace Nor any ocean rolls so vast that He Forgets one wave of all that restless sea Thus it is written and moreover told How Gabriel watching by the Gates of Gold Heard from the Voice Ineffable this word Of twofold mandate uttered by the Lord Go earthward pass where Solomon hath made His pleasure house and sitteth there arrayed Goodly and splendid whom I crowned the king For at this hour my servant doth a thing Unfitting out of Nisibis there came A thousand steeds with nostrils all aflame And limbs of swiftness prizes of the fight Lo these are led for Solomon s delight Before the palace where he gazeth now Filling his heart with pride at that brave show So taken with the snorting and the tramp Of his war horses that Our silver lamp Of eve is swung in vain Our warning Sun Will sink before his sunset prayer s begun So shall the people say This king our lord Loves more the long maned trophies of his sword Than the remembrance of his God Go in Save thou My faithful servant from such sin Also upon the slope of Arafat Beneath a lote tree which is fallen flat Toileth a yellow ant who carrieth home Food for her nest but so far hath she come Her worn feet fail and she will perish caught In the falling rain but thou make the way naught And help her to her people in the cleft Of the black rock Silently Gabriel left The Presence and prevented the king s sin And holp the little ant at entering in O Thou whose love is wide and great We praise Thee The Compassionate THE AFTERNOON From Pearls of the Faith He is sufficient and He makes suffice Praise thus again thy Lord mighty and wise God is enough thou who in hope and fear Toilest through desert sands of life sore tried Climb trustful over death s black ridge for near The bright wells shine thou wilt be satisfied God doth suffice O thou the patient one Who puttest faith in Him and none beside Bear yet thy load under the setting sun The glad tents gleam thou wilt be satisfied By God s gold Afternoon peace ye shall have Man is in loss except he live aright And help his fellow to be firm and brave Faithful and patient then the restful night Al Mughni best Rewarder we Endure putting our trust in Thee THE TRUMPET From Pearls of the Faith Magnify Him Al Kaiyum and so call The Self subsisting God who judgeth all When the trumpet shall sound On that day The wicked slow gathering Shall say Is it long we have lain in our graves For it seems as an hour Then will Israfil call them to judgment And none shall have power To turn aside this way or that And their voices will sink To silence except for the sounding Of a noise like the noise on the brink Of the sea when its stones Are dragged with a clatter and hiss Down the shore in the wild breakers roar The sound of their woe shall be this Then they who denied That He liveth Eternal Self made Shall call to the mountains to crush them Amazed and affrayed Thou Self subsistent Living Lord Thy grace against that day afford ENVOI TO THE LIGHT OF ASIA Ah Blessed Lord Oh High Deliverer Forgive this feeble script which doth Thee wrong Measuring with little wit Thy lofty Love Ah Lover Brother Guide Lamp of the Law I take my refuge in Thy name and Thee I take my refuge in Thy Law of God I take my refuge in Thy Order Om The Dew is on the lotus rise great Sun And lift my leaf and mix me with the wave Om mani padme hum the Sunrise comes The Dewdrop slips into the Shining Sea From Harper s Monthly copyright eighteen eighty six by Harper Brothers GRISHMA OR THE SEASON OF HEAT Translated from Kalidasa s Ritu Sanhara With fierce noons beaming moons of glory gleaming Full conduits streaming where fair bathers lie With sunsets splendid when the strong day ended Melts into peace like a tired lover s sigh So cometh summer nigh And nights of ebon blackness laced with lustres From starry clusters courts of calm retreat Where wan rills warble over glistening marble Cold jewels and the sandal moist and sweet These for the time are meet Of Suchi dear one of the bright days bringing Love songs for singing which all hearts enthrall Wine cups that sparkle at the lips of lovers Odors and pleasures in the palace hall In Suchi these befall For then with wide hips richly girt and bosoms Fragrant with blossoms and with pearl strings gay Their new laved hair unbound and spreading round Faint scents the palace maids in tender play The ardent heats allay Of princely playmates Through the gates their feet With lac dye rosy and neat and anklets ringing In music trip along echoing the song Of wild swans all men s hearts by subtle singing To Kama s service bringing For who their sandal scented breasts perceiving Their white pearls weaving with the saffron stars Girdles and diadems their gold and gems Linked upon waist and thigh in Love s soft snares Is not caught unawares Then lay they by their robes no longer light For the warm midnight and their beauty cover With woven veil too airy to conceal Its dew pearled softness so with youth clad over Each seeks her eager lover And sweet airs winnowed from the sandal fans Faint balm that nests between those gem bound breasts Voices of stream and bird and clear notes heard From vina strings amid the songs unrests Wake passion With light jests And sidelong glances and coy smiles and dances Each maid enhances newly sprung delight Quick leaps the fire of Love s divine desire So kindled in the season when the Night With broadest moons is bright Till on the silvered terraces sleep sunken With Love s draughts drunken those close lovers lie And all for sorrow there shall come To morrow The Moon who watched them pales in the gray sky While the still Night doth die Then breaks fierce Day The whirling dust is driven O er earth and heaven until the sun scorched plain Its road scarce shows for dazzling heat to those Who far from home and love journey in pain Longing to rest again Panting and parched with muzzles dry and burning For cool streams yearning herds of antelope Haste where the brassy sky banked black and high Hath clouded promise There will be they hope Water beyond the tope Sick with the glare his hooded terrors failing His slow coils trailing o er the fiery dust The cobra glides to nighest shade and hides His head beneath the peacock s train he must His ancient foeman trust The purple peafowl wholly overmastered By the red morning droop with weary cries No stroke they make to slay that gliding snake Who creeps for shelter underneath the eyes Of their spread jewelries The jungle lord the kingly tiger prowling For fierce thirst howling orbs a stare and red Sees without heed the elephants pass by him Lolls his lank tongue and hangs his bloody head His mighty forces fled Nor heed the elephants that tiger plucking Green leaves and sucking with a dry trunk dew Tormented by the blazing day they wander And nowhere finding water still renew Their search a woful crew With restless snout rooting the dark morasses Where reeds and grasses on the soft slime grow The wild boars grunting ill content and anger Dig lairs to shield them from the torturing glow Deep deep as they can go The frog for misery of his pool departing Neath that flame darting ball and waters drained Down to their mud crawls croaking forth to cower Under the black snake s coils where there is gained A little shade and strained To patience by such heat scorching the jewel Gleaming so cruel on his venomous head That worm whose tongue as the blast burns along Licks it for coolness all discomfited Strikes not his strange friend dead The pool with tender growing cups of lotus Once brightly blowing hath no blossoms more Its fish are dead its fearful cranes are fled And crowding elephants its flowery shore Tramp to a miry floor With foam strings roping from his jowls and dropping From dried drawn lips horns laid aback and eyes Mad with the drouth and thirst tormented mouth Down thundering from his mountain cavern flies The bison in wild wise Questing a water channel Bare and scrannel The trees droop where the crows sit in a row With beaks agape The hot baboon and ape Climb chattering to the bush The buffalo Bellows And locusts go Choking the wells Far o er the hills and dells Wanders th affrighted eye beholding blasted The pleasant grass the forest s leafy mass Wilted its waters waned its grace exhausted Its creatures wasted Then leaps to view blood red and bright of hue As blooms sprung new on the Kusumbha Tree The wild fire s tongue fanned by the wind and flung Furiously forth the palms canes brakes you see Wrapped in one agony Of lurid death The conflagration driven In fiery levin roars from jungle caves Hisses and blusters through the bamboo clusters Crackles across the curling grass and drives Into the river waves The forest folk Dreadful that flame to see Coil from the cotton tree a snake of gold Violently break from root and trunk to take The bending boughs and leaves in deadly hold Then passing to enfold New spoils In herds elephants jackals pards For anguish of such fate their enmity Laying aside burst for the river wide Which flows between fair isles in company As friends they madly flee But Thee my Best Beloved may Suchi visit fair With songs of secret waters cooling the quiet air Under blue buds of lotus beds and patalas which shed Fragrance and balm while Moonlight weaves over thy happy head Its silvery veil So Nights and Days of Summer pass for thee Amid the pleasure palaces with love and melody MATTHEW ARNOLD eighteen twenty two eighteen eighty eight BY GEORGE EDWARD WOODBERRY Matthew Arnold an English poet and critic was born December twenty fourth eighteen twenty two at Laleham in the Thames valley He was the son of doctor Thomas Arnold best remembered as the master of Rugby in later years and distinguished also as a historian of Rome His mother was by her maiden name Mary Penrose and long survived her husband Arnold passed his school days at Winchester and Rugby and went to Oxford in October eighteen forty one There as also at school he won scholarship and prize and showed poetical talent He was elected a fellow of Oriel in March eighteen forty five He taught for a short time at Rugby but in eighteen forty seven became private secretary to Lord Lansdowne who in eighteen fifty one appointed him school inspector From that time he was engaged mainly in educational labors as inspector and commissioner and traveled frequently on the Continent examining foreign methods He was also interested controversially in political and religious questions of the day and altogether had a sufficient public life outside of literature In eighteen fifty one he married Frances Lucy daughter of Sir William Wightman a judge of the Court of Queen s Bench and by her had five children three sons and two daughters His first volume of verse The Strayed Reveller and Other Poems bears the date eighteen forty nine the second Empedocles on Etna and Other Poems eighteen fifty two the third Poems made up mainly from the two former was published in eighteen fifty three and thereafter he added little to his poetic work His first volume of similar significance in prose was Essays in Criticism issued in eighteen sixty five Throughout his mature life he was a constant writer and his collected works of all kinds now fill eleven volumes exclusive of his letters In eighteen fifty seven he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford and there began his career as a lecturer and this method of public expression he employed often His life was thus one with many diverse activities and filled with practical or literary affairs and on no side was it deficient in human relations He won respect and reputation while he lived and his works continue to attract men s minds although with much unevenness He died at Liverpool on April fifteenth eighteen eighty eight Illustration MATTHEW ARNOLD That considerable portion of Arnold s writings which was concerned with education and politics or with phases of theological thought and religious tendency however valuable in contemporary discussion and to men and movements of the third quarter of the century must be set on one side It is not because of anything there contained that he has become a permanent figure of his time or is of interest in literature He achieved distinction as a critic and as a poet but although he was earlier in the field as a poet he was recognized by the public at large first as a critic The union of the two functions is not unusual in the history of literature but where success has been attained in both the critic has commonly sprung from the poet in the man and his range and quality have been limited thereby It was so with Dryden and Wordsworth and less obviously with Landor and Lowell In Arnold s case there is no such growth the two modes of writing prose and verse were disconnected One could read his essays without suspecting a poet and his poems without discerning a critic except so far as one finds the moralist there In fact Arnold s critical faculty belonged rather to the practical side of his life and was a part of his talents as a public man This appears by the very definitions that he gave and by the turn of his phrase which always keeps an audience rather than a meditative reader in view What is the function of criticism at the present time he asks and answers A disinterested endeavor to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought in the world That is a wide warrant The writer who exercises his critical function under it however is plainly a reformer at heart and labors for the social welfare He is not an analyst of the form of art for its own sake or a contemplator of its substance of wisdom or beauty merely He is not limited to literature or the other arts of expression but the world the intellectual world is all before him where to choose and having learned the best that is known and thought his second and manifestly not inferior duty is to go into all nations a messenger of the propaganda of intelligence It is a great mission and nobly characterized but if criticism be so defined it is criticism of a large mold The scope of the word conspicuously appears also in the phrase which became proverbial declaring that literature is a criticism of life In such an employment of terms ordinary meanings evaporate and it becomes necessary to know the thought of the author rather than the usage of men Without granting the dictum therefore which would be far from the purpose is it not clear that by critic and criticism Arnold intended to designate or at least to convey something peculiar to his own conception not strictly related to literature at all it may be but more closely tied to society in its general mental activity In other words Arnold was a critic of civilization more than of books and aimed at illumination by means of ideas With this goes his manner that habitual air of telling you something which you did not know before and doing it for your good which stamps him as a preacher born Under the mask of the critic is the long English face of the gospeler that type whose persistent physiognomy was never absent from the conventicle of English thought This evangelizing prepossession of Arnold s mind must be recognized in order to understand alike his attitude of superiority his stiffly didactic method and his success in attracting converts in whom the seed proved barren The first impression that his entire work makes is one of limitation so strict is this limitation and it profits him so much that it seems the element in which he had his being On a close survey the fewness of his ideas is most surprising though the fact is somewhat cloaked by the lucidity of his thought its logical vigor and the manner of its presentation He takes a text either some formula of his own or some adopted phrase that he has made his own and from that he starts out only to return to it again and again with ceaseless iteration In his illustrations for example when he has pilloried some poor gentleman otherwise unknown for the astounded and amused contemplation of the Anglican monocle he cannot let him alone So too when with the journalist s nack for nicknames he divides all England into three parts he cannot forget the rhetorical exploit He never lets the points he has made fall into oblivion and hence his work in general as a critic is skeletonized to the memory in watchwords formulas and nicknames which taken altogether make up only a small number of ideas His scale likewise is meagre His essay is apt to be a book review or a plea merely it is without that free illusiveness and undeveloped suggestion which indicate a full mind and give to such brief pieces of writing the sense of overflow He takes no large subject as a whole but either a small one or else some phases of the larger one and he exhausts all that he touches He seems to have no more to say It is probable that his acquaintance with literature was incommensurate with his reputation or apparent scope as a writer As he has fewer ideas than any other author of his time of the same rank so he discloses less knowledge of his own or foreign literatures His occupations forbade wide acquisition he husbanded his time and economized also by giving the best direction to his private studies and he accomplished much but he could not master the field as any man whose profession was literature might easily do Consequently in comparison with Coleridge or Lowell his critical work seems dry and bare with neither the fluency nor the richness of a master In yet another point this paucity of matter appears What mister Richard Holt Hutton says in his essay on the poetry of Arnold is so apposite here that it will be best to quote the passage He is speaking in an aside of Arnold s criticisms They are fine they are keen they are often true but they are always too much limited to the thin superficial layer of the moral nature of their subjects and seem to take little comparative interest in the deeper individuality beneath Read his essay on Heine and you will see the critic engrossed with the relation of Heine to the political and social ideas of his day and passing over with comparative indifference the true soul of Heine the fountain of both his poetry and his cynicism Read his five lectures on translating Homer and observe how exclusively the critic s mind is occupied with the form as distinguished from the substance of the Homeric poetry Even when he concerns himself with the greatest modern poets with Shakespeare as in the preface to the earlier edition of his poems or with Goethe in reiterated poetical criticisms or when he again and again in his poems treats of Wordsworth it is always the style and superficial doctrine of their poetry not the individual character and unique genius which occupy him He will tell you whether a poet is sane and clear or stormy and fervent whether he is rapid and noble or loquacious and quaint whether a thinker penetrates the husks of conventional thought which mislead the crowd whether there is sweetness as well as lucidity in his aims whether a descriptive writer has distinction of style or is admirable only for his vivacity but he rarely goes to the individual heart of any of the subjects of his criticism he finds their style and class but not their personality in that class he ranks his men but does not portray them hardly even seems to find much interest in the individual roots of their character In brief this is to say that Arnold took little interest in human nature nor is there anything in his later essays on Byron Keats Wordsworth Milton or Gray to cause us to revise the judgment on this point In fact so far as he touched on the personality of Keats or Gray to take the capital instances he was most unsatisfactory Arnold was not then one of those critics who are interested in life itself and through the literary work seize on the soul of the author in its original brightness or set forth the life stains in the successive incarnations of his heart and mind Nor was he of those who consider the work itself final and endeavor simply to understand it form and matter and so to mediate between genius and our slower intelligence He followed neither the psychological nor the aesthetic method It need hardly be said that he was born too early to be able ever to conceive of literature as a phenomenon of society and its great men as only terms in an evolutionary series He had only a moderate knowledge of literature and his stock of ideas was small his manner of speech was hard and dry there was a trick in his style and his self repetition is tiresome What gave him vogue then and what still keeps his more literary work alive Is it anything more than the temper in which he worked and the spirit which he evoked in the reader He stood for the very spirit of intelligence in his time He made his readers respect ideas and want to have as many as possible He enveloped them in an atmosphere of mental curiosity and alertness and put them in contact with novel and attractive themes In particular he took their minds to the Continent and made them feel that they were becoming cosmopolitan by knowing Joubert or at home he rallied them in opposition to the dullness of the period to barbarism or other objectionable traits in the social classes and he volleyed contempt upon the common multitudinous foe in general and from time to time cheered them with some delectable examples of single combat It cannot be concealed that there was much malicious pleasure in it all He was not indisposed to high bred cruelty Like Lamb he loved a fool but it was in a mortar and pleasant it was to see the spectacle when he really took a man in hand for the chastisement of irony It is thus that the seraphim illuminati sneer And in all his controversial writing there was a brilliancy and unsparingness that will appeal to the deepest instincts of a fighting race willy nilly and as one had only to read the words to feel himself among the children of light so that our withers were unwrung there was high enjoyment This liveliness of intellectual conflict together with the sense of ideas was a boon to youth especially and the academic air in which the thought and style always moved with scholarly self possession and assurance with the dogmatism of enlightenment in all ages and among all sects with serenity and security unassailable from within at least this academic clearness and purity without shadow or stain had an overpowering charm to the college bred and cultivated who found the rare combination of information taste and aggressiveness in one of their own ilk Above all there was the play of intelligence on every page there was an application of ideas to life in many regions of the world s interests there was contact with a mind keen clear and firm armed for controversy or persuasion equally and filled with eager belief in itself its ways and its will To meet such personality in a book was a bracing experience and for many these essays were an awakening of the mind itself We may go to others for the greater part of what criticism can give for definite and fundamental principles for adequate characterization for the intuition and the revelation the penetrant flash of thought and phrase but Arnold generates and supports a temper of mind in which the work of these writers best thrives even in its own sphere and through him this temper becomes less individual than social encompassing the whole of life Few critics have been really less disinterested few have kept their eyes less steadily upon the object but that fact does not lessen the value of his precepts of disinterestedness and objectivity nor is it necessary in becoming a child of light to join in spirit the unhappy remnant of the academy or to drink too deep of that honeyed satisfaction with which he fills his readers of being on his side As a critic Arnold succeeds if his main purpose does not fail and that was to reinforce the party of ideas of culture of the children of light to impart not moral vigor but openness and reasonableness of mind and to arouse and arm the intellectual in contradistinction to the other energies of civilization The poetry of Arnold to pass to the second portion of his work was less widely welcomed than his prose and made its way very slowly but it now seems the most important and permanent part It is not small in quantity though his unproductiveness in later years has made it appear that he was less fluent and abundant in verse than he really was The remarkable thing as one turns to his poems is the contrast in spirit that they afford to the essays there is here an atmosphere of entire calm We seem to be in a different world This fact with the singular silence of his familiar letters in regard to his verse indicates that his poetic life was truly a thing apart In one respect only is there something in common between his prose and verse just as interest in human nature was absent in the latter it is absent also in the former There is no action in the poems neither is there character for its own sake Arnold was a man of the mind and he betrays no interest in personality except for its intellectual traits in Clough as in Obermann it is the life of thought not the human being that he portrays As a poet he expresses the moods of the meditative spirit in view of nature and our mortal existence and he represents life not lyrically by its changeful moments nor tragically by its conflict in great characters but philosophically by a self contained and unvarying monologue deeper or less deep in feeling and with cadences of tone but always with the same grave and serious effect He is constantly thinking whatever his subject or his mood his attitude is intellectual his sentiments are maxims his conclusions are advisory His world is the sphere of thought and his poems have the distance and repose and also the coldness that befit that sphere and the character of his imagination which lays hold of form and reason makes natural to him the classical style It is obvious that the sources of his poetical culture are Greek It is not merely however that he takes for his early subjects Merope and Empedocles or that he strives in Balder Dead for Homeric narrative or that in the recitative to which he was addicted he evoked an immelodious phantom of Greek choruses nor is it the marmoreal air that chills while it ennobles much of his finest work One feels the Greek quality not as a source but as a presence In Tennyson Keats and Shelley there was Greek influence but in them the result was modern In Arnold the antiquity remains remains in mood just as in Landor it remains in form The Greek twilight broods over all his poetry It is pagan in philosophic spirit not Attic but of a later and stoical time with the very virtues of patience endurance suffering not in their Christian types but as they now seem to a post Christian imagination looking back to the imperial past There is a difference it is true in Arnold s expression of the mood he is as little Sophoclean as he is Homeric as little Lucretian as he is Vergilian The temperament is not the same not a survival or a revival of the antique but original and living And yet the mood of the verse is felt at once to be a reincarnation of the deathless spirit of Hellas that in other ages also has made beautiful and solemn for a time the shadowed places of the Christian world If one does not realize this he must miss the secret of the tranquillity the chill the grave austerity as well as the philosophical resignation which are essential to the verse Even in those parts of the poems which use romantic motives one reason of their original charm is that they suggest how the Greek imagination would have dealt with the forsaken merman the church of Brou and Tristram and Iseult The presence of such motives such mythology and such Christian and chivalric color in the work of Arnold does not disturb the simple unity of its feeling which finds no solvent for life whatever its accident of time and place and faith except in that Greek spirit which ruled in thoughtful men before the triumph of Christianity and is still native in men who accept the intellect as the sole guide of life It was with reference to these modern men and the movement they took part in that he made his serious claim to greatness to rank that is with Tennyson and Browning as he said in the literature of his time My poems he wrote represent on the whole the main movement of mind of the last quarter of a century and thus they will probably have their day as people become conscious to themselves of what that movement of mind is and interested in the literary productions that reflect it It might be fairly urged that I have less poetical sentiment than Tennyson and less intellectual vigor and abundance than Browning yet because I have perhaps more of a fusion of the two than either of them and have more regularly applied that fusion to the main line of modern development I am likely enough to have my turn as they have had theirs If the main movement had been such as he thought of it or if it had been of importance in the long run there might be a sounder basis for this hope than now appears to be the case but there can be no doubt let the contemporary movement have been what it may that Arnold s mood is one that will not pass out of men s hearts to day nor to morrow On the modern side the example of Wordsworth was most formative and in fact it is common to describe Arnold as a Wordsworthian and so in his contemplative attitude to nature and in his habitual recourse to her he was but both nature herself as she appeared to him and his mood in her presence were very different from Wordsworth s conception and emotion Arnold finds in nature a refuge from life an anodyne an escape but Wordsworth in going into the hills for poetical communion passed from a less to a fuller and deeper life and obtained an inspiration and was seeking the goal of all his being In the method of approach too as well as in the character of the experience there was a profound difference between the two poets Arnold sees with the outward rather than the inward eye He is pictorial in a way that Wordsworth seldom is he uses detail much more and gives a group or a scene with the externality of a painter The method resembles that of Tennyson rather than that of Wordsworth and has more direct analogy with the Greek manner than with the modern and emotional schools it is objective often minute and always carefully composed in the artistic sense of that term The description of the river Oxus for example though faintly charged with suggested and allegoric meaning is a noble close to the poem which ends in it The scale is large and Arnold was fond of a broad landscape of mountains and prospects over the land but one cannot fancy Wordsworth writing it So too on a small scale the charming scene of the English garden in Thyrsis is far from Wordsworth s manner When garden walks and all the grassy floor With blossoms red and white of fallen May And chestnut flowers are strewn So have I heard the cuckoo s parting cry From the wet field through the vext garden trees Come with the volleying rain and tossing breeze This is a picture that could be framed how different from Wordsworth s wandering voice Or to take another notable example which like the Oxus passage is a fine close in the Tristram and Iseult the hunter on the arras above the dead lovers A stately huntsman clad in green And round him a fresh forest scene On that clear forest knoll he stays With his pack round him and delays The wild boar rustles in his lair The fierce hounds snuff the tainted air But lord and hounds keep rooted there Cheer cheer thy dogs into the brake O hunter and without a fear Thy golden tasseled bugle blow But no one is deceived and the hunter does not move from the arras but is still rooted there with his green suit and his golden tassel The piece is pictorial and highly wrought for pictorial effects only obviously decorative and used as stage scenery precisely in the manner of our later theatrical art with that accent of forethought which turns the beautiful into the aesthetic This is a method which Wordsworth never used Take one of his pictures the Reaper for example and see the difference The one is out of doors the other is of the studio The purpose of these illustrations is to show that Arnold s nature pictures are not only consciously artistic with an arrangement that approaches artifice but that he is interested through his eye primarily and not through his emotions It is characteristic of his temperament also that he reminds one most often of the painter in water colors If there is this difference between Arnold and Wordsworth in method a greater difference in spirit is to be anticipated It is a fixed gulf In nature Wordsworth found the one spirit s plastic stress and a near and intimate revelation to the soul of truths that were his greatest joy and support in existence Arnold finds there no inhabitancy of God no such streaming forth of wisdom and beauty from the fountain heads of being but the secret frame of nature is filled only with the darkness the melancholy the waiting endurance that is projected from himself Yet Fausta the mute turf we tread The solemn hills about us spread The stream that falls incessantly The strange scrawled rocks the lonely sky If I might lend their life a voice Seem to bear rather than rejoice Compare this with Wordsworth s Stanzas on Peele Castle and the important reservations that must be borne in mind in describing Arnold as a Wordsworthian will become clearer It is as a relief from thought as a beautiful and half physical diversion as a scale of being so vast and mysterious as to reduce the pettiness of human life to nothingness it is in these ways that nature has value in Arnold s verse Such a poet may describe natural scenes well and obtain by means of them contrast to human conditions and decorative beauty but he does not penetrate nature or interpret what her significance is in the human spirit as the more emotional poets have done He ends in an antithesis not in a synthesis and both nature and man lose by the divorce One looks in vain for anything deeper than landscapes in Arnold s treatment of nature she is emptied of her own infinite and has become spiritually void and in the simple great line in which he gave the sea The unplumbed salt estranging sea he is thinking of man not of the ocean and the mood seems ancient rather than modern the feeling of a Greek just as the sound of the waves to him is always Aegean In treating of man s life which must be the main thing in any poet s work Arnold is either very austere or very pessimistic If the feeling is moral the predominant impression is of austerity if it is intellectual the predominant impression is of sadness He was not insensible to the charm of life but he feels it in his senses only to deny it in his mind The illustrative passage is from Dover Beach Ah love let us be true To one another for the world which seems To lie before us like a land of dreams So various so beautiful so new Hath really neither joy nor love nor light Nor certitude nor peace nor help for pain This is the contradiction of sense and thought the voice of a regret grounded in the intellect for if it were vital and grounded in the emotions it would become despair the creed of illusion and futility in life which is the characteristic note of Arnold and the reason of his acceptance by many minds The one thing about life which he most insists on is its isolation its individuality In the series called Switzerland this is the substance of the whole and the doctrine is stated with an intensity and power with an amplitude and prolongation that set these poems apart as the most remarkable of all his lyrics From a poet so deeply impressed with this aspect of existence and unable to find its remedy or its counterpart in the harmony of life no joyful or hopeful word can be expected and none is found The second thing about life which he dwells on is its futility though he bids one strive and work and points to the example of the strong whom he has known yet one feels that his voice rings more true when he writes of Obermann than in any other of the elegiac poems In such verse as the Summer Night again the genuineness of the mood is indubitable In The Sick King of Bokhara the one dramatic expression of his genius futility is the very centre of the action The fact that so much of his poetry seems to take its motive from the subsidence of Christian faith has set him among the skeptic or agnostic poets and the main movement which he believed he had expressed was doubtless that in which agnosticism was a leading element The unbelief of the third quarter of the century was certainly a controlling influence over him and in a man mainly intellectual by nature it could not well have been otherwise Hence as one looks at his more philosophical and lyrical poems the profounder part of his work and endeavors to determine their character and sources alike it is plain to see that in the old phrase the pride of the intellect lifts its lonely column over the desolation of every page The man of the academy is here as in the prose after all He reveals himself in the literary motive the bookish atmosphere of the verse in its vocabulary its elegance of structure its precise phrase and its curious allusions involving footnotes and in fact throughout all its form and structure So self conscious is it that it becomes frankly prosaic at inconvenient times and is more often on the level of eloquent and graceful rhetoric than of poetry It is frequently liquid and melodious but there is no burst of native song in it anywhere It is the work of a true poet nevertheless but there are many voices for the Muse It is sincere it is touched with reality it is the mirror of a phase of life in our times and not in our times only but whenever the intellect seeks expression for its sense of the limitation of its own career and its sadness in a world which it cannot solve A word should be added concerning the personality of Arnold which is revealed in his familiar letters a collection that has dignified the records of literature with a singularly noble memory of private life Few who did not know Arnold could have been prepared for the revelation of a nature so true so amiable so dutiful In every relation of private life he is shown to have been a man of exceptional constancy and plainness The letters are mainly home letters but a few friendships also yielded up their hoard and thus the circle of private life is made complete Every one must take delight in the mental association with Arnold in the scenes of his existence thus daily exposed and in his family affections A nature warm to its own kindly to all cheerful fond of sport and fun and always fed from pure fountains and with it a character so founded upon the rock so humbly serviceable so continuing in power and grace must wake in all the responses of happy appreciation and leave the charm of memory He did his duty as naturally as if it required neither resolve nor effort nor thought of any kind for the morrow and he never failed seemingly in act or word of sympathy in little or great things and when to this one adds the clear ether of the intellectual life where he habitually moved in his own life apart and the humanity of his home the gift that these letters bring may be appreciated That gift is the man himself but set in the atmosphere of home with son ship and fatherhood sisters and brothers with the bereavements of years fully accomplished and those of babyhood and boyhood a sweet and wholesome English home with all the cloud and sunshine of the English world drifting over its roof tree and the soil of England beneath its stones and English duties for the breath of its being To add such a home to the household rights of English literature is perhaps something from which Arnold would have shrunk but it endears his memory Illustration Signature Geroge E Woodberry INTELLIGENCE AND GENIUS From Essays in Criticism What are the essential characteristics of the spirit of our nation Not certainly an open and clear mind not a quick and flexible intelligence Our greatest admirers would not claim for us that we have these in a pre eminent degree they might say that we had more of them than our detractors gave us credit for but they would not assert them to be our essential characteristics They would rather allege as our chief spiritual characteristics energy and honesty and if we are judged favorably and positively not invidiously and negatively our chief characteristics are no doubt these energy and honesty not an open and clear mind not a quick and flexible intelligence Openness of mind and flexibility of intelligence were very signal characteristics of the Athenian people in ancient times everybody will feel that Openness of mind and flexibility of intelligence are remarkable characteristics of the French people in modern times at any rate they strikingly characterize them as compared with us I think everybody or almost everybody will feel that I will not now ask what more the Athenian or the French spirit has than this nor what shortcomings either of them may have as a set off against this all I want now to point out is that they have this and that we have it in a much lesser degree Let me remark however that not only in the moral sphere but also in the intellectual and spiritual sphere energy and honesty are most important and fruitful qualities that for instance of what we call genius energy is the most essential part So by assigning to a nation energy and honesty as its chief spiritual characteristics by refusing to it as at all eminent characteristics openness of mind and flexibility of intelligence we do not by any means as some people might at first suppose relegate its importance and its power of manifesting itself with effect from the intellectual to the moral sphere We only indicate its probable special line of successful activity in the intellectual sphere and it is true certain imperfections and failings to which in this sphere it will always be subject Genius is mainly an affair of energy and poetry is mainly an affair of genius therefore a nation whose spirit is characterized by energy may well be eminent in poetry and we have Shakespeare Again the highest reach of science is one may say an inventive power a faculty of divination akin to the highest power exercised in poetry therefore a nation whose spirit is characterized by energy may well be eminent in science and we have Newton Shakespeare and Newton in the intellectual sphere there can be no higher names And what that energy which is the life of genius above everything demands and insists upon is freedom entire independence of all authority prescription and routine the fullest room to expand as it will Therefore a nation whose chief spiritual characteristic is energy will not be very apt to set up in intellectual matters a fixed standard an authority like an academy By this it certainly escapes certain real inconveniences and dangers and it can at the same time as we have seen reach undeniably splendid heights in poetry and science On the other hand some of the requisites of intellectual work are specially the affair of quickness of mind and flexibility of intelligence The form the method of evolution the precision the proportions the relations of the parts to the whole in an intellectual work depend mainly upon them And these are the elements of an intellectual work which are really most communicable from it which can most be learned and adopted from it which have therefore the greatest effect upon the intellectual performance of others Even in poetry these requisites are very important and the poetry of a nation not eminent for the gifts on which they depend will more or less suffer by this shortcoming In poetry however they are after all secondary and energy is the first thing but in prose they are of first rate importance In its prose literature therefore and in the routine of intellectual work generally a nation with no particular gifts for these will not be so successful These are what as I have said can to a certain degree be learned and appropriated while the free activity of genius cannot Academies consecrate and maintain them and therefore a nation with an eminent turn for them naturally establishes academies So far as routine and authority tend to embarrass energy and inventive genius academies may be said to be obstructive to energy and inventive genius and to this extent to the human spirit s general advance But then this evil is so much compensated by the propagation on a large scale of the mental aptitudes and demands which an open mind and a flexible intelligence naturally engender genius itself in the long run so greatly finds its account in this propagation and bodies like the French Academy have such power for promoting it that the general advance of the human spirit is perhaps on the whole rather furthered than impeded by their existence How much greater is our nation in poetry than prose how much better in general do the productions of its spirit show in the qualities of genius than in the qualities of intelligence One may constantly remark this in the work of individuals how much more striking in general does any Englishman of some vigor of mind but by no means a poet seem in his verse than in his prose His verse partly suffers from his not being really a poet partly no doubt from the very same defects which impair his prose and he cannot express himself with thorough success in it but how much more powerful a personage does he appear in it by dint of feeling and of originality and movement of ideas than when he is writing prose With a Frenchman of like stamp it is just the reverse set him to write poetry he is limited artificial and impotent set him to write prose he is free natural and effective The power of French literature is in its prose writers the power of English literature is in its poets Nay many of the celebrated French poets depend wholly for their fame upon the qualities of intelligence which they exhibit qualities which are the distinctive support of prose many of the celebrated English prose writers depend wholly for their fame upon the qualities of genius and imagination which they exhibit qualities which are the distinctive support of poetry But as I have said the qualities of genius are less transferable than the qualities of intelligence less can be immediately learned and appropriated from their product they are less direct and stringent intellectual agencies though they may be more beautiful and divine Shakespeare and our great Elizabethan group were certainly more gifted writers than Corneille and his group but what was the sequel to this great literature this literature of genius as we may call it stretching from Marlowe to Milton What did it lead up to in English literature To our provincial and second rate literature of the eighteenth century What on the other hand was the sequel to the literature of the French great century to this literature of intelligence as by comparison with our Elizabethan literature we may call it what did it lead up to To the French literature of the eighteenth century one of the most powerful and pervasive intellectual agencies that have ever existed the greatest European force of the eighteenth century In science again we had Newton a genius of the very highest order a type of genius in science if ever there was one On the continent as a sort of counterpart to Newton there was Leibnitz a man it seems to me though on these matters I speak under correction of much less creative energy of genius much less power of divination than Newton but rather a man of admirable intelligence a type of intelligence in science if ever there was one Well and what did they each directly lead up to in science What was the intellectual generation that sprang from each of them I only repeat what the men of science have themselves pointed out The man of genius was continued by the English analysts of the eighteenth century comparatively powerless and obscure followers of the renowned master The man of intelligence was continued by successors like Bernoulli Euler Lagrange and Laplace the greatest names in modern mathematics SWEETNESS AND LIGHT From Culture and Anarchy The disparagers of culture make its motive curiosity sometimes indeed they make its motive mere exclusiveness and vanity The culture which is supposed to plume itself on a smattering of Greek and Latin is a culture which is begotten by nothing so intellectual as curiosity it is valued either out of sheer vanity and ignorance or else as an engine of social and class distinction separating its holder like a badge or title from other people who have not got it No serious man would call this culture or attach any value to it as culture at all To find the real ground for the very differing estimate which serious people will set upon culture we must find some motive for culture in the terms of which may lie a real ambiguity and such a motive the word curiosity gives us I have before now pointed out that we English do not like the foreigners use this word in a good sense as well as in a bad sense With us the word is always used in a somewhat disapproving sense A liberal and intelligent eagerness about the things of the mind may be meant by a foreigner when he speaks of curiosity but with us the word always conveys a certain notion of frivolous and unedifying activity In the Quarterly Review some little time ago was an estimate of the celebrated French critic M Sainte Beuve and a very inadequate estimate it in my judgment was And its inadequacy consisted chiefly in this that in our English way it left out of sight the double sense really involved in the word curiosity thinking enough was said to stamp M Sainte Beuve with blame if it was said that he was impelled in his operations as a critic by curiosity and omitting either to perceive that M Sainte Beuve himself and many other people with him would consider that this was praiseworthy and not blameworthy or to point out why it ought really to be accounted worthy of blame and not of praise For as there is a curiosity about intellectual matters which is futile and merely a disease so there is certainly a curiosity a desire after the things of the mind simply for their own sakes and for the pleasure of seeing them as they are which is in an intelligent being natural and laudable Nay and the very desire to see things as they are implies a balance and regulation of mind which is not often attained without fruitful effort and which is the very opposite of the blind and diseased impulse of mind which is what we mean to blame when we blame curiosity Montesquieu says The first motive which ought to impel us to study is the desire to augment the excellence of our nature and to render an intelligent being yet more intelligent This is the true ground to assign for the genuine scientific passion however manifested and for culture viewed simply as a fruit of this passion and it is a worthy ground even though we let the term curiosity stand to describe it But there is of culture another view in which not solely the scientific passion the sheer desire to see things as they are natural and proper in an intelligent being appears as the ground of it There is a view in which all the love of our neighbor the impulses toward action help and beneficence the desire for removing human error clearing human confusion and diminishing human misery the noble aspiration to leave the world better and happier than we found it motives eminently such as are called social come in as part of the grounds of culture and the main and pre eminent part Culture is then properly described not as having its origin in curiosity but as having its origin in the love of perfection it is a study of perfection It moves by the force not merely or primarily of the scientific passion for pure knowledge but also of the moral and social passion for doing good As in the first view of it we took for its worthy motto Montesquieu s words To render an intelligent being yet more intelligent so in the second view of it there is no better motto which it can have than these words of Bishop Wilson To make reason and the will of God prevail Only whereas the passion for doing good is apt to be over hasty in determining what reason and the will of God say because its turn is for acting rather than thinking and it wants to be beginning to act and whereas it is apt to take its own conceptions which proceed from its own state of development and share in all the imperfections and immaturities of this for a basis of action what distinguishes culture is that it is possessed by the scientific passion as well as by the passion of doing good that it demands worthy notions of reason and the will of God and does not readily suffer its own crude conceptions to substitute themselves for them And knowing that no action or institution can be salutary and stable which is not based on reason and the will of God it is not so bent on acting and instituting even with the great aim of diminishing human error and misery ever before its thoughts but that it can remember that acting and instituting are of little use unless we know how and what we ought to act and to institute The pursuit of perfection then is the pursuit of sweetness and light He who works for sweetness and light works to make reason and the will of God prevail He who works for machinery he who works for hatred works only for confusion Culture looks beyond machinery culture hates hatred culture has one great passion the passion for sweetness and light It has one even yet greater the passion for making them prevail It is not satisfied till we all come to a perfect man it knows that the sweetness and light of the few must be imperfect until the raw and unkindled masses of humanity are touched with sweetness and light If I have not shrunk from saying that we must work for sweetness and light so neither have I shrunk from saying that we must have a broad basis must have sweetness and light for as many as possible Again and again I have insisted how those are the happy moments of humanity how those are the marking epochs of a people s life how those are the flowering times for literature and art and all the creative power of genius when there is a national glow of life and thought when the whole of society is in the fullest measure permeated by thought sensible to beauty intelligent and alive Only it must be real thought and real beauty real sweetness and real light Plenty of people will try to give the masses as they call them an intellectual food prepared and adapted in the way they think proper for the actual condition of the masses The ordinary popular literature is an example of this way of working on the masses Plenty of people will try to indoctrinate the masses with the set of ideas and judgments constituting the creed of their own profession or party Our religious and political organizations give an example of this way of working on the masses I condemn neither way but culture works differently It does not try to teach down to the level of inferior classes it does not try to win them for this or that sect of its own with ready made judgments and watchwords It seeks to do away with classes to make the best that has been thought and known in the world current everywhere to make all men live in an atmosphere of sweetness and light where they may use ideas as it uses them itself freely nourished and not bound by them This is the social idea and the men of culture are the true apostles of equality The great men of culture are those who have had a passion for diffusing for making prevail for carrying from one end of society to the other the best knowledge the best ideas of their time who have labored to divest knowledge of all that was harsh uncouth difficult abstract professional exclusive to humanize it to make it efficient outside the clique of the cultivated and learned yet still remaining the best knowledge and thought of the time and a true source therefore of sweetness and light Such a man was Abelard in the Middle Ages in spite of all his imperfections and thence the boundless emotion and enthusiasm which Abelard excited Such were Lessing and Herder in Germany at the end of the last century and their services to Germany were in this way inestimably precious Generations will pass and literary monuments will accumulate and works far more perfect than the works of Lessing and Herder will be produced in Germany and yet the names of these two men will fill a German with a reverence and enthusiasm such as the names of the most gifted masters will hardly awaken And why Because they humanized knowledge because they broadened the basis of life and intelligence because they worked powerfully to diffuse sweetness and light to make reason and the will of God prevail With Saint Augustine they said Let us not leave thee alone to make in the secret of thy knowledge as thou didst before the creation of the firmament the division of light from darkness let the children of thy spirit placed in their firmament make their light shine upon the earth mark the division of night and day and announce the revolution of the times for the old order is passed and the new arises the night is spent the day is come forth and thou shalt crown the year with thy blessing when thou shalt send forth laborers into thy harvest sown by other hands than theirs when thou shalt send forth new laborers to new seed times whereof the harvest shall be not yet Keeping this in view I have in my own mind often indulged myself with the fancy of employing in order to designate our aristocratic class the name of The Barbarians The Barbarians to whom we all owe so much and who reinvigorated and renewed our worn out Europe had as is well known eminent merits and in this country where we are for the most part sprung from the Barbarians we have never had the prejudice against them which prevails among the races of Latin origin The Barbarians brought with them that stanch individualism as the modern phrase is and that passion for doing as one likes for the assertion of personal liberty which appears to mister Bright the central idea of English life and of which we have at any rate a very rich supply The stronghold and natural seat of this passion was in the nobles of whom our aristocratic class are the inheritors and this class accordingly have signally manifested it and have done much by their example to recommend it to the body of the nation who already indeed had it in their blood The Barbarians again had the passion for field sports and they have handed it on to our aristocratic class who of this passion too as of the passion for asserting one s personal liberty are the great natural stronghold The care of the Barbarians for the body and for all manly exercises the vigor good looks and fine complexion which they acquired and perpetuated in their families by these means all this may be observed still in our aristocratic class The chivalry of the Barbarians with its characteristics of high spirit choice manners and distinguished bearing what is this but the attractive commencement of the politeness of our aristocratic class In some Barbarian noble no doubt one would have admired if one could have been then alive to see it the rudiments of our politest peer Only all this culture to call it by that name of the Barbarians was an exterior culture mainly It consisted principally in outward gifts and graces in looks manners accomplishments prowess The chief inward gifts which had part in it were the most exterior so to speak of inward gifts those which come nearest to outward ones they were courage a high spirit self confidence Far within and unawakened lay a whole range of powers of thought and feeling to which these interesting productions of nature had from the circumstances of their life no access Making allowances for the difference of the times surely we can observe precisely the same thing now in our aristocratic class In general its culture is exterior chiefly all the exterior graces and accomplishments and the more external of the inward virtues seem to be principally its portion It now of course cannot but be often in contact with those studies by which from the world of thought and feeling true culture teaches us to fetch sweetness and light but its hold upon these very studies appears remarkably external and unable to exert any deep power upon its spirit Therefore the one insufficiency which we noted in the perfect mean of this class was an insufficiency of light And owing to the same causes does not a subtle criticism lead us to make even on the good looks and politeness of our aristocratic class and of even the most fascinating half of that class the feminine half the one qualifying remark that in these charming gifts there should perhaps be for ideal perfection a shade more soul I often therefore when I want to distinguish clearly the aristocratic class from the Philistines proper or middle class name the former in my own mind The Barbarians And when I go through the country and see this and that beautiful and imposing seat of theirs crowning the landscape There I say to myself is a great fortified post of the Barbarians OXFORD From Essays in Criticism No we are all seekers still seekers often make mistakes and I wish mine to redound to my own discredit only and not to touch Oxford Beautiful city so venerable so lovely so unravaged by the fierce intellectual life of our century so serene There are our young barbarians all at play And yet steeped in sentiment as she lies spreading her gardens to the moonlight and whispering from her towers the last enchantments of the Middle Age who will deny that Oxford by her ineffable charm keeps ever calling us nearer to the true goal of all of us to the ideal to perfection to beauty in a word which is only truth seen from another side nearer perhaps than all the science of Tuebingen Adorable dreamer whose heart has been so romantic who hast given thyself so prodigally given thyself to sides and to heroes not mine only never to the Philistines home of lost causes and forsaken beliefs and unpopular names and impossible loyalties what example could ever so inspire us to keep down the Philistine in ourselves what teacher could ever so save us from that bondage to which we are all prone that bondage which Goethe in his incomparable lines on the death of Schiller makes it his friend s highest praise and nobly did Schiller deserve the praise to have left miles out of sight behind him the bondage of was uns alle bandigt Das Gemeine She will forgive me even if I have unwittingly drawn upon her a shot or two aimed at her unworthy son for she is generous and the cause in which I fight is after all hers Apparitions of a day what is our puny warfare against the Philistines compared with the warfare which this queen of romance has been waging against them for centuries and will wage after we are gone TO A FRIEND Who prop thou ask saint in these bad days my mind He much the old man who clearest souled of men Saw The Wide Prospect and the Asian Fen And Tmolus hill and Smyrna bay though blind Much he whose friendship I not long since won That halting slave who in Nicopolis Taught Arrian when Vespasian s brutal son Cleared Rome of what most shamed him But he his My special thanks whose even balanced soul From first youth tested up to extreme old age Business could not make dull nor passion wild Who saw life steadily and saw it whole The mellow glory of the Attic stage Singer of sweet Colonus and its child YOUTH AND CALM Tis death and peace indeed is here And ease from shame and rest from fear There s nothing can dismarble now The smoothness of that limpid brow But is a calm like this in truth The crowning end of life and youth And when this boon rewards the dead Are all debts paid has all been said And is the heart of youth so light Its step so firm its eye so bright Because on its hot brow there blows A wind of promise and repose From the far grave to which it goes Because it has the hope to come One day to harbor in the tomb Ah no the bliss youth dreams is one For daylight for the cheerful sun For feeling nerves and living breath Youth dreams a bliss on this side death It dreams a rest if not more deep More grateful than this marble sleep It hears a voice within it tell Calms not life s crown though calm is well Tis all perhaps which man acquires But tis not what our youth desires ISOLATION TO MARGUERITE We were apart yet day by day I bade my heart more constant be I bade it keep the world away And grow a home for only thee Nor feared but thy love likewise grew Like mine each day more tried more true The fault was grave I might have known What far too soon alas I learned The heart can bind itself alone And faith may oft be unreturned Self swayed our feelings ebb and swell Thou lov saint no more Farewell Farewell Farewell and thou thou lonely heart Which never yet without remorse Even for a moment didst depart From thy remote and sphered course To haunt the place where passions reign Back to thy solitude again Back with the conscious thrill of shame Which Luna felt that summer night Flash through her pure immortal frame When she forsook the starry height To hang over Endymion s sleep Upon the pine grown Latmian steep Yet she chaste queen had never proved How vain a thing is mortal love Wandering in Heaven far removed But thou hast long had place to prove This truth to prove and make thine own Thou hast been shalt be art alone Or if not quite alone yet they Which touch thee are unmating things Ocean and clouds and night and day Lorn autumns and triumphant springs And life and others joy and pain And love if love of happier men Of happier men for they at least Have dreamed two human hearts might blend In one and were through faith released From isolation without end Prolonged nor knew although not less Alone than thou their loneliness Yes in the sea of life enisled With echoing straits between us thrown Dotting the shoreless watery wild We mortal millions live alone The islands feel the enclasping flow And then their endless bounds they know But when the moon their hollow lights And they are swept by balms of spring And in their glens on starry nights The nightingales divinely sing And lovely notes from shore to shore Across the sounds and channels pour Oh then a longing like despair Is to their farthest caverns sent For surely once they feel we were Parts of a single continent Now round us spreads the watery plain Oh might our marges meet again Who ordered that their longing s fire Should be as soon as kindled cooled Who renders vain their deep desire A God a God their severance ruled And bade betwixt their shores to be The unplumbed salt estranging sea STANZAS IN MEMORY OF THE AUTHOR OF OBERMANN eighteen forty nine In front the awful Alpine track Crawls up its rocky stair The autumn storm winds drive the rack Close o er it in the air Behind are the abandoned baths Mute in their meadows lone The leaves are on the valley paths The mists are on the Rhone The white mists rolling like a sea I hear the torrents roar Yes Obermann all speaks of thee I feel thee near once more I turn thy leaves I feel their breath Once more upon me roll That air of languor cold and death Which brooded o er thy soul Fly hence poor wretch whoe er thou art Condemned to cast about All shipwreck in thy own weak heart For comfort from without A fever in these pages burns Beneath the calm they feign A wounded human spirit turns Here on its bed of pain Yes though the virgin mountain air Fresh through these pages blows Though to these leaves the glaciers spare The soul of their mute snows Though here a mountain murmur swells Of many a dark boughed pine Though as you read you hear the bells Of the high pasturing kine Yet through the hum of torrent lone And brooding mountain bee There sobs I know not what ground tone Of human agony Is it for this because the sound Is fraught too deep with pain That Obermann the world around So little loves thy strain And then we turn thou sadder sage To thee we feel thy spell The hopeless tangle of our age Thou too hast scanned it well Immovable thou sittest still As death composed to bear Thy head is clear thy feeling chill And icy thy despair He who hath watched not shared the strife Knows how the day hath gone He only lives with the world s life Who hath renounced his own To thee we come then Clouds are rolled Where thou O seer art set Thy realm of thought is drear and cold The world is colder yet And thou hast pleasures too to share With those who come to thee Balms floating on thy mountain air And healing sights to see How often where the slopes are green On Jaman hast thou sate By some high chalet door and seen The summer day grow late And darkness steal o er the wet grass With the pale crocus starr d And reach that glimmering sheet of glass Beneath the piny sward Lake Leman s waters far below And watched the rosy light Fade from the distant peaks of snow And on the air of night Heard accents of the eternal tongue Through the pine branches play Listened and felt thyself grow young Listened and wept Away Away the dreams that but deceive And thou sad guide adieu I go fate drives me but I leave Half of my life with you We in some unknown Power s employ Move on a rigorous line Can neither when we will enjoy Nor when we will resign I in the world must live but thou Thou melancholy shade Wilt not if thou can saint see me now Condemn me nor upbraid For thou art gone away from earth And place with those dost claim The Children of the Second Birth Whom the world could not tame Farewell Whether thou now liest near That much loved inland sea The ripples of whose blue waves cheer Vevey and Meillerie And in that gracious region bland Where with clear rustling wave The scented pines of Switzerland Stand dark round thy green grave Between the dusty vineyard walls Issuing on that green place The early peasant still recalls The pensive stranger s face And stoops to clear thy moss grown date Ere he plods on again Or whether by maligner fate Among the swarms of men Where between granite terraces The blue Seine rolls her wave The Capital of Pleasures sees Thy hardly heard of grave Farewell Under the sky we part In this stern Alpine dell O unstrung will O broken heart A last a last farewell MEMORIAL VERSES eighteen fifty Goethe in Weimar sleeps and Greece Long since saw Byron s struggle cease But one such death remained to come The last poetic voice is dumb We stand to day by Wordsworth s tomb When Byron s eyes were shut in death We bowed our head and held our breath He taught us little but our soul Had felt him like the thunder s roll With shivering heart the strife we saw Of passion with eternal law And yet with reverential awe We watched the fount of fiery life Which served for that Titanic strife When Goethe s death was told we said Sunk then is Europe s sagest head Physician of the iron age Goethe has done his pilgrimage He took the suffering human race He read each wound each weakness clear And struck his finger on the place And said Thou ailest here and here He looked on Europe s dying hour Of fitful dream and feverish power His eye plunged down the weltering strife The turmoil of expiring life He said The end is everywhere Art still has truth take refuge there And he was happy if to know Causes of things and far below His feet to see the lurid flow Of terror and insane distress And headlong fate be happiness And Wordsworth Ah pale ghosts rejoice For never has such soothing voice Been to your shadowy world conveyed Since erst at morn some wandering shade Heard the clear song of Orpheus come Through Hades and the mournful gloom Wordsworth has gone from us and ye Ah may ye feel his voice as we He too upon a wintry clime Had fallen on this iron time Of doubts disputes distractions fears He found us when the age had bound Our souls in its benumbing round He spoke and loosed our heart in tears He laid us as we lay at birth On the cool flowery lap of earth Smiles broke from us and we had ease The hills were round us and the breeze Went o er the sunlit fields again Our foreheads felt the wind and rain Our youth returned for there was shed On spirits that had long been dead Spirits dried up and closely furled The freshness of the early world Ah since dark days still bring to light Man s prudence and man s fiery might Time may restore us in his course Goethe s sage mind and Byron s force But where will Europe s latter hour Again find Wordsworth s healing power Others will teach us how to dare And against fear our breast to steel Others will strengthen us to bear But who ah who will make us feel The cloud of mortal destiny Others will front it fearlessly But who like him will put it by Keep fresh the grass upon his grave O Rotha with thy living wave Sing him thy best for few or none Hears thy voice right now he is gone THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA HUSSEIN O most just Vizier send away The cloth merchants and let them be Them and their dues this day the King Is ill at ease and calls for thee THE VIZIER O merchants tarry yet a day Here in Bokhara but at noon To morrow come and ye shall pay Each fortieth web of cloth to me As the law is and go your way O Hussein lead me to the King Thou teller of sweet tales thine own Ferdousi s and the others lead How is it with my lord HUSSEIN Alone Ever since prayer time he doth wait O Vizier without lying down In the great window of the gate Looking into the Registan Where through the sellers booths the slaves Are this way bringing the dead man O Vizier here is the King s door THE KING O Vizier I may bury him THE VIZIER O King thou know saint I have been sick These many days and heard no thing For Allah shut my ears and mind Not even what thou dost O King Wherefore that I may counsel thee Let Hussein if thou wilt make haste To speak in order what hath chanced THE KING O Vizier be it as thou say saint HUSSEIN Three days since at the time of prayer A certain Moollah with his robe All rent and dust upon his hair Watched my lord s coming forth and pushed The golden mace bearers aside And fell at the King s feet and cried Justice O King and on myself On this great sinner who did break The law and by the law must die Vengeance O King But the King spake What fool is this that hurts our ears With folly or what drunken slave My guards what prick him with your spears Prick me the fellow from the path As the King said so was it done And to the mosque my lord passed on But on the morrow when the King Went forth again the holy book Carried before him as his right And through the square his way he took My man comes running flecked with blood From yesterday and falling down Cries out most earnestly O King My lord O King do right I pray How canst thou ere thou hear discern If I speak folly but a king Whether a thing be great or small Like Allah hears and judges all Wherefore hear thou Thou know saint how fierce In these last days the sun hath burned That the green water in the tanks Is to a putrid puddle turned And the canal that from the stream Of Samarcand is brought this way Wastes and runs thinner every day Now I at nightfall had gone forth Alone and in a darksome place Under some mulberry trees I found A little pool and in short space With all the water that was there I filled my pitcher and stole home Unseen and having drink to spare I hid the can behind the door And went up on the roof to sleep But in the night which was with wind And burning dust again I creep Down having fever for a drink Now meanwhile had my brethren found The water pitcher where it stood Behind the door upon the ground And called my mother and they all As they were thirsty and the night Most sultry drained the pitcher there That they sate with it in my sight Their lips still wet when I came down Now mark I being fevered sick Most unblest also at that sight Brake forth and cursed them dost thou hear One was my mother Now do right But my lord mused a space and said Send him away sirs and make on It is some madman the King said As the King bade so was it done The morrow at the self same hour In the King s path behold the man Not kneeling sternly fixed he stood Right opposite and thus began Frowning grim down Thou wicked King Most deaf where thou shouldst most give ear What must I howl in the next world Because thou wilt not listen here What wilt thou pray and get thee grace And all grace shall to me be grudged Nay but I swear from this thy path I will not stir till I be judged Then they who stood about the King Drew close together and conferred Till that the King stood forth and said Before the priests thou shalt be heard But when the Ulemas were met And the thing heard they doubted not But sentenced him as the law is To die by stoning on the spot Now the King charged us secretly Stoned must he be the law stands so Yet if he seek to fly give way Hinder him not but let him go So saying the King took a stone And cast it softly but the man With a great joy upon his face Kneeled down and cried not neither ran So they whose lot it was cast stones That they flew thick and bruised him sore But he praised Allah with loud voice And remained kneeling as before My lord had covered up his face But when one told him He is dead Turning him quickly to go in Bring thou to me his corpse he said And truly while I speak O King I hear the bearers on the stair Wilt thou they straightway bring him in Ho enter ye who tarry there THE VIZIER O King in this I praise thee not Now must I call thy grief not wise Is he thy friend or of thy blood To find such favor in thine eyes Nay were he thine own mother s son Still thou art king and the law stands It were not meet the balance swerved The sword were broken in thy hands But being nothing as he is Why for no cause make sad thy face Lo I am old Three kings ere thee Have I seen reigning in this place But who through all this length of time Could bear the burden of his years If he for strangers pained his heart Not less than those who merit tears Fathers we must have wife and child And grievous is the grief for these This pain alone which must be borne Makes the head white and bows the knees But other loads than this his own One man is not well made to bear Besides to each are his own friends To mourn with him and show him care Look this is but one single place Though it be great all the earth round If a man bear to have it so Things which might vex him shall be found All these have sorrow and keep still Whilst other men make cheer and sing Wilt thou have pity on all these No nor on this dead dog O King THE KING O Vizier thou art old I young Clear in these things I cannot see My head is burning and a heat Is in my skin which angers me But hear ye this ye sons of men They that bear rule and are obeyed Unto a rule more strong than theirs Are in their turn obedient made In vain therefore with wistful eyes Gazing up hither the poor man Who loiters by the high heaped booths Below there in the Registan Says Happy he who lodges there With silken raiment store of rice And for this drought all kinds of fruits Grape syrup squares of colored ice With cherries served in drifts of snow In vain hath a king power to build Houses arcades enameled mosques And to make orchard closes filled With curious fruit trees brought from far With cisterns for the winter rain And in the desert spacious inns In divers places if that pain Is not more lightened which he feels If his will be not satisfied And that it be not from all time The law is planted to abide Thou wast a sinner thou poor man Thou wast athirst and didst not see That though we take what we desire We must not snatch it eagerly And I have meat and drink at will And rooms of treasures not a few But I am sick nor heed I these And what I would I cannot do Even the great honor which I have When I am dead will soon grow still So have I neither joy nor fame But what I can do that I will I have a fretted brickwork tomb Upon a hill on the right hand Hard by a close of apricots Upon the road of Samarcand Thither O Vizier will I bear This man my pity could not save And plucking up the marble flags There lay his body in my grave Bring water nard and linen rolls Wash off all blood set smooth each limb Then say He was not wholly vile Because a king shall bury him DOVER BEACH The sea is calm to night The tide is full the moon lies fair Upon the straits on the French coast the light Gleams and is gone the cliffs of England stand Glimmering and vast out in the tranquil bay Come to the window sweet is the night air Only from the long line of spray Where the sea meets the moon blanched sand Listen you hear the grating roar Of pebbles which the waves draw back and fling At their return up the high strand Begin and cease and then again begin With tremulous cadence slow and bring The eternal note of sadness in Sophocles long ago Heard it on the Aegean and it brought Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow Of human misery we Find also in the sound a thought Hearing it by this distant northern sea The sea of faith Was once too at the full and round earth s shore Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled But now I only hear Its melancholy long withdrawing roar Retreating to the breath Of the night wind down the vast edges drear And naked shingles of the world Ah love let us be true To one another for the world which seems To lie before us like a land of dreams So various so beautiful so new Hath really neither joy nor love nor light Nor certitude nor peace nor help for pain And we are here as on a darkling plain Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight Where ignorant armies clash by night SELF DEPENDENCE Weary of myself and sick of asking What I am and what I ought to be At this vessel s prow I stand which bears me Forwards forwards o er the starlit sea And a look of passionate desire O er the sea and to the stars I send Ye who from my childhood up have calmed me Calm me ah compose me to the end Ah once more I cried ye stars ye waters On my heart your mighty charm renew Still still let me as I gaze upon you Feel my soul becoming vast like you From the intense clear star sown vault of heaven Over the lit sea s unquiet way In the rustling night air came the answer Wouldst thou be as these are Live as they Unaffrighted by the silence round them Undistracted by the sights they see These demand not that the things without them Yield them love amusement sympathy And with joy the stars perform their shining And the sea its long moon silvered roll For self poised they live nor pine with noting All the fever of some differing soul Bounded by themselves and unregardful In what state God s other works may be In their own tasks all their powers pouring These attain the mighty life you see O air born voice long since severely clear A cry like thine in mine own heart I hear Resolve to be thyself and know that he Who finds himself loses his misery STANZAS FROM THE GRANDE CHARTREUSE Oh hide me in your gloom profound Ye solemn seats of holy pain Take me cowled forms and fence me round Till I possess my soul again Till free my thoughts before me roll Not chafed by hourly false control For the world cries your faith is now But a dead time s exploded dream My melancholy sciolists say Is a passed mood and outworn theme As if the world had ever had A faith or sciolists been sad Ah if it be passed take away At least the restlessness the pain Be man henceforth no more a prey To these out dated stings again The nobleness of grief is gone Ah leave us not the fret alone But if you cannot give us ease Last of the race of them who grieve Here leave us to die out with these Last of the people who believe Silent while years engrave the brow Silent the best are silent now Achilles ponders in his tent The kings of modern thought are dumb Silent they are though not content And wait to see the future come They have the grief men had of yore But they contend and cry no more Our fathers watered with their tears This sea of time whereon we sail Their voices were in all men s ears Who passed within their puissant hail Still the same ocean round us raves But we stand mute and watch the waves For what availed it all the noise And outcry of the former men Say have their sons achieved more joys Say is life lighter now than then The sufferers died they left their pain The pangs which tortured them remain What helps it now that Byron bore With haughty scorn which mocked the smart Through Europe to the AEtolian shore The pageant of his bleeding heart That thousands counted every groan And Europe made his woe her own What boots it Shelley that the breeze Carried thy lovely wail away Musical through Italian trees Which fringe thy soft blue Spezzian bay Inheritors of thy distress Have restless hearts one throb the less Or are we easier to have read O Obermann the sad stern page Which tells us how thou hidd saint thy head From the fierce tempest of thine age In the lone brakes of Fontainebleau Or chalets near the Alpine snow Ye slumber in your silent grave The world which for an idle day Grace to your mood of sadness gave Long since hath flung her weeds away The eternal trifler breaks your spell But we we learnt your lore too well Years hence perhaps may dawn an age More fortunate alas than we Which without hardness will be sage And gay without frivolity Sons of the world oh speed those years But while we wait allow our tears A SUMMER NIGHT In the deserted moon blanched street How lonely rings the echo of my feet Those windows which I gaze at frown Silent and white unopening down Repellent as the world but see A break between the housetops shows The moon and lost behind her fading dim Into the dewy dark obscurity Down at the far horizon s rim Doth a whole tract of heaven disclose And to my mind the thought Is on a sudden brought Of a past night and a far different scene Headlands stood out into the moonlit deep As clearly as at noon The spring tide s brimming flow Heaved dazzlingly between Houses with long wide sweep Girdled the glistening bay Behind through the soft air The blue haze cradled mountains spread away That night was far more fair But the same restless pacings to and fro And the same vainly throbbing heart was there And the same bright calm moon And the calm moonlight seems to say Hast thou then still the old unquiet breast Which neither deadens into rest Nor ever feels the fiery glow That whirls the spirit from itself away But fluctuates to and fro Never by passion quite possessed And never quite benumbed by the world s sway And I I know not if to pray Still to be what I am or yield and be Like all the other men I see For most men in a brazen prison live Where in the sun s hot eye With heads bent o er their toil they languidly Their lives to some unmeaning taskwork give Dreaming of naught beyond their prison wall And as year after year Fresh products of their barren labor fall From their tired hands and rest Never yet comes more near Gloom settles slowly down over their breast And while they try to stem The waves of mournful thought by which they are prest Death in their prison reaches them Unfreed having seen nothing still unblest And the rest a few Escape their prison and depart On the wide ocean of life anew There the freed prisoner where er his heart Listeth will sail Nor doth he know how there prevail Despotic on that sea Trade winds which cross it from eternity Awhile he holds some false way undebarred By thwarting signs and braves The freshening wind and blackening waves And then the tempest strikes him and between The lightning bursts is seen Only a driving wreck And the pale master on his spar strewn deck With anguished face and flying hair Grasping the rudder hard Still bent to make some port he knows not where Still standing for some false impossible shore And sterner comes the roar Of sea and wind and through the deepening gloom Fainter and fainter wreck and helmsman loom And he too disappears and comes no more Is there no life but these alone Madman or slave must man be one Plainness and clearness without shadow of stain Clearness divine Ye heavens whose pure dark regions have no sign Of languor though so calm and though so great Are yet untroubled and unpassionate Who though so noble share in the world s toil And though so tasked keep free from dust and soil I will not say that your mild deeps retain A tinge it may be of their silent pain Who have longed deeply once and longed in vain But I will rather say that you remain A world above man s head to let him see How boundless might his soul s horizons be How vast yet of what clear transparency How it were good to live there and breathe free How fair a lot to fill Is left to each man still THE BETTER PART Long fed on boundless hopes O race of man How angrily thou spurn saint all simpler fare Christ some one says was human as we are No judge eyes us from Heaven our sin to scan We live no more when we have done our span Well then for Christ thou answerest who can care From sin which Heaven records not why forbear Live we like brutes our life without a plan So answerest thou but why not rather say Hath man no second life Pitch this one high Sits there no judge in Heaven our sin to see More strictly then the inward judge obey Was Christ a man like us Ah let us try If we then too can be such men as he THE LAST WORD Creep into thy narrow bed Creep and let no more be said Vain thy onset all stands fast Thou thyself must break at last Let the long contention cease Geese are swans and swans are geese Let them have it how they will Thou art tired best be still They out talked thee hissed thee tore thee Better men fared thus before thee Fired their ringing shot and passed Hotly charged and sank at last Charge once more then and be dumb Let the victors when they come When the forts of folly fall Find thy body by the wall THE ARTHURIAN LEGENDS Eighth to Twelfth Centuries BY RICHARD JONES For nearly a thousand years the Arthurian legends which lie at the basis of Tennyson s Idylls of the King have furnished unlimited literary material not to English poets alone but to the poets of all Christendom These Celtic romances having their birthplace in Brittany or in Wales had been growing and changing for some centuries before the fanciful Historia Britonum of Geoffrey of Monmouth flushed them with color and filled them with new life Through the version of the good Benedictine they soon became a vehicle for the dissemination of Christian doctrine By the year twelve hundred they were the common property of Europe influencing profoundly the literature of the Middle Ages and becoming the source of a great stream of poetry that has flowed without interruption down to our own day Sixty years after the Historia Britonum appeared and when the English poet Layamon wrote his Brut A D twelve oh five which was a translation of Wace as Wace was a translation of Geoffrey the theme was engrossing the imagination of Europe It had absorbed into itself the elements of other cycles of legend which had grown up independently some of these in fact having been at one time of much greater prominence Finally so vast and so complicated did the body of Arthurian legend become that summaries of the essential features were attempted Such a summary was made in French about twelve seventy by the Italian Rustighello of Pisa in German about two centuries later by Ulrich Fueterer and in English by Sir Thomas Malory in his Morte d Arthur finished the ix yere of the reygne of kyng Edward the Fourth and one of the first books published in England by Caxton emprynted and fynysshed in th abbey Westmestre the last day of July the yere of our Lord MCCCCLXXXV It is of interest to note as an indication of the popularity of the Arthurian legends that Caxton printed the Morte d Arthur eight years before he printed any portion of the English Bible and fifty three years before the complete English Bible was in print He printed the Morte d Arthur in response to a general demaund for many noble and dyvers gentylmen of thys royame of England camen and demaunded me many and oftymes wherefore that I have not do make and enprynte the noble hystorye of the saynt greal and of the moost renomed crysten kyng fyrst and chyef of the thre best crysten and worthy kyng Arthur whyche ought moost to be remembred emonge us Englysshe men tofore al other crysten kynges Nor did poetic treatment of the theme then cease Dante in the Divine Comedy speaks by name of Arthur Guinevere Tristan and Launcelot In that touching interview in the second cycle of the Inferno between the poet and Francesca da Rimini which Carlyle has called a thing woven out of rainbows on a ground of eternal black Francesca replies to Dante who was bent to know the primal root whence her love for Paolo gat being One day For our delight we read of Launcelot How him love thralled Alone we were and no Suspicion near us Oft times by that reading Our eyes were drawn together and the hue Fled from our altered cheek But at one point Alone we fell When of that smile we read The wished smile rapturously kissed By one so deep in love then he who ne er From me shall separate at once my lips All trembling kissed The book and writer both Were love s purveyors In its leaves that day We read no more This poetic material was appropriated also by the countrymen of Dante Boiardo Ariosto and Tasso by Hans Sachs in Germany by Spenser Shakespeare and Milton in England As Sir Walter Scott has sung The mightiest chiefs of British song Scorned not such legends to prolong Roger Ascham it is true has in his Scholemaster fifteen seventy A D broken a lance against this body of fiction In our forefathers tyme wrote he whan Papistrie as a standyng poole couered and ouerflowed all England fewe bookes were read in our tong sauyng certaine bookes of Cheualrie as they sayd for pastime and pleasure which as some say were made in Monasteries by idle Monkes or wanton Chanons as one for example Morte Arthure the whole pleasure of which booke standeth in two speciall poyntes in open mans slaughter and bold bawdrye in which booke those be counted the noblest Knights that do kill most men without any quarrell and commit foulest aduoulteries by sutlest shiftes But Roger s characterization of the whole pleasure of which booke was not just nor did it destroy interest in the theme The generall end of all the booke said Spenser of the Faerie Queene is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and gentle discipline and for this purpose he therefore chose the historye of King Arthure as most fitte for the excellency of his person being made famous by many men s former workes and also furthest from the daunger of envie and suspition of present tyme The plots for Shakespeare s King Lear and Cymbeline came from Geoffrey s Historia Britonum as did also the story of Gorboduc the first tragedy in the English language Milton intended at one time that the subject of the great poem for which he was pluming his wings should be King Arthur as may be seen in his Mansus and Epitaphium Damonis Indeed he did touch the lyre upon this theme lightly it is true but firmly enough to justify Swinburne s lines Yet Milton s sacred feet have lingered there His lips have made august the fabulous air His hands have touched and left the wild weeds fair But his duties as Latin Secretary to the Commonwealth diverted him from poetry for many years and when the Restoration gave him leisure once more to court the Muse he had come to doubt the existence of the Celtic hero king for in Paradise Lost Book i line five hundred seventy nine he refers to what resounds In fable or romance of Uther s son and in his History of Britain sixteen seventy A D he says explicitly For who Arthur was and whether ever any such reign d in Britan hath bin doubted heertofore and may again with good reason Dryden who composed the words of an opera on King Arthur meditated according to Sir Walter Scott a larger treatment of the theme And Dryden in immortal strain Had raised the Table Round again But that a ribald King and Court Bade him toil on to make them sport Sir Walter himself edited the old metrical romance of Sir Tristram and where the manuscript was defective composed a portion after the manner of the original the portion in which occur the lines Mi schip do thou take

the poets of the present generation Tennyson has treated the Arthurian poetic heritage as a whole Phases of the Arthurian theme have been presented also by his contemporaries and successors at home and abroad by William Wordsworth Lord Lytton Robert Stephen Hawker Matthew Arnold William Morris Algernon Charles Swinburne in England Edgar Quinet in France Wilhelm Hertz L Schneegans F Roeber in Germany Richard Hovey in America There have been many other approved variations on Arthurian themes such as James Russell Lowell s Vision of Sir Launfal and Richard Wagner s operas Lohengrin Tristan and Isolde and Parsifal Of still later versions we may mention the King Arthur of J Comyns Carr which has been presented on the stage by Sir Henry Irving and Under King Constantine by Katrina Trask whose hero is the king whom tradition names as the successor of the heroic Arthur Imperator Dux Bellorum This poetic material is manifestly a living force in the literature of the present day And we may well remind ourselves of the rule which should govern our verdict in regard to the new treatments of the theme as they appear This century old Dichterstoff this poetic treasure store through which speaks the voice of the race this great body of accumulated poetic material is a heritage and it is evident that whoever attempts any phase of this theme may not treat such subject matter capriciously nor otherwise than in harmony with its inherent nature and spirit It is recognized that the stuff whereof great poetry is made is not the arbitrary creation of the poet and cannot be manufactured to order Genuine poetic material it has been said is handed down in the imagination of man from generation to generation changing its spirit according to the spirit of each age and reaching its full development only when in the course of time the favorable conditions coincide Inasmuch as the subject matter of the Arthurian legends is not the creation of a single poet nor even of many poets but is in fact the creation of the people indeed of many peoples widely separated in time and space and is thus in a sense the voice of the race it resembles in this respect the Faust legends which are the basis of Goethe s world poem or the mediaeval visions of a future state which found their supreme and final expression in Dante s Divina Commedia which sums up within itself the art the religion the politics the philosophy and the view of life of the Middle Ages Whether the Arthurian legends as a whole have found their final and adequate expression in Tennyson s Idylls of the King or whether it was already too late when the Laureate wrote to create from primitive ideas so simple a poem of the first rank is not within the province of this essay to discuss But manifestly any final judgment in regard to the treatment of this theme as a whole or any phase of the theme is inadequate which leaves out of consideration the history of the subject matter and its treatment by other poets which in short ignores its possibilities and its significance With respect to the origin and the early history of the Arthurian legend much remains to be established Whether its original home was in Wales or among the neighboring Celts across the sea in Brittany whither many of the Celts of Britain fled after the Anglo Saxon invasion of their island home no one knows But to some extent at least the legend was common to both sides of the Channel when Geoffrey wrote his book about eleven forty five As a matter of course this King Arthur the ideal hero of later ages was a less commanding personage in the early forms of the legend than when it had acquired its splendid distinction by borrowing and assimilating other mythical tales It appears that five great cycles of legend one the Arthur Guinevere and Merlin cycle two the Round Table cycle three the Holy Grail cycle four the Launcelot cycle five the Tristan cycle which at first developed independently were in the latter half of the twelfth century merged together into a body of legend whose bond of unity was the idealized Celtic hero King Arthur LANCELOT BIDS ADIEU TO ELAINE Photogravure from Drawing by Gustave Dore Illustration This blameless knight whose transfigured memory has been thus transmitted to us was probably a leader of the Celtic tribes of England in their struggles with the Saxon invaders His victory at Mount Badon described by Sir Launcelot to the household at Astolat Dull days were those till our good Arthur broke The pagan yet once more on Badon Hill this victory is mentioned by Gildas who wrote in the sixth century Gildas however though he mentions the occasion does not give the name of the leader But Nennius who wrote in the latter part of the eighth century or early in the ninth makes Arthur the chieftain and adds an account of his great personal prowess Thus the Arthur legend has already begun to grow For the desperate struggle with the Saxons was vain As the highly gifted imaginative Celt saw his people overwhelmed by the kinsmen of the conquerors of Rome he found solace in song for the hard facts of life In the fields of imagination he won the victories denied him on the field of battle and he clustered these triumphs against the enemies of his race about the name and the person of the magnanimous Arthur When the descendants of the Saxons were in their turn overcome by Norman conquerors the heart of the Celtic world was profoundly stirred Ancient memories awoke and yearning for the restoration of British greatness men rehearsed the deeds of him who had been king and of whom it was prophesied that he should be king hereafter At this moment of newly awakened hope Geoffrey s Historia appeared His book was not in reality a history Possibly it was not even very largely founded on existing legends But in any case the chronicle of Geoffrey was a work of genius and of imagination The figure of Arthur says Ten Brink now stood forth in brilliant light a chivalrous king and hero endowed and guarded by supernatural powers surrounded by brave warriors and a splendid court a man of marvelous life and a tragic death Geoffrey s book was immediately translated into French by Robert Wace who incorporated with the legend of Arthur the Round Table legend In his Brut the English poet priest Layamon reproduced this feature of the legend with additional details His chronicle is largely a free translation of the Brut d Engleterre of Wace earlier known as Geste des Bretons Thus as Wace had reproduced Geoffrey with additions and modifications Layamon reproduced Wace So the story grew In the mean time other poets in other lands had taken up the theme connecting with it other cycles of legend already in existence In twelve oh five when Layamon wrote his Brut unnumbered versions of the history of King Arthur with which had been woven the legend of the Holy Grail had already appeared among the principal nations of Europe Of the early Arthurian poets two of the more illustrious and important are Chrestien de Troyes in France of highest poetic repute who opened the way for Tennyson and Wolfram von Eschenbach in Germany with his Parzival later the theme of Wagner s greatest opera The names of Robert de Borron in France Walter Map in England and Heinrich von dem Tuerlin in Germany may also be mentioned In divers lands innumerable poets with diverse tastes set themselves to make new versions of the legend Characteristics of the Arthurian tale were grafted upon an entirely different stock as was done by Boiardo in Italy making confusion worse confounded to the modern Arthurian scholar Boiardo expressly says in the Orlando Innamorato that his intention is to graft the characteristics of the Arthurian cycle upon the Carlovingian French national epic stock He wished to please the courts whose ideal was not the paladins but Arthur s knights The peers of the Charlemagne legend are thus transformed into knights errant who fight for ladies and for honor The result of this interpenetration of the two cycles is a splendid world of love and cortesia whose constituent elements it defies the Arthurian scholar to trace Truly as doctor Sommer has said in his erudite edition of Malory s La Morte d Arthur The origin and relationship to one another of these branches of romance whether in prose or in verse are involved in great obscurity He adds that it would almost seem as though several generations of scholars were required for the gigantic task of finding a sure pathway through this intricate maze And M Gaston Paris one of the foremost of living Arthurian scholars has written in his Romania Some time ago I undertook a methodical exploration in the grand poetical domain which is called the cycle of the Round Table the cycle of Arthur or the Breton cycle I advance groping along and very often retracing my steps twenty times over I become aware that I am lost in a pathless maze There is a question moreover whether Geoffrey s book is based mainly upon inherited poetical material or is largely the product of Geoffrey s individual imagination The elder Paris M Paulin Paris inclined to the view that Nennius with hints from local tales supplied all the bases that Geoffrey had But his son Professor Gaston Paris in his Litterature Francaise au Moyen Age emphasizes the importance of the Celtic contribution as does also mister Alfred Nutt in his Studies in the Arthurian Legend The former view emphasizes the individual importance of Geoffrey the latter view places the emphasis on the legendary heritage Referring to this so called national poetry Ten Brink says But herein lies the essential difference between that age and our own the result of poetical activity was not the property and not the production of a single person but of the community The work of the individual singer endured only as long as its delivery lasted He gained personal distinction only as a virtuoso The permanent elements of what he presented the material the ideas even the style and metre already existed The work of the singer was only a ripple in the stream of national poetry Who can say how much the individual contributed to it or where in his poetical recitation memory ceased and creative impulse began In any case the work of the individual lived on only as the ideal possession of the aggregate body of the people and it soon lost the stamp of originality When Geoffrey wrote this period of national poetry was drawing to a close but it was not yet closed Alfred Nutt in his Studies in the Legend of the Holy Grail speaking of Wolfram von Eschenbach who wrote his Parzival about the time that the Nibelungenlied was given its present form i e about a half century after Geoffrey says Compared with the unknown poets who gave their present shape to the Nibelungenlied or to the Chanson de Roland he is an individual writer but he is far from deserving this epithet even in the sense that Chaucer deserves it Professor Rhys says in his Studies in the Arthurian Legend Leaving aside for a while the man Arthur and assuming the existence of a god of that name let us see what could be made of him Mythologically speaking he would probably have to be regarded as a Culture Hero et cetera To summarize this discussion of the difficulties of the theme there are now existing scattered throughout the libraries and the monasteries of Europe unnumbered versions of the Arthurian legends Some of these are early versions some are late and some are intermediate What is the relation of all these versions to one another Which are the oldest and which are copies and of what versions are they copies What is the land of their origin and what is the significance of their symbolism These problems weighty in tracing the growth of mediaeval ideals i e in tracing the development of the realities of the present from the ideals of the past are still under investigation by the specialists The study of the Arthurian legends is in itself a distinct branch of learning which demands the lifelong labors of scholarly devotees There now remains to consider the extraordinary spread of the legend in the closing decades of the twelfth century and in the century following Though Tennyson has worthily celebrated as the morning star of English song Dan Chaucer the first warbler whose sweet breath Preluded those melodious bursts that fill The spacious times of great Elizabeth With sounds that echo still yet the centuries before Chaucer far from being barren of literature were periods of rich poetical activity both in England and on the Continent Eleanor of Aquitaine formerly Queen of France who had herself gone on a crusade to the Holy Land and who on returning married in eleven fifty two Henry of Anjou who became in eleven fifty five Henry II of England was an ardent patroness of the art of poetry and personally aroused the zeal of poets The famous troubadour Bernard de Ventadorn with whom says Ten Brink the Provencal art poesy entered upon the period of its florescence followed her to England and addressed to her his impassioned verse Wace the Norman French trouvere dedicated to her his Brut The ruling classes of England at this time were truly cosmopolitan familiar with the poetic material of many lands Jusserand in his English Novel in the Time of Shakespeare discussing a poem of the following century written in French by a Norman monk of Westminster and dedicated to Eleanor of Provence wife of Henry III says Rarely was the like seen in any literature here is a poem dedicated to a Frenchwoman by a Norman of England which begins with the praise of a Briton a Saxon and a Dane But the ruling classes of England were not the only cosmopolitans nor the only possessors of fresh poetic material Throughout Europe in general the conditions were favorable for poetic production The Crusades had brought home a larger knowledge of the world and the stimulus of new experiences Western princes returned with princesses of the East as their brides and these were accompanied by splendid trains including minstrels and poets Thus Europe gathered in new poetic material which stimulated and developed the poetical activity of the age Furthermore the Crusades had aroused an intense idealism which as always demanded and found poetic expression The dominant idea pervading the earlier forms of the Charlemagne stories the unswerving loyalty due from a vassal to his lord that is the feudal view of life no longer found an echo in the hearts of men The time was therefore propitious for the development of a new cycle of legend Though by the middle of the twelfth century the Arthurian legend had been long in existence and King Arthur had of late been glorified by Geoffrey s book the legend was not yet supreme in popular interest It became so through its association a few years later with the legend of the Holy Grail the San Graal the holy vessel which received at the Cross the blood of Christ which was now become a symbol of the Divine Presence This holy vessel had been brought by Joseph of Arimathea from Palestine to Britain but was now alas vanished quite from the sight of man It was the holy quest for this sacred vessel to which the knights of the Round Table now bound themselves this search for the supernatural this struggle for the spiritual this blending of the spirit of Christianity with that of chivalry which immediately transformed the Arthurian legend and gave to its heroes immortality At once a new spirit breathes in the old legend In a few years it is become a mystical symbolical anagogical tale inculcating one of the profoundest dogmas of the Holy Catholic Church a bearer of a Christian doctrine engrossing the thought of the Christian world And inasmuch as the transformed Arthurian legend now taught by implication the doctrine of the Divine Presence its spread was in every way furthered by the great power of the Church whose spiritual rulers made the minstrel doubly welcome when celebrating this theme For there was heresy to be combated viz the heresy of the scholastic theologian Berengar of Tours who had attacked the doctrine of the transubstantiation of the bread and the wine of the Eucharist into the body and blood of Christ Lanfranc Archbishop of Canterbury one of the most brilliant of the Middle Age theologians felt impelled to reply to Berengar who had been his personal friend and he did so in the Liber Scintillarum which was a vigorous indeed a violent defense of the doctrine denied by Berengar Berengar died in ten eighty eight but he left a considerable body of followers The heretics were anathematized by the Second Lateran Ecumenical Council held in Rome in eleven thirty nine Again in twelve fifteen the Fourth Lateran Council declared transubstantiation to be an article of faith and in twelve sixty four a special holy day Corpus Christi viz the first Thursday after Trinity Sunday was set apart to give an annual public manifestation of the belief of the Church in the doctrine of the Eucharist But when the Fourth Lateran Ecumenical Council met in twelve fifteen the transformation of the Arthurian legend by means of its association with the legend of the Holy Grail was already complete and the transformed legend now become a defender of the faith was engrossing the imagination of Europe The subsequent influence of the legend was doubtless to some extent associated with the discussions which continually came up anew respecting the meaning of the doctrine of the Eucharist for it was not until the Council of Trent fifteen forty five sixty three that the doctrine was finally and authoritatively defined In the mean time there was interminable discussion respecting the nature of this real presence respecting tran substantiation and con substantiation and impanation respecting the actual presence of the body and blood of Christ under the appearance of the bread and wine or the presence of the body and blood together with the bread and wine The professor of philosophy in the University of Oxford who passes daily through Logic Lane has said that there the followers of Duns Scotus and Thomas Aquinas were wont to come to blows in the eagerness of their discussion respecting the proper definition of the doctrine Nor was the doctrine without interest to the Reformers Luther and Zwingli held opposing views and Calvin was involved in a long dispute concerning the doctrine which resulted in the division of the evangelical body into the two parties of the Lutherans and the Reformed Doubtless the connection between the Arthurian legend and the doctrine of the Divine Presence was not without influence on the unparalleled spread of the legend in the closing decades of the twelfth century and on its prominence in the centuries following A suggestion has already been given of the vast development of the Arthurian legends during the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and of the importance of the labors of the specialists who are endeavoring to fix a date for these versions in order to infer therefrom the spiritual ideals of the people among whom they arose To perceive clearly to what extent ideals do change it is but necessary to compare various versions of the same incident as given in various periods of time To go no farther back than Malory for example we observe a signal difference between his treatment of the sin of Guinevere and Launcelot and the treatment of the theme by Tennyson Malory s Arthur is not so much wounded by the treachery of Launcelot of whose relations to Guinevere he had long been aware as he is angered at Sir Modred for making public those disclosures which made it necessary for him and Sir Launcelot to bee at debate Ah Agravaine Agravaine cries the King Jesu forgive it thy soule for thine evill will that thou and thy brother Sir Modred had unto Sir Launcelot hath caused all this sorrow Wit you well my heart was never so heavie as it is now and much more I am sorrier for my good knights losse than for the losse of my queene for queenes might I have enough but such a fellowship of good knightes shall never bee together in no company But to the great Poet Laureate who voices the modern ideal a true marriage is the crown of life To love one maiden only to cleave to her and worship her by years of noblest deeds to be joined with her and to live together as one life and reigning with one will in all things to have power on this dead world to make it live this was the high ideal of the blameless King Too wholly true to dream untruth in thee And his farewell from her who had not made his life so sweet that he should greatly care to live Lo I forgive thee as Eternal God Forgives And so thou lean on our fair father Christ Hereafter in that world where all are pure We two may meet before high God and thou Wilt spring to me and claim me thine this is altogether one of the noblest passages in modern verse A comparison of the various modern treatments of the Tristram theme as given by Tennyson Richard Wagner F Roeber L Schneegans Matthew Arnold Algernon Charles Swinburne F Millard touching also on the Tristan of Hans Sachs and the Tristram who because he is true to love is the darling of the old romances and is there notwithstanding that his love is the wedded wife of another always represented as the strong and beautiful knight the flower of courtesy a model to youth such a comparison would reveal striking differences between mediaeval and modern ideals In making the comparison however care must be exercised to select the modern treatment of the theme which represents correctly the modern ideal The Middle Age romances sung by wandering minstrels before the invention of the printing press doubtless expressed the ideals of the age in which they were produced more infallibly than does the possibly individualistic conception of the modern poet for of the earlier forms of the romance only those which found general favor were likely to be preserved and handed down This inference may be safely made because of the method of the dissemination of the poems before the art of printing was known It is true that copies of them were carried in manuscript from country to country but the more important means of dissemination were the minstrels who passed from court to court and land to land singing the songs which they had made or heard In that age there was little thought of literary proprietorship The poem belonged to him who could recall it And as each minstrel felt free to adopt whatever poem he found or heard that pleased him so he felt free also to modify the incidents thereof guided only by his experience as to what pleased his hearers Hence the countless variations in the treatment of the theme and the value of the conclusions that may be drawn as to the moral sentiment of an age the quality of whose moral judgments is indicated by the prevailing tone of the songs which persisted because they pleased Unconformable variations which express the view of an individual rather than the view of a people may have come down to us in an accidentally preserved manuscript but the songs which were sung by the poets of all lands give expression to the view of life of the age and reveal the morals and the ideals of nations whose history in this respect may otherwise be lost to us What some of these ideals were as revealed by this rich store of poetic material which grew up about the chivalrous and spiritual ideals of the Middle Ages and what the corresponding modern ideals are what in brief some of the hitherto dimly discerned ethical movements of the past seven hundred years have in reality been and whither they seem to be tending surely clear knowledge on these themes is an end worthy the supreme endeavor of finished scholars whose training has made them expert in interpreting the aspirations of each age and in tracing the evolution of the ideals of the past into the realities of the present And though as M Gaston Paris has said the path of the Arthurian scholar seems at times to be an inextricable maze yet the value of the results already achieved and the possibility of still greater results will doubtless prove a sufficient encouragement to the several generations of scholars which as doctor Sommer suggests are needed for the gigantic task

January fifteenth eighteen twelve at Christiania Norway He entered the University in eighteen thirty three but was presently obliged to take the position of tutor with a family in Romerike Four years later he came back to the University where he studied medicine but also and particularly zooelogy and botany subjects which he subsequently taught in various schools During his life among the country people he had begun to collect folk tales and legends and afterward on long foot tours undertaken in the pursuit of his favorite studies he added to this store In company operation with his lifelong friend Joergen Moe subsequently Bishop of Christiansand he published in eighteen thirty eight a first collection of folk stories In later years his study of folk lore went on side by side with his study of zooelogy At various times from eighteen forty six to eighteen fifty three he received stipends from the Christiania University to enable him to pursue zooelogical investigations at points along the Norwegian coast In addition to these journeys he had traversed Norway in every direction partly to observe the condition of the forests of the country and partly to collect the popular legends which seem always to have been in his mind From eighteen fifty six to eighteen fifty eight he studied forestry at Tharand and in eighteen sixty was made head forester of the district of Trondhjem in the north of Norway He retained this position until eighteen sixty four when he was sent by the government to Holland Germany and Denmark to investigate the turf industry On his return he was made the head of a commission whose purpose was to better the turf production of the country from which position he was finally released with a pension in eighteen seventy six He died in eighteen eighty five Asbjoernsen s principal literary work was in the direction of the folk tales of Norway although the list of his writings on natural history popular and scientific is a long one As a scientist he made several important discoveries in deep sea soundings which gave him at home and abroad a wide reputation but the significance of his work as a collector of folk lore has in a great measure overshadowed this phase of his activity His greatest works are Norske Folke eventyr Norwegian Folk Tales in collaboration with Moe which appeared in eighteen forty two forty four and subsequently in many editions Norske Huldre eventyr og Folkesagn Norwegian Fairy Tales and Folk Legends in eighteen forty five In the stories published by Asbjoernsen alone he has not confined himself simply to the reproduction of the tales in their popular form but has retold them with an admirable setting of the characteristics of the life of the people in their particular environment He was a rare lover of nature and there are many exquisite bits of natural description Asbjoernsen s literary power was of no mean merit and his work not only found immediate acceptance in his own country but has been widely translated into the other languages of Europe Norwegian literature in particular owes him a debt of gratitude for he was the first to point out the direction of the subsequent national development GUDBRAND OF THE MOUNTAIN SIDE There was once a man named Gudbrand who had a farm which lay on the side of a mountain whence he was called Gudbrand of the Mountain side He and his wife lived in such harmony together and were so well matched that whatever the husband did seemed to the wife so well done that it could not be done better let him therefore act as he might she was equally well pleased They owned a plot of ground and had a hundred dollars lying at the bottom of a chest and in the stall two fine cows One day the woman said to Gudbrand I think we might as well drive one of the cows to town and sell it we should then have a little pocket money for such respectable persons as we are ought to have a few shillings in hand as well as others The hundred dollars at the bottom of the chest we had better not touch but I do not see why we should keep more than one cow besides we shall be somewhat the gainers for instead of two cows I shall have only one to milk and look after These words Gudbrand thought both just and reasonable so he took the cow and went to the town in order to sell it but when he came there he could not find any one who wanted to buy a cow Well thought Gudbrand I can go home again with my cow I have both stall and collar for her and it is no farther to go backwards than forwards So saying he began wandering home again When he had gone a little way he met a man who had a horse he wished to sell and Gudbrand thought it better to have a horse than a cow so he exchanged with the man Going a little further still he met a man driving a fat pig before him and thinking it better to have a fat pig than a horse he made an exchange with him also A little further on he met a man with a goat A goat thought he is always better to have than a pig so he made an exchange with the owner of the goat He now walked on for an hour when he met a man with a sheep with him he exchanged his goat for thought he it is always better to have a sheep than a goat After walking some way again meeting a man with a goose he changed away the sheep for the goose then going on a long way he met a man with a cock and thought to himself It is better to have a cock than a goose and so gave his goose for the cock Having walked on till the day was far gone and beginning to feel hungry he sold the cock for twelve shillings and bought some food for thought he it is better to support life than to carry back the cock After this he continued his way homeward till he reached the house of his nearest neighbor where he called in How have matters gone with you in town asked the neighbor Oh answered Gudbrand but so so I cannot boast of my luck neither can I exactly complain of it He then began to relate all that he had done from first to last You ll meet with a warm reception when you get home to your wife said his neighbor God help you I would not be in your place I think things might have been much worse said Gudbrand but whether they are good or bad I have such a gentle wife that she will never say a word let me do what I may Yes that I know answered his neighbor but I do not think she will be so gentle in this instance Shall we lay a wager said Gudbrand of the Mountain side I have got a hundred dollars in my chest at home will you venture the like sum Yes I will replied the neighbor and they wagered accordingly and remained till evening drew on when they set out together for Gudbrand s house having agreed that the neighbor should stand outside and listen while Gudbrand went in to meet his wife Good evening said Gudbrand Good evening said his wife thank God thou art there Yes there he was His wife then began asking him how he had fared in the town So so said Gudbrand I have not much to boast of for when I reached the town there was no one who would buy the cow so I changed it for a horse Many thanks for that said his wife we are such respectable people that we ought to ride to church as well as others and if we can afford to keep a horse we may certainly have one Go and put the horse in the stable children Oh said Gudbrand but I have not got the horse for as I went along the road I exchanged the horse for a pig Well said the woman that is just what I should have done myself I thank thee for that I can now have pork and bacon in my house to offer anybody when they come to see us What should we have done with a horse People would only have said we were grown too proud to walk to church Go children and put the pig in But I have not brought the pig with me exclaimed Gudbrand for when I had gone a little further on I exchanged it for a milch goat How admirably thou dost everything exclaimed his wife What should we have done with a pig People would only have said that we eat everything we own Yes now that I have a goat I can get both milk and cheese and still keep my goat Go and tie the goat children No said Gudbrand I have not brought home the goat for when I came a little further on I changed the goat for a fine sheep Well cried the woman thou hast done everything just as I could wish just as if I had been there myself What should we have done with a goat I must have climbed up the mountains and wandered through the valleys to bring it home in the evening With a sheep I should have wool and clothing in the house with food into the bargain So go children and put the sheep into the field But I have not got the sheep said Gudbrand for as I went a little further I changed it away for a goose Many many thanks for that said his wife What should I have done with a sheep For I have neither a spinning wheel nor have I much desire to toil and labor to make clothes we can purchase clothing as we have hitherto now I shall have roast goose which I have often longed for and then I can make a little pillow of the feathers Go and bring in the goose children But I have not got the goose said Gudbrand as I came on a little further I changed it away for a cock Heaven only knows how thou couldst think of all this exclaimed his wife it is just as if I had managed it all myself A cock that is just as good as if thou hadst bought an eight day clock for as the cock crows every morning at four o clock we can be stirring betimes What should I have done with a goose I do not know how to dress a goose and my pillow I can stuff with moss Go and fetch in the cock children But I have not brought the cock home with me said Gudbrand for when I had gone a long long way I became so hungry that I was obliged to sell the cock for twelve shillings to keep me alive Well thank God thou always dost just as I could wish to have it done What should we have done with a cock We are our own masters we can lie as long as we like in the morning God be praised I have got thee here safe again and as thou always dost everything so right we want neither a cock nor a goose nor a pig nor a sheep nor a cow Hereupon Gudbrand opened the door Have I won your hundred dollars asked he of the neighbor who was obliged to confess that he had Translation by Benjamin Thorpe in Yule Tide Stories Bonn s Library THE WIDOW S SON There was once a very poor woman who had only one son She toiled for him till he was old enough to be confirmed by the priest when she told him that she could support him no longer but that he must go out in the world and gain his own livelihood So the youth set out and after wandering about for a day or two he met a stranger Whither art thou going asked the man I am going out in the world to see if I can get employment answered the youth Wilt thou serve us Yes just as well serve you as anybody else answered the youth Thou shalt be well cared for with me said the man thou shalt be my companion and do little or nothing besides So the youth resided with him had plenty to eat and drink and very little or nothing to do but he never saw a living person in the man s house One day his master said to him I am going to travel and shall be absent eight days During that time thou wilt be here alone but thou must not go into either of these four rooms if thou dost I will kill thee when I return The youth answered that he would not When the man had gone away three or four days the youth could no longer refrain but went into one of the rooms He looked around but saw nothing except a shelf over the door with a whip made of briar on it This was well worth forbidding me so strictly from seeing thought the youth When the eight days had passed the man came home again Thou hast not I hope been into any of my rooms said he No I have not answered the youth That I shall soon be able to see said the man going into the room the youth had entered But thou hast been in said he and now thou shalt die The youth cried and entreated to be forgiven so that he escaped with his life but had a severe beating when that was over they were as good friends as before Some time after this the man took another journey This time he would be away a fortnight but first forbade the youth again from going into any of the rooms he had not already been in but the one he had previously entered he might enter again This time all took place just as before the only difference being that the youth abstained for eight days before he entered the forbidden rooms In one apartment he found only a shelf over the door on which lay a huge stone and a water bottle This is also something to be in such fear about thought the youth again When the man came home he asked whether he had been in any of the rooms No he had not was the answer I shall soon see said the man and when he found that the youth had nevertheless been in he said Now I will no longer spare thee thou shalt die But the youth cried and implored that his life might be spared and thus again escaped with a beating but this time got as much as could be laid on him When he had recovered from the effect of this beating he lived as well as ever and he and the man were as good friends as before Some time after this the man again made a journey and now he was to be three weeks absent He warned the youth anew not to enter the third room if he did he must at once prepare to die At the end of a fortnight the youth had no longer any command over himself and stole in but here he saw nothing save a trap door in the floor He lifted it up and looked through there stood a large copper kettle that boiled and boiled yet he could see no fire under it I should like to know if it is hot thought the youth dipping his finger down into it but when he drew it up again he found that all his finger was gilt He scraped and washed it but the gilding was not to be removed so he tied a rag over it and when the man returned and asked him what was the matter with his finger he answered he had cut it badly But the man tearing the rag off at once saw what ailed the finger At first he was going to kill the youth but as he cried and begged again he merely beat him so that he was obliged to lie in bed for three days The man then took a pot down from the wall and rubbed him with what it contained so that the youth was as well as before After some time the man made another journey and said he should not return for a month He then told the youth that if he went into the fourth room he must not think for a moment that his life would be spared One two even three weeks the youth refrained from entering the forbidden room but then having no longer any command over himself he stole in There stood a large black horse in a stall with a trough of burning embers at its head and a basket of hay at its tail The youth thought this was cruel and therefore changed their position putting the basket of hay by the horse s head The horse thereupon said As you have so kind a disposition that you enable me to get food I will save you should the Troll return and find you here he will kill you Now you must go up into the chamber above this and take one of the suits of armor that hang there but on no account take one that is bright on the contrary select the most rusty you can see and take that choose also a sword and saddle in like manner The youth did so but he found the whole very heavy for him to carry When he came back the horse said that now he should strip and wash himself well in the kettle which stood boiling in the next apartment I feel afraid thought the youth but nevertheless did so When he had washed himself he became comely and plump and as red and white as milk and blood and much stronger than before Are you sensible of any change asked the horse Yes answered the youth Try to lift me said the horse Aye that he could and brandished the sword with ease Now lay the saddle on me said the horse put on the armor and take the whip of thorn the stone and the water flask and the pot with ointment and then we will set out When the youth had mounted the horse it started off at a rapid rate After riding some time the horse said I think I hear a noise Look round can you see anything A great many men are coming after us certainly a score at least answered the youth Ah that is the Troll said the horse he is coming with all his companions They traveled for a time until their pursuers were gaining on them Throw now the thorn whip over your shoulder said the horse but throw it far away from me The youth did so and at the same moment there sprang up a large thick wood of briars The youth now rode on a long way while the Troll was obliged to go home for something wherewith to hew a road through the wood After some time the horse again said Look back can you see anything now Yes a whole multitude of people said the youth like a church congregation That is the Troll now he has got more with him throw out now the large stone but throw it far from me When the youth had done what the horse desired there arose a large stone mountain behind them So the Troll was obliged to go home after something with which to bore through the mountain and while he was thus employed the youth rode on a considerable way But now the horse again bade him look back he then saw a multitude like a whole army they were so bright that they glittered in the sun Well that is the Troll with all his friends said the horse Now throw the water bottle behind you but take good care to spill nothing on me The youth did so but notwithstanding his caution he happened to spill a drop on the horse s loins Immediately there rose a vast lake and the spilling of the few drops caused the horse to stand far out in the water nevertheless he at last swam to the shore When the Trolls came to the water they lay down to drink it all up and they gulped and gulped till they burst Now we are quit of them said the horse When they had traveled on a very long way they came to a green plain in a wood Take off your armor now said the horse and put on your rags only lift my saddle off and hang everything up in that large hollow linden make yourself then a wig of pine moss go to the royal palace which lies close by and there ask for employment When you desire to see me come to this spot shake the bridle and I will instantly be with you The youth did as the horse told him and when he put on the moss wig he became so pale and miserable to look at that no one would have recognized him On reaching the palace he only asked if he might serve in the kitchen to carry wood and water to the cook but the cook maid asked him why he wore such an ugly wig Take it off said she I will not have anybody here so frightful That I cannot answered the youth for I am not very clean in the head Dost thou think then that I will have thee in the kitchen if such be the case said she go to the master of the horse thou art fittest to carry muck from the stables When the master of the horse told him to take off his wig he got the same answer so he refused to have him Thou canst go to the gardener said he thou art only fit to go and dig the ground The gardener allowed him to remain but none of the servants would sleep with him so he was obliged to sleep alone under the stairs of the summer house which stood upon pillars and had a high staircase under which he laid a quantity of moss for a bed and there lay as well as he could When he had been some time in the royal palace it happened one morning just at sunrise that the youth had taken off his moss wig and was standing washing himself and appeared so handsome it was a pleasure to look on him The princess saw from her window this comely gardener and thought she had never before seen any one so handsome She then asked the gardener why he lay out there under the stairs Because none of the other servants will lie with him answered the gardener Let him come this evening and lie by the door in my room said the princess they cannot refuse after that to let him sleep in the house The gardener told this to the youth Dost thou think I will do so said he If I do so all will say there is something between me and the princess Thou hast reason forsooth to fear such a suspicion replied the gardener such a fine comely lad as thou art Well if she has commanded it I suppose I must comply said the youth In going up stairs that evening he stamped and made such a noise that they were obliged to beg of him to go more gently lest it might come to the king s knowledge When within the chamber he lay down and began immediately to snore The princess then said to her waiting maid Go gently and pull off his moss wig Creeping softly toward him she was about to snatch it but he held it fast with both hands and said she should not have it He then lay down again and began to snore The princess made a sign to the maid and this time she snatched his wig off There he lay so beautifully red and white just as the princess had seen him in the morning sun After this the youth slept every night in the princess s chamber But it was not long before the king heard that the garden lad slept every night in the princess s chamber at which he became so angry that he almost resolved on putting him to death This however he did not do but cast him into prison and his daughter he confined to her room not allowing her to go out either by day or night Her tears and prayers for herself and the youth were unheeded by the king who only became the more incensed against her Some time after this there arose a war and disturbance in the country and the king was obliged to take arms and defend himself against another king who threatened to deprive him of his throne When the youth heard this he begged the jailer would go to the king for him and propose to let him have armor and a sword and allow him to follow to the war All the courtiers laughed when the jailer made known his errand to the king They begged he might have some old trumpery for armor that they might enjoy the sport of seeing the poor creature in the war He got the armor and also an old jade of a horse which limped on three legs dragging the fourth after it Thus they all marched forth against the enemy but they had not gone far from the royal palace before the youth stuck fast with his old jade in a swamp Here he sat beating and calling to the jade Hie wilt thou go hie wilt thou go This amused all the others who laughed and jeered as they passed But no sooner were they all gone than running to the linden he put on his own armor and shook the bridle and immediately the horse appeared and said Do thou do thy best and I will do mine When the youth arrived on the field the battle had already begun and the king was hard pressed but just at that moment the youth put the enemy to flight The king and his attendants wondered who it could be that came to their help but no one had been near enough to speak to him and when the battle was over he was away When they returned the youth was still sitting fast in the swamp beating and calling to his three legged jade They laughed as they passed and said Only look yonder sits the fool yet The next day when they marched out the youth was still sitting there and they again laughed and jeered at him but no sooner had they all passed by than he ran again to the linden and everything took place as on the previous day Every one wondered who the stranger warrior was who had fought for them but no one approached him so near that he could speak to him of course no one ever imagined that it was the youth When they returned in the evening and saw him and his old jade still sticking fast in the swamp they again made a jest of him one shot an arrow at him and wounded him in the leg and he began to cry and moan so that it was sad to hear whereupon the king threw him his handkerchief that he might bind it about his leg When they marched forth the third morning there sat the youth calling to his horse Hie wilt thou go hie wilt thou go No no he will stay there till he starves said the king s men as they passed by and laughed so heartily at him that they nearly fell from their horses When they had all passed he again ran to the linden and came to the battle just at the right moment That day he killed the enemy s king and thus the war was at an end When the fighting was over the king observed his handkerchief tied round the leg of the strange warrior and by this he easily knew him They received him with great joy and carried him with them up to the royal palace and the princess who saw them from her window was so delighted no one could tell There comes my beloved also said she He then took the pot of ointment and rubbed his leg and afterward all the wounded so that they were all well again in a moment After this the king gave him the princess to wife On the day of his marriage he went down into the stable to see the horse and found him dull hanging his ears and refusing to eat When the young king for he was now king having obtained the half of the realm spoke to him and asked him what he wanted the horse said I have now helped thee forward in the world and I will live no longer thou must take thy sword and cut my head off No that I will not do said the young king thou shalt have whatever thou wilt and always live without working If thou wilt not do as I say answered the horse I shall find a way of killing thee The king was then obliged to slay him but when he raised the sword to give the stroke he was so distressed that he turned his face away but no sooner had he struck his head off than there stood before him a handsome prince in the place of the horse Whence in the name of Heaven didst thou come asked the king It was I who was the horse answered the prince Formerly I was king of the country whose sovereign you slew yesterday it was he who cast over me a horse s semblance and sold me to the Troll As he is killed I shall recover my kingdom and you and I shall be neighboring kings but we will never go to war with each other Neither did they they were friends as long as they lived and the one came often to visit the other ROGER ASCHAM fifteen fifteen fifteen sixty eight This noted scholar owes his place in English literature to his pure vigorous English prose John Tindal and Sir Thomas More his predecessors had perhaps equaled him in the flexible and simple use of his native tongue but they had not surpassed him The usage of the time was still to write works of importance in Latin and Ascham was master of a good Ciceronian Latin style It is to his credit that he urged on his countrymen the writing of English and set them an example of its vigorous use He was the son of John Ascham house steward to Lord Scrope of Bolton and was born at Kirby Wiske near Northallerton in fifteen fifteen At the age of fifteen he entered saint John s College Cambridge where he applied himself to Greek and Latin mathematics music and penmanship He had great success in teaching and improving the study of the classics but seems to have had a somewhat checkered academic career both as student and teacher His poverty was excessive and he made many unsuccessful attempts to secure patronage and position till at length in fifteen forty five he published his famous treatise on Archery Toxophilus which he presented to Henry VIII in the picture gallery at Greenwich and which obtained for him a small pension The treatise is in the form of a dialogue the first part being an argument in favor of archery and the second instructions for its practice In its pages he makes a plea for the literary use of the English tongue After long continued disappointment and trouble he was finally successful in obtaining the position of tutor to the Princess Elizabeth in fifteen forty eight She was fifteen years old and he found her an apt scholar but the life was irksome and in fifteen fifty he resigned the post to return to Cambridge as public orator whence one may guess as a main reason for so excellent a teacher having so hard a time to live that like many others he liked to talk about his profession better than to practice it Going abroad shortly afterward as secretary to Sir Richard Morysin ambassador to Charles V he remained with him until fifteen fifty three when he received the appointment of Latin secretary to Queen Mary It is said that he wrote for her forty seven letters in his fine Latin style in three days Illustration ROGER ASCHAM At the accession of Elizabeth he received the office of the Queen s private tutor Poverty and household griefs still gave him anxiety but during the five years which elapsed between fifteen sixty three and his death in fifteen sixty eight he found some comfort in the composition of his Schoolmaster which was published by his widow in fifteen seventy It was suggested by a conversation at Windsor with Sir William Cecil on the proper method of bringing up children Sir Richard Sackville was so well pleased with Ascham s theories that he with others entreated him to write a practical work on the subject The Schoolmaster argues in favor of gentleness rather than force on the part of an instructor Then he commends his own method of teaching Latin by double translation offers remarks on Latin prosody and touches on other pedagogic themes Both this and the Toxophilus show a pure straightforward easy style Contemporary testimony to its beauty may be found in an appendix to Mayor s edition of The School master eighteen sixty three though doctor Johnson in a memoir prefixed to Rennet s collected edition of Ascham s English works seventeen seventy one says that he was scarcely known as an author in his own language till mister Upton published his Schoolmaster in seventeen seventy one He has remained however the best known type of a great teacher in the popular memory in part perhaps through his great pupil The best collected edition of his works including his Latin letters was published by doctor Giles in eighteen sixty four five There is an authoritative edition of the Schoolmaster in the Arber Series of old English reprints The best account of his system of education is in R H Quick s Essays on Educational Reformers eighteen sixty eight ON GENTLENESS IN EDUCATION From The Schoolmaster Yet some will say that children of nature love pastime and mislike learning because in their kind the one is easy and pleasant the other hard and wearisome Which is an opinion not so true as some men ween For the matter lieth not so much in the disposition of them that be young as in the order and manner of bringing up by them that be old nor yet in the difference of learning and pastime For beat a child if he dance not well and cherish him though he learn not well you shall have him unwilling to go to dance and glad to go to his book knock him always when he draweth his shaft ill and favor him again though he fault at his book you shall have him very loth to be in the field and very willing to be in the school Yea I say more and not of myself but by the judgment of those from whom few wise men will gladly dissent that if ever the nature of man be given at any time more than other to receive goodness it is in innocency of young years before that experience of evil have taken root in him For the pure clean wit of a sweet young babe is like the newest wax most able to receive the best and fairest printing and like a new bright silver dish never occupied to receive and keep clean any good thing that is put into it And thus will in children wisely wrought withal may easily be won to be very well willing to learn And wit in children by nature namely memory the only key and keeper of all learning is readiest to receive and surest to keep any manner of thing that is learned in youth This lewd and learned by common experience know to be most true For we remember nothing so well when we be old as those things which we learned when we were young And this is not strange but common in all nature s works Every man seeth as I said before new wax is best for printing new clay fittest for working new shorn wool aptest for soon and surest dyeing new fresh flesh for good and durable salting And this similitude is not rude nor borrowed of the larder house but out of his school house of whom the wisest of England need not be ashamed to learn Young grafts grow not only soonest but also fairest and bring always forth the best and sweetest fruit young whelps learn easily to carry young popin jays learn quickly to speak And so to be short if in all other things though they lack reason sense and life the similitude of youth is fittest to all goodness surely nature in mankind is most beneficial and effectual in their behalf Therefore if to the goodness of nature be joined the wisdom of the teacher in leading young wits into a right and plain way of learning surely children kept up in God s fear and governed by His grace may most easily be brought well to serve God and their country both by virtue and wisdom But if will and wit by farther age be once allured from innocency delighted in vain sights filled with foul talk crooked with wilfulness hardened with stubbornness and let loose to disobedience surely it is hard with gentleness but impossible with severe cruelty to call them back to good frame again For where the one perchance may bend it the other shall surely break it and so instead of some hope leave an assured desperation and shameless contempt of all goodness the furthest point in all mischief as Xenophon doth most truly and most wittily mark Therefore to love or to hate to like or contemn to ply this way or that way to good or to bad ye shall have as ye use a child in his youth And one example whether love or fear doth work more in a child for virtue and learning I will gladly report which may be heard with some pleasure and followed with more profit Before I went into Germany I came to Broadgate in Leicestershire to take my leave of that noble lady Jane Grey to whom I was exceeding much beholding Her parents the duke and duchess with all the household gentlemen and gentlewomen were hunting in the park I found her in her chamber reading Phaedo Platonis in Greek and that with as much delight as some gentlemen would read a merry tale in Boccace After salutation and duty done with some other talk I asked her why she would leese lose such pastime in the park Smiling she answered me Iwisse all their sport in the park is but a shadow to that pleasure that I find in Plato Alas good folk they never felt what true pleasure meant And how came you madame quoth I to this deep knowledge of pleasure and what did chiefly allure you unto it seeing not many women but very few men have attained thereunto I will tell you quoth she and tell you a truth which perchance ye will marvel at One of the greatest benefits that ever God gave me is that he sent me so sharp and severe parents and so gentle a schoolmaster For when I am in presence either of father or mother whether I speak keep silence sit stand or go eat drink be merry or sad be sewing playing dancing or doing anything else I must do it as it were in such weight measure and number even so perfectly as God made the world or else I am so sharply taunted so cruelly threatened yea presently sometimes with pinches nips and bobs and other ways which I will not name for the honor I bear them so without measure misordered that I think myself in hell till time come that I must go to mister Elmer who teacheth me so gently so pleasantly with such fair allurements to learning that I think all the time nothing whiles I am with him And when I am called from him I fall on weeping because whatsoever I do else but learning is full of grief trouble fear and whole misliking unto me And thus my book hath been so much my pleasure and bringeth daily to me more pleasure and more that in respect of it all other pleasures in very deed be but trifles and troubles unto me I remember this talk gladly both because it is so worthy of memory and because also it was the last talk that ever I had and the last time that ever I saw that noble and worthy lady ON STUDY AND EXERCISE From Toxophilus Philologe But now to our shooting Toxophile again wherein I suppose you cannot say so much for shooting to be fit for learning as you have spoken against music for the same Therefore as concerning music I can be content to grant you your mind but as for shooting surely I suppose that you cannot persuade me by no means that a man can be earnest in it and earnest at his book too but rather I think that a man with a bow on his back and shafts under his girdle is more fit to wait upon Robin Hood than upon Apollo or the Muses Toxophile Over earnest shooting surely I will not over earnestly defend for I ever thought shooting should be a waiter upon learning not a mistress over learning Yet this I marvel not a little at that ye think a man with a bow on his back is more like Robin Hood s servant than Apollo s seeing that Apollo himself in Alcestis of Euripides which tragedy you read openly not long ago in a manner glorieth saying this verse It is my wont always my bow with me to bear Therefore a learned man ought not too much to be ashamed to bear that sometime which Apollo god of learning himself was not ashamed always to bear And because ye would have a man wait upon the Muses and not at all meddle with shooting I marvel that you do not remember how that the nine Muses their self as soon as they were born were put to nurse to a lady called Euphemis which had a son named Erotus with whom the nine Muses for his excellent shooting kept evermore company withal and used daily to shoot together in the Mount Parnassus and at last it chanced this Erotus to die whose death the Muses lamented greatly and fell all upon their knees afore Jupiter their father and at their request Erotus for shooting with the Muses on earth was made a sign and called Sagittarius in heaven Therefore you see that if Apollo and the Muses either were examples indeed or only feigned of wise men to be examples of learning honest shooting may well enough be companion with honest study Philologe Well Toxophile if you have no stronger defense of shooting than poets I fear if your companions which love shooting heard you they would think you made it but a trifling and fabling matter rather than any other man that loveth not shooting could be persuaded by this reason to love it Toxophile Even as I am not so fond but I know that these be fables so I am sure you be not so ignorant but you know what such noble wits as the poets had meant by such matters which oftentimes under the covering of a fable do hide and wrap in goodly precepts of philosophy with the true judgment of things Which to be true specially in Homer and Euripides Plato Aristotle and Galen plainly do show when through all their works in a manner they determine all controversies by these two poets and such like authorities Therefore if in this matter I seem to fable and nothing prove I am content you judge so on me seeing the same judgment shall condemn with me Plato Aristotle and Galen whom in that error I am well content to follow If these old examples prove nothing for shooting what say you to this that the best learned and sagest men in this realm which be now alive both love shooting and use shooting as the best learned bishops that be amongst whom Philologe you yourself know four or five which as in all good learning virtue and sageness they give other men example what thing they should do even so by their shooting they plainly show what honest pastime other men given to learning may honestly use That earnest study must be recreated with honest pastime sufficiently I have proved afore both by reason and authority of the best learned men that ever wrote Then seeing pastimes be leful lawful the most fittest for learning is to be sought for A pastime saith Aristotle must be like a medicine Medicines stand by contraries therefore the nature of studying considered the fittest pastime shall soon appear In study every part of the body is idle which thing causeth gross and cold humors to gather together and vex scholars very much the mind is altogether bent and set on work A pastime then must be had where every part of the body must be labored to separate and lessen such humors withal the mind must be unbent to gather and fetch again his quickness withal Thus pastimes for the mind only be nothing fit for students because the body which is most hurt by study should take away no profit thereat This knew Erasmus very well when he was here in Cambridge which when he had been sore at his book as Garret our book binder had very often told me for lack of better exercise would take his horse and ride about the market hill and come again If a scholar should use bowls or tennis the labor is too vehement and unequal which is condemned of Galen the example very ill for other men when by so many acts they be made unlawful Running leaping and quoiting be too vile for scholars and so not fit by Aristotle s judgment walking alone into the field hath no token of courage in it a pastime like a simple man which is neither flesh nor fish Therefore if a man would have a pastime wholesome and equal for every part of the body pleasant and full of courage for the mind not vile and unhonest to give ill example to laymen not kept in gardens and corners not lurking on the night and in holes but evermore in the face of men either to rebuke it when it doeth ill or else to testify on it when it doth well let him seek chiefly of all other for shooting ATHENAEUS Third Century A D Little is known that is authentic about the Graeco Egyptian Sophist or man of letters Athenaeus author of the Deipnosophistae or Feast of the Learned except his literary bequest It is recorded that he was born at Naucratis a city of the Nile Delta and that after living at Alexandria he migrated to Rome His date is presumptively fixed in the early part of the third century by his inclusion of Ulpian the eminent jurist whose death occurred A D two hundred twenty eight among the twenty nine guests of the banquet whose wit and learning furnished its viands He was perhaps a contemporary of the physician Galen another of the putative banqueters who served as a mouthpiece of the author s erudition Probably nothing concerning him deserved preservation except his unique work the Feast of the Learned Of the fifteen books transmitted under the above title the first two and portions of the third eleventh and fifteenth exist only in epitome the name of the compiler and his time being equally obscure yet it is curious that for many centuries these garbled fragments were the only memorials of the author extant The other books constituting the major portion of the work have been pronounced authentic by eminent scholars with Bentley at their head Without the slightest pretense of literary skill the Feast of the Learned is an immense storehouse of Ana or table talk Into its receptacles the author gathers fruitage from nearly every branch of contemporary learning He seemed to anticipate Macaulay s vice of omniscience though he lacked Macaulay s incomparable literary virtues Personal anecdote criticism of the fine arts the drama history poetry philosophy politics medicine and natural history enter into his pages illustrated with an aptness and variety of quotation which seem to have no limit He preserves old songs folk lore and popular gossip and relates whatever he may have heard without sifting it He gives for example a vivid account of the procession which greeted Demetrius Poliorketes When Demetrius returned from Leucadia and Corcyra to Athens the Athenians received him not only with incense and garlands and libations but they even sent out processional choruses and greeted him with Ithyphallic hymns and dances Stationed by his chariot wheels they sang and danced and chanted that he alone was a real god the rest were sleeping or were on a journey or did not exist they called him son of Poseidon and Aphrodite eminent for beauty universal in his goodness to mankind then they prayed and besought and supplicated him like a god The hymn of worship which Athenaeus evidently disapproved has been preserved and turned into English by the accomplished J A Symonds on account of its rare and interesting versification It belongs to the class of Prosodia or processional hymns which the greatest poets delighted to produce and which were sung at religious festivals by young men and maidens marching to the shrines in time with the music their locks crowned with wreaths of olive myrtle or oleander their white robes shining in the sun See how the mightiest gods and best beloved Towards our town are winging For lo Demeter and Demetrius This glad day is bringing She to perform her Daughter s solemn rites Mystic pomps attend her He joyous as a god should be and blithe Comes with laughing splendor Show forth your triumph Friends all troop around Let him shine above you Be you the stars to circle him with love He s the sun to love you Hail offspring of Poseidon powerful god Child of Aphrodite The other deities keep far from earth Have no ears though mighty They are not or they will not hear us wail Thee our eye beholdeth Not wood not stone but living breathing real Thee our prayer enfoldeth First give us peace Give dearest for thou canst Thou art Lord and Master The Sphinx who not on Thebes but on all Greece Swoops to gloat and pasture The AEtolian he who sits upon his rock Like that old disaster He feeds upon our flesh and blood and we Can no longer labor For it was ever thus the AEtolian thief Preyed upon his neighbor Him punish Thou or if not Thou then send Oedipus to harm him Who ll cast this Sphinx down from his cliff of pride Or to stone will charm him The Swallow song which is cited is an example of the folk lore and old customs which Athenaeus delighted to gather and he tells how in springtime the children used to go about from door to door begging doles and presents and singing such half sensible half foolish rhymes as She is here she is here the swallow Fair seasons bringing fair years to follow Her belly is white Her back black as night From your rich house Roll forth to us Tarts wine and cheese Or if not these Oatmeal and barley cake The swallow deigns to take What shall we have or must we hence away Thanks if you give if not we ll make you pay The house door hence we ll carry Nor shall the lintel tarry From hearth and home your wife we ll rob She is so small To take her off will be an easy job Whate er you give give largess free Up open open to the swallow s call No grave old men but merry children we The Feast of the Learned professes to be the record of the sayings at a banquet given at Rome by Laurentius to his learned friends Laurentius stands as the typical Maecenas of the period The dialogue is reported after Plato s method or as we see it in the more familiar form of the Satires of Horace though lacking the pithy vigor of these models The discursiveness with which topics succeed each other their want of logic or continuity and the pelting fire of quotations in prose and verse make a strange mixture It may be compared to one of those dishes known both to ancients and to moderns in which a great variety of scraps is enriched with condiments to the obliteration of all individual flavor The plan of execution is so cumbersome that its only defense is its imitation of the inevitably disjointed talk when the guests of a dinner party are busy with their wine and nuts One is tempted to suspect Athenaeus of a sly sarcasm at his own expense when he puts the following flings at pedantry in the mouths of some of his puppets And now when Myrtilus had said all this in a connected statement and when all were marveling at his memory Cynulcus said Your multifarious learning I do wonder at Though there is not a thing more vain and useless Says Hippo the Atheist But the divine Heraclitus also says A great variety of information does not usually give wisdom And Timon said For what is the use of so many names my good grammarian which are more calculated to overwhelm the hearers than to do them any good This passage shows the redundancy of expression which disfigures so much of Athenaeus It is also typical of the cudgel play of repartee between his characters which takes the place of agile witticism But if he heaps up vast piles of scholastic rubbish he is also the Golden Dustman who shows us the treasure preserved by his saving pedantry Scholars find the Feast of the Learned a quarry of quotations from classical writers whose works have perished Nearly eight hundred writers and twenty four hundred separate writings are referred to and cited in this disorderly encyclopedia most of them now lost and forgotten This literary thrift will always give rank to the work of Athenaeus poor as it is The best editions of the original Greek are those of Dindorf Leipzig eighteen twenty seven and of Meineke Leipzig eighteen sixty seven The best English translation is that of C D Yonge in Bonn s Classical Library from which with slight alterations the appended passages are selected WHY THE NILE OVERFLOWS From the Deipnosophistae Thales the Milesian one of the Seven Wise Men says that the overflowing of the Nile arises from the Etesian winds for that they blow up the river and that the mouths of the river lie exactly opposite to the point from which they blow and accordingly that the wind blowing in the opposite direction hinders the flow of the waters and the waves of the sea dashing against the mouth of the river and coming on with a fair wind in the same direction beat back the river and in this manner the Nile becomes full to overflowing But Anaxagoras the natural philosopher says that the fullness of the Nile arises from the snow melting and so too says Euripides and some others of the tragic poets Anaxagoras says this is the sole origin of all that fullness but Euripides goes further and describes the exact place where this melting of the snow takes place HOW TO PRESERVE THE HEALTH From the Deipnosophistae One ought to avoid thick perfumes and to drink water that is thin and clear and that in respect of weight is light and that has no earthy particles in it And that water is best which is of moderate heat or coldness and which when poured into a brazen or silver vessel does not produce a blackish sediment Hippocrates says Water which is easily warmed or easily chilled is alway lighter But that water is bad which takes a long time to boil vegetables and so too is water full of nitre or brackish And in his book On Waters Hippocrates calls good water drinkable but stagnant water he calls bad such as that from ponds or marshes And most spring water is rather hard Erasistratus says that some people test water by weight and that is a most stupid proceeding For just look says he if men compare the water from the fountain Amphiaraus with that from the Eretrian spring though one of them is good and the other bad there is absolutely no difference in their respective weights And Hippocrates in his book On Places says that those waters are the best which flow from high ground and from dry hills for they are white and sweet and are able to bear very little wine and are warm in winter and cold in summer And he praises those most the springs of which break toward the east and especially toward the northeast for they must be inevitably clear and fragrant and light Diocles says that water is good for the digestion and not apt to cause flatulency that it is moderately cooling and good for the eyes and that it has no tendency to make the head feel heavy and that it adds vigor to the mind and body And Praxagoras says the same and he also praises rain water But Euenor praises water from cisterns and says that the best is that from the cistern of Amphiaraus when compared with that from the fountain in Eretria That water is really nutritious is plain from the fact that some animals are nourished by it alone as for instance grasshoppers And there are many other liquids that are nutritious such as milk barley water and wine At all events animals at the breast are nourished by milk and there are many nations who drink nothing but milk And it is said that Democritus the philosopher of Abdera after he had determined to rid himself of life on account of his extreme old age and after he had begun to diminish his food day by day when the day of the Thesmophorian festival came round and the women of his household besought him not to die during the festival in order that they might not be debarred from their share in the festivities was persuaded and ordered a vessel full of honey to be set near him and in this way he lived many days with no other support than honey and then some days after when the honey had been taken away he died But Democritus had always been fond of honey and he once answered a man who asked him how he could live in the enjoyment of the best health that he might do so if he constantly moistened his inward parts with honey and the outer man with oil And bread and honey was the chief food of the Pythagoreans according to the statement of Aristoxenus who says that those who eat this for breakfast were free from disease all their lives And Lycus says that the Cyrneans a people who live near Sardinia are very long lived because they are continually eating honey and it is produced in great quantities among them AN ACCOUNT OF SOME GREAT EATERS From the Deipnosophistae Heraclitus in his Entertainer of Strangers says that there was a woman named Helena who ate more than any other woman ever did And Posidippus in his Epigrams says that Phuromachus was a great eater on whom he wrote this epigram This lowly ditch now holds Phuromachus Who used to swallow everything he saw Like a fierce carrion crow who roams all night Now here he lies wrapped in a ragged cloak But O Athenian whosoe er you are Anoint this tomb and crown it with a wreath If ever in old times he feasted with you At last he came sans teeth with eyes worn out And livid swollen eyelids clothed in skins With but one single cruse and that scarce full Far from the gay Lenaean Games he came Descending humbly to Calliope Amarantus of Alexandria in his treatise on the Stage says that Herodorus the Megarian trumpeter was a man three cubits and a half in height and that he had great strength in his chest and that he could eat six pounds of bread and twenty litrae of meat of whatever sort was provided for him and that he could drink two choes of wine and that he could play on two trumpets at once and that it was his habit to sleep on only a lion s skin and when playing on the trumpet he made a vast noise Accordingly when Demetrius the son of Antigonus was besieging Argos and when his troops could not bring the battering ram against the walls on account of its weight he giving the signal with his two trumpets at once by the great volume of sound which he poured forth instigated the soldiers to move forward the engine with great zeal and earnestness and he gained the prize in all the games ten times and he used to eat sitting down as Nestor tells us in his Theatrical Reminiscences And there was a woman too named Aglais who played on the trumpet the daughter of Megacles who in the first great procession which took place in Alexandria played a processional piece of music having a head dress of false hair on and a crest upon her head as Posidippus proves by his epigrams on her And she too could eat twelve litrae of meat and four choenixes of bread and drink a choenus of wine at one sitting There was besides a man of the name of Lityerses a bastard son of Midas the King of Celaenae in Phrygia a man of a savage and fierce aspect and an enormous glutton He is mentioned by Sositheus the tragic poet in his play called Daphnis or Lityersa where he says He ll eat three asses panniers freight and all Three times in one brief day and what he calls A measure of wine is a ten amphorae cask And this he drinks all at a single draught And the man mentioned by Pherecrates or Strattis whichever was the author of the play called The Good Men was much such another the author says A I scarcely in one day unless I m forced Can eat two bushels and a half of food B A most unhappy man how have you lost Your appetite so as now to be content With the scant rations of one ship of war And Xanthus in his Account of Lydia says that Cambles who was the king of the Lydians was a great eater and drinker and also an exceeding epicure and accordingly that he one night cut up his own wife into joints and ate her and then in the morning finding the hand of his wife still sticking in his mouth he slew himself as his act began to get notorious And we have already mentioned Thys the king of the Paphlagonians saying that he too was a man of vast appetite quoting Theopompus who speaks of him in the thirty fifth book of his History and Archilochus in his Tetrameters has accused Charilas of the same fault as the comic poets have attacked Cleonymus and Pisander And Phoenicides mentions Chaerippus in his Phylarchus in the following terms And next to them I place Chaerippus third He as you know will without ceasing eat As long as any one will give him food Or till he bursts such stowage vast has he Like any house And Nicolaus the Peripatetic in the hundred and third book of his History says that Mithridates the king of Pontus once proposed a contest in great eating and great drinking the prize was a talent of silver and that he himself gained the victory in both but he yielded the prize to the man who was judged to be second to him namely Calomodrys the athlete of Cyzicus And Timocreon the Rhodian a poet and an athlete who had gained the victory in the pentathlum ate and drank a great deal as the epigram on his tomb shows Much did I eat much did I drink and much Did I abuse all men now here I lie My name Timocreon my country Rhodes And Thrasymachus of Chalcedon in one of his prefaces says that Timocreon came to the great king of Persia and being entertained by him did eat an immense quantity of food and when the king asked him What he would do on the strength of it he said that he would beat a great many Persians and the next day having vanquished a great many one after another taking them one by one after this he beat the air with his hands and when they asked him what he wanted he said that he had all those blows left in him if any one was inclined to come on And Clearchus in the fifth book of his Lives says that Cantibaris the Persian whenever his jaws were weary with eating had his slaves to pour food into his mouth which he kept open as if they were pouring it into an empty vessel But Hellanicus in the first book of his Deucalionea says that Erysichthon the son of Myrmidon being a man perfectly insatiable in respect of food was called AEthon Also Polemo in the first book of his Treatise addressed to Timaeus says that among the Sicilians there was a temple consecrated to gluttony and an image of Demeter Sito near which also there was a statue of Himalis as there is at Delphi one of Hermuchus and as at Scolum in Boeotia there are statues of Megalartus and Megalomazus THE LOVE OF ANIMALS FOR MAN From the Deipnosophistae And even dumb animals have fallen in love with men for there was a cock who took a fancy to a man of the name of Secundus a cupbearer of the king and the cock was nicknamed the Centaur This Secundus was a slave of Nicomedes the king of Bithynia as Nicander informs us in the sixth book of his essay on The Revolutions of Fortune And at AEgium a goose took a fancy to a boy as Clearchus relates in the first book of his Amatory Anecdotes And Theophrastus in his essay On Love says that the name of this boy was Amphilochus and that he was a native of Olenus And Hermeas the son of Hermodorus who was a Samian by birth says that a goose also took a fancy to Lacydes the philosopher And in Leucadia according to a story told by Clearchus a peacock fell so in love with a maiden there that when she died the bird died too There is a story also that at Iasus a dolphin took a fancy to a boy and this story is told by Duris in the ninth book of his History and the subject of that book is the history of Alexander and the historian s words are these He likewise sent for the boy from Iasus For near Iasus there was a boy whose name was Dionysius and he once when leaving the palaestra with the rest of the boys went down to the sea and bathed and a dolphin came forward out of the deep water to meet him and taking him on his back swam away with him a considerable distance into the open sea and then brought him back again to land The dolphin is in fact an animal which is very fond of men and very intelligent and one very susceptible of gratitude Accordingly Phylarchus in his twelfth book says Coiranus the Milesian when he saw some fishermen who had caught a dolphin in a net and who were about to cut it up gave them some money and bought the fish and took it down and put it back in the sea again And after this it happened to him to be shipwrecked near Myconos and while every one else perished Coiranus alone was saved by a dolphin And when at last he died of old age in his native country as it so happened that his funeral procession passed along the seashore close to Miletus a great shoal of dolphins appeared on that day in the harbor keeping only a very little distance from those who were attending the funeral of Coiranus as if they also were joining in the procession and sharing in their grief The same Phylarchus also relates in the twentieth book of his History the great affection which was once displayed by an elephant for a boy And his words are these Now there was a female elephant kept with this elephant and the name of the female elephant was Nicaea and to her the wife of the king of India when dying intrusted her child which was just a month old And when the woman did die the affection for the child displayed by the beast was most extraordinary for it could not endure the child to be away and whenever it did not see him it was out of spirits And so whenever the nurse fed the infant with milk she placed it in its cradle between the feet of the beast and if she had not done so the elephant would not take any food and after this it would take whatever reeds and grass there were near and while the child was sleeping beat away the flies with the bundle And whenever the child wept it would rock the cradle with its trunk and lull it to sleep And very often the male elephant did the same PER DANIEL AMADEUS ATTERBOM seventeen ninety eighteen fifty five Among the leaders of the romantic movement which affected Swedish literature in the earlier half of the nineteenth century was P D A Atterbom one of the greatest lyric poets of his country He was born in Ostergoethland in seventeen ninety and at the age of fifteen was already so advanced in his studies that he entered the University of Upsala There in eighteen oh seven he helped to found the Musis Amici a students society of literature and art its membership included Hedbom who is remembered for his beautiful hymns and the able and laborious Palmblad author of several popular books including the well known novel Aurora Koenigsmark This society soon assumed the name of the Aurora League and set itself to free Swedish literature from French influence The means chosen were the study of German romanticism and a treatment of the higher branches of literature in direct opposition to the course decreed by the Academical school The leaders of this revolution were Atterbom eighteen years old and Palmblad twenty The first organ of the League was the Polyfem soon replaced by the Phosphorus eighteen ten eighteen thirteen from which the young enthusiasts received their sobriquet of Phosphorists Theoretically this sheet was given to the discussion of Schelling s philosophy and of metaphysical problems in general practically to the publication of the original poetry of the new school The Phosphorists did a good work in calling attention to the old Swedish folk lore and awakening a new interest in its imaginative treasures But their best service lay in their forcible and earnest treatment of religious questions which at that time were most superficially dealt with When the Phosphorus was in its third year the Romanticists united in bringing out two new organs the Poetical Calendar eighteen twelve eighteen twenty two which published poetry only and the Swedish Literary News eighteen thirteen eighteen twenty four containing critical essays of great scientific value The Phosphorists who had shown themselves ardent but not always sagacious fighters now appeared at their best and dashed into the controversy which was engaging the attention of the Swedish reading public This included not only literature but philosophy and religion as well as art The odds were now on one side now on the other The Academicians might easily have conquered their youthful opponents however had not their bitterness continually forged new weapons against themselves In eighteen twenty the Phosphorists wrote the excellent satire Marskall s Sleepless Nights aimed at Wallmark leader of the Academicians Gradually the strife died out and the man who carried off the palm and for a time became the leader of Swedish poetry was Tegner who was hardly a partisan of either side In eighteen seventeen Atterbom had gone abroad broken down in health by his uninterrupted studies While in Germany he entered into a warm friendship with Schelling and Steffens and in Naples he met the Danish sculptor Thorwaldsen to whose circle of friends he became attached On his return he was made tutor of German and literature to the Crown Prince In eighteen twenty eight the Chair of Logics and Metaphysics at Upsala was offered him and he held this for seven years when he exchanged it for that of Aesthetics In eighteen thirty nine he was elected a member of the Academy whose bitterest enemy he had been and so the peace was signed Atterbom is undoubtedly the greatest lyrical poet in the ranks of the Phosphorists His verses are wonderfully melodious and full of charm in spite of the fact that his tendency to the mystical at times makes him obscure Among the best of his productions are a cycle of lyrics entitled The Flowers The Isle of Blessedness a romantic drama of great beauty published in eighteen twenty three and a fragment of a fairy drama The Blue Bird He introduced the sonnet into Swedish poetry and did a great service to the national literature by his critical work Swedish Seers and Poets a collection of biographies and criticisms of poets and philosophers before and during the reign of Gustavus III Atterbom s life may be accounted long in the way of service though he died at the age of sixty five THE GENIUS OF THE NORTH It is true that our Northern nature is lofty and strong Its characteristics may well awaken deep meditation and emotion When the Goddess of Song has grown up in these surroundings her view of life is like that mirrored in our lakes where between the dark shadows of mountain and trees on the shore a light blue sky looks down Over this mirror the Northern morning and the Northern day the Northern evening and the Northern night rise in a glorious beauty Our Muse kindles a lofty hero s flame a lofty seer s flame and always the flame of a lofty immortality In this sombre North we experience an immense joyousness and an immense melancholy moods of earth coveting and of earth renunciation With equal mind we behold the fleet charming dream of her summers her early harvest with its quickly falling splendor and the darkness and silence of the long winter s sleep For if the gem like green of the verdure proclaims its short life it proclaims at the same time its richness and in winter the very darkness seems made to let the starry vault shine through with a glory of Valhalla and Gimle Indeed in our North the winter possesses an impressiveness a freshness which only we Norsemen understand Add to these strong effects of nature the loneliness of life in a wide tract of land sparingly populated by a still sparingly educated people and then think of the poet s soul which must beat against these barriers of circumstance and barriers of spirit Yet the barriers that hold him in as often help as hinder his striving These conditions explain what our literature amply proves that so far the only poetical form which has reached perfection in Sweden is the lyrical This will be otherwise only as the northern mind through a growing familiarity with contemporaneous Europe will consent to be drawn from its forest solitude into the whirl of the motley World s Fair outside its boundaries It is probable that the lyrical gift will always be the true possession of the Swedish poet His genius is such that it needs only a beautiful moment s exaltation blissful whether the experience be called joy or sorrow to rise on full free wings suddenly singing out his very inmost being Whether the poet makes this inmost being his subject or quite forgets himself in a richer and higher theme is of little consequence If again no true lyric can express a narrow egoism least of all could the Swedish in spite of the indivisible relation between nature and man The entire Saemunds Edda shows us that Scandinavian poetry was originally lyrical didactic as much religious as heroic Not only in lyrical impression but also in lyrical contemplation and lyrical expression will the Swedish heroic poem still follow its earliest trend Yes let us believe that this impulse will some day lead Swedish poetry into the only path of true progress to the point where dramatic expression will attain perfection of artistic form This development is foreshadowed already in the high tragic drama in the view of the world taken by the old Swedish didactic poem and in some of the songs of the Edda as well as in many an old folk song and folk play THE LILY OF THE VALLEY O er hill and dale the welcome news is flying That summer s drawing near Out of my thicket cool my cranny hidden Around I shyly peer He will not notice me this guest resplendent Unseen I shall remain Content to live if of his banquet royal Some glimpses I may gain Behold Behold His banquet hall s before me Pillared with forest trees Lo as he feasts a thousand sunbeams sparkle His gracious smiles are these Hail to thee brilliant world Ye heavens fretted With clouds of silver hue Ye waves of mighty ocean tossing tossing Fair in my sight as new Far in the past if years my life has numbered Ghost like in thought they drift Came to me silently the truth eternal Joy is life s richest gift Thus in return for life s abundant dower A gift have I I bear A spotless soul from whose unseen recesses Exhales a fragrance rare Strong is the power in gentle souls indwelling Born of a joy divine Theirs is a sphere untrod by creatures earthly By beings gross supine Fragile and small and set in quiet places My worth should I forget Some one who seeks friend counselor or lover Will find and prize me yet Thou lovely maid through mossy pathways straying Striving to make thy choice Hearing the while the brook which downward leaping Lifts up its merry voice Pluck me and as a rich reward I ll whisper Things them wilt love to hear The name of him who comes to win thy favor I ll whisper in thine ear SVANHVIT S COLLOQUY From The Islands of the Blest SVANHVIT alone in her chamber No Asdolf yet in vain and everywhere Hath he been sought for since his foaming steed At morn with vacant saddle stood before The lofty staircase in the castle yard His drooping crest and wildly rolling eye And limbs with frenzied terror quivering All seemed as though the midnight fiends had urged His swiftest flight through many a wood and plain O Lord that know saint what he hath witnessed there Wouldst thou but give one single speaking sound Unto the faithful creature s silent tongue That momentary voice would be for me A call to life or summons to the grave She goes to the window And yet what childish fears are these How oft Hath not my Asdolf boldest feats achieved And aye returned unharmed and beautiful Yes beautiful alas like this cold flower That proudly glances on the frosty pane Short is the violet s short the cowslip s spring The frost flowers live far longer cold as they The beautiful should be that it may share The splendor of the light without its heat For else the sun of life must soon dissolve The hard cold shining pearls to liquid tears And tears flow fast away She breathes on the window Become transparent thou fair Asdolf flower That I may look into the vale beneath There lies the city Asdolf s capital How wondrously the spotless vest of snow On roof on mount on market place now smiles A glittering welcome to the morning sun Whose blood red beams shed beauty on the earth The Bride of Sacrifice makes no lament But smiles in silence knowing sadly well That she is slighted and that he who could Call forth her spring doth not but rather dwells In other climes where lavishly he pours His fond embracing beams while she alas In wintry shade and lengthened loneliness Cold on the solitary couch reclines After a pause What countless paths wind down from divers points To yonder city gates Oh wilt not thou My star appear to me on one of them Whate er I said thou art my worshiped sun Then pardon me thou art not cold oh no Too warm too glowing warm art thou for me Yet thus it is Thy being s music has A thousand chords with thousand varying tones Whilst I but one poor sound can offer thee Of tenderness and truth At times indeed This too may have its power but then it lasts One and the same forever sounding still Unalterably like itself alone A wordless prayer to God for what we love Tis more a whisper than a sound and charms Like new mown meadows when the grass exhales Sweet fragrance to the foot that tramples it Kings heroes towering spirits among men Rush to their aim on wild and stormy wings And far beneath them view the world whose form For ever varies on from hour to hour What would they ask of love That volatile In changeful freshness it may charm their ears With proud triumphant songs when high in air Victorious banners wave or sweetly lull To rapturous repose when round them roars The awful thunder s everlasting voice Mute mean and spiritless to them must seem The maid who is no more than woman How Should she o er sound the storm their wings have raised Sitting down Great Lord how lonely I become within These now uncheerful towers O er all the earth No shield have I no mutual feeling left Tis true that those around me all are kind And well I know they love me more indeed Than my poor merits claim Yet even though They raised me to my Asdolf s royal throne As being the last of all his line ah me No solace could it bring for then far less Might I reveal the sorrow of my soul A helpless maiden s tears like raindrops fall Which in a July night ere harvest time Bedew the flowers and trembling stand within Their half closed eyes unnumbered and unknown She rises Yet One there is who counts the maiden s tears But when will their sad number be fulfilled Walking to and fro How calm was I in former days I now Am so no more My heart beats heavily Oppressed within its prison cave Ah fain Would I that it might burst its bonds so that Twere conscious Asdolf I sometimes had seemed Not all unworthy in thine eyes She takes the guitar A gentle friend the Master from Vallandia Has taught me how I may converse with thee Thou cherished token of my Asdolf s love I have been told of far off lakes around Whose shores the cypress and the willow wave And make a mournful shade above the stream Which dark and narrow on the surface swells Broad and unfathomably deep below From these dark lakes at certain times and most On Sabbath morns and eves of festivals Uprising from the depths is heard a sound Most strange and wild as of the tuneful bells Of churches and of castles long since sunk And as the wanderer s steps approach the shore He hears more plainly the lamenting tone Of the dark waters whilst the surface still Continues motionless and calm and seems To listen with a melancholy joy While thus the dim mysterious depths resound So let me strive to soften and subdue My heart s dark swelling with a soothful song She plays and sings The maiden bound her hunting net At morning fresh and fair Ah no that lay doth ever make me grieve Another then that of the hapless flower Surprised by frost and snow in early spring Sings Hush thee oh hush thee Slumber from snow and stormy sky Lovely and lone one Now is the time for thee to die When vale and streamlet frozen lie Hush thee oh hush thee Hours hasten onward For thee the last will soon be o er Rest thee oh rest thee Flowers have withered thus before And my poor heart what wouldst thou more Rest thee oh rest thee Shadows should darkly Enveil thy past delights and woes Forget oh forget them Tis thus that eve its shadows throws But now in noiseless night s repose Forget oh forget them Slumber oh slumber No friend hast thou like kindly snow Sleep is well for thee For whom no second spring will blow Then why poor heart still beating so Slumber oh slumber Hush thee oh hush thee Resign thy life breath in a sigh Listen no longer Life bids farewell to thee then die Sad one good night in sweet sleep lie Hush thee oh hush thee She bursts into tears Would now that I might bid adieu to life But ah no voice to me replies Sleep well THE MERMAID Leaving the sea the pale moon lights the strand Tracing old runes a youth inscribes the sand And by the rune ring waits a woman fair Down to her feet extends her dripping hair Woven of lustrous pearls her robes appear Thin as the air and as the water clear Lifting her veil with milk white hand she shows Eyes in whose deeps a deadly fire glows Blue are her eyes she looks upon him bound As by a spell he views their gulf profound Heaven and death are there in his desire He feels the chill of ice the heat of fire Graciously smiling now she whispers low The runes are dark would you their meaning know Follow my dwelling is as dark and deep You you alone its treasure vast shall keep Where is your dwelling charming maid now say Built on a coral island far away Crystalline golden floats that castle free Meet for a lovely daughter of the sea Still he delays and muses on the strand Now the alluring maiden grasps his hand Ah Do you tremble you who were so bold Yes for the heaving breakers are so cold Let not the mounting waves your spirit change Take as a charm my ring with sea runes strange Here is my crown of water lilies white Here is my harp with human bones bedight What say my Father and my Mother dear What says my God who bends from heaven to hear Father and Mother in the churchyard lie As for thy God he deigns not to reply Blithely she dances on the pearl strewn sand Smiting the bone harp with her graceful hand Fair is her bosom through her thin robe seen White as a swan beheld through rushes green Follow me youth through ocean deeps we ll rove There is my castle in its coral grove There the red branches purple shadows throw There the green waves like grass sway to and fro I have a thousand sisters none so fair He whom I wed receives my sceptre rare Wisdom occult my mother will impart Granting his slightest wish I ll cheer his heart Heaven and earth to win you I abjure Child of the ocean is your promise sure Heaven and earth abjuring great s your gain Throned with the ancient gods a king to reign Lo as she speaks a thousand starlights gleam Lighted for Heaven s Christmas day they seem Sighing he swears the oath the die is cast Into the mermaid s arms he sinks at last High on the shore the rushing waves roll in Why does the color vary on your skin What From your waist a fish s tail depends Worn for the dances of my sea maid friends High overhead the stars like torches burn Haste to my golden castle I return Save me ye runes Yes try them now they fail Pupil of heathen men my spells prevail Proudly she turns her sceptre strikes the wave Roaring it parts the ocean yawns a grave Mermaid and youth go down the gulf is deep Over their heads the surging waters sweep Often on moonlight nights when bluebells ring When for their sports the elves are gathering Out of the waves the youth appears and plays Tunes that are merry mournful like his days AUCASSIN AND NICOLLETE Twelfth Century BY FREDERICK MORRIS WARREN This charming tale of medieval France has reached modern times in but one manuscript which is now in the National Library at Paris It gives us no hint as to the time and place of the author but its linguistic forms would indicate for locality the borderland of Champagne and Picardy while the fact that the verse of the story is in assonance would point to the later twelfth century as the date of the original draft It would thus be contemporaneous with the last poems of Chretien de Troyes eleven seventy eighty The author was probably a minstrel by profession but one of more than ordinary taste and talent For evidently skilled in both song and recitation he so divided his narrative between poetry and prose that he gave himself ample opportunity to display his powers while at the same time he retained more easily by this variety the attention of his audience He calls his invention if his invention it be a song story The subject he drew probably from reminiscences of the widely known story of Floire and Blanchefleur reversing the parts so that here it is the hero who is the Christian while the heroine is a Saracen captive baptized in her early years The general outline of the plot also resembles indistinctly the plot of Floire and Blanchefleur though its topography is somewhat indefinite and a certain amount of absurd adventure in strange lands is interwoven with it With these exceptions however few literary productions of the Middle Ages can rival Aucassin and Nicolette in graceful sentiment and sympathetic description The Paris manuscript gives the music for the poetical parts music that is little more than a modulation There is a different notation for the first two lines but for the other lines this notation is repeated in couplets except that the last line of each song or laisse being a half line has a cadence of its own The lines are all seven syllables in length save the final half lines and the assonance which all but the half lines observe tends somewhat towards rhyme The story begins with a song which serves as prologue and then its prose takes up the narrative telling how Aucassin son of Garin Count of Beaucaire so loved Nicolette a Saracen maiden who had been sold to the Viscount of Beaucaire baptized and adopted by him that he had forsaken knighthood and chivalry and even refused to defend his father s territories against Count Bougart of Valence Accordingly his father ordered the Viscount to send away Nicolette and he walled her up in a tower of his palace Later Aucassin is imprisoned by his father But Nicolette escapes hears him lamenting in his cell and comforts him until the warden on the tower warns her of the approach of the town watch She flees to the forest outside the gates and there in order to test Aucassin s fidelity builds a rustic tower When he is released from prison Aucassin hears from shepherd lads of Nicolette s hiding place and seeks her bower The lovers united resolve to leave the country They take ship and are driven to the kingdom of Torelore whose queen they find in child bed while the king is with the army After a three years stay in Torelore they are captured by Saracen pirates and separated Contrary winds blow Aucassin s boat to Beaucaire where he succeeds to Garin s estate while Nicolette is carried to Carthage The sight of the city reminds her that she is the daughter of its king and a royal marriage is planned for her But she avoids this by assuming a minstrel s garb and setting sail for Beaucaire There before Aucassin she sings of her own adventures and in due time makes herself known to him Now in one last strain our story teller celebrates the lovers meeting concluding with Our song story comes to an end I know no more to tell And thus he takes leave of the gentle and courageous maiden The whole account of these trials and reunions does not occupy over forty pages of the original French which has been best edited by H Suchier at Paderborn second edition eighteen eighty one In eighteen seventy eight A Bida published with illustrations a modern French version of the story at Paris accompanied by the original text and a preface by Gaston Paris This version was translated into English by A Rodney Macdonough under the title of The Lovers of Provence Aucassin and Nicolette New York eighteen eighty Additional illustrations by American artists found place in this edition F W Bourdillon has published the original text and an English version together with an exhaustive introduction bibliography notes and glossary London eighteen eighty seven and later in the same year Andrew Lang wrote out another translation accompanied by an introduction and notes Aucassin and Nicolette London The extracts given below are from Lang s version with occasional slight alterations Illustration Signature F M WARREN TIS OF AUCASSIN AND NICOLETTE Who would list to the good lay Gladness of the captive gray Tis how two young lovers met Aucassin and Nicolette Of the pains the lover bore And the perils he outwore For the goodness and the grace Of his love so fair of face Sweet the song the story sweet There is no man hearkens it No man living neath the sun So outwearied so fordone Sick and woeful worn and sad But is healed but is glad Tis so sweet So say they speak they tell they The Tale How the Count Bougart of Valence made war on Count Garin of Beaucaire war so great so marvelous and so mortal that never a day dawned but alway he was there by the gates and walls and barriers of the town with a hundred knights and ten thousand men at arms horsemen and footmen so burned he the Count s land and spoiled his country and slew his men Now the Count Garin of Beaucaire was old and frail and his good days were gone over No heir had he neither son nor daughter save one young man only such an one as I shall tell you Aucassin was the name of the damoiseau fair was he goodly and great and featly fashioned of his body and limbs His hair was yellow in little curls his eyes blue gray and laughing his face beautiful and shapely his nose high and well set and so richly seen was he in all things good that in him was none evil at all But so suddenly was he overtaken of Love who is a great master that he would not of his will be a knight nor take arms nor follow tourneys nor do whatsoever him beseemed Therefore his father and mother said to him Son go take thine arms mount thine horse and hold thy land and help thy men for if they see thee among them more stoutly will they keep in battle their lives and lands and thine and mine Father answered Aucassin what are you saying now Never may God give me aught of my desire if I be a knight or mount my horse or face stour and battle wherein knights smite and are smitten again unless thou give me Nicolette my true love that I love so well Son said the father this may not be Let Nicolette go A slave girl is she out of a strange land and the viscount of this town bought her of the Saracens and carried her hither and hath reared her and had her christened and made her his god daughter and one day will find a young man for her to win her bread honorably Herein hast thou naught to make nor mend but if a wife thou wilt have I will give thee the daughter of a king or a count There is no man so rich in France but if thou desire his daughter thou shall have her Faith my father said Aucassin tell me where is the place so high in all the world that Nicolette my sweet lady and love would not grace it well If she were Empress of Constantinople or of Germany or Queen of France or England it were little enough for her so gentle is she and courteous and debonnaire and compact of all good qualities IMPRISONMENT OF NICOLETTE When Count Garin of Beaucaire knew that he would not avail to withdraw Aucassin his son from the love of Nicolette he went to the viscount of the city who was his man and spake to him saying Sir Count away with Nicolette thy daughter in God cursed be the land whence she was brought into this country for by reason of her do I lose Aucassin that will neither be a knight nor do aught of the things that fall to him to be done And wit ye well he said that if I might have her at my will I would burn her in a fire and yourself might well be sore adread Sir said the Viscount this is grievous to me that he comes and goes and hath speech with her I had bought the maid at mine own charges and nourished her and baptized and made her my daughter in God Yea I would have given her to a young man that should win her bread honorably With this had Aucassin thy son naught to make or mend But sith it is thy will and thy pleasure I will send her into that land and that country where never will he see her with his eyes Have a heed to thyself said the Count Garin thence might great evil come on thee So parted they each from the other Now the Viscount was a right rich man so had he a rich palace with a garden in face of it in an upper chamber thereof he had Nicolette placed with one old woman to keep her company and in that chamber put bread and meat and wine and such things as were needful Then he had the door sealed that none might come in or go forth save that there was one window over against the garden and quite strait through which came to them a little air Here singeth one Nicolette as ye heard tell Prisoned is within a cell That is painted wondrously With colors of a far countrie At the window of marble wrought There the maiden stood in thought With straight brows and yellow hair Never saw ye fairer fair On the wood she gazed below And she saw the roses blow Heard the birds sing loud and low Therefore spoke she woefully Ah me wherefore do I lie Here in prison wrongfully Aucassin my love my knight Am I not thy heart s delight Thou that lovest me aright Tis for thee that I must dwell In this vaulted chamber cell Hard beset and all alone By our Lady Mary s Son Here no longer will I wonn If I may flee AUCASSIN AND THE VISCOUNT The Viscount speaks first Plentiful lack of comfort hadst thou got thereby for in Hell would thy soul have lain while the world endures and into Paradise wouldst thou have entered never In Paradise what have I to win Therein I seek not to enter but only to have Nicolette my sweet lady that I love so well For into Paradise go none but such folk as I shall tell thee now Thither go these same old priests and halt old men and maimed who all day and night cower continually before the altars and in these old crypts and such folks as wear old amices and old clouted frocks and naked folks and shoeless and those covered with sores who perish of hunger and thirst and of cold and of wretchedness These be they that go into Paradise with them have I naught to make But into Hell would I fain go for into Hell fare the goodly clerks and goodly knights that fall in tourneys and great wars and stout men at arms and the free men With these would I liefly go And thither pass the sweet ladies and courteous that have two lovers or three and their lords also thereto Thither goes the gold and the silver and fur of vair and fur of gris and there too go the harpers and minstrels and the kings of this world With these I would gladly go let me but have with me Nicolette my sweetest lady AUCASSIN CAPTURES COUNT BOUGART The damoiseau was tall and strong and the horse whereon he sat was right eager And he laid hand to sword and fell a smiting to right and left and smote through helm and nasal and arm and clenched hand making a murder about him like a wild boar when hounds fall on him in the forest even till he struck down ten knights and seven he hurt and straightway he hurled out of the press and rode back again at full speed sword in hand Count Bougart of Valence heard it said that they were to hang Aucassin his enemy so he came into that place and Aucassin was ware of him He gat his sword into his hand and struck at his helm with such a stroke that it drave it down on his head and he being stunned fell groveling And Aucassin laid hands on him and caught him by the nasal of his helmet and gave him up to his father Father quoth Aucassin lo here is your mortal foe who hath so warred on you and done you such evil Full twenty months did this war endure and might not be ended by man Fair son said his father thy feats of youth shouldst them do and not seek after folly Father saith Aucassin sermon me no sermons but fulfill my covenant Ha what covenant fair son What father hast thou forgotten it By mine own head whosoever forgets will I not forget it so much it hath me at heart Didst thou not covenant with me when I took up arms and went into the stour that if God brought me back safe and sound thou wouldst let me see Nicolette my sweet lady even so long that I may have of her two words or three and one kiss So didst thou covenant and my mind is that thou keep thy word I quoth the father God forsake me when I keep this covenant Nay if she were here I would have burned her in the fire and thou thyself shouldst be sore adread THE LOVERS MEETING Aucassin was cast into prison as ye have heard tell and Nicolette of her part was in the chamber Now it was summer time the month of May when days are warm and long and clear and the nights still and serene Nicolette lay one night on her bed and saw the moon shine clear through a window and heard the nightingale sing in the garden and she minded her of Aucassin her friend whom she loved so well Then fell she to thoughts of Count Garin of Beaucaire that he hated her to death and therefore deemed she that there she would no longer abide for that if she were told of and the Count knew where she lay an ill death he would make her die She saw that the old woman was sleeping who held her company Then she arose and clad her in a mantle of silk she had by her very goodly and took sheets of the bed and towels and knotted one to the other and made therewith a cord as long as she might and knotted it to a pillar in the window and let herself slip down into the garden then caught up her raiment in both hands behind and before and kilted up her kirtle because of the dew that she saw lying deep on the grass and so went on her way down through the garden Her locks were yellow and curled her eyes blue gray and smiling her face featly fashioned the nose high and fairly set the lips more red than cherry or rose in time of summer her teeth white and small and her breasts so firm that they bore up the folds of her bodice as they had been two walnuts so slim was she in the waist that your two hands might have clipped her and the daisy flowers that brake beneath her as she went tiptoe and that bent above her instep seemed black against her feet and ankles so white was the maiden She came to the postern gate and unbarred it and went out through the streets of Beaucaire keeping always on the shadowy side for the moon was shining right clear and so wandered she till she came to the tower where her lover lay The tower was flanked with pillars and she cowered under one of them wrapped in her mantle Then thrust she her head through a crevice of the tower that was old and worn and heard Aucassin who was weeping within and making dole and lament for the sweet friend he loved so well And when she had listened to him some time she began to say Here one singeth Nicolette the bright of brow On a pillar leaned now All Aucassin s wail did hear For his love that was so dear Then the maid spake low and clear Gentle knight withouten fear Little good befalleth thee Little help of sigh or tear Ne er shalt thou have joy of me Never shalt thou win me still Am I held in evil will Of thy father and thy kin Therefore must I cross the sea And another land must win Then she cut her curls of gold Cast them in the dungeon hold Aucassin doth clasp them there Kiss th the curls that were so fair Them doth in his bosom bear Then he wept e en as of old All for his love Thus say they speak they tell they The Tale When Aucassin heard Nicolette say that she would pass into a far country he was all in wrath Fair sweet friend quoth he thou shalt not go for then wouldst thou be my death And the first man that saw thee and had the might withal would take thee straightway into his bed to be his leman And once thou earnest into a man s bed and that bed not mine wit ye well that I would not tarry till I had found a knife to pierce my heart and slay myself Nay verily wait so long I would not but would hurl myself so far as I might see a wall or a black stone and I would dash my head against it so mightily that the eyes would start and my brain burst Rather would I die even such a death than know that thou hadst lain in a man s bed and that bed not mine Aucassin she said I trow thou lovest me not as much as thou sayest but I love thee more than thou lovest me Ah fair sweet friend said Aucassin it may not be that thou shouldest love me even as I love thee Woman may not love man as man loves woman for a woman s love lies in her eye and the bud of her breast and her foot s tiptoe but the love of a man is in his heart planted whence it can never issue forth and pass away Now when Aucassin and Nicolette were holding this parley together the town s watchmen were coming down a street with swords drawn beneath their cloaks for Count Garin had charged them that if they could take her they should slay her But the sentinel that was on the tower saw them coming and heard them speaking of Nicolette as they went and threatening to slay her God quoth he this were great pity to slay so fair a maid Right great charity it were if I could say aught to her and they perceive it not and she should be on her guard against them for if they slay her then were Aucassin my damoiseau dead and that were great pity Here one singeth Valiant was the sentinel Courteous kind and practiced well So a song did sing and tell Of the peril that befell Maiden fair that lingerest here Gentle maid of merry cheer Hair of gold and eyes as clear As the water in a mere Thou meseems hast spoken word To thy lover and thy lord That would die for thee his dear Now beware the ill accord Of the cloaked men of the sword These have sworn and keep their word They will put thee to the sword Save thou take heed NICOLETTE BUILDS HER LODGE Nicolette the bright of brow From the shepherds doth she pass All below the blossomed bough Where an ancient way there was Overgrown and choked with grass Till she found the cross roads where Seven paths do all way fare Then she deemeth she will try Should her lover pass thereby If he love her loyally So she gathered white lilies Oak leaf that in greenwood is Leaves of many a branch iwis Therewith built a lodge of green Goodlier was never seen Swore by God who may not lie If my love the lodge should spy He will rest a while thereby If he love me loyally Thus his faith she deemed to try Or I love him not not I Nor he loves me AUCASSIN SEEKING NICOLETTE COMES UPON A COWHERD Aucassin fared through the forest from path to path after Nicolette and his horse bare him furiously Think ye not that the thorns him spared nor the briars nay not so but tare his raiment that scarce a knot might be tied with the soundest part thereof and the blood spurted from his arms and flanks and legs in forty places or thirty so that behind the Childe men might follow on the track of his blood in the grass But so much he went in thoughts of Nicolette his lady sweet that he felt no pain nor torment and all the day hurled through the forest in this fashion nor heard no word of her And when he saw vespers draw nigh he began to weep for that he found her not All down an old road and grass grown he fared when anon looking along the way before him he saw such an one as I shall tell you Tall was he and great of growth ugly and hideous his head huge and blacker than charcoal and more than the breadth of a hand between his two eyes and he had great cheeks and a big nose and flat big nostrils and wide and thick lips redder than steak and great teeth yellow and ugly and he was shod with hosen and shoon of ox hide bound with cords of bark up over the knee and all about him a great cloak two fold and he leaned upon a grievous cudgel and Aucassin came unto him and was afraid when he beheld him AUCASSIN FINDS NICOLETTE S LODGE So they parted from each other and Aucassin rode on the night was fair and still and so long he went that he came to the lodge of boughs that Nicolette had builded and woven within and without over and under with flowers and it was the fairest lodge that might be seen When Aucassin was ware of it he stopped suddenly and the light of the moon fell therein Forsooth quoth Aucassin here was Nicolette my sweet lady and this lodge builded she with her fair hands For the sweetness of it and for love of her will I now alight and rest here this night long He drew forth his foot from the stirrup to alight and the steed was great and tall He dreamed so much on Nicolette his right sweet friend that he fell heavily upon a stone and drave his shoulder out of its place Then knew he that he was hurt sore nathless he bore him with that force he might and fastened his horse with the other hand to a thorn Then turned he on his side and crept backwise into the lodge of boughs And he looked through a gap in the lodge and saw the stars in heaven and one that was brighter than the rest so began he to say Here one singeth Star that I from far behold Star the moon calls to her fold Nicolette with thee doth dwell My sweet love with locks of gold God would have her dwell afar Dwell with him for evening star Would to God whate er befell Would that with her I might dwell I would clip her close and strait Nay were I of much estate Some king s son desirable Worthy she to be my mate Me to kiss and clip me well Sister sweet friend So speak they say they tell they The Tale When Nicolette heard Aucassin she came to him for she was not far away She passed within the lodge and threw her arms about his neck clipped him and kissed him Fair sweet friend welcome be thou And thou fair sweet love be thou welcome So either kissed and clipped the other and fair joy was them between Ha sweet love quoth Aucassin but now was I sore hurt and my shoulder wried but I take no heed of it nor have no hurt therefrom since I have thee Right so felt she his shoulder and found it was wried from its place And she so handled it with her white hands and so wrought in her surgery that by God s will who loveth lovers it went back into its place Then took she flowers and fresh grass and leaves green and bound them on the hurt with a strip of her smock and he was all healed NICOLETTE SAILS TO CARTHAGE When all they of the court heard her speak thus that she was daughter to the king of Carthage they knew well that she spake truly so made they great joy of her and led her to the castle with great honor as a king s daughter And they would have given her to her lord a king of Paynim but she had no mind to marry There dwelt she three days or four And she considered by what device she might seek far Aucassin Then she got her a viol and learned to play on it till they would have married her one day to a rich king of Paynim and she stole forth by night and came to the seaport and dwelt with a poor woman thereby Then took she a certain herb and therewith smeared her head and her face till she was all brown and stained And she had a coat and mantle and smock and breeches made and attired herself as if she had been a minstrel So took she the viol and went to a mariner and so wrought on him that he took her aboard his vessel Then hoisted they sail and fared on the high seas even till they came to the land of Provence And Nicolette went forth and took the viol and went playing through all the country even till she came to the castle of Beaucaire where Aucassin was Here singeth one At Beaucaire below the tower Sat Aucassin on an hour Heard the bird and watched the flower With his barons him beside Then came on him in that tide The sweet influence of love And the memory thereof Thought of Nicolette the fair And the dainty face of her He had loved so many years Then was he in dule and tears Even then came Nicolette On the stair a foot she set And she drew the viol bow O er the strings and chanted so Listen lords and knights to me Lords of high or low degree To my story list will ye All of Aucassin and her That was Nicolette the fair And their love was long to tell Deep woods through he sought her well Paynims took them on a day In Torelore and bound they lay Of Aucassin naught know we But fair Nicolette the free Now in Carthage doth she dwell There her father loves her well Who is king of that countrie Her a husband hath he found Paynim lord that serves Mahound Ne er with him the maid will go For she loves a damoiseau Aucassin that ye may know Swears to God that never mo With a lover will she go Save with him she loveth

have been a preparation and which certainly surpasses in interest every other ornithological publication For fifteen years before he thought of making use of his collections in this way he annually went alone with his gun and his drawing materials into deep and unexplored forests and through wild regions of country making long journeys on foot and counting nothing a hardship that added to his specimens This passion had controlled him from early childhood His father a Frenchman was living in New Orleans at the time of Audubon s birth in seventeen eighty and with the view of helping him in his studies sent him to Paris when he was fifteen years old where he entered the drawing class of David the painter He remained there two years and it was after his return that he made his memorable excursions his home being then a farm at Mill Grove near Philadelphia In eighteen oh eight he removed with his family to the West still continuing his researches Several years later he returned to Philadelphia with a portfolio of nearly a thousand colored drawings of birds What befell them a parallel to so many like incidents as through Warburton s cook Newton s dog Carlyle s friend and Edward Livingston s fire that they seem one of the appointed tests of moral fibre is best told in Audubon s own language An accident he says which happened to two hundred of my original drawings nearly put a stop to my researches in ornithology I shall relate it merely to show how far enthusiasm for by no other name can I call my perseverance may enable the preserver of nature to surmount the most disheartening difficulties I left the village of Henderson in Kentucky situated on the banks of the Ohio where I resided for several years to proceed to Philadelphia on business I looked to my drawings before my departure placed them carefully in a wooden box and gave them in charge of a relative with injunctions to see that no injury should happen to them My absence was of several months and when I returned after having enjoyed the pleasures of home for a few days I inquired after my box and what I was pleased to call my treasure The box was produced and opened but reader feel for me a pair of Norway rats had taken possession of the whole and reared a young family among the gnawed bits of paper which but a month previous represented nearly a thousand inhabitants of air The burning heat which instantly rushed through my brain was too great to be endured without affecting my whole nervous system I slept not for several nights and the days passed like days of oblivion until the animal powers being recalled into action through the strength of my constitution I took up my gun my note book and my pencils and went forth to the woods as gayly as if nothing had happened I felt pleased that I might now make better drawings than before and ere a period not exceeding three years had elapsed my portfolio was again filled Illustration J J AUDUBON In eighteen twenty six he sailed for Europe to exhibit his newly collected treasures to foreign ornithologists He succeeded in obtaining pecuniary aid in publishing the work and plates were made in England The book was published in New York in four volumes elephant folio in eighteen thirty thirty nine The birds are life size The American Ornithological Biography which is the text for the plates was published in Edinburgh eighteen thirty one thirty nine in five octavo volumes Accompanied by his two sons he started on new excursions which resulted in The Quadrupeds of America with a Biography of American Quadrupeds both published at Philadelphia beginning in eighteen forty During that year he built a house for himself in the upper part of New York in what is now called Audubon Park and died there January twenty seventh eighteen fifty one Audubon s descriptive text is not unworthy of his plates his works are far from being mere tenders to picture books He is full of enthusiasm his descriptions of birds and animals are vivid and realizing and his adventures are told with much spirit and considerable literary skill though some carelessness of syntax A DANGEROUS ADVENTURE From The American Ornithological Biography On my return from the Upper Mississippi I found myself obliged to cross one of the wide prairies which in that portion of the United States vary the appearance of the country The weather was fine all around me was as fresh and blooming as if it had just issued from the bosom of nature My knapsack my gun and my dog were all I had for baggage and company But although well moccasined I moved slowly along attracted by the brilliancy of the flowers and the gambols of the fawns around their dams to all appearance as thoughtless of danger as I felt myself My march was of long duration I saw the sun sinking beneath the horizon long before I could perceive any appearance of woodland and nothing in the shape of man had I met with that day The track which I followed was only an old Indian trace and as darkness overshadowed the prairie I felt some desire to reach at least a copse in which I might lie down to rest The night hawks were skimming over and around me attracted by the buzzing wings of the beetles which formed their food and the distant howling of wolves gave me some hope that I should soon arrive at the skirts of some woodland I did so and almost at the same instant a fire light attracting my eye I moved toward it full of confidence that it proceeded from the camp of some wandering Indians I was mistaken I discovered by its glare that it was from the hearth of a small log cabin and that a tall figure passed and repassed between it and me as if busily engaged in household arrangements I reached the spot and presenting myself at the door asked the tall figure which proved to be a woman if I might take shelter under her roof for the night Her voice was gruff and her attire negligently thrown about her She answered in the affirmative I walked in took a wooden stool and quietly seated myself by the fire The next object that attracted my notice was a finely formed young Indian resting his head between his hands with his elbows on his knees A long bow rested against the log wall near him while a quantity of arrows and two or three raccoon skins lay at his feet He moved not he apparently breathed not Accustomed to the habits of the Indians and knowing that they pay little attention to the approach of civilized strangers a circumstance which in some countries is considered as evincing the apathy of their character I addressed him in French a language not unfrequently partially known to the people in that neighborhood He raised his head pointed to one of his eyes with his finger and gave me a significant glance with the other His face was covered with blood The fact was that an hour before this as he was in the act of discharging an arrow at a raccoon in the top of a tree the arrow had split upon the cord and sprung back with such violence into his right eye as to destroy it forever Feeling hungry I inquired what sort of fare I might expect Such a thing as a bed was not to be seen but many large untanned bear and buffalo hides lay piled in a corner I drew a fine timepiece from my breast and told the woman that it was late and that I was fatigued She had espied my watch the richness of which seemed to operate upon her feelings with electric quickness She told me that there was plenty of venison and jerked buffalo meat and that on removing the ashes I should find a cake But my watch had struck her fancy and her curiosity had to be gratified by an immediate sight of it I took off the gold chain that secured it from around my neck and presented it to her She was all ecstasy spoke of its beauty asked me its value and put the chain round her brawny neck saying how happy the possession of such a watch should make her Thoughtless and as I fancied myself in so retired a spot secure I paid little attention to her talk or her movements I helped my dog to a good supper of venison and was not long in satisfying the demands of my own appetite The Indian rose from his seat as if in extreme suffering He passed me and repassed me several times and once pinched me on the side so violently that the pain nearly brought forth an exclamation of anger I looked at him His eye met mine but his look was so forbidding that it struck a chill into the more nervous part of my system He again seated himself drew his butcher knife from its greasy scabbard examined its edge as I would do that of a razor suspected dull replaced it and again taking his tomahawk from his back filled the pipe of it with tobacco and sent me expressive glances whenever our hostess chanced to have her back towards us Never until that moment had my senses been awakened to the danger which I now suspected to be about me I returned glance for glance to my companion and rested well assured that whatever enemies I might have he was not of their number I asked the woman for my watch wound it up and under pretense of wishing to see how the weather might probably be on the morrow took up my gun and walked out of the cabin I slipped a ball into each barrel scraped the edges of my flints renewed the primings and returning to the hut gave a favorable account of my observations I took a few bear skins made a pallet of them and calling my faithful dog to my side lay down with my gun close to my body and in a few minutes was to all appearance fast asleep A short time had elapsed when some voices were heard and from the corner of my eyes I saw two athletic youths making their entrance bearing a dead stag on a pole They disposed of their burden and asking for whisky helped themselves freely to it Observing me and the wounded Indian they asked who I was and why the devil that rascal meaning the Indian who they knew understood not a word of English was in the house The mother for so she proved to be bade them speak less loudly made mention of my watch and took them to a corner where a conversation took place the purport of which it required little shrewdness in me to guess I tapped my dog gently He moved his tail and with indescribable pleasure I saw his fine eyes alternately fixed on me and raised toward the trio in the corner I felt that he perceived danger in my situation The Indian exchanged a last glance with me The lads had eaten and drunk themselves into such condition that I already looked upon them as hors tie combat and the frequent visits of the whisky bottle to the ugly mouth of their dam I hoped would soon reduce her to a like state Judge of my astonishment reader when I saw this incarnate fiend take a large carving knife and go to the grindstone to whet its edge I saw her pour the water on the turning machine and watched her working away with the dangerous instrument until the cold sweat covered every part of my body in spite of my determination to defend myself to the last Her task finished she walked to her reeling sons and said There that ll soon settle him Boys kill yon and then for the watch I turned cocked my gunlocks silently touched my faithful companion and lay ready to start up and shoot the first one who might attempt my life The moment was fast approaching and that night might have been my last in the world had not Providence made preparations for my rescue All was ready The infernal hag was advancing slowly probably contemplating the best way of dispatching me while her sons should be engaged with the Indian I was several times on the point of rising and shooting her on the spot but she was not to be punished thus The door was suddenly opened and there entered two stout travelers each with a long rifle on his shoulder I bounced up on my feet and making them most heartily welcome told them how well it was for me that they should have arrived at that moment The tale was told in a minute The drunken sons were secured and the woman in spite of her defense and vociferations shared the same fate The Indian fairly danced with joy and gave us to understand that as he could not sleep for pain he would watch over us You may suppose we slept much less than we talked The two strangers gave me an account of their once having been themselves in a somewhat similar situation Day came fair and rosy and with it the punishment of our captives They were now quite sobered Their feet were unbound but their arms were still securely tied We marched them into the woods off the road and having used them as Regulators were wont to use such delinquents we set fire to the cabin gave all the skins and implements to the young Indian warrior and proceeded well pleased towards the settlements During upward of twenty five years when my wanderings extended to all parts of our country this was the only time at which my life was in danger from my fellow creatures Indeed so little risk do travelers run in the United States that no one born there ever dreams of any to be encountered on the road and I can only account for this occurrence by supposing that the inhabitants of the cabin were not Americans Will you believe good natured reader that not many miles from the place where this adventure happened and where fifteen years ago no habitation belonging to civilized man was expected and very few ever seen large roads are now laid out cultivation has converted the woods into fertile fields taverns have been erected and much of what we Americans call comfort is to be met with So fast does improvement proceed in our abundant and free

kindness Their whole life gradually becomes interwoven with our own Walpurga became oblivious of herself and of all that was dear to her in the cottage by the lake She was now needed here where a young life had been assigned to her loving charge She looked up at Mademoiselle Kramer with beaming eyes and met a joyful glance in return It seems to me said Walpurga that a palace is just like a church One has only good and pious thoughts here and all the people are so kind and frank Mademoiselle Kramer suddenly smiled and replied My dear child Don t call me child I m not a child I m a mother But here in the great world you are only a child A court is a strange place Some go hunting others go fishing one builds another paints one studies a role another a piece of music a dancer learns a new step an author writes a new book Every one in the land is doing something cooking or baking drilling or practicing writing painting or dancing simply in order that the king and queen may be entertained I understand you said Walpurga and Mademoiselle Kramer continued My family has been in the service of the court for sixteen generations six would have been the right number but sixteen sounded so much better my father is the governor of the summer palace and I was born there I know all about the court and can teach you a great deal And I ll be glad to learn interposed Walpurga End
