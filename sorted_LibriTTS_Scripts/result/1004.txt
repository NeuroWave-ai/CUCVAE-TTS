text courtesy ILT s Digital Dante Project INFERNO Inferno Canto I Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself within a forest dark For the straightforward pathway had been lost Ah me how hard a thing it is to say What was this forest savage rough and stern Which in the very thought renews the fear So bitter is it death is little more But of the good to treat which there I found Speak will I of the other things I saw there I cannot well repeat how there I entered So full was I of slumber at the moment In which I had abandoned the true way But after I had reached a mountain s foot At that point where the valley terminated Which had with consternation pierced my heart Upward I looked and I beheld its shoulders Vested already with that planet s rays Which leadeth others right by every road Then was the fear a little quieted That in my heart s lake had endured throughout The night which I had passed so piteously And even as he who with distressful breath Forth issued from the sea upon the shore Turns to the water perilous and gazes So did my soul that still was fleeing onward Turn itself back to re behold the pass Which never yet a living person left After my weary body I had rested The way resumed I on the desert slope So that the firm foot ever was the lower And lo almost where the ascent began A panther light and swift exceedingly Which with a spotted skin was covered o er And never moved she from before my face Nay rather did impede so much my way That many times I to return had turned The time was the beginning of the morning And up the sun was mounting with those stars That with him were what time the Love Divine At first in motion set those beauteous things So were to me occasion of good hope The variegated skin of that wild beast The hour of time and the delicious season But not so much that did not give me fear A lion s aspect which appeared to me He seemed as if against me he were coming With head uplifted and with ravenous hunger So that it seemed the air was afraid of him And a she wolf that with all hungerings Seemed to be laden in her meagreness And many folk has caused to live forlorn She brought upon me so much heaviness With the affright that from her aspect came That I the hope relinquished of the height And as he is who willingly acquires And the time comes that causes him to lose Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent E en such made me that beast withouten peace Which coming on against me by degrees Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent While I was rushing downward to the lowland Before mine eyes did one present himself Who seemed from long continued silence hoarse When I beheld him in the desert vast Have pity on me unto him I cried Whiche er thou art or shade or real man He answered me Not man man once I was And both my parents were of Lombardy And Mantuans by country both of them Sub Julio was I born though it was late And lived at Rome under the good Augustus During the time of false and lying gods A poet was I and I sang that just Son of Anchises who came forth from Troy After that Ilion the superb was burned But thou why goest thou back to such annoyance Why climb saint thou not the Mount Delectable Which is the source and cause of every joy Now art thou that Virgilius and that fountain Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech I made response to him with bashful forehead O of the other poets honour and light Avail me the long study and great love That have impelled me to explore thy volume Thou art my master and my author thou Thou art alone the one from whom I took The beautiful style that has done honour to me Behold the beast for which I have turned back Do thou protect me from her famous Sage For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble Thee it behoves to take another road Responded he when he beheld me weeping If from this savage place thou wouldst escape Because this beast at which thou criest out Suffers not any one to pass her way But so doth harass him that she destroys him And has a nature so malign and ruthless That never doth she glut her greedy will And after food is hungrier than before Many the animals with whom she weds And more they shall be still until the Greyhound Comes who shall make her perish in her pain He shall not feed on either earth or pelf But upon wisdom and on love and virtue Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour On whose account the maid Camilla died Euryalus Turnus Nisus of their wounds Through every city shall he hunt her down Until he shall have driven her back to Hell There from whence envy first did let her loose Therefore I think and judge it for thy best Thou follow me and I will be thy guide And lead thee hence through the eternal place Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate Who cry out each one for the second death And thou shalt see those who contented are Within the fire because they hope to come Whene er it may be to the blessed people To whom then if thou wishest to ascend A soul shall be for that than I more worthy With her at my departure I will leave thee Because that Emperor who reigns above In that I was rebellious to his law Wills that through me none come into his city He governs everywhere and there he reigns There is his city and his lofty throne O happy he whom thereto he elects And I to him Poet I thee entreat By that same God whom thou didst never know So that I may escape this woe and worse Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said That I may see the portal of Saint Peter And those thou makest so disconsolate Then he moved on and I behind him followed Inferno Canto II Day was departing and the embrowned air Released the animals that are on earth From their fatigues and I the only one Made myself ready to sustain the war Both of the way and likewise of the woe Which memory that errs not shall retrace O Muses O high genius now assist me O memory that didst write down what I saw Here thy nobility shall be manifest And I began Poet who guidest me Regard my manhood if it be sufficient Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me Thou sayest that of Silvius the parent While yet corruptible unto the world Immortal went and was there bodily But if the adversary of all evil Was courteous thinking of the high effect That issue would from him and who and what To men of intellect unmeet it seems not For he was of great Rome and of her empire In the empyreal heaven as father chosen The which and what wishing to speak the truth Were stablished as the holy place wherein Sits the successor of the greatest Peter Upon this journey whence thou givest him vaunt Things did he hear which the occasion were Both of his victory and the papal mantle Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith Which of salvation s way is the beginning But I why thither come or who concedes it I not Aeneas am I am not Paul Nor I nor others think me worthy of it Therefore if I resign myself to come I fear the coming may be ill advised Thou rt wise and knowest better than I speak And as he is who unwills what he willed And by new thoughts doth his intention change So that from his design he quite withdraws Such I became upon that dark hillside Because in thinking I consumed the emprise Which was so very prompt in the beginning If I have well thy language understood Replied that shade of the Magnanimous Thy soul attainted is with cowardice Which many times a man encumbers so It turns him back from honoured enterprise As false sight doth a beast when he is shy That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension I ll tell thee why I came and what I heard At the first moment when I grieved for thee Among those was I who are in suspense And a fair saintly Lady called to me In such wise I besought her to command me Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star And she began to say gentle and low With voice angelical in her own language O spirit courteous of Mantua Of whom the fame still in the world endures And shall endure long lasting as the world A friend of mine and not the friend of fortune Upon the desert slope is so impeded Upon his way that he has turned through terror And may I fear already be so lost That I too late have risen to his succour From that which I have heard of him in Heaven Bestir thee now and with thy speech ornate And with what needful is for his release Assist him so that I may be consoled Beatrice am I who do bid thee go I come from there where I would fain return Love moved me which compelleth me to speak When I shall be in presence of my Lord Full often will I praise thee unto him Then paused she and thereafter I began O Lady of virtue thou alone through whom The human race exceedeth all contained Within the heaven that has the lesser circles So grateful unto me is thy commandment To obey if twere already done were late No farther need saint thou ope to me thy wish But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun The here descending down into this centre From the vast place thou burnest to return to Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern Briefly will I relate she answered me Why I am not afraid to enter here Of those things only should one be afraid Which have the power of doing others harm Of the rest no because they are not fearful God in his mercy such created me That misery of yours attains me not Nor any flame assails me of this burning A gentle Lady is in Heaven who grieves At this impediment to which I send thee So that stern judgment there above is broken In her entreaty she besought Lucia And said Thy faithful one now stands in need Of thee and unto thee I recommend him Lucia foe of all that cruel is Hastened away and came unto the place Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel Beatrice said she the true praise of God Why succourest thou not him who loved thee so For thee he issued from the vulgar herd Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint Dost thou not see the death that combats him Beside that flood where ocean has no vaunt Never were persons in the world so swift To work their weal and to escape their woe As I after such words as these were uttered Came hither downward from my blessed seat Confiding in thy dignified discourse Which honours thee and those who ve listened to it After she thus had spoken unto me Weeping her shining eyes she turned away Whereby she made me swifter in my coming And unto thee I came as she desired I have delivered thee from that wild beast Which barred the beautiful mountain s short ascent What is it then Why why dost thou delay Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart Daring and hardihood why hast thou not Seeing that three such Ladies benedight Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven And so much good my speech doth promise thee Even as the flowerets by nocturnal chill Bowed down and closed when the sun whitens them Uplift themselves all open on their stems Such I became with my exhausted strength And such good courage to my heart there coursed That I began like an intrepid person O she compassionate who succoured me And courteous thou who hast obeyed so soon The words of truth which she addressed to thee Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed To the adventure with these words of thine That to my first intent I have returned Now go for one sole will is in us both Thou Leader and thou Lord and Master thou Thus said I to him and when he had moved I entered on the deep and savage way Inferno Canto III Through me the way is to the city dolent Through me the way is to eternal dole Through me the way among the people lost Justice incited my sublime Creator Created me divine Omnipotence The highest Wisdom and the primal Love Before me there were no created things Only eterne and I eternal last All hope abandon ye who enter in These words in sombre colour I beheld Written upon the summit of a gate Whence I Their sense is Master hard to me And he to me as one experienced Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned All cowardice must needs be here extinct We to the place have come where I have told thee Thou shalt behold the people dolorous Who have foregone the good of intellect And after he had laid his hand on mine With joyful mien whence I was comforted He led me in among the secret things There sighs complaints and ululations loud Resounded through the air without a star Whence I at the beginning wept thereat Languages diverse horrible dialects Accents of anger words of agony And voices high and hoarse with sound of hands Made up a tumult that goes whirling on For ever in that air for ever black Even as the sand doth when the whirlwind breathes And I who had my head with horror bound Said Master what is this which now I hear What folk is this which seems by pain so vanquished And he to me This miserable mode Maintain the melancholy souls of those Who lived withouten infamy or praise Commingled are they with that caitiff choir Of Angels who have not rebellious been Nor faithful were to God but were for self The heavens expelled them not to be less fair Nor them the nethermore abyss receives For glory none the damned would have from them And I O Master what so grievous is To these that maketh them lament so sore He answered I will tell thee very briefly These have no longer any hope of death And this blind life of theirs is so debased They envious are of every other fate No fame of them the world permits to be Misericord and Justice both disdain them Let us not speak of them but look and pass And I who looked again beheld a banner Which whirling round ran on so rapidly That of all pause it seemed to me indignant And after it there came so long a train Of people that I ne er would have believed That ever Death so many had undone When some among them I had recognised I looked and I beheld the shade of him Who made through cowardice the great refusal Forthwith I comprehended and was certain That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches Hateful to God and to his enemies These miscreants who never were alive Were naked and were stung exceedingly By gadflies and by hornets that were there These did their faces irrigate with blood Which with their tears commingled at their feet By the disgusting worms was gathered up And when to gazing farther I betook me People I saw on a great river s bank Whence said I Master now vouchsafe to me That I may know who these are and what law Makes them appear so ready to pass over As I discern athwart the dusky light And he to me These things shall all be known To thee as soon as we our footsteps stay Upon the dismal shore of Acheron Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast Fearing my words might irksome be to him From speech refrained I till we reached the river And lo towards us coming in a boat An old man hoary with the hair of eld Crying Woe unto you ye souls depraved Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens I come to lead you to the other shore To the eternal shades in heat and frost And thou that yonder standest living soul Withdraw thee from these people who are dead But when he saw that I did not withdraw He said By other ways by other ports Thou to the shore shalt come not here for passage A lighter vessel needs must carry thee And unto him the Guide Vex thee not Charon It is so willed there where is power to do That which is willed and farther question not Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks Of him the ferryman of the livid fen Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame But all those souls who weary were and naked Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together As soon as they had heard those cruel words God they blasphemed and their progenitors The human race the place the time the seed Of their engendering and of their birth Thereafter all together they drew back Bitterly weeping to the accursed shore Which waiteth every man who fears not God Charon the demon with the eyes of glede Beckoning to them collects them all together Beats with his oar whoever lags behind As in the autumn time the leaves fall off First one and then another till the branch Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils In similar wise the evil seed of Adam Throw themselves from that margin one by one At signals as a bird unto its lure So they depart across the dusky wave And ere upon the other side they land Again on this side a new troop assembles My son the courteous Master said to me All those who perish in the wrath of God Here meet together out of every land And ready are they to pass o er the river Because celestial Justice spurs them on So that their fear is turned into desire This way there never passes a good soul And hence if Charon doth complain of thee Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports This being finished all the dusk champaign Trembled so violently that of that terror The recollection bathes me still with sweat The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind And fulminated a vermilion light Which overmastered in me every sense And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell Inferno Canto IV Broke the deep lethargy within my head A heavy thunder so that I upstarted Like to a person who by force is wakened And round about I moved my rested eyes Uprisen erect and steadfastly I gazed To recognise the place wherein I was True is it that upon the verge I found me Of the abysmal valley dolorous That gathers thunder of infinite ululations Obscure profound it was and nebulous So that by fixing on its depths my sight Nothing whatever I discerned therein Let us descend now into the blind world Began the Poet pallid utterly I will be first and thou shalt second be And I who of his colour was aware Said How shall I come if thou art afraid Who rt wont to be a comfort to my fears And he to me The anguish of the people Who are below here in my face depicts That pity which for terror thou hast taken Let us go on for the long way impels us Thus he went in and thus he made me enter The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss There as it seemed to me from listening Were lamentations none but only sighs That tremble made the everlasting air And this arose from sorrow without torment Which the crowds had that many were and great Of infants and of women and of men To me the Master good Thou dost not ask What spirits these which thou beholdest are Now will I have thee know ere thou go farther That they sinned not and if they merit had Tis not enough because they had not baptism Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest And if they were before Christianity In the right manner they adored not God And among such as these am I myself For such defects and not for other guilt Lost are we and are only so far punished That without hope we live on in desire Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard Because some people of much worthiness I knew who in that Limbo were suspended Tell me my Master tell me thou my Lord Began I with desire of being certain Of that Faith which o ercometh every error Came any one by his own merit hence Or by another s who was blessed thereafter And he who understood my covert speech Replied I was a novice in this state When I saw hither come a Mighty One With sign of victory incoronate Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent And that of his son Abel and of Noah Of Moses the lawgiver and the obedient Abraham patriarch and David king Israel with his father and his children And Rachel for whose sake he did so much And others many and he made them blessed And thou must know that earlier than these Never were any human spirits saved We ceased not to advance because he spake But still were passing onward through the forest The forest say I of thick crowded ghosts Not very far as yet our way had gone This side the summit when I saw a fire That overcame a hemisphere of darkness We were a little distant from it still But not so far that I in part discerned not That honourable people held that place O thou who honourest every art and science Who may these be which such great honour have That from the fashion of the rest it parts them And he to me The honourable name That sounds of them above there in thy life Wins grace in Heaven that so advances them In the mean time a voice was heard by me All honour be to the pre eminent Poet His shade returns again that was departed After the voice had ceased and quiet was Four mighty shades I saw approaching us Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad To say to me began my gracious Master Him with that falchion in his hand behold Who comes before the three even as their lord That one is Homer Poet sovereign He who comes next is Horace the satirist The third is Ovid and the last is Lucan Because to each of these with me applies The name that solitary voice proclaimed They do me honour and in that do well Thus I beheld assemble the fair school Of that lord of the song pre eminent Who o er the others like an eagle soars When they together had discoursed somewhat They turned to me with signs of salutation And on beholding this my Master smiled And more of honour still much more they did me In that they made me one of their own band So that the sixth was I mid so much wit Thus we went on as far as to the light Things saying tis becoming to keep silent As was the saying of them where I was We came unto a noble castle s foot Seven times encompassed with lofty walls Defended round by a fair rivulet This we passed over even as firm ground Through portals seven I entered with these Sages We came into a meadow of fresh verdure People were there with solemn eyes and slow Of great authority in their countenance They spake but seldom and with gentle voices Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side Into an opening luminous and lofty So that they all of them were visible There opposite upon the green enamel Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted I saw Electra with companions many Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes I saw Camilla and Penthesilea On the other side and saw the King Latinus Who with Lavinia his daughter sat I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth Lucretia Julia Marcia and Cornelia And saw alone apart the Saladin When I had lifted up my brows a little The Master I beheld of those who know Sit with his philosophic family All gaze upon him and all do him honour There I beheld both Socrates and Plato Who nearer him before the others stand Democritus who puts the world on chance Diogenes Anaxagoras and Thales Zeno Empedocles and Heraclitus Of qualities I saw the good collector Hight Dioscorides and Orpheus saw I Tully and Livy and moral Seneca Euclid geometrician and Ptolemy Galen Hippocrates and Avicenna Averroes who the great Comment made I cannot all of them pourtray in full Because so drives me onward the long theme That many times the word comes short of fact The sixfold company in two divides Another way my sapient Guide conducts me Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles And to a place I come where nothing shines Inferno Canto V Thus I descended out of the first circle Down to the second that less space begirds And so much greater dole that goads to wailing There standeth Minos horribly and snarls Examines the transgressions at the entrance Judges and sends according as he girds him I say that when the spirit evil born Cometh before him wholly it confesses And this discriminator of transgressions Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it Girds himself with his tail as many times As grades he wishes it should be thrust down Always before him many of them stand They go by turns each one unto the judgment They speak and hear and then are downward hurled O thou that to this dolorous hostelry Comest said Minos to me when he saw me Leaving the practice of so great an office Look how thou enterest and in whom thou trustest Let not the portal s amplitude deceive thee And unto him my Guide Why criest thou too Do not impede his journey fate ordained It is so willed there where is power to do That which is willed and ask no further question And now begin the dolesome notes to grow Audible unto me now am I come There where much lamentation strikes upon me I came into a place mute of all light Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest If by opposing winds t is combated The infernal hurricane that never rests Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine Whirling them round and smiting it molests them When they arrive before the precipice There are the shrieks the plaints and the laments There they blaspheme the puissance divine I understood that unto such a torment The carnal malefactors were condemned Who reason subjugate to appetite And as the wings of starlings bear them on In the cold season in large band and full So doth that blast the spirits maledict It hither thither downward upward drives them No hope doth comfort them for evermore Not of repose but even of lesser pain And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays Making in air a long line of themselves So saw I coming uttering lamentations Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress Whereupon said I Master who are those People whom the black air so castigates The first of those of whom intelligence Thou fain wouldst have then said he unto me The empress was of many languages To sensual vices she was so abandoned That lustful she made licit in her law To remove the blame to which she had been led She is Semiramis of whom we read That she succeeded Ninus and was his spouse She held the land which now the Sultan rules The next is she who killed herself for love And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus Then Cleopatra the voluptuous Helen I saw for whom so many ruthless Seasons revolved and saw the great Achilles Who at the last hour combated with Love Paris I saw Tristan and more than a thousand Shades did he name and point out with his finger Whom Love had separated from our life After that I had listened to my Teacher Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers Pity prevailed and I was nigh bewildered And I began O Poet willingly Speak would I to those two who go together And seem upon the wind to be so light And he to me Thou lieutenant mark when they shall be Nearer to us and then do thou implore them By love which leadeth them and they will come Soon as the wind in our direction sways them My voice uplift I O ye weary souls Come speak to us if no one interdicts it As turtle doves called onward by desire With open and steady wings to the sweet nest Fly through the air by their volition borne So came they from the band where Dido is Approaching us athwart the air malign So strong was the affectionate appeal O living creature gracious and benignant Who visiting goest through the purple air Us who have stained the world incarnadine If were the King of the Universe our friend We would pray unto him to give thee peace Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak That will we hear and we will speak to you While silent is the wind as it is now Sitteth the city wherein I was born Upon the sea shore where the Po descends To rest in peace with all his retinue Love that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize Seized this man for the person beautiful That was ta en from me and still the mode offends me Love that exempts no one beloved from loving Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly That as thou seest it doth not yet desert me Love has conducted us unto one death Caina waiteth him who quenched our life These words were borne along from them to us As soon as I had heard those souls tormented I bowed my face and so long held it down Until the Poet said to me What thinkest When I made answer I began Alas How many pleasant thoughts how much desire Conducted these unto the dolorous pass Then unto them I turned me and I spake And I began Thine agonies Francesca Sad and compassionate to weeping make me But tell me at the time of those sweet sighs By what and in what manner Love conceded That you should know your dubious desires And she to me There is no greater sorrow Than to be mindful of the happy time In misery and that thy Teacher knows But if to recognise the earliest root Of love in us thou hast so great desire I will do even as he who weeps and speaks One day we reading were for our delight Of Launcelot how Love did him enthral Alone we were and without any fear Full many a time our eyes together drew That reading and drove the colour from our faces But one point only was it that o ercame us When as we read of the much longed for smile Being by such a noble lover kissed This one who ne er from me shall be divided Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it That day no farther did we read therein And all the while one spirit uttered this The other one did weep so that for pity I swooned away as if I had been dying And fell even as a dead body falls Inferno Canto VI At the return of consciousness that closed Before the pity of those two relations Which utterly with sadness had confused me New torments I behold and new tormented Around me whichsoever way I move And whichsoever way I turn and gaze In the third circle am I of the rain Eternal maledict and cold and heavy Its law and quality are never new Huge hail and water sombre hued and snow Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain Noisome the earth is that receiveth this Cerberus monster cruel and uncouth With his three gullets like a dog is barking Over the people that are there submerged Red eyes he has and unctuous beard and black And belly large and armed with claws his hands He rends the spirits flays and quarters them Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs One side they make a shelter for the other Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates When Cerberus perceived us the great worm His mouths he opened and displayed his tusks Not a limb had he that was motionless And my Conductor with his spans extended Took of the earth and with his fists well filled He threw it into those rapacious gullets Such as that dog is who by barking craves And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws For to devour it he but thinks and struggles The like became those muzzles filth begrimed Of Cerberus the demon who so thunders Over the souls that they would fain be deaf We passed across the shadows which subdues The heavy rain storm and we placed our feet Upon their vanity that person seems They all were lying prone upon the earth Excepting one who sat upright as soon As he beheld us passing on before him O thou that art conducted through this Hell He said to me recall me if thou canst Thyself wast made before I was unmade And I to him The anguish which thou hast Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance So that it seems not I have ever seen thee But tell me who thou art that in so doleful A place art put and in such punishment If some are greater none is so displeasing And he to me Thy city which is full Of envy so that now the sack runs over Held me within it in the life serene You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco For the pernicious sin of gluttony I as thou seest am battered by this rain And I sad soul am not the only one For all these suffer the like penalty For the like sin and word no more spake he I answered him Ciacco thy wretchedness Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me But tell me if thou knowest to what shall come The citizens of the divided city If any there be just and the occasion Tell me why so much discord has assailed it And he to me They after long contention Will come to bloodshed and the rustic party Will drive the other out with much offence Then afterwards behoves it this one fall Within three suns and rise again the other By force of him who now is on the coast High will it hold its forehead a long while Keeping the other under heavy burdens Howe er it weeps thereat and is indignant The just are two and are not understood there Envy and Arrogance and Avarice Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled Here ended he his tearful utterance And I to him I wish thee still to teach me And make a gift to me of further speech Farinata and Tegghiaio once so worthy Jacopo Rusticucci Arrigo and Mosca And others who on good deeds set their thoughts Say where they are and cause that I may know them For great desire constraineth me to learn If Heaven doth sweeten them or Hell envenom And he They are among the blacker souls A different sin downweighs them to the bottom If thou so far descendest thou canst see them But when thou art again in the sweet world I pray thee to the mind of others bring me No more I tell thee and no more I answer Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance Eyed me a little and then bowed his head He fell therewith prone like the other blind And the Guide said to me He wakes no more This side the sound of the angelic trumpet When shall approach the hostile Potentate Each one shall find again his dismal tomb Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure Shall hear what through eternity re echoes So we passed onward o er the filthy mixture Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow Touching a little on the future life Wherefore I said Master these torments here Will they increase after the mighty sentence Or lesser be or will they be as burning And he to me Return unto thy science Which wills that as the thing more perfect is The more it feels of pleasure and of pain Albeit that this people maledict To true perfection never can attain Hereafter more than now they look to be Round in a circle by that road we went Speaking much more which I do not repeat We came unto the point where the descent is There we found Plutus the great enemy Inferno Canto VII Pape Satan Pape Satan Aleppe Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began And that benignant Sage who all things knew Said to encourage me Let not thy fear Harm thee for any power that he may have Shall not prevent thy going down this crag Then he turned round unto that bloated lip And said Be silent thou accursed wolf Consume within thyself with thine own rage Not causeless is this journey to the abyss Thus is it willed on high where Michael wrought Vengeance upon the proud adultery Even as the sails inflated by the wind Involved together fall when snaps the mast So fell the cruel monster to the earth Thus we descended into the fourth chasm Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore Which all the woe of the universe insacks Justice of God ah who heaps up so many New toils and sufferings as I beheld And why doth our transgression waste us so As doth the billow there upon Charybdis That breaks itself on that which it encounters So here the folk must dance their roundelay Here saw I people more than elsewhere many On one side and the other with great howls Rolling weights forward by main force of chest They clashed together and then at that point Each one turned backward rolling retrograde Crying Why keepest and Why squanderest thou Thus they returned along the lurid circle On either hand unto the opposite point Shouting their shameful metre evermore Then each when he arrived there wheeled about Through his half circle to another joust And I who had my heart pierced as it were Exclaimed My Master now declare to me What people these are and if all were clerks These shaven crowns upon the left of us And he to me All of them were asquint In intellect in the first life so much That there with measure they no spending made Clearly enough their voices bark it forth Whene er they reach the two points of the circle Where sunders them the opposite defect Clerks those were who no hairy covering Have on the head and Popes and Cardinals In whom doth Avarice practise its excess And I My Master among such as these I ought forsooth to recognise some few Who were infected with these maladies And he to me Vain thought thou entertainest The undiscerning life which made them sordid Now makes them unto all discernment dim Forever shall they come to these two buttings These from the sepulchre shall rise again With the fist closed and these with tresses shorn Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world Have ta en from them and placed them in this scuffle Whate er it be no words adorn I for it Now canst thou Son behold the transient farce Of goods that are committed unto Fortune For which the human race each other buffet For all the gold that is beneath the moon Or ever has been of these weary souls Could never make a single one repose Master I said to him now tell me also What is this Fortune which thou speakest of That has the world s goods so within its clutches And he to me O creatures imbecile What ignorance is this which doth beset you Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her He whose omniscience everything transcends The heavens created and gave who should guide them That every part to every part may shine Distributing the light in equal measure He in like manner to the mundane splendours Ordained a general ministress and guide That she might change at times the empty treasures From race to race from one blood to another Beyond resistance of all human wisdom Therefore one people triumphs and another Languishes in pursuance of her judgment Which hidden is as in the grass a serpent Your knowledge has no counterstand against her She makes provision judges and pursues Her governance as theirs the other gods Her permutations have not any truce Necessity makes her precipitate So often cometh who his turn obtains And this is she who is so crucified Even by those who ought to give her praise Giving her blame amiss and bad repute But she is blissful and she hears it not Among the other primal creatures gladsome She turns her sphere and blissful she rejoices Let us descend now unto greater woe Already sinks each star that was ascending When I set out and loitering is forbidden We crossed the circle to the other bank Near to a fount that boils and pours itself Along a gully that runs out of it The water was more sombre far than perse And we in company with the dusky waves Made entrance downward by a path uncouth A marsh it makes which has the name of Styx This tristful brooklet when it has descended Down to the foot of the malign gray shores And I who stood intent upon beholding Saw people mud besprent in that lagoon All of them naked and with angry look They smote each other not alone with hands But with the head and with the breast and feet Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth Said the good Master Son thou now beholdest The souls of those whom anger overcame And likewise I would have thee know for certain Beneath the water people are who sigh And make this water bubble at the surface As the eye tells thee wheresoe er it turns Fixed in the mire they say We sullen were In the sweet air which by the sun is gladdened Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek Now we are sullen in this sable mire This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats For with unbroken words they cannot say it Thus we went circling round the filthy fen A great arc twixt the dry bank and the swamp With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire Unto the foot of a tower we came at last Inferno Canto VIII I say continuing that long before We to the foot of that high tower had come Our eyes went upward to the summit of it By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there And from afar another answer them So far that hardly could the eye attain it And to the sea of all discernment turned I said What sayeth this and what respondeth That other fire and who are they that made it And he to me Across the turbid waves What is expected thou canst now discern If reek of the morass conceal it not Cord never shot an arrow from itself That sped away athwart the air so swift As I beheld a very little boat Come o er the water tow rds us at that moment Under the guidance of a single pilot Who shouted Now art thou arrived fell soul Phlegyas Phlegyas thou criest out in vain For this once said my Lord thou shalt not have us Longer than in the passing of the slough As he who listens to some great deceit That has been done to him and then resents it Such became Phlegyas in his gathered wrath My Guide descended down into the boat And then he made me enter after him And only when I entered seemed it laden Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat The antique prow goes on its way dividing More of the water than tis wont with others While we were running through the dead canal Uprose in front of me one full of mire And said Who rt thou that comest ere the hour And I to him Although I come I stay not But who art thou that hast become so squalid Thou seest that I am one who weeps he answered And I to him With weeping and with wailing Thou spirit maledict do thou remain For thee I know though thou art all defiled Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat Whereat my wary Master thrust him back Saying Away there with the other dogs Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck He kissed my face and said Disdainful soul Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom That was an arrogant person in the world Goodness is none that decks his memory So likewise here his shade is furious How many are esteemed great kings up there Who here shall be like unto swine in mire Leaving behind them horrible dispraises And I My Master much should I be pleased If I could see him soused into this broth Before we issue forth out of the lake And he to me Ere unto thee the shore Reveal itself thou shalt be satisfied Such a desire tis meet thou shouldst enjoy A little after that I saw such havoc Made of him by the people of the mire That still I praise and thank my God for it They all were shouting At Philippo Argenti And that exasperate spirit Florentine Turned round upon himself with his own teeth We left him there and more of him I tell not But on mine ears there smote a lamentation Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes And the good Master said Even now my Son The city draweth near whose name is Dis With the grave citizens with the great throng And I Its mosques already Master clearly Within there in the valley I discern Vermilion as if issuing from the fire They were And he to me The fire eternal That kindles them within makes them look red As thou beholdest in this nether Hell Then we arrived within the moats profound That circumvallate that disconsolate city The walls appeared to me to be of iron Not without making first a circuit wide We came unto a place where loud the pilot Cried out to us Debark here is the entrance More than a thousand at the gates I saw Out of the Heavens rained down who angrily Were saying Who is this that without death Goes through the kingdom of the people dead And my sagacious Master made a sign Of wishing secretly to speak with them A little then they quelled their great disdain And said Come thou alone and he begone Who has so boldly entered these dominions Let him return alone by his mad road Try if he can for thou shalt here remain Who hast escorted him through such dark regions Think Reader if I was discomforted At utterance of the accursed words For never to return here I believed O my dear Guide who more than seven times Hast rendered me security and drawn me From imminent peril that before me stood Do not desert me said I thus undone And if the going farther be denied us Let us retrace our steps together swiftly And that Lord who had led me thitherward Said unto me Fear not because our passage None can take from us it by Such is given But here await me and thy weary spirit Comfort and nourish with a better hope For in this nether world I will not leave thee So onward goes and there abandons me My Father sweet and I remain in doubt For No and Yes within my head contend I could not hear what he proposed to them But with them there he did not linger long Ere each within in rivalry ran back They closed the portals those our adversaries On my Lord s breast who had remained without And turned to me with footsteps far between His eyes cast down his forehead shorn had he Of all its boldness and he said with sighs Who has denied to me the dolesome houses And unto me Thou because I am angry Fear not for I will conquer in the trial Whatever for defence within be planned This arrogance of theirs is nothing new For once they used it at less secret gate Which finds itself without a fastening still O er it didst thou behold the dead inscription And now this side of it descends the steep Passing across the circles without escort One by whose means the city shall be opened Inferno Canto IX That hue which cowardice brought out on me Beholding my Conductor backward turn Sooner repressed within him his new colour He stopped attentive like a man who listens Because the eye could not conduct him far Through the black air and through the heavy fog Still it behoveth us to win the fight Began he Else Such offered us herself O how I long that some one here arrive Well I perceived as soon as the beginning He covered up with what came afterward That they were words quite different from the first But none the less his saying gave me fear Because I carried out the broken phrase Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had Into this bottom of the doleful conch Doth any e er descend from the first grade Which for its pain has only hope cut off This question put I and he answered me Seldom it comes to pass that one of us Maketh the journey upon which I go True is it once before I here below Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies Naked of me short while the flesh had been Before within that wall she made me enter To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas That is the lowest region and the darkest And farthest from the heaven which circles all Well know I the way therefore be reassured This fen which a prodigious stench exhales Encompasses about the city dolent Where now we cannot enter without anger And more he said but not in mind I have it Because mine eye had altogether drawn me Tow rds the high tower with the red flaming summit Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen The three infernal Furies stained with blood Who had the limbs of women and their mien And with the greenest hydras were begirt Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined And he who well the handmaids of the Queen Of everlasting lamentation knew Said unto me Behold the fierce Erinnys This is Megaera on the left hand side She who is weeping on the right Alecto Tisiphone is between and then was silent Each one her breast was rending with her nails They beat them with their palms and cried so loud That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet Medusa come so we to stone will change him All shouted looking down in evil hour Avenged we not on Theseus his assault Turn thyself round and keep thine eyes close shut For if the Gorgon appear and thou shouldst see it No more returning upward would there be Thus said the Master and he turned me round Himself and trusted not unto my hands So far as not to blind me with his own O ye who have undistempered intellects Observe the doctrine that conceals itself Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses And now there came across the turbid waves The clangour of a sound with terror fraught Because of which both of the margins trembled Not otherwise it was than of a wind Impetuous on account of adverse heats That smites the forest and without restraint The branches rends beats down and bears away Right onward laden with dust it goes superb And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds Mine eyes he loosed and said Direct the nerve Of vision now along that ancient foam There yonder where that smoke is most intense Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent Across the water scatter all abroad Until each one is huddled in the earth More than a thousand ruined souls I saw Thus fleeing from before one who on foot Was passing o er the Styx with soles unwet From off his face he fanned that unctuous air Waving his left hand oft in front of him And only with that anguish seemed he weary Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he And to the Master turned and he made sign That I should quiet stand and bow before him Ah how disdainful he appeared to me He reached the gate and with a little rod He opened it for there was no resistance O banished out of Heaven people despised Thus he began upon the horrid threshold Whence is this arrogance within you couched Wherefore recalcitrate against that will From which the end can never be cut off And which has many times increased your pain What helpeth it to butt against the fates Your Cerberus if you remember well For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled Then he returned along the miry road And spake no word to us but had the look Of one whom other care constrains and goads Than that of him who in his presence is And we our feet directed tow rds the city After those holy words all confident Within we entered without any contest And I who inclination had to see What the condition such a fortress holds Soon as I was within cast round mine eye And see on every hand an ample plain Full of distress and torment terrible Even as at Arles where stagnant grows the Rhone Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders The sepulchres make all the place uneven So likewise did they there on every side Saving that there the manner was more bitter For flames between the sepulchres were scattered By which they so intensely heated were That iron more so asks not any art All of their coverings uplifted were And from them issued forth such dire laments Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented And I My Master what are all those people Who having sepulture within those tombs Make themselves audible by doleful sighs And he to me Here are the Heresiarchs With their disciples of all sects and much More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs Here like together with its like is buried And more and less the monuments are heated And when he to the right had turned we passed Between the torments and high parapets Inferno Canto X Now onward goes along a narrow path Between the torments and the city wall My Master and I follow at his back O power supreme that through these impious circles Turnest me I began as pleases thee Speak to me and my longings satisfy The people who are lying in these tombs Might they be seen already are uplifted The covers all and no one keepeth guard And he to me They all will be closed up When from Jehoshaphat they shall return Here with the bodies they have left above Their cemetery have upon this side With Epicurus all his followers Who with the body mortal make the soul But in the question thou dost put to me Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent And I Good Leader I but keep concealed From thee my heart that I may speak the less Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me O Tuscan thou who through the city of fire Goest alive thus speaking modestly Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest A native of that noble fatherland To which perhaps I too molestful was Upon a sudden issued forth this sound From out one of the tombs wherefore I pressed Fearing a little nearer to my Leader And unto me he said Turn thee what dost thou Behold there Farinata who has risen From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him I had already fixed mine eyes on his And he uprose erect with breast and front E en as if Hell he had in great despite And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him Exclaiming Let thy words explicit be As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb Somewhat he eyed me and as if disdainful Then asked of me Who were thine ancestors I who desirous of obeying was Concealed it not but all revealed to him Whereat he raised his brows a little upward Then said he Fiercely adverse have they been To me and to my fathers and my party So that two several times I scattered them If they were banished they returned on all sides I answered him the first time and the second But yours have not acquired that art aright Then there uprose upon the sight uncovered Down to the chin a shadow at his side I think that he had risen on his knees Round me he gazed as if solicitude He had to see if some one else were with me But after his suspicion was all spent Weeping he said to me If through this blind Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius Where is my son and why is he not with thee And I to him I come not of myself He who is waiting yonder leads me here Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had His language and the mode of punishment Already unto me had read his name On that account my answer was so full Up starting suddenly he cried out How Saidst thou he had Is he not still alive Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes When he became aware of some delay Which I before my answer made supine He fell again and forth appeared no more But the other magnanimous at whose desire I had remained did not his aspect change Neither his neck he moved nor bent his side And if continuing his first discourse They have that art he said not learned aright That more tormenteth me than doth this bed But fifty times shall not rekindled be The countenance of the Lady who reigns here Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return Say why that people is so pitiless Against my race in each one of its laws Whence I to him The slaughter and great carnage Which have with crimson stained the Arbia cause Such orisons in our temple to be made After his head he with a sigh had shaken There I was not alone he said nor surely Without a cause had with the others moved But there I was alone where every one Consented to the laying waste of Florence He who defended her with open face Ah so hereafter may your seed repose I him entreated solve for me that knot Which has entangled my conceptions here It seems that you can see if I hear rightly Beforehand whatsoe er time brings with it And in the present have another mode We see like those who have imperfect sight The things he said that distant are from us So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler When they draw near or are is wholly vain Our intellect and if none brings it to us Not anything know we of your human state Hence thou canst understand that wholly dead Will be our knowledge from the moment when The portal of the future shall be closed Then I as if compunctious for my fault Said Now then you will tell that fallen one That still his son is with the living joined And if just now in answering I was dumb Tell him I did it because I was thinking Already of the error you have solved me And now my Master was recalling me Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit That he would tell me who was with him there He said With more than a thousand here I lie Within here is the second Frederick And the Cardinal and of the rest I speak not Thereon he hid himself and I towards The ancient poet turned my steps reflecting Upon that saying which seemed hostile to me He moved along and afterward thus going He said to me Why art thou so bewildered And I in his inquiry satisfied him Let memory preserve what thou hast heard Against thyself that Sage commanded me And now attend here and he raised his finger When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold From her thou lieutenant know the journey of thy life Unto the left hand then he turned his feet We left the wall and went towards the middle Along a path that strikes into a valley Which even up there unpleasant made its stench Inferno Canto XI Upon the margin of a lofty bank Which great rocks broken in a circle made We came upon a still more cruel throng And there by reason of the horrible Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out We drew ourselves aside behind the cover Of a great tomb whereon I saw a writing Which said Pope Anastasius I hold Whom out of the right way Photinus drew Slow it behoveth our descent to be So that the sense be first a little used To the sad blast and then we shall not heed it The Master thus and unto him I said Some compensation find that the time pass not Idly and he Thou seest I think of that My son upon the inside of these rocks Began he then to say are three small circles From grade to grade like those which thou art leaving They all are full of spirits maledict But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven Injury is the end and all such end Either by force or fraud afflicteth others But because fraud is man s peculiar vice More it displeases God and so stand lowest The fraudulent and greater dole assails them All the first circle of the Violent is But since force may be used against three persons In three rounds tis divided and constructed To God to ourselves and to our neighbour can we Use force I say on them and on their things As thou shalt hear with reason manifest A death by violence and painful wounds Are to our neighbour given and in his substance Ruin and arson and injurious levies Whence homicides and he who smites unjustly Marauders and freebooters the first round Tormenteth all in companies diverse Man may lay violent hands upon himself And his own goods and therefore in the second Round must perforce without avail repent Whoever of your world deprives himself Who games and dissipates his property And weepeth there where he should jocund be Violence can be done the Deity In heart denying and blaspheming Him And by disdaining Nature and her bounty And for this reason doth the smallest round Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors And who disdaining God speaks from the heart Fraud wherewithal is every conscience stung A man may practise upon him who trusts And him who doth no confidence imburse This latter mode it would appear dissevers Only the bond of love which Nature makes Wherefore within the second circle nestle Hypocrisy flattery and who deals in magic Falsification theft and simony Panders and barrators and the like filth By the other mode forgotten is that love Which Nature makes and what is after added From which there is a special faith engendered Hence in the smallest circle where the point is Of the Universe upon which Dis is seated Whoe er betrays for ever is consumed And I My Master clear enough proceeds Thy reasoning and full well distinguishes This cavern and the people who possess it But tell me those within the fat lagoon Whom the wind drives and whom the rain doth beat And who encounter with such bitter tongues Wherefore are they inside of the red city Not punished if God has them in his wrath And if he has not wherefore in such fashion And unto me he said Why wanders so Thine intellect from that which it is wont Or sooth thy mind where is it elsewhere looking Hast thou no recollection of those words With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses The dispositions three that Heaven abides not Incontinence and Malice and insane Bestiality and how Incontinence Less God offendeth and less blame attracts If thou regardest this conclusion well And to thy mind recallest who they are That up outside are undergoing penance Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons They separated are and why less wroth Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer O Sun that healest all distempered vision Thou dost content me so when thou resolvest That doubting pleases me no less than knowing Once more a little backward turn thee said I There where thou sayest that usury offends Goodness divine and disengage the knot Philosophy he said to him who heeds it Noteth not only in one place alone After what manner Nature takes her course From Intellect Divine and from its art And if thy Physics carefully thou notest After not many pages shalt thou find That this your art as far as possible Follows as the disciple doth the master So that your art is as it were God s grandchild From these two if thou bringest to thy mind Genesis at the beginning it behoves Mankind to gain their life and to advance And since the usurer takes another way Nature herself and in her follower Disdains he for elsewhere he puts his hope But follow now as I would fain go on For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies And far beyond there we descend the crag Inferno Canto XII The place where to descend the bank we came Was alpine and from what was there moreover Of such a kind that every eye would shun it Such as that ruin is which in the flank Smote on this side of Trent the Adige Either by earthquake or by failing stay For from the mountain s top from which it moved Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so Some path twould give to him who was above Even such was the descent of that ravine And on the border of the broken chasm The infamy of Crete was stretched along Who was conceived in the fictitious cow And when he us beheld he bit himself Even as one whom anger racks within My Sage towards him shouted Peradventure Thou think saint that here may be the Duke of Athens Who in the world above brought death to thee Get thee gone beast for this one cometh not Instructed by thy sister but he comes In order to behold your punishments As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment In which he has received the mortal blow Who cannot walk but staggers here and there The Minotaur beheld I do the like And he the wary cried Run to the passage While he wroth tis well thou shouldst descend Thus down we took our way o er that discharge Of stones which oftentimes did move themselves Beneath my feet from the unwonted burden Thoughtful I went and he said Thou art thinking Perhaps upon this ruin which is guarded By that brute anger which just now I quenched Now will I have thee know the other time I here descended to the nether Hell This precipice had not yet fallen down But truly if I well discern a little Before His coming who the mighty spoil Bore off from Dis in the supernal circle Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley Trembled so that I thought the Universe Was thrilled with love by which there are who think The world ofttimes converted into chaos And at that moment this primeval crag Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow But fix thine eyes below for draweth near The river of blood within which boiling is Whoe er by violence doth injure others O blind cupidity O wrath insane That spurs us onward so in our short life And in the eternal then so badly steeps us I saw an ample moat bent like a bow As one which all the plain encompasses Conformable to what my Guide had said And between this and the embankment s foot Centaurs in file were running armed with arrows As in the world they used the chase to follow Beholding us descend each one stood still And from the squadron three detached themselves With bows and arrows in advance selected And from afar one cried Unto what torment Come ye who down the hillside are descending Tell us from there if not I draw the bow My Master said Our answer will we make To Chiron near you there in evil hour That will of thine was evermore so hasty Then touched he me and said This one is Nessus Who perished for the lovely Dejanira And for himself himself did vengeance take And he in the midst who at his breast is gazing Is the great Chiron who brought up Achilles That other Pholus is who was so wrathful Thousands and thousands go about the moat Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges Out of the blood more than his crime allots Near we approached unto those monsters fleet Chiron an arrow took and with the notch Backward upon his jaws he put his beard After he had uncovered his great mouth He said to his companions Are you ware That he behind moveth whate er he touches Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men And my good Guide who now was at his breast Where the two natures are together joined Replied Indeed he lives and thus alone Me it behoves to show him the dark valley Necessity and not delight impels us Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja Who unto me committed this new office No thief is he nor I a thievish spirit But by that virtue through which I am moving My steps along this savage thoroughfare Give us some one of thine to be with us And who may show us where to pass the ford And who may carry this one on his back For tis no spirit that can walk the air Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about And said to Nessus Turn and do thou guide them And warn aside if other band may meet you We with our faithful escort onward moved Along the brink of the vermilion boiling Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments People I saw within up to the eyebrows And the great Centaur said Tyrants are these Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs here Is Alexander and fierce Dionysius Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years That forehead there which has the hair so black Is Azzolin and the other who is blond Obizzo is of Esti who in truth Up in the world was by his stepson slain Then turned I to the Poet and he said Now he be first to thee and second I A little farther on the Centaur stopped Above a folk who far down as the throat Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth A shade he showed us on one side alone Saying He cleft asunder in God s bosom The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured Then people saw I who from out the river Lifted their heads and also all the chest And many among these I recognised Thus ever more and more grew shallower That blood so that the feet alone it covered And there across the moat our passage was Even as thou here upon this side beholdest The boiling stream that aye diminishes The Centaur said I wish thee to believe That on this other more and more declines Its bed until it reunites itself Where it behoveth tyranny to groan Justice divine upon this side is goading That Attila who was a scourge on earth And Pyrrhus and Sextus and for ever milks The tears which with the boiling it unseals In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo Who made upon the highways so much war Then back he turned and passed again the ford Inferno Canto XIII Not yet had Nessus reached the other side When we had put ourselves within a wood That was not marked by any path whatever Not foliage green but of a dusky colour Not branches smooth but gnarled and intertangled Not apple trees were there but thorns with poison Such tangled thickets have not nor so dense Those savage wild beasts that in hatred hold Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places There do the hideous Harpies make their nests Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades With sad announcement of impending doom Broad wings have they and necks and faces human And feet with claws and their great bellies fledged They make laments upon the wondrous trees And the good Master Ere thou enter farther Know that thou art within the second round Thus he began to say and shalt be till Thou comest out upon the horrible sand Therefore look well around and thou shalt see Things that will credence give unto my speech I heard on all sides lamentations uttered And person none beheld I who might make them Whence utterly bewildered I stood still I think he thought that I perhaps might think So many voices issued through those trunks From people who concealed themselves from us Therefore the Master said If thou break off Some little spray from any of these trees The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn And the trunk cried Why dost thou mangle me After it had become embrowned with blood It recommenced its cry Why dost thou rend me Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever Men once we were and now are changed to trees Indeed thy hand should be more pitiful Even if the souls of serpents we had been As out of a green brand that is on fire At one of the ends and from the other drips And hisses with the wind that is escaping So from that splinter issued forth together Both words and blood whereat I let the tip Fall and stood like a man who is afraid Had he been able sooner to believe My Sage made answer O thou wounded soul What only in my verses he has seen Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand Whereas the thing incredible has caused me To put him to an act which grieveth me But tell him who thou wast so that by way Of some amends thy fame he may refresh Up in the world to which he can return And the trunk said So thy sweet words allure me I cannot silent be and you be vexed not That I a little to discourse am tempted I am the one who both keys had in keeping Of Frederick s heart and turned them to and fro So softly in unlocking and in locking That from his secrets most men I withheld Fidelity I bore the glorious office So great I lost 
82-121544-0106	train-other-500	thereby
none	none	 my sleep and pulses The courtesan who never from the dwelling Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes Death universal and the vice of courts Inflamed against me all the other minds And they inflamed did so inflame Augustus That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings My spirit in disdainful exultation Thinking by dying to escape disdain Made me unjust against myself the just I by the roots unwonted of this wood Do swear to you that never broke I faith Unto my lord who was so worthy of honour And to the world if one of you return Let him my memory comfort which is lying Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it Waited awhile and then Since he is silent The Poet said to me lose not the time But speak and question him if more may please thee Whence I to him Do thou again inquire Concerning what thou thinks t will satisfy me For I cannot such pity is in my heart Therefore he recommenced So may the man Do for thee freely what thy speech implores Spirit incarcerate again be pleased To tell us in what way the soul is bound Within these knots and tell us if thou canst If any from such members e er is freed Then blew the trunk amain and afterward The wind was into such a voice converted With brevity shall be replied to you When the exasperated soul abandons The body whence it rent itself away Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss It falls into the forest and no part Is chosen for it but where Fortune hurls it There like a grain of spelt it germinates It springs a sapling and a forest tree The Harpies feeding then upon its leaves Do pain create and for the pain an outlet Like others for our spoils shall we return But not that any one may them revest For tis not just to have what one casts off Here we shall drag them and along the dismal Forest our bodies shall suspended be Each to the thorn of his molested shade We were attentive still unto the trunk Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us When by a tumult we were overtaken In the same way as he is who perceives The boar and chase approaching to his stand Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches And two behold upon our left hand side Naked and scratched fleeing so furiously That of the forest every fan they broke He who was in advance Now help Death help And the other one who seemed to lag too much Was shouting Lano were not so alert Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo And then perchance because his breath was failing He grouped himself together with a bush Behind them was the forest full of black She mastiffs ravenous and swift of foot As greyhounds who are issuing from the chain On him who had crouched down they set their teeth And him they lacerated piece by piece Thereafter bore away those aching members Thereat my Escort took me by the hand And led me to the bush that all in vain Was weeping from its bloody lacerations O Jacopo it said of Sant Andrea What helped it thee of me to make a screen What blame have I in thy nefarious life When near him had the Master stayed his steps He said Who wast thou that through wounds so many Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech And he to us O souls that hither come To look upon the shameful massacre That has so rent away from me my leaves Gather them up beneath the dismal bush I of that city was which to the Baptist Changed its first patron wherefore he for this Forever with his art will make it sad And were it not that on the pass of Arno Some glimpses of him are remaining still Those citizens who afterwards rebuilt it Upon the ashes left by Attila In vain had caused their labour to be done Of my own house I made myself a gibbet Inferno Canto XIV Because the charity of my native place Constrained me gathered I the scattered leaves And gave them back to him who now was hoarse Then came we to the confine where disparted The second round is from the third and where A horrible form of Justice is beheld Clearly to manifest these novel things I say that we arrived upon a plain Which from its bed rejecteth every plant The dolorous forest is a garland to it All round about as the sad moat to that There close upon the edge we stayed our feet The soil was of an arid and thick sand Not of another fashion made than that Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed Vengeance of God O how much oughtest thou By each one to be dreaded who doth read That which was manifest unto mine eyes Of naked souls beheld I many herds Who all were weeping very miserably And over them seemed set a law diverse Supine upon the ground some folk were lying And some were sitting all drawn up together And others went about continually Those who were going round were far the more And those were less who lay down to their torment But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation O er all the sand waste with a gradual fall Were raining down dilated flakes of fire As of the snow on Alp without a wind As Alexander in those torrid parts Of India beheld upon his host Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground Whence he provided with his phalanxes To trample down the soil because the vapour Better extinguished was while it was single Thus was descending the eternal heat Whereby the sand was set on fire like tinder Beneath the steel for doubling of the dole Without repose forever was the dance Of miserable hands now there now here Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds Master began I thou who overcomest All things except the demons dire that issued Against us at the entrance of the gate Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not The fire and lieth lowering and disdainful So that the rain seems not to ripen him And he himself who had become aware That I was questioning my Guide about him Cried Such as I was living am I dead If Jove should weary out his smith from whom He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten And if he wearied out by turns the others In Mongibello at the swarthy forge Vociferating Help good Vulcan help Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra And shot his bolts at me with all his might He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance Then did my Leader speak with such great force That I had never heard him speak so loud O Capaneus in that is not extinguished Thine arrogance thou punished art the more Not any torment saving thine own rage Would be unto thy fury pain complete Then he turned round to me with better lip Saying One of the Seven Kings was he Who Thebes besieged and held and seems to hold God in disdain and little seems to prize him But as I said to him his own despites Are for his breast the fittest ornaments Now follow me and mind thou do not place As yet thy feet upon the burning sand But always keep them close unto the wood Speaking no word we came to where there gushes Forth from the wood a little rivulet Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet The sinful women later share among them So downward through the sand it went its way The bottom of it and both sloping banks Were made of stone and the margins at the side Whence I perceived that there the passage was In all the rest which I have shown to thee Since we have entered in within the gate Whose threshold unto no one is denied Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes So notable as is the present river Which all the little flames above it quenches These words were of my Leader whence I prayed him That he would give me largess of the food For which he had given me largess of desire In the mid sea there sits a wasted land Said he thereafterward whose name is Crete Under whose king the world of old was chaste There is a mountain there that once was glad With waters and with leaves which was called Ida Now tis deserted as a thing worn out Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle Of her own son and to conceal him better Whene er he cried she there had clamours made A grand old man stands in the mount erect Who holds his shoulders turned tow rds Damietta And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror His head is fashioned of refined gold And of pure silver are the arms and breast Then he is brass as far down as the fork From that point downward all is chosen iron Save that the right foot is of kiln baked clay And more he stands on that than on the other Each part except the gold is by a fissure Asunder cleft that dripping is with tears Which gathered together perforate that cavern From rock to rock they fall into this valley Acheron Styx and Phlegethon they form Then downward go along this narrow sluice Unto that point where is no more descending They form Cocytus what that pool may be Thou shalt behold so here tis not narrated And I to him If so the present runnel Doth take its rise in this way from our world Why only on this verge appears it to us And he to me Thou knowest the place is round And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far Still to the left descending to the bottom Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned Therefore if something new appear to us It should not bring amazement to thy face And I again Master where shall be found Lethe and Phlegethon for of one thou rt silent And sayest the other of this rain is made In all thy questions truly thou dost please me Replied he but the boiling of the red Water might well solve one of them thou makest Thou shalt see Lethe but outside this moat There where the souls repair to lave themselves When sin repented of has been removed Then said he It is time now to abandon The wood take heed that thou come after me A way the margins make that are not burning And over them all vapours are extinguished Inferno Canto XV Now bears us onward one of the hard margins And so the brooklet s mist o ershadows it From fire it saves the water and the dikes Even as the Flemings twixt Cadsand and Bruges Fearing the flood that tow rds them hurls itself Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight And as the Paduans along the Brenta To guard their villas and their villages Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat In such similitude had those been made Albeit not so lofty nor so thick Whoever he might be the master made them Now were we from the forest so remote I could not have discovered where it was Even if backward I had turned myself When we a company of souls encountered Who came beside the dike and every one Gazed at us as at evening we are wont To eye each other under a new moon And so towards us sharpened they their brows As an old tailor at the needle s eye Thus scrutinised by such a family By some one I was recognised who seized My garment s hem and cried out What a marvel And I when he stretched forth his arm to me On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes That the scorched countenance prevented not His recognition by my intellect And bowing down my face unto his own I made reply Are you here Ser Brunetto And he May t not displease thee O my son If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini Backward return and let the trail go on I said to him With all my power I ask it And if you wish me to sit down with you I will if he please for I go with him O son he said whoever of this herd A moment stops lies then a hundred years Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire Therefore go on I at thy skirts will come And afterward will I rejoin my band Which goes lamenting its eternal doom I did not dare to go down from the road Level to walk with him but my head bowed I held as one who goeth reverently And he began What fortune or what fate Before the last day leadeth thee down here And who is this that showeth thee the way Up there above us in the life serene I answered him I lost me in a valley Or ever yet my age had been completed But yestermorn I turned my back upon it This one appeared to me returning thither And homeward leadeth me along this road And he to me If thou thy star do follow Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port If well I judged in the life beautiful And if I had not died so prematurely Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee I would have given thee comfort in the work But that ungrateful and malignant people Which of old time from Fesole descended And smacks still of the mountain and the granite Will make itself for thy good deeds thy foe And it is right for among crabbed sorbs It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind A people avaricious envious proud Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee One party and the other shall be hungry For thee but far from goat shall be the grass Their litter let the beasts of Fesole Make of themselves nor let them touch the plant If any still upon their dunghill rise In which may yet revive the consecrated Seed of those Romans who remained there when The nest of such great malice it became If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled Replied I to him not yet would you be In banishment from human nature placed For in my mind is fixed and touches now My heart the dear and good paternal image Of you when in the world from hour to hour You taught me how a man becomes eternal And how much I am grateful while I live Behoves that in my language be discerned What you narrate of my career I write And keep it to be glossed with other text By a Lady who can do it if I reach her This much will I have manifest to you Provided that my conscience do not chide me For whatsoever Fortune I am ready Such handsel is not new unto mine ears Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around As it may please her and the churl his mattock My Master thereupon on his right cheek Did backward turn himself and looked at me Then said He listeneth well who noteth it Nor speaking less on that account I go With Ser Brunetto and I ask who are His most known and most eminent companions And he to me To know of some is well Of others it were laudable to be silent For short would be the time for so much speech Know them in sum that all of them were clerks And men of letters great and of great fame In the world tainted with the selfsame sin Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd And Francis of Accorso and thou hadst seen there If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf That one who by the Servant of the Servants From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione Where he has left his sin excited nerves More would I say but coming and discoursing Can be no longer for that I behold New smoke uprising yonder from the sand A people comes with whom I may not be Commended unto thee be my Tesoro In which I still live and no more I ask Then he turned round and seemed to be of those Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle Across the plain and seemed to be among them The one who wins and not the one who loses

79_121541_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 It must needs be some novelty respond I said within myself to the new signal The Master with his eye is following so 
79_121541_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Ah me how very cautious men should be With those who not alone behold the act But with their wisdom look into the thoughts 
79_121541_000047_000000	train-clean-360	He said to me Soon there will upward come What I await and what thy thought is dreaming Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight 
none	none	Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood A man should close his lips as far as may be Because without his fault it causes shame But here I cannot and Reader by the notes Of this my Comedy to thee I swear So may they not be void of lasting favour 
79_121541_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere I saw a figure swimming upward come Marvellous unto every steadfast heart 
79_121541_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Even as he returns who goeth down Sometimes to clear an anchor which has grappled Reef or aught else that in the sea is hidden 
none	none	Who upward stretches and draws in his feet

79_121541_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Behold the monster with the pointed tail Who cleaves the hills and breaketh walls and weapons Behold him who infecteth all the world 
none	none	Thus unto me my Guide began to say And beckoned him that he should come to shore Near to the confine of the trodden marble 
79_121541_000056_000000	train-clean-360	And that uncleanly image of deceit Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust But on the border did not drag its tail 
79_121541_000057_000000	train-clean-360	The face was as the face of a just man Its semblance outwardly was so benign And of a serpent all the trunk beside 
79_121541_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Two paws it had hairy unto the armpits The back and breast and both the sides it had Depicted o er with nooses and with shields 
79_121541_000059_000000	train-clean-360	With colours more groundwork or broidery Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid 
none	none	As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore That part are in the water part on land And as among the guzzling Germans there The beaver plants himself to wage his war So that vile monster lay upon the border Which is of stone and shutteth in the sand 
79_121541_000062_000000	train-clean-360	His tail was wholly quivering in the void Contorting upwards the envenomed fork That in the guise of scorpion armed its point 
79_121541_000063_000000	train-clean-360	The Guide said Now perforce must turn aside Our way a little even to that beast Malevolent that yonder coucheth him 
79_121541_000064_000000	train-clean-360	We therefore on the right side descended And made ten steps upon the outer verge Completely to avoid the sand and flame 
79_121541_000065_000000	train-clean-360	And after we are come to him I see A little farther off upon the sand A people sitting near the hollow place 
79_121541_000066_000000	train-clean-360	Then said to me the Master So that full Experience of this round thou bear away Now go and see what their condition is 
79_121541_000067_000000	train-clean-360	There let thy conversation be concise Till thou returnest I will speak with him That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders 
79_121541_000068_000000	train-clean-360	Thus farther still upon the outermost Head of that seventh circle all alone I went where sat the melancholy folk 
79_121541_000069_000000	train-clean-360	Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe This way that way they helped them with their hands Now from the flames and now from the hot soil 
79_121541_000070_000000	train-clean-360	Not otherwise in summer do the dogs Now with the foot now with the muzzle when By fleas or flies or gadflies they are bitten 
79_121541_000071_000000	train-clean-360	When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces Of some on whom the dolorous fire is falling Not one of them I knew but I perceived
79_121541_000072_000000	train-clean-360	That from the neck of each there hung a pouch Which certain colour had and certain blazon And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding 
79_121541_000073_000000	train-clean-360	And as I gazing round me come among them Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw That had the face and posture of a lion 
79_121541_000074_000000	train-clean-360	Proceeding then the current of my sight Another of them saw I red as blood Display a goose more white than butter is 
79_121541_000075_000000	train-clean-360	And one who with an azure sow and gravid Emblazoned had his little pouch of white Said unto me What dost thou in this moat 
none	none	Now get thee gone and since thou rt still alive Know that a neighbour of mine Vitaliano Will have his seat here on my left hand side A Paduan am I with these Florentines Full many a time they thunder in mine ears Exclaiming Come the sovereign cavalier 
79_121541_000078_000000	train-clean-360	He who shall bring the satchel with three goats Then twisted he his mouth and forth he thrust His tongue like to an ox that licks its nose 
79_121541_000079_000000	train-clean-360	And fearing lest my longer stay might vex Him who had warned me not to tarry long Backward I turned me from those weary souls 
79_121541_000080_000000	train-clean-360	I found my Guide who had already mounted Upon the back of that wild animal And said to me Now be both strong and bold 
79_121541_000081_000000	train-clean-360	Now we descend by stairways such as these Mount thou in front for I will be midway So that the tail may have no power to harm thee 
79_121541_000082_000000	train-clean-360	Such as he is who has so near the ague Of quartan that his nails are blue already And trembles all but looking at the shade 
79_121541_000083_000000	train-clean-360	Even such became I at those proffered words But shame in me his menaces produced Which maketh servant strong before good master 
none	none	I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders I wished to say and yet the voice came not As I believed Take heed that thou embrace me 
79_121541_000085_000000	train-clean-360	But he who other times had rescued me In other peril soon as I had mounted Within his arms encircled and sustained me 
none	none	And said Now Geryon bestir thyself The circles large and the descent be little Think of the novel burden which thou hast 
79_121541_000087_000000	train-clean-360	Even as the little vessel shoves from shore Backward still backward so he thence withdrew And when he wholly felt himself afloat 
79_121541_000088_000000	train-clean-360	There where his breast had been he turned his tail And that extended like an eel he moved And with his paws drew to himself the air 
none	none	A greater fear I do not think there was What time abandoned Phaeton the reins Whereby the heavens as still appears were scorched Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax His father crying An ill way thou takest Than was my own when I perceived myself On all sides in the air and saw extinguished The sight of everything but of the monster 
79_121541_000092_000000	train-clean-360	Onward he goeth swimming slowly slowly Wheels and descends but I perceive it only By wind upon my face and from below 
79_121541_000093_000000	train-clean-360	I heard already on the right the whirlpool Making a horrible crashing under us Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward 
79_121541_000094_000000	train-clean-360	Then was I still more fearful of the abyss Because I fires beheld and heard laments Whereat I trembling all the closer cling 
79_121541_000095_000000	train-clean-360	I saw then for before I had not seen it The turning and descending by great horrors That were approaching upon divers sides 
79_121541_000096_000000	train-clean-360	As falcon who has long been on the wing Who without seeing either lure or bird Maketh the falconer say Ah me thou stoopest 
none	none	Descendeth weary whence he started swiftly Thorough a hundred circles and alights Far from his master sullen and disdainful 
79_121541_000098_000000	train-clean-360	Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom Close to the bases of the rough hewn rock And being disencumbered of our persons 
none	none	He sped away as arrow from the string 
79_121541_000100_000000	train-clean-360	Inferno Canto XVIII
79_121541_000101_000000	train-clean-360	There is a place in Hell called Malebolge Wholly of stone and of an iron colour As is the circle that around it turns 
79_121541_000102_000000	train-clean-360	Right in the middle of the field malign There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep Of which its place the structure will recount 
none	none	Round then is that enclosure which remains Between the well and foot of the high hard bank And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom 
79_121541_000104_000000	train-clean-360	As where for the protection of the walls Many and many moats surround the castles The part in which they are a figure forms 
79_121541_000105_000000	train-clean-360	Just such an image those presented there And as about such strongholds from their gates Unto the outer bank are little bridges 
79_121541_000106_000000	train-clean-360	So from the precipice s base did crags Project which intersected dikes and moats Unto the well that truncates and collects them 
79_121541_000107_000000	train-clean-360	Within this place down shaken from the back Of Geryon we found us and the Poet Held to the left and I moved on behind 
79_121541_000108_000000	train-clean-360	Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish New torments and new wielders of the lash Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete 
79_121541_000109_000000	train-clean-360	Down at the bottom were the sinners naked This side the middle came they facing us Beyond it with us but with greater steps 
79_121541_000110_000000	train-clean-360	Even as the Romans for the mighty host The year of Jubilee upon the bridge Have chosen a mode to pass the people over 
79_121541_000111_000000	train-clean-360	For all upon one side towards the Castle Their faces have and go unto saint Peter s On the other side they go towards the Mountain 
79_121541_000112_000000	train-clean-360	This side and that along the livid stone Beheld I horned demons with great scourges Who cruelly were beating them behind 
none	none	Ah me how they did make them lift their legs At the first blows and sooth not any one The second waited for nor for the third 
79_121541_000114_000000	train-clean-360	While I was going on mine eyes by one Encountered were and straight I said Already With sight of this one I am not unfed 
79_121541_000115_000000	train-clean-360	Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand And to my going somewhat back assented 
79_121541_000116_000000	train-clean-360	And he the scourged one thought to hide himself Lowering his face but little it availed him For said I Thou that castest down thine eyes 
none	none	If false are not the features which thou bearest Thou art Venedico Caccianimico But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces 
79_121541_000118_000000	train-clean-360	And he to me Unwillingly I tell it But forces me thine utterance distinct Which makes me recollect the ancient world 
79_121541_000119_000000	train-clean-360	I was the one who the fair Ghisola Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis Howe er the shameless story may be told 
79_121541_000120_000000	train-clean-360	Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here Nay rather is this place so full of them That not so many tongues to day are taught
none	none	 Twixt Reno and Savena to say sipa And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart While speaking in this manner with his scourge A demon smote him and said Get thee gone Pander there are no women here for coin I joined myself again unto mine Escort Thereafterward with footsteps few we came To where a crag projected from the bank 
79_121541_000124_000000	train-clean-360	This very easily did we ascend And turning to the right along its ridge From those eternal circles we departed 
none	none	When we were there where it is hollowed out Beneath to give a passage to the scourged The Guide said Wait and see that on thee strike The vision of those others evil born Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces Because together with us they have gone From the old bridge we looked upon the train Which tow rds us came upon the other border And which the scourges in like manner smite And the good Master without my inquiring Said to me See that tall one who is coming And for his pain seems not to shed a tear 
79_121541_000129_000000	train-clean-360	Still what a royal aspect he retains That Jason is who by his heart and cunning The Colchians of the Ram made destitute 
79_121541_000130_000000	train-clean-360	He by the isle of Lemnos passed along After the daring women pitiless Had unto death devoted all their males 
79_121541_000131_000000	train-clean-360	There with his tokens and with ornate words Did he deceive Hypsipyle the maiden Who first herself had all the rest deceived 
79_121541_000132_000000	train-clean-360	There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn Such sin unto such punishment condemns him And also for Medea is vengeance done 
none	none	With him go those who in such wise deceive And this sufficient be of the first valley To know and those that in its jaws it holds We were already where the narrow path Crosses athwart the second dike and forms Of that a buttress for another arch 
79_121541_000135_000000	train-clean-360	Thence we heard people who are making moan In the next Bolgia snorting with their muzzles And with their palms beating upon themselves
79_121541_000136_000000	train-clean-360	The margins were incrusted with a mould By exhalation from below that sticks there And with the eyes and nostrils wages war 
none	none	The bottom is so deep no place suffices To give us sight of it without ascending The arch s back where most the crag impends Thither we came and thence down in the moat I saw a people smothered in a filth That out of human privies seemed to flow 
79_121541_000139_000000	train-clean-360	And whilst below there with mine eye I search I saw one with his head so foul with ordure It was not clear if he were clerk or layman 
79_121541_000140_000000	train-clean-360	He screamed to me Wherefore art thou so eager To look at me more than the other foul ones And I to him Because if I remember 
none	none	I have already seen thee with dry hair And thou rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca Therefore I eye thee more than all the others 
79_121541_000142_000000	train-clean-360	And he thereon belabouring his pumpkin The flatteries have submerged me here below Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited 
none	none	Then said to me the Guide See that thou thrust Thy visage somewhat farther in advance That with thine eyes thou well the face attain Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails And crouches now and now on foot is standing Thais the harlot is it who replied Unto her paramour when he said Have I Great gratitude from thee Nay marvellous And herewith let our sight be satisfied

79_121541_000150_000000	train-clean-360	We had already on the following tomb Ascended to that portion of the crag Which o er the middle of the moat hangs plumb 
79_121541_000151_000000	train-clean-360	Wisdom supreme O how great art thou showest In heaven in earth and in the evil world And with what justice doth thy power distribute 
79_121541_000152_000000	train-clean-360	I saw upon the sides and on the bottom The livid stone with perforations filled All of one size and every one was round 
79_121541_000153_000000	train-clean-360	To me less ample seemed they not nor greater Than those that in my beautiful Saint John Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers 
79_121541_000154_000000	train-clean-360	And one of which not many years ago I broke for some one who was drowning in it Be this a seal all men to undeceive 
79_121541_000155_000000	train-clean-360	Out of the mouth of each one there protruded The feet of a transgressor and the legs Up to the calf the rest within remained 
none	none	In all of them the soles were both on fire Wherefore the joints so violently quivered They would have snapped asunder withes and bands 
79_121541_000157_000000	train-clean-360	Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont To move upon the outer surface only So likewise was it there from heel to point

79_121541_000159_000000	train-clean-360	And he to me If thou wilt have me bear thee Down there along that bank which lowest lies From him thou lieutenant know his errors and himself 
none	none	And I What pleases thee to me is pleasing Thou art my Lord and knowest that I depart not From thy desire and knowest what is not spoken Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived We turned and on the left hand side descended Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow 
79_121541_000162_000000	train-clean-360	And the good Master yet from off his haunch Deposed me not till to the hole he brought me Of him who so lamented with his shanks

79_121541_000164_000000	train-clean-360	I stood even as the friar who is confessing The false assassin who when he is fixed Recalls him so that death may be delayed 
none	none	And he cried out Dost thou stand there already Dost thou stand there already Boniface By many years the record lied to me Art thou so early satiate with that wealth For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud The beautiful Lady and then work her woe 
79_121541_000167_000000	train-clean-360	Such I became as people are who stand Not comprehending what is answered them As if bemocked and know not how to answer 
79_121541_000168_000000	train-clean-360	Then said Virgilius Say to him straightway I am not he I am not he thou thinkest And I replied as was imposed on me 
79_121541_000169_000000	train-clean-360	Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet Then sighing with a voice of lamentation Said to me Then what wantest thou of me 
none	none	If who I am thou carest so much to know That thou on that account hast crossed the bank Know that I vested was with the great mantle 
79_121541_000171_000000	train-clean-360	And truly was I son of the She bear So eager to advance the cubs that wealth Above and here myself I pocketed 
79_121541_000172_000000	train-clean-360	Beneath my head the others are dragged down Who have preceded me in simony Flattened along the fissure of the rock 
79_121541_000173_000000	train-clean-360	Below there I shall likewise fall whenever That one shall come who I believed thou wast What time the sudden question I proposed

79_121541_000189_000000	train-clean-360	Therefore with both his arms he took me up And when he had me all upon his breast Remounted by the way where he descended 
79_121541_000190_000000	train-clean-360	Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him But bore me to the summit of the arch Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage 
79_121541_000191_000000	train-clean-360	There tenderly he laid his burden down Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep That would have been hard passage for the goats

79_121541_000194_000000	train-clean-360	Of a new pain behoves me to make verses And give material to the twentieth canto Of the first song which is of the submerged 
79_121541_000195_000000	train-clean-360	I was already thoroughly disposed To peer down into the uncovered depth Which bathed itself with tears of agony 
79_121541_000196_000000	train-clean-360	And people saw I through the circular valley Silent and weeping coming at the pace Which in this world the Litanies assume 
79_121541_000197_000000	train-clean-360	As lower down my sight descended on them Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted From chin to the beginning of the chest

79_121541_000199_000000	train-clean-360	Perchance indeed by violence of palsy Some one has been thus wholly turned awry But I ne er saw it nor believe it can be

none	none	Inferno Canto XXI From bridge to bridge thus speaking other things Of which my Comedy cares not to sing We came along and held the summit when We halted to behold another fissure Of Malebolge and other vain laments And I beheld it marvellously dark As in the Arsenal of the Venetians Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch To smear their unsound vessels o er again For sail they cannot and instead thereof One makes his vessel new and one recaulks The ribs of that which many a voyage has made One hammers at the prow one at the stern This one makes oars and that one cordage twists Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen Thus not by fire but by the art divine Was boiling down below there a dense pitch Which upon every side the bank belimed I saw it but I did not see within it Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised And all swell up and resubside compressed The while below there fixedly I gazed My Leader crying out Beware beware Drew me unto himself from where I stood Then I turned round as one who is impatient To see what it behoves him to escape And whom a sudden terror doth unman Who while he looks delays not his departure And I beheld behind us a black devil Running along upon the crag approach Ah how ferocious was he in his aspect And how he seemed to me in action ruthless With open wings and light upon his feet His shoulders which sharp pointed were and high A sinner did encumber with both haunches And he held clutched the sinews of the feet From off our bridge he said O Malebranche Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita Plunge him beneath for I return for others Unto that town which is well furnished with them All there are barrators except Bonturo No into Yes for money there is changed He hurled him down and over the hard crag Turned round and never was a mastiff loosened In so much hurry to pursue a thief The other sank and rose again face downward But the demons under cover of the bridge Cried Here the Santo Volto has no place Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio Therefore if for our gaffs thou wishest not Do not uplift thyself above the pitch They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes They said It here behoves thee to dance covered That if thou canst thou secretly mayest pilfer Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make Immerse into the middle of the caldron The meat with hooks so that it may not float Said the good Master to me That it be not Apparent thou art here crouch thyself down Behind a jag that thou mayest have some screen And for no outrage that is done to me Be thou afraid because these things I know For once before was I in such a scuffle Then he passed on beyond the bridge s head And as upon the sixth bank he arrived Need was for him to have a steadfast front With the same fury and the same uproar As dogs leap out upon a mendicant Who on a sudden begs where er he stops They issued from beneath the little bridge And turned against him all their grappling irons But he cried out Be none of you malignant Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me Let one of you step forward who may hear me And then take counsel as to grappling me They all cried out Let Malacoda go Whereat one started and the rest stood still And he came to him saying What avails it Thinkest thou Malacoda to behold me Advanced into this place my Master said Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence Without the will divine and fate auspicious Let me go on for it in Heaven is willed That I another show this savage road Then was his arrogance so humbled in him That he let fall his grapnel at his feet And to the others said Now strike him not And unto me my Guide O thou who sittest Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down Securely now return to me again Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him And all the devils forward thrust themselves So that I feared they would not keep their compact And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers Who issued under safeguard from Caprona Seeing themselves among so many foes Close did I press myself with all my person Beside my Leader and turned not mine eyes From off their countenance which was not good They lowered their rakes and Wilt thou have me hit him They said to one another on the rump And answered Yes see that thou nick him with it But the same demon who was holding parley With my Conductor turned him very quickly And said Be quiet be quiet Scarmiglione Then said to us You can no farther go Forward upon this crag because is lying All shattered at the bottom the sixth arch And if it still doth please you to go onward Pursue your way along upon this rock Near is another crag that yields a path Yesterday five hours later than this hour One thousand and two hundred sixty six Years were complete that here the way was broken I send in that direction some of mine To see if any one doth air himself Go ye with them for they will not be vicious Step forward Alichino and Calcabrina Began he to cry out and thou Cagnazzo And Barbariccia do thou guide the ten Come forward Libicocco and Draghignazzo And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane And Farfarello and mad Rubicante Search ye all round about the boiling pitch Let these be safe as far as the next crag That all unbroken passes o er the dens O me what is it Master that I see Pray let us go I said without an escort If thou knowest how since for myself I ask none If thou art as observant as thy wont is Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth And with their brows are threatening woe to us And he to me I will not have thee fear Let them gnash on according to their fancy Because they do it for those boiling wretches Along the left hand dike they wheeled about But first had each one thrust his tongue between His teeth towards their leader for a signal And he had made a trumpet of his rump Inferno Canto XXII I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp Begin the storming and their muster make And sometimes starting off for their escape Vaunt couriers have I seen upon your land O Aretines and foragers go forth Tournaments stricken and the joustings run Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells With kettle drums and signals of the castles And with our own and with outlandish things But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth Did I see horsemen move nor infantry Nor ship by any sign of land or star We went upon our way with the ten demons Ah savage company but in the church With saints and in the tavern with the gluttons Ever upon the pitch was my intent To see the whole condition of that Bolgia And of the people who therein were burned Even as the dolphins when they make a sign To mariners by arching of the back That they should counsel take to save their vessel Thus sometimes to alleviate his pain One of the sinners would display his back And in less time conceal it than it lightens As on the brink of water in a ditch The frogs stand only with their muzzles out So that they hide their feet and other bulk So upon every side the sinners stood But ever as Barbariccia near them came Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew I saw and still my heart doth shudder at it One waiting thus even as it comes to pass One frog remains and down another dives And Graffiacan who most confronted him Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch And drew him up so that he seemed an otter I knew before the names of all of them So had I noted them when they were chosen And when they called each other listened how O Rubicante see that thou do lay Thy claws upon him so that thou mayst flay him Cried all together the accursed ones And I My Master see to it if thou canst That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight Thus come into his adversaries hands Near to the side of him my Leader drew Asked of him whence he was and he replied I in the kingdom of Navarre was born My mother placed me servant to a lord For she had borne me to a ribald knave Destroyer of himself and of his things Then I domestic was of good King Thibault I set me there to practise barratry For which I pay the reckoning in this heat And Ciriatto from whose mouth projected On either side a tusk as in a boar Caused him to feel how one of them could rip Among malicious cats the mouse had come But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms And said Stand ye aside while I enfork him And to my Master he turned round his head Ask him again he said if more thou wish To know from him before some one destroy him The Guide Now tell then of the other culprits Knowest thou any one who is a Latian Under the pitch And he I separated Lately from one who was a neighbour to it Would that I still were covered up with him For I should fear not either claw nor hook And Libicocco We have borne too much And with his grapnel seized him by the arm So that by rending he tore off a tendon Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him Down at the legs whence their Decurion Turned round and round about with evil look When they again somewhat were pacified Of him who still was looking at his wound Demanded my Conductor without stay Who was that one from whom a luckless parting Thou sayest thou hast made to come ashore And he replied It was the Friar Gomita He of Gallura vessel of all fraud Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand And dealt so with them each exults thereat Money he took and let them smoothly off As he says and in other offices A barrator was he not mean but sovereign Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche Of Logodoro and of Sardinia To gossip never do their tongues feel tired O me see that one how he grinds his teeth Still farther would I speak but am afraid Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready And the grand Provost turned to Farfarello Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike Said Stand aside there thou malicious bird If you desire either to see or hear The terror stricken recommenced thereon Tuscans or Lombards I will make them come But let the Malebranche cease a little So that these may not their revenges fear And I down sitting in this very place For one that I am will make seven come When I shall whistle as our custom is To do whenever one of us comes out Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted Shaking his head and said Just hear the trick Which he has thought of down to throw himself Whence he who snares in great abundance had Responded I by far too cunning am When I procure for mine a greater sadness Alichin held not in but running counter Unto the rest said to him If thou dive I will not follow thee upon the gallop But I will beat my wings above the pitch The height be left and be the bank a shield To see if thou alone dost countervail us O thou who readest thou shalt hear new sport Each to the other side his eyes averted He first who most reluctant was to do it The Navarrese selected well his time Planted his feet on land and in a moment Leaped and released himself from their design Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame But he most who was cause of the defeat Therefore he moved and cried Thou art o ertakern But little it availed for wings could not Outstrip the fear the other one went under And flying upward he his breast directed Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden Dives under when the falcon is approaching And upward he returneth cross and weary Infuriate at the mockery Calcabrina Flying behind him followed close desirous The other should escape to have a quarrel And when the barrator had disappeared He turned his talons upon his companion And grappled with him right above the moat But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk To clapperclaw him well and both of them Fell in the middle of the boiling pond A sudden intercessor was the heat But ne ertheless of rising there was naught To such degree they had their wings belimed Lamenting with the others Barbariccia Made four of them fly to the other side With all their gaffs and very speedily This side and that they to their posts descended They stretched their hooks towards the pitch ensnared Who were already baked within the crust And in this manner busied did we leave them Inferno Canto XXIII Silent alone and without company We went the one in front the other after As go the Minor Friars along their way Upon the fable of Aesop was directed My thought by reason of the present quarrel Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse For mo and issa are not more alike Than this one is to that if well we couple End and beginning with a steadfast mind And even as one thought from another springs So afterward from that was born another Which the first fear within me double made Thus did I ponder These on our account Are laughed to scorn with injury and scoff So great that much I think it must annoy them If anger be engrafted on ill will They will come after us more merciless Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes I felt my hair stand all on end already With terror and stood backwardly intent When said I Master if thou hidest not Thyself and me forthwith of Malebranche I am in dread we have them now behind us I so imagine them I already feel them And he If I were made of leaded glass Thine outward image I should not attract Sooner to me than I imprint the inner Just now thy thoughts came in among my own With similar attitude and similar face So that of both one counsel sole I made If peradventure the right bank so slope That we to the next Bolgia can descend We shall escape from the imagined chase Not yet he finished rendering such opinion When I beheld them come with outstretched wings Not far remote with will to seize upon us My Leader on a sudden seized me up Even as a mother who by noise is wakened And close beside her sees the enkindled flames Who takes her son and flies and does not stop Having more care of him than of herself So that she clothes her only with a shift And downward from the top of the hard bank Supine he gave him to the pendent rock That one side of the other Bolgia walls Ne er ran so swiftly water through a sluice To turn the wheel of any land built mill When nearest to the paddles it approaches As did my Master down along that border Bearing me with him on his breast away As his own son and not as a companion Hardly the bed of the ravine below His feet had reached ere they had reached the hill Right over us but he was not afraid For the high Providence which had ordained To place them ministers of the fifth moat The power of thence departing took from all A painted people there below we found Who went about with footsteps very slow Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished They had on mantles with the hoods low down Before their eyes and fashioned of the cut That in Cologne they for the monks are made Without they gilded are so that it dazzles But inwardly all leaden and so heavy That Frederick used to put them on of straw O everlastingly fatiguing mantle Again we turned us still to the left hand Along with them intent on their sad plaint But owing to the weight that weary folk Came on so tardily that we were new In company at each motion of the haunch Whence I unto my Leader See thou find Some one who may by deed or name be known And thus in going move thine eye about And one who understood the Tuscan speech Cried to us from behind Stay ye your feet Ye who so run athwart the dusky air Perhaps thou lieutenant have from me what thou demandest Whereat the Leader turned him and said Wait And then according to his pace proceed I stopped and two beheld I show great haste Of spirit in their faces to be with me But the burden and the narrow way delayed them When they came up long with an eye askance They scanned me without uttering a word Then to each other turned and said together He by the action of his throat seems living And if they dead are by what privilege Go they uncovered by the heavy stole Then said to me Tuscan who to the college Of miserable hypocrites art come Do not disdain to tell us who thou art And I to them Born was I and grew up In the great town on the fair river of Arno And with the body am I ve always had But who are ye in whom there trickles down Along your cheeks such grief as I behold And what pain is upon you that so sparkles And one replied to me These orange cloaks Are made of lead so heavy that the weights Cause in this way their balances to creak Frati Gaudenti were we and Bolognese I Catalano and he Loderingo Named and together taken by thy city As the wont is to take one man alone For maintenance of its peace and we were such That still it is apparent round Gardingo O Friars began I your iniquitous But said no more for to mine eyes there rushed One crucified with three stakes on the ground When me he saw he writhed himself all over Blowing into his beard with suspirations And the Friar Catalan who noticed this Said to me This transfixed one whom thou seest Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet To put one man to torture for the people Crosswise and naked is he on the path As thou perceivest and he needs must feel Whoever passes first how much he weighs And in like mode his father in law is punished Within this moat and the others of the council Which for the Jews was a malignant seed And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel O er him who was extended on the cross So vilely in eternal banishment Then he directed to the Friar this voice Be not displeased if granted thee to tell us If to the right hand any pass slope down By which we two may issue forth from here Without constraining some of the black angels To come and extricate us from this deep Then he made answer Nearer than thou hopest There is a rock that forth from the great circle Proceeds and crosses all the cruel valleys Save that at this tis broken and does not bridge it You will be able to mount up the ruin That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down Then said The business badly he recounted Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder And the Friar Many of the Devil s vices Once heard I at Bologna and among them That he s a liar and the father of lies Thereat my Leader with great strides went on Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks Whence from the heavy laden I departed After the prints of his beloved feet Inferno Canto XXIV In that part of the youthful year wherein The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers And now the nights draw near to half the day What time the hoar frost copies on the ground The outward semblance of her sister white But little lasts the temper of her pen The husbandman whose forage faileth him Rises and looks and seeth the champaign All gleaming white whereat he beats his flank Returns in doors and up and down laments Like a poor wretch who knows not what to do Then he returns and hope revives again Seeing the world has changed its countenance In little time and takes his shepherd s crook And forth the little lambs to pasture drives Thus did the Master fill me with alarm When I beheld his forehead so disturbed And to the ailment came as soon the plaster For as we came unto the ruined bridge The Leader turned to me with that sweet look Which at the mountain s foot I first beheld His arms he opened after some advisement Within himself elected looking first Well at the ruin and laid hold of me And even as he who acts and meditates For aye it seems that he provides beforehand So upward lifting me towards the summit Of a huge rock he scanned another crag Saying To that one grapple afterwards But try first if tis such that it will hold thee This was no way for one clothed with a cloak For hardly we he light and I pushed upward Were able to ascend from jag to jag And had it not been that upon that precinct Shorter was the ascent than on the other He I know not but I had been dead beat But because Malebolge tow rds the mouth Of the profoundest well is all inclining The structure of each valley doth import That one bank rises and the other sinks Still we arrived at length upon the point Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder The breath was from my lungs so milked away When I was up that I could go no farther Nay I sat down upon my first arrival Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth My Master said for sitting upon down Or under quilt one cometh not to fame Withouten which whoso his life consumes Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth As smoke in air or in the water foam And therefore raise thee up o ercome the anguish With spirit that o ercometh every battle If with its heavy body it sink not A longer stairway it behoves thee mount Tis not enough from these to have departed Let it avail thee if thou understand me Then I uprose showing myself provided Better with breath than I did feel myself And said Go on for I am strong and bold Upward we took our way along the crag Which jagged was and narrow and difficult And more precipitous far than that before Speaking I went not to appear exhausted Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth Not well adapted to articulate words I know not what it said though o er the back I now was of the arch that passes there But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking I was bent downward but my living eyes Could not attain the bottom for the dark Wherefore I Master see that thou arrive At the next round and let us descend the wall For as from hence I hear and understand not So I look down and nothing I distinguish Other response he said I make thee not Except the doing for the modest asking Ought to be followed by the deed in silence We from the bridge descended at its head Where it connects itself with the eighth bank And then was manifest to me the Bolgia And I beheld therein a terrible throng Of serpents and of such a monstrous kind That the remembrance still congeals my blood Let Libya boast no longer with her sand For if Chelydri Jaculi and Phareae She breeds with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena Neither so many plagues nor so malignant E er showed she with all Ethiopia Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is Among this cruel and most dismal throng People were running naked and affrighted Without the hope of hole or heliotrope They had their hands with serpents bound behind them These riveted upon their reins the tail And head and were in front of them entwined And lo at one who was upon our side There darted forth a serpent which transfixed him There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders Nor O so quickly e er nor I was written As he took fire and burned and ashes wholly Behoved it that in falling he became And when he on the ground was thus destroyed The ashes drew together and of themselves Into himself they instantly returned Even thus by the great sages tis confessed The phoenix dies and then is born again When it approaches its five hundredth year On herb or grain it feeds not in its life But only on tears of incense and amomum And nard and myrrh are its last winding sheet And as he is who falls and knows not how By force of demons who to earth down drag him Or other oppilation that binds man When he arises and around him looks Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish Which he has suffered and in looking sighs Such was that sinner after he had risen Justice of God O how severe it is That blows like these in vengeance poureth down The Guide thereafter asked him who he was Whence he replied I rained from Tuscany A short time since into this cruel gorge A bestial life and not a human pleased me Even as the mule I was I m Vanni Fucci Beast and Pistoia was my worthy den And I unto the Guide Tell him to stir not And ask what crime has thrust him here below For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him And the sinner who had heard dissembled not But unto me directed mind and face And with a melancholy shame was painted Then said It pains me more that thou hast caught me Amid this misery where thou seest me Than when I from the other life was taken What thou demandest I cannot deny So low am I put down because I robbed The sacristy of the fair ornaments And falsely once twas laid upon another But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy If thou shalt e er be out of the dark places Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre Then Florence doth renew her men and manners Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round And with impetuous and bitter tempest Over Campo Picen shall be the battle When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten And this I ve said that it may give thee pain Inferno Canto XXV At the conclusion of his words the thief Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs Crying Take that God for at thee I aim them From that time forth the serpents were my friends For one entwined itself about his neck As if it said I will not thou speak more And round his arms another and rebound him Clinching itself together so in front That with them he could not a motion make Pistoia ah Pistoia why resolve not To burn thyself to ashes and so perish Since in ill doing thou thy seed excellest Through all the sombre circles of this Hell Spirit I saw not against God so proud Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls He fled away and spake no further word And I beheld a Centaur full of rage Come crying out Where is where is the scoffer I do not think Maremma has so many Serpents as he had all along his back As far as where our countenance begins Upon the shoulders just behind the nape With wings wide open was a dragon lying And he sets fire to all that he encounters My Master said That one is Cacus who Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine Created oftentimes a lake of blood He goes not on the same road with his brothers By reason of the fraudulent theft he made Of the great herd which he had near to him Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath The mace of Hercules who peradventure Gave him a hundred and he felt not ten While he was speaking thus he had passed by And spirits three had underneath us come Of which nor I aware was nor my Leader Until what time they shouted Who are you On which account our story made a halt And then we were intent on them alone I did not know them but it came to pass As it is wont to happen by some chance That one to name the other was compelled Exclaiming Where can Cianfa have remained Whence I so that the Leader might attend Upward from chin to nose my finger laid If thou art Reader slow now to believe What I shall say it will no marvel be For I who saw it hardly can admit it As I was holding raised on them my brows Behold a serpent with six feet darts forth In front of one and fastens wholly on him With middle feet it bound him round the paunch And with the forward ones his arms it seized Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs And put its tail through in between the two And up behind along the reins outspread it Ivy was never fastened by its barbs Unto a tree so as this horrible reptile Upon the other s limbs entwined its own Then they stuck close as if of heated wax They had been made and intermixed their colour Nor one nor other seemed now what he was E en as proceedeth on before the flame Upward along the paper a brown colour Which is not black as yet and the white dies The other two looked on and each of them Cried out O me Agnello how thou changest Behold thou now art neither two nor one Already the two heads had one become When there appeared to us two figures mingled Into one face wherein the two were lost Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms The thighs and legs the belly and the chest Members became that never yet were seen Every original aspect there was cancelled Two and yet none did the perverted image Appear and such departed with slow pace Even as a lizard under the great scourge Of days canicular exchanging hedge Lightning appeareth if the road it cross Thus did appear coming towards the bellies Of the two others a small fiery serpent Livid and black

82-121544-0004	train-other-500	one and all of them As when the fog is vanishing away Little by little doth the sight refigure Whate er the mist that crowds the air conceals So piercing through the dense and darksome air
82-121544-0005	train-other-500	More and more near approaching tow rd the verge My error fled and fear came over me Because as on its circular parapets
none	none	 Montereggione crowns itself with towers 
82-121544-0006	train-other-500	E en thus the margin which surrounds the well With one half of their bodies turreted The horrible giants whom Jove menaces E en now from out the heavens when he thunders
82-121544-0007	train-other-500	And I of one already saw the face Shoulders and breast and great part of the belly
none	none	 And down along his sides both of the arms Certainly Nature when she left the making Of animals like these did well indeed By taking such executors from Mars 
82-121544-0008	train-other-500	And if of elephants and whales she doth not Repent her
none	none	 whosoever looketh subtly 
82-121544-0009	train-other-500	More just and more discreet will hold her for it For where the argument of intellect Is added unto evil will and power No rampart can the people make against it
82-121544-0010	train-other-500	His face appeared to me as long and large As is at Rome the pine cone of Saint Peter s And in proportion were the other bones So that the margin which an apron was Down from the middle
82-121544-0011	train-other-500	showed so much of him Above it that to reach up to his hair
none	none	 Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them 
82-121544-0012	train-other-500	For I beheld thirty great palms of him Down from the place where man his mantle buckles
none	none	 Raphael mai amech izabi almi Began to clamour the ferocious mouth 
82-121544-0013	train-other-500	To which were not befitting sweeter psalms
none	none	 And unto him my Guide 
82-121544-0014	train-other-500	Soul idiotic Keep to thy horn and vent thyself with that When wrath or other passion touches thee Search round thy neck
none	none	 and thou wilt find the belt Which keeps it fastened O bewildered soul And see it where it bars thy mighty breast Then said to me He doth himself accuse This one is Nimrod by whose evil thought One language in the world is not still used 
82-121544-0015	train-other-500	Here let us leave him and not speak in vain For even such to him is every language As his to others which to none is known Therefore a longer journey did we make
82-121544-0016	train-other-500	Turned to the left and a crossbow shot oft We found another far more fierce and large In binding him who might the master be I cannot say but he had pinioned close Behind the right arm and in front the other
82-121544-0017	train-other-500	With chains that held him so begirt about From the neck down that on the part uncovered It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre This proud one wished to make experiment Of his own power against the Supreme Jove
none	none	 My Leader said whence he has such a guerdon Ephialtes is his name 
82-121544-0018	train-other-500	he showed great prowess What time the giants terrified the gods The arms he wielded never more he moves And I to him If possible
82-121544-0019	train-other-500	I should wish That of the measureless Briareus These eyes of mine might have experience Whence he replied Thou shalt behold Antaeus Close by here
82-121544-0020	train-other-500	who can speak and is unbound Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us
none	none	 Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see And he is bound and fashioned like to this one 
82-121544-0021	train-other-500	Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious There never was an earthquake of such might That it could shake a tower so violently
none	none	 As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself Then was I more afraid of death than ever For nothing more was needful than the fear 
82-121544-0022	train-other-500	If I had not beheld the manacles Then we proceeded farther in advance
none	none	 And to Antaeus came 
82-121544-0023	train-other-500	who full five ells Without the head forth issued from the cavern O thou who in the valley fortunate Which Scipio the heir of glory made When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts
82-121544-0024	train-other-500	Once brought saint a thousand lions for thy prey And who hadst thou been at the mighty war Among thy brothers some it seems still think The sons of Earth the victory would have gained
82-121544-0025	train-other-500	Place us below nor be disdainful of it
none	none	 There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up 
82-121544-0026	train-other-500	Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus
none	none	 This one can give of that which here is longed for 
82-121544-0027	train-other-500	Therefore stoop down and do not curl thy lip Still in the world can he restore thy fame Because he lives and still expects long life If to itself Grace call him not untimely
none	none	 So said the Master and in haste the other His hands extended and took up my Guide Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt Virgilius when he felt himself embraced Said unto me 
82-121544-0028	train-other-500	Draw nigh that I may take thee Then of himself and me one bundle made As seems the Carisenda to behold Beneath the leaning side when goes a cloud Above it so that opposite it hangs
82-121544-0029	train-other-500	Such did Antaeus seem to me who stood Watching to see him stoop and then it was I could have wished to go some other way But lightly in the abyss which swallows up Judas with Lucifer
82-121544-0030	train-other-500	he put us down Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay But as a mast does in a ship uprose Inferno
none	none	 Canto XXXII If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous As were appropriate to the dismal hole Down upon which thrust all the other rocks 
82-121544-0031	train-other-500	I would press out the juice of my conception More fully but because I have them not Not without fear I bring myself to speak
82-121544-0032	train-other-500	For tis no enterprise to take in jest To sketch the bottom of all the universe Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo
none	none	 But may those Ladies help this verse of mine 
82-121544-0033	train-other-500	Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes That from the fact the word be not diverse O rabble ill begotten above all Who re in the place to speak of which is hard
82-121544-0034	train-other-500	Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats When we were down within the darksome well Beneath the giant s feet but lower far And I was scanning still the lofty wall I heard it said to me
82-121544-0035	train-other-500	Look how thou steppest Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet The heads of the tired miserable brothers Whereat I turned me round and saw before me And underfoot a lake
82-121544-0036	train-other-500	that from the frost The semblance had of glass and not of water So thick a veil ne er made upon its current In winter time Danube in Austria Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don
none	none	 As there was here so that if Tambernich Had fallen upon it or Pietrapana E en at the edge twould not have given a creak And as to croak the frog doth place himself With muzzle out of water 
82-121544-0037	train-other-500	when is dreaming Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant girl Livid as far down as where shame appears Were the disconsolate shades within the ice Setting their teeth unto the note of storks
82-121544-0038	train-other-500	Each one his countenance held downward bent From mouth the cold from eyes the doleful heart Among them witness of itself procures When round about me
82-121544-0039	train-other-500	somewhat I had looked I downward turned me and saw two so close The hair upon their heads together mingled
none	none	 Ye who so strain your breasts together 
82-121544-0040	train-other-500	tell me I said who are you
none	none	 and they bent their necks And when to me their faces they had lifted Their eyes which first were only moist within Gushed o er the eyelids and the frost congealed The tears between and locked them up again 
82-121544-0041	train-other-500	Clamp never bound together wood with wood So strongly whereat they like two he goats Butted together so much wrath o ercame them
82-121544-0042	train-other-500	And one who had by reason of the cold Lost both his ears still with his visage downward Said Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us If thou desire to know who these two are
82-121544-0043	train-other-500	The valley whence Bisenzio descends Belonged to them and to their father Albert They from one body came and all Caina Thou shalt search through and shalt not find a shade More worthy to be fixed in gelatine
82-121544-0044	train-other-500	Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow At one and the same blow by Arthur s hand Focaccia not not he who me encumbers So with his head I see no farther forward
82-121544-0045	train-other-500	And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni Well knowest thou who he was if thou art Tuscan And that thou put me not to further speech Know that I
none	none	 Camicion de Pazzi 
82-121544-0046	train-other-500	was And wait Carlino to exonerate me Then I beheld a thousand faces made Purple with cold
none	none	 whence o er me comes a shudder And evermore will come at frozen ponds And while we were advancing tow rds the middle 
82-121544-0047	train-other-500	Where everything of weight unites together And I was shivering in the eternal shade
none	none	 Whether twere will or destiny or chance I know not 
82-121544-0048	train-other-500	but in walking mong the heads I struck my foot hard in the face of one Weeping he growled Why dost thou trample me Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance of Montaperti
82-121544-0049	train-other-500	why dost thou molest me And I My Master now wait here for me That I through him may issue from a doubt Then thou mayst hurry me as thou shalt wish The Leader stopped
none	none	 and to that one I said Who was blaspheming vehemently still 
82-121544-0050	train-other-500	Who art thou that thus reprehendest others Now who art thou
none	none	 that goest through Antenora Smiting replied he 
82-121544-0051	train-other-500	other people s cheeks So that if thou wert living twere too much Living I am and dear to thee it may be Was my response if thou demandest fame That mid the other notes thy name I place
82-121544-0052	train-other-500	And he to me For the reverse I long Take thyself hence and give me no more trouble For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him And said
82-121544-0053	train-other-500	It must needs be thou name thyself Or not a hair remain upon thee here Whence he to me Though thou strip off my hair I will not tell thee who I am nor show thee
82-121544-0054	train-other-500	If on my head a thousand times thou fall I had his hair in hand already twisted
none	none	 And more than one shock of it had pulled out He barking with his eyes held firmly down 
82-121544-0055	train-other-500	When cried another What doth ail thee Bocca
none	none	 Is t not enough to clatter with thy jaws But thou must bark 
82-121544-0056	train-other-500	what devil touches thee Now said I
none	none	 I care not to have thee speak Accursed traitor for unto thy shame I will report of thee veracious news Begone replied he and tell what thou wilt But be not silent if thou issue hence Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt 
82-121544-0057	train-other-500	He weepeth here the silver of the French I saw
none	none	 thus canst thou phrase it him of Duera There where the sinners stand out in the cold 
82-121544-0058	train-other-500	If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there
none	none	 Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria 
82-121544-0059	train-other-500	Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder
none	none	 Gianni del Soldanier I think may be Yonder with Ganellon and Tebaldello Who oped Faenza when the people slep 
82-121544-0060	train-other-500	Already we had gone away from him When I beheld two frozen in one hole So that one head a hood was to the other
82-121544-0061	train-other-500	And even as bread through hunger is devoured The uppermost on the other set his teeth There where the brain is to the nape united Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed The temples of Menalippus in disdain
82-121544-0062	train-other-500	Than that one did the skull and the other things
none	none	 O thou who showest by such bestial sign Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating Tell me the wherefore said I with this compact That if thou rightfully of him complain In knowing who ye are and his transgression I in the world above repay thee for it If that wherewith I speak be not dried up Inferno Canto XXXIII His mouth uplifted from his grim repast That sinner wiping it upon the hair Of the same head that he behind had wasted Then he began Thou wilt that I renew The desperate grief which wrings my heart already To think of only ere I speak of it 
82-121544-0063	train-other-500	But if my words be seed that may bear fruit Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together
none	none	 I know not who thou art nor by what mode Thou hast come down here 
82-121544-0064	train-other-500	but a Florentine Thou seemest to me truly when I hear thee Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour
none	none	 That by effect of his malicious thoughts 
82-121544-0065	train-other-500	Trusting in him I was made prisoner And after put to death I need not say But ne ertheless what thou canst not have heard That is to say how cruel was my death
82-121544-0066	train-other-500	Hear shalt thou and shalt know if he has wronged me A narrow perforation in the mew Which bears because of me the title of Famine
none	none	 And in which others still must be locked up 
82-121544-0067	train-other-500	Had shown me through its opening many moons Already when I dreamed the evil dream Which of the future rent for me the veil This one appeared to me as lord and master
none	none	 Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see With sleuth hounds gaunt and eager and well trained Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi He had sent out before him to the front After brief course seemed unto me forespent The father and the sons 
82-121544-0068	train-other-500	and with sharp tushes It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open When I before the morrow was awake Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons Who with me were and asking after bread
none	none	 Cruel indeed art thou if yet thou grieve not Thinking of what my heart foreboded me And weep saint thou not 
82-121544-0069	train-other-500	what art thou wont to weep at They were awake now and the hour drew nigh At which our food used to be brought to us And through his dream was each one apprehensive
82-121544-0070	train-other-500	And I heard locking up the under door Of the horrible tower whereat without a word I gazed into the faces of my sons I wept not I within so turned to stone
82-121544-0071	train-other-500	They wept and darling little Anselm mine Said Thou dost gaze so father what doth ail thee Still not a tear I shed nor answer made All of that day
82-121544-0072	train-other-500	nor yet the night thereafter Until another sun rose on the world As now a little glimmer made its way Into the dolorous prison
none	none	 and I saw Upon four faces my own very aspect 
82-121544-0073	train-other-500	Both of my hands in agony I bit And thinking that I did it from desire Of eating on a sudden they uprose And said they Father
82-121544-0074	train-other-500	much less pain twill give us If thou do eat of us thyself didst clothe us With this poor flesh and do thou strip it off I calmed me then not to make them more sad
82-121544-0075	train-other-500	That day we all were silent and the next Ah obdurate earth wherefore didst thou not open When we had come unto the fourth day
82-121544-0076	train-other-500	Gaddo Threw himself down outstretched before my feet Saying My father why dost thou not help me
none	none	 And there he died and as thou seest me I saw the three fall one by one between The fifth day and the sixth 
82-121544-0077	train-other-500	whence I betook me Already blind to groping over each And three days called them after they were dead Then hunger did what sorrow could not do When he had
82-121544-0078	train-other-500	said this with his eyes distorted The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth Which as a dog s upon the bone were strong Ah Pisa
82-121544-0079	train-other-500	thou opprobrium of the people Of the fair land there where the Si doth sound Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are
82-121544-0080	train-other-500	Let the Capraia and Gorgona move And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno That every person in thee it may drown For if Count Ugolino had the fame Of having in thy castles thee betrayed
none	none	 Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons Guiltless of any crime thou modern Thebes Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata And the other two my song doth name above We passed still farther onward where the ice Another people ruggedly enswathes 
82-121544-0081	train-other-500	Not downward turned but all of them reversed Weeping itself there does not let them weep And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes Turns itself inward to increase the anguish
82-121544-0082	train-other-500	Because the earliest tears a cluster form And in the manner of a crystal visor Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full And notwithstanding that as in a callus
none	none	 Because of cold all sensibility Its station had abandoned in my face Still it appeared to me I felt some wind Whence I My Master who sets this in motion 
82-121544-0083	train-other-500	Is not below here every vapour quenched
none	none	 Whence he to me Full soon shalt thou be where Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast And one of the wretches of the frozen crust Cried out to us O souls so merciless That the last post is given unto you 
82-121544-0084	train-other-500	Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils that I May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart A little e er the weeping recongeal Whence I to him If thou wouldst have me help thee
none	none	 Say who thou wast 
82-121544-0085	train-other-500	and if I free thee not May I go to the bottom of the ice Then he replied
none	none	 I am Friar Alberigo He am I of the fruit of the bad garden 
82-121544-0086	train-other-500	Who here a date am getting for my fig O said I to him now art thou too dead And he to me How may my body fare Up in the world no knowledge I possess
none	none	 Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea That oftentimes the soul descendeth here Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it And that thou mayest more willingly remove From off my countenance these glassy tears Know that as soon as any soul betrays As I have done 
82-121544-0087	train-other-500	his body by a demon Is taken from him who thereafter rules it Until his time has wholly been revolved
82-121544-0088	train-other-500	Itself down rushes into such a cistern And still perchance above appears the body Of yonder shade that winters here behind me This thou shouldst know if thou hast just come down
none	none	 It is Ser Branca d Oria and many years Have passed away since he was thus locked up 
82-121544-0089	train-other-500	I think said I to him thou dost deceive me For Branca d Oria is not dead as yet And eats and drinks and sleeps and puts on clothes In moat above said he
none	none	 of Malebranche There where is boiling the tenacious pitch As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived When this one left a devil in his stead 
82-121544-0090	train-other-500	In his own body and one near of kin Who made together with him the betrayal
none	none	 But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith Open mine eyes and open them I did not 
82-121544-0091	train-other-500	And to be rude to him was courtesy
none	none	 Ah Genoese ye men at variance With every virtue full of every vice Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world For with the vilest spirit of Romagna I found of you one such who for his deeds In soul already in Cocytus bathes And still above in body 
82-121544-0092	train-other-500	seems alive Inferno
none	none	 Canto XXXIV Vexilla Regis prodeunt Inferni 
82-121544-0093	train-other-500	Towards us therefore look in front of thee My Master said if thou discernest him As when there breathes a heavy fog or when Our hemisphere is darkening into night
82-121544-0094	train-other-500	Appears far off a mill the wind is turning Methought that such a building then I saw And for the wind I drew myself behind My Guide because there was no other shelter
82-121544-0095	train-other-500	Now was I and with fear in verse I put it There where the shades were wholly covered up
none	none	 And glimmered through like unto straws in glass Some prone are lying 
82-121544-0096	train-other-500	others stand erect This with the head and that one with the soles Another bow like face to feet inverts When in advance so far we had proceeded
none	none	 That it my Master pleased to show to me 
82-121544-0097	train-other-500	The creature who once had the beauteous semblance
none	none	 He from before me moved 
82-121544-0098	train-other-500	and made me stop Saying Behold Dis and behold the place Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself How frozen I became and powerless then Ask it not Reader
none	none	 for I write it not Because all language would be insufficient I did not die and I alive remained not Think for thyself now hast thou aught of wit What I became 
82-121544-0099	train-other-500	being of both deprived The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous From his mid breast forth issued from the ice And better with a giant I compare Than do the giants with those arms of his
82-121544-0100	train-other-500	Consider now how great must be that whole
none	none	 Which unto such a part conforms itself Were he as fair once as he now is foul 
82-121544-0101	train-other-500	And lifted up his brow against his Maker
none	none	 Well may proceed from him all tribulation 
82-121544-0102	train-other-500	O what a marvel it appeared to me When I beheld three faces on his head The one in front and that vermilion was Two were the others that were joined with this
82-121544-0103	train-other-500	Above the middle part of either shoulder And they were joined together at the crest And the right hand one seemed twixt white and yellow The left was such to look upon as those Who come from where the Nile falls valley ward
82-121544-0104	train-other-500	Underneath each came forth two mighty wings
none	none	 Such as befitting were so great a bird 
82-121544-0105	train-other-500	Sails of the sea I never saw so large No feathers had they but as of a bat Their fashion was and he was waving them
none	none	 So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed With six eyes did he weep and down three chins Trickled the tear drops and the bloody drivel 
82-121544-0107	train-other-500	At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching A sinner in the manner of a brake So that he three of them tormented thus
none	none	 To him in front the biting was as naught Unto the clawing for sometimes the spine Utterly stripped of all the skin remained That soul up there 
82-121544-0108	train-other-500	which has the greatest pain The Master said is Judas Iscariot With head inside he plies his legs without Of the two others who head downward are
82-121544-0109	train-other-500	The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus See how he writhes himself and speaks no word And the other who so stalwart seems is Cassius But night is reascending
82-121544-0110	train-other-500	and tis time That we depart for we have seen the whole As seemed him good I clasped him round the neck
none	none	 And he the vantage seized of time and place 
82-121544-0111	train-other-500	And when the wings were opened wide apart He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides From fell to fell descended downward then Between the thick hair and the frozen crust
82-121544-0112	train-other-500	When we were come to where the thigh revolves Exactly on the thickness of the haunch The Guide with labour and with hard drawn breath
none	none	 Turned round his head where he had had his legs And grappled to the hair as one who mounts So that to Hell I thought we were returning Keep fast thy hold for by such stairs as these The Master said 
82-121544-0113	train-other-500	panting as one fatigued Must we perforce depart from so much evil Then through the opening of a rock he issued And down upon the margin seated me
82-121544-0114	train-other-500	Then tow rds me he outstretched his wary step I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see Lucifer in the same way I had left him And I beheld him upward hold his legs
82-121544-0115	train-other-500	And if I then became disquieted Let stolid people think who do not see What the point is beyond which I had passed Rise up the Master said upon thy feet
82-121544-0116	train-other-500	The way is long and difficult the road And now the sun to middle tierce returns It was not any palace corridor There where we were but dungeon natural
82-121544-0117	train-other-500	With floor uneven and unease of light Ere from the abyss I tear myself away My Master said I when I had arisen To draw me from an error speak a little
none	none	 Where is the ice and how is this one fixed Thus upside down and how in such short time From eve to morn has the sun made his transit And he to me 
82-121544-0118	train-other-500	Thou still imaginest Thou art beyond the centre where I grasped The hair of the fell worm who mines the world That side thou wast so long as I descended
none	none	 When round I turned me thou didst pass the point To which things heavy draw from every side 
82-121544-0119	train-other-500	And now beneath the hemisphere art come
none	none	 Opposite that which overhangs the vast Dry land 
82-121544-0120	train-other-500	and neath whose cope was put to death The Man who without sin was born and lived
none	none	 Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere Which makes the other face of the Judecca

better waters hoists its sail The little vessel of my genius now That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel And of that second kingdom will I sing Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy But let dead Poesy here rise again O holy Muses since that I am yours And here Calliope somewhat ascend My song accompanying with that sound Of which the miserable magpies felt The blow so great that they despaired of pardon Sweet colour of the oriental sapphire That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect Of the pure air as far as the first circle Unto mine eyes did recommence delight Soon as I issued forth from the dead air Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast The beauteous planet that to love incites Was making all the orient to laugh Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort To the right hand I turned and fixed my mind Upon the other pole and saw four stars Ne er seen before save by the primal people Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven O thou septentrional and widowed site Because thou art deprived of seeing these When from regarding them I had withdrawn Turning a little to the other pole There where the Wain had disappeared already I saw beside me an old man alone Worthy of so much reverence in his look That more owes not to father any son A long beard and with white hair intermingled He wore in semblance like unto the tresses Of which a double list fell on his breast The rays of the four consecrated stars Did so adorn his countenance with light That him I saw as were the sun before him Who are you ye who counter the blind river Have fled away from the eternal prison Moving those venerable plumes he said Who guided you or who has been your lamp In issuing forth out of the night profound That ever black makes the infernal valley The laws of the abyss are they thus broken Or is there changed in heaven some council new That being damned ye come unto my crags Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me And with his words and with his hands and signs Reverent he made in me my knees and brow Then answered him I came not of myself A Lady from Heaven descended at whose prayers I aided this one with my company But since it is thy will more be unfolded Of our condition how it truly is Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee This one has never his last evening seen But by his folly was so near to it That very little time was there to turn As I have said I unto him was sent To rescue him and other way was none Than this to which I have myself betaken I ve shown him all the people of perdition And now those spirits I intend to show Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship How I have brought him would be long to tell thee Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming He seeketh Liberty which is so dear As knoweth he who life for her refuses Thou know saint it since for her to thee not bitter Was death in Utica where thou didst leave The vesture that will shine so the great day By us the eternal edicts are not broken Since this one lives and Minos binds not me But of that circle I where are the chaste Eyes of thy Marcia who in looks still prays thee O holy breast to hold her as thine own For her love then incline thyself to us Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go I will take back this grace from thee to her If to be mentioned there below thou deignest Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes While I was on the other side then said he That every grace she wished of me I granted Now that she dwells beyond the evil river She can no longer move me by that law Which when I issued forth from there was made But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee As thou dost say no flattery is needful Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me Go then and see thou gird this one about With a smooth rush and that thou wash his face So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom For twere not fitting that the eye o ercast By any mist should go before the first Angel who is of those of Paradise This little island round about its base Below there yonder where the billow beats it Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze No other plant that putteth forth the leaf Or that doth indurate can there have life Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks Thereafter be not this way your return The sun which now is rising will direct you To take the mount by easier ascent With this he vanished and I raised me up Without a word and wholly drew myself Unto my Guide and turned mine eyes to him And he began Son follow thou my steps Let us turn back for on this side declines The plain unto its lower boundaries The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour Which fled before it so that from afar I recognised the trembling of the sea Along the solitary plain we went As one who unto the lost road returns And till he finds it seems to go in vain As soon as we were come to where the dew Fights with the sun and being in a part Where shadow falls little evaporates Both of his hands upon the grass outspread In gentle manner did my Master place Whence I who of his action was aware Extended unto him my tearful cheeks There did he make in me uncovered wholly That hue which Hell had covered up in me Then came we down upon the desert shore Which never yet saw navigate its waters Any that afterward had known return There he begirt me as the other pleased O marvellous for even as he culled The humble plant such it sprang up again Suddenly there where he uprooted it Purgatorio Canto II Already had the sun the horizon reached Whose circle of meridian covers o er Jerusalem with its most lofty point And night that opposite to him revolves Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth So that the white and the vermilion cheeks Of beautiful Aurora where I was By too great age were changing into orange We still were on the border of the sea Like people who are thinking of their road Who go in heart and with the body stay And lo as when upon the approach of morning Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red Down in the West upon the ocean floor Appeared to me may I again behold it A light along the sea so swiftly coming Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled From which when I a little had withdrawn Mine eyes that I might question my Conductor Again I saw it brighter grown and larger Then on each side of it appeared to me I knew not what of white and underneath it Little by little there came forth another My Master yet had uttered not a word While the first whiteness into wings unfolded But when he clearly recognised the pilot He cried Make haste make haste to bow the knee Behold the Angel of God fold thou thy hands Henceforward shalt thou see such officers See how he scorneth human arguments So that nor oar he wants nor other sail Than his own wings between so distant shores See how he holds them pointed up to heaven Fanning the air with the eternal pinions That do not moult themselves like mortal hair Then as still nearer and more near us came The Bird Divine more radiant he appeared So that near by the eye could not endure him But down I cast it and he came to shore With a small vessel very swift and light So that the water swallowed naught thereof Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot Beatitude seemed written in his face And more than a hundred spirits sat within In exitu Israel de Aegypto They chanted all together in one voice With whatso in that psalm is after written Then made he sign of holy rood upon them Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore And he departed swiftly as he came The throng which still remained there unfamiliar Seemed with the place all round about them gazing As one who in new matters makes essay On every side was darting forth the day The sun who had with his resplendent shafts From the mid heaven chased forth the Capricorn When the new people lifted up their faces Towards us saying to us If ye know Show us the way to go unto the mountain And answer made Virgilius Ye believe Perchance that we have knowledge of this place But we are strangers even as yourselves Just now we came a little while before you Another way which was so rough and steep That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us The souls who had from seeing me draw breath Become aware that I was still alive Pallid in their astonishment became And as to messenger who bears the olive The people throng to listen to the news And no one shows himself afraid of crowding So at the sight of me stood motionless Those fortunate spirits all of them as if Oblivious to go and make them fair One from among them saw I coming forward As to embrace me with such great affection That it incited me to do the like O empty shadows save in aspect only Three times behind it did I clasp my hands As oft returned with them to my own breast I think with wonder I depicted me Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew And I pursuing it pressed farther forward Gently it said that I should stay my steps Then knew I who it was and I entreated That it would stop awhile to speak with me It made reply to me Even as I loved thee In mortal body so I love thee free Therefore I stop but wherefore goest thou My own Casella to return once more There where I am I make this journey said I But how from thee has so much time be taken And he to me No outrage has been done me If he who takes both when and whom he pleases Has many times denied to me this passage For of a righteous will his own is made He sooth to say for three months past has taken Whoever wished to enter with all peace Whence I who now had turned unto that shore Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow Benignantly by him have been received Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed Because for evermore assemble there Those who tow rds Acheron do not descend And I If some new law take not from thee Memory or practice of the song of love Which used to quiet in me all my longings Thee may it please to comfort therewithal Somewhat this soul of mine that with its body Hitherward coming is so much distressed Love that within my mind discourses with me Forthwith began he so melodiously The melody within me still is sounding My Master and myself and all that people Which with him were appeared as satisfied As if naught else might touch the mind of any We all of us were moveless and attentive Unto his notes and lo the grave old man Exclaiming What is this ye laggard spirits What negligence what standing still is this Run to the mountain to strip off the slough That lets not God be manifest to you Even as when collecting grain or tares The doves together at their pasture met Quiet nor showing their accustomed pride If aught appear of which they are afraid Upon a sudden leave their food alone Because they are assailed by greater care So that fresh company did I behold The song relinquish and go tow rds the hill As one who goes and knows not whitherward Nor was our own departure less in haste Purgatorio Canto III Inasmuch as the instantaneous flight Had scattered them asunder o er the plain Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us I pressed me close unto my faithful comrade And how without him had I kept my course Who would have led me up along the mountain He seemed to me within himself remorseful O noble conscience and without a stain How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee After his feet had laid aside the haste Which mars the dignity of every act My mind that hitherto had been restrained Let loose its faculties as if delighted And I my sight directed to the hill That highest tow rds the heaven uplifts itself The sun that in our rear was flaming red Was broken in front of me into the figure Which had in me the stoppage of its rays Unto one side I turned me with the fear Of being left alone when I beheld Only in front of me the ground obscured Why dost thou still mistrust my Comforter Began to say to me turned wholly round Dost thou not think me with thee and that I guide thee Tis evening there already where is buried The body within which I cast a shadow Tis from Brundusium ta en and Naples has it Now if in front of me no shadow fall Marvel not at it more than at the heavens Because one ray impedeth not another To suffer torments both of cold and heat Bodies like this that Power provides which wills That how it works be not unveiled to us Insane is he who hopeth that our reason Can traverse the illimitable way Which the one Substance in three Persons follows Mortals remain contented at the Quia For if ye had been able to see all No need there were for Mary to give birth And ye have seen desiring without fruit Those whose desire would have been quieted Which evermore is given them for a grief I speak of Aristotle and of Plato And many others and here bowed his head And more he said not and remained disturbed We came meanwhile unto the mountain s foot There so precipitate we found the rock That nimble legs would there have been in vain Twixt Lerici and Turbia the most desert The most secluded pathway is a stair Easy and open if compared with that Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill Slopes down my Master said his footsteps staying So that who goeth without wings may mount And while he held his eyes upon the ground Examining the nature of the path And I was looking up around the rock On the left hand appeared to me a throng Of souls that moved their feet in our direction And did not seem to move they came so slowly Lift up thine eyes I to the Master said Behold on this side who will give us counsel If thou of thine own self can have it not Then he looked at me and with frank expression Replied Let us go there for they come slowly And thou be steadfast in thy hope sweet son Still was that people as far off from us After a thousand steps of ours I say As a good thrower with his hand would reach When they all crowded unto the hard masses Of the high bank and motionless stood and close As he stands still to look who goes in doubt O happy dead O spirits elect already Virgilius made beginning by that peace Which I believe is waiting for you all Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes So that the going up be possible For to lose time irks him most who most knows As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold By ones and twos and threes and the others stand Timidly holding down their eyes and nostrils And what the foremost does the others do Huddling themselves against her if she stop Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not So moving to approach us thereupon I saw the leader of that fortunate flock Modest in face and dignified in gait As soon as those in the advance saw broken The light upon the ground at my right side So that from me the shadow reached the rock They stopped and backward drew themselves somewhat And all the others who came after them Not knowing why nor wherefore did the same Without your asking I confess to you This is a human body which you see Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft Marvel ye not thereat but be persuaded That not without a power which comes from Heaven Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall The Master thus and said those worthy people Return ye then and enter in before us Making a signal with the back o the hand And one of them began Whoe er thou art Thus going turn thine eyes consider well If e er thou saw me in the other world I turned me tow rds him and looked at him closely Blond was he beautiful and of noble aspect But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided When with humility I had disclaimed E er having seen him Now behold he said And showed me high upon his breast a wound Then said he with a smile I am Manfredi The grandson of the Empress Costanza Therefore when thou returnest I beseech thee Go to my daughter beautiful the mother Of Sicily s honour and of Aragon s And the truth tell her if aught else be told After I had my body lacerated By these two mortal stabs I gave myself Weeping to Him who willingly doth pardon Horrible my iniquities had been But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms That it receives whatever turns to it Had but Cosenza s pastor who in chase Of me was sent by Clement at that time In God read understandingly this page The bones of my dead body still would be At the bridge head near unto Benevento Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn Now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind Beyond the realm almost beside the Verde Where he transported them with tapers quenched By malison of theirs is not so lost Eternal Love that it cannot return So long as hope has anything of green True is it who in contumacy dies Of Holy Church though penitent at last Must wait upon the outside this bank Thirty times told the time that he has been In his presumption unless such decree Shorter by means of righteous prayers become See now if thou hast power to make me happy By making known unto my good Costanza How thou hast seen me and this ban beside For those on earth can much advance us here Purgatorio Canto IV Whenever by delight or else by pain That seizes any faculty of ours Wholly to that the soul collects itself It seemeth that no other power it heeds And this against that error is which thinks One soul above another kindles in us And hence whenever aught is heard or seen Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it Time passes on and we perceive it not Because one faculty is that which listens And other that which the soul keeps entire This is as if in bonds and that is free Of this I had experience positive In hearing and in gazing at that spirit For fifty full degrees uprisen was The sun and I had not perceived it when We came to where those souls with one accord Cried out unto us Here is what you ask A greater opening ofttimes hedges up With but a little forkful of his thorns The villager what time the grape imbrowns Than was the passage way through which ascended Only my Leader and myself behind him After that company departed from us One climbs Sanleo and descends in Noli And mounts the summit of Bismantova With feet alone but here one needs must fly With the swift pinions and the plumes I say Of great desire conducted after him Who gave me hope and made a light for me We mounted upward through the rifted rock And on each side the border pressed upon us And feet and hands the ground beneath required When we were come upon the upper rim Of the high bank out on the open slope My Master said I what way shall we take And he to me No step of thine descend Still up the mount behind me win thy way Till some sage escort shall appear to us The summit was so high it vanquished sight And the hillside precipitous far more Than line from middle quadrant to the centre Spent with fatigue was I when I began O my sweet Father turn thee and behold How I remain alone unless thou stay O son he said up yonder drag thyself Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher Which on that side encircles all the hill These words of his so spurred me on that I Strained every nerve behind him scrambling up Until the circle was beneath my feet Thereon ourselves we seated both of us Turned to the East from which we had ascended For all men are delighted to look back To the low shores mine eyes I first directed Then to the sun uplifted them and wondered That on the left hand we were smitten by it The Poet well perceived that I was wholly Bewildered at the chariot of the light Where twixt us and the Aquilon it entered Whereon he said to me If Castor and Pollux Were in the company of yonder mirror That up and down conducteth with its light Thou wouldst behold the zodiac s jagged wheel Revolving still more near unto the Bears Unless it swerved aside from its old track How that may be wouldst thou have power to think Collected in thyself imagine Zion Together with this mount on earth to stand So that they both one sole horizon have And hemispheres diverse whereby the road Which Phaeton alas knew not to drive Thou lieutenant see how of necessity must pass This on one side when that upon the other If thine intelligence right clearly heed Truly my Master said I never yet Saw I so clearly as I now discern There where my wit appeared incompetent That the mid circle of supernal motion Which in some art is the Equator called And aye remains between the Sun and Winter For reason which thou sayest departeth hence Tow rds the Septentrion what time the Hebrews Beheld it tow rds the region of the heat But if it pleaseth thee I fain would learn How far we have to go for the hill rises Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise And he to me This mount is such that ever At the beginning down below tis tiresome And aye the more one climbs the less it hurts Therefore when it shall seem so pleasant to thee That going up shall be to thee as easy As going down the current in a boat Then at this pathway s ending thou wilt be There to repose thy panting breath expect No more I answer and this I know for true And as he finished uttering these words A voice close by us sounded Peradventure Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that At sound thereof each one of us turned round And saw upon the left hand a great rock Which neither I nor he before had noticed Thither we drew and there were persons there Who in the shadow stood behind the rock As one through indolence is wont to stand And one of them who seemed to me fatigued Was sitting down and both his knees embraced Holding his face low down between them bowed O my sweet Lord I said do turn thine eye On him who shows himself more negligent Then even Sloth herself his sister were Then he turned round to us and he gave heed Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh And said Now go thou up for thou art valiant Then knew I who he was and the distress That still a little did my breathing quicken My going to him hindered not and after I came to him he hardly raised his head Saying Hast thou seen clearly how the sun O er thy left shoulder drives his chariot His sluggish attitude and his curt words A little unto laughter moved my lips Then I began Belacqua I grieve not For thee henceforth but tell me wherefore seated In this place art thou Waitest thou an escort Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee And he O brother what s the use of climbing Since to my torment would not let me go The Angel of God who sitteth at the gate First heaven must needs so long revolve me round Outside thereof as in my life it did Since the good sighs I to the end postponed Unless e er that some prayer may bring me aid Which rises from a heart that lives in grace What profit others that in heaven are heard not Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting And saying Come now see the sun has touched Meridian and from the shore the night Covers already with her foot Morocco Purgatorio Canto V I had already from those shades departed And followed in the footsteps of my Guide When from behind pointing his finger at me One shouted See it seems as if shone not The sunshine on the left of him below And like one living seems he to conduct him Mine eyes I turned at utterance of these words And saw them watching with astonishment But me but me and the light which was broken Why doth thy mind so occupy itself The Master said that thou thy pace dost slacken What matters it to thee what here is whispered Come after me and let the people talk Stand like a steadfast tower that never wags Its top for all the blowing of the winds For evermore the man in whom is springing Thought upon thought removes from him the mark Because the force of one the other weakens What could I say in answer but I come I said it somewhat with that colour tinged Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy Meanwhile along the mountain side across Came people in advance of us a little Singing the Miserere verse by verse When they became aware I gave no place For passage of the sunshine through my body They changed their song into a long hoarse Oh And two of them in form of messengers Ran forth to meet us and demanded of us Of your condition make us cognisant And said my Master Ye can go your way And carry back again to those who sent you That this one s body is of very flesh If they stood still because they saw his shadow As I suppose enough is answered them Him let them honour it may profit them Vapours enkindled saw I ne er so swiftly At early nightfall cleave the air serene Nor at the set of sun the clouds of August But upward they returned in briefer time And on arriving with the others wheeled Tow rds us like troops that run without a rein This folk that presses unto us is great And cometh to implore thee said the Poet So still go onward and in going listen O soul that goest to beatitude With the same members wherewith thou wast born Shouting they came a little stay thy steps Look if thou e er hast any of us seen So that o er yonder thou bear news of him Ah why dost thou go on Ah why not stay Long since we all were slain by violence And sinners even to the latest hour Then did a light from heaven admonish us So that both penitent and pardoning forth From life we issued reconciled to God Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts And I Although I gaze into your faces No one I recognize but if may please you Aught I have power to do ye well born spirits Speak ye and I will do it by that peace Which following the feet of such a Guide From world to world makes itself sought by me And one began Each one has confidence In thy good offices without an oath Unless the I cannot cut off the I will Whence I who speak alone before the others Pray thee if ever thou dost see the land That twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles Thou be so courteous to me of thy prayers In Fano that they pray for me devoutly That I may purge away my grave offences From thence was I but the deep wounds through which Issued the blood wherein I had my seat Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori There where I thought to be the most secure Twas he of Este had it done who held me In hatred far beyond what justice willed But if towards the Mira I had fled When I was overtaken at Oriaco I still should be o er yonder where men breathe I ran to the lagoon and reeds and mire Did so entangle me I fell and saw there A lake made from my veins upon the ground Then said another Ah be that desire Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain As thou with pious pity aidest mine I was of Montefeltro and am Buonconte Giovanna nor none other cares for me Hence among these I go with downcast front And I to him What violence or what chance Led thee astray so far from Campaldino That never has thy sepulture been known Oh he replied at Casentino s foot A river crosses named Archiano born Above the Hermitage in Apennine There where the name thereof becometh void Did I arrive pierced through and through the throat Fleeing on foot and bloodying the plain There my sight lost I and my utterance Ceased in the name of Mary and thereat I fell and tenantless my flesh remained Truth will I speak repeat it to the living God s Angel took me up and he of hell Shouted O thou from heaven why dost thou rob me Thou bearest away the eternal part of him For one poor little tear that takes him from me But with the rest I ll deal in other fashion Well knowest thou how in the air is gathered That humid vapour which to water turns Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it He joined that evil will which aye seeks evil To intellect and moved the mist and wind By means of power which his own nature gave Thereafter when the day was spent the valley From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered With fog and made the heaven above intent So that the pregnant air to water changed Down fell the rain and to the gullies came Whate er of it earth tolerated not And as it mingled with the mighty torrents Towards the royal river with such speed It headlong rushed that nothing held it back My frozen body near unto its outlet The robust Archian found and into Arno Thrust it and loosened from my breast the cross I made of me when agony o ercame me It rolled me on the banks and on the bottom Then with its booty covered and begirt me Ah when thou hast returned unto the world And rested thee from thy long journeying After the second followed the third spirit Do thou remember me who am the Pia Siena made me unmade me Maremma He knoweth it who had encircled first Espousing me my finger with his gem Purgatorio Canto VI Whene er is broken up the game of Zara He who has lost remains behind despondent The throws repeating and in sadness learns The people with the other all depart One goes in front and one behind doth pluck him And at his side one brings himself to mind He pauses not and this and that one hears They crowd no more to whom his hand he stretches And from the throng he thus defends himself Even such was I in that dense multitude Turning to them this way and that my face And promising I freed myself therefrom There was the Aretine who from the arms Untamed of Ghin di Tacco had his death And he who fleeing from pursuit was drowned There was imploring with his hands outstretched Frederick Novello and that one of Pisa Who made the good Marzucco seem so strong I saw Count Orso and the soul divided By hatred and by envy from its body As it declared and not for crime committed Pierre de la Brosse I say and here provide While still on earth the Lady of Brabant So that for this she be of no worse flock As soon as I was free from all those shades Who only prayed that some one else may pray So as to hasten their becoming holy Began I It appears that thou deniest O light of mine expressly in some text That orison can bend decree of Heaven And ne ertheless these people pray for this Might then their expectation bootless be Or is to me thy saying not quite clear And he to me My writing is explicit And not fallacious is the hope of these If with sane intellect tis well regarded For top of judgment doth not vail itself Because the fire of love fulfils at once What he must satisfy who here installs him And there where I affirmed that proposition Defect was not amended by a prayer Because the prayer from God was separate Verily in so deep a questioning Do not decide unless she tell it thee Who light twixt truth and intellect shall be I know not if thou understand I speak Of Beatrice her shalt thou see above Smiling and happy on this mountain s top And I Good Leader let us make more haste For I no longer tire me as before And see e en now the hill a shadow casts We will go forward with this day he answered As far as now is possible for us But otherwise the fact is than thou thinkest Ere thou art up there thou shalt see return Him who now hides himself behind the hill So that thou dost not interrupt his rays But yonder there behold a soul that stationed All all alone is looking hitherward It will point out to us the quickest way We came up unto it O Lombard soul How lofty and disdainful thou didst bear thee And grand and slow in moving of thine eyes Nothing whatever did it say to us But let us go our way eying us only After the manner of a couchant lion Still near to it Virgilius drew entreating That it would point us out the best ascent And it replied not unto his demand But of our native land and of our life It questioned us and the sweet Guide began Mantua and the shade all in itself recluse Rose tow rds him from the place where first it was Saying O Mantuan I am Sordello Of thine own land and one embraced the other Ah servile Italy grief s hostelry A ship without a pilot in great tempest No Lady thou of Provinces but brothel That noble soul was so impatient only At the sweet sound of his own native land To make its citizen glad welcome there And now within thee are not without war Thy living ones and one doth gnaw the other Of those whom one wall and one fosse shut in Search wretched one all round about the shores Thy seaboard and then look within thy bosom If any part of thee enjoyeth peace What boots it that for thee Justinian The bridle mend if empty be the saddle Withouten this the shame would be the less Ah people thou that oughtest to be devout And to let Caesar sit upon the saddle If well thou hearest what God teacheth thee Behold how fell this wild beast has become Being no longer by the spur corrected Since thou hast laid thy hand upon the bridle O German Albert who abandonest Her that has grown recalcitrant and savage And oughtest to bestride her saddle bow May a just judgment from the stars down fall Upon thy blood and be it new and open That thy successor may have fear thereof Because thy father and thyself have suffered By greed of those transalpine lands distrained The garden of the empire to be waste Come and behold Montecchi and Cappelletti Monaldi and Fillippeschi careless man Those sad already and these doubt depressed Come cruel one come and behold the oppression Of thy nobility and cure their wounds And thou shalt see how safe is Santafiore Come and behold thy Rome that is lamenting Widowed alone and day and night exclaims My Caesar why hast thou forsaken me Come and behold how loving are the people And if for us no pity moveth thee Come and be made ashamed of thy renown And if it lawful be O Jove Supreme Who upon earth for us wast crucified Are thy just eyes averted otherwhere Or preparation is t that in the abyss Of thine own counsel for some good thou makest From our perception utterly cut off For all the towns of Italy are full Of tyrants and becometh a Marcellus Each peasant churl who plays the partisan My Florence well mayst thou contented be With this digression which concerns thee not Thanks to thy people who such forethought take Many at heart have justice but shoot slowly That unadvised they come not to the bow But on their very lips thy people have it Many refuse to bear the common burden But thy solicitous people answereth Without being asked and crieth I submit Now be thou joyful for thou hast good reason Thou affluent thou in peace thou full of wisdom If I speak true the event conceals it not Athens and Lacedaemon they who made The ancient laws and were so civilized Made towards living well a little sign Compared with thee who makest such fine spun Provisions that to middle of November Reaches not what thou in October spinnest How oft within the time of thy remembrance Laws money offices and usages Hast thou remodelled and renewed thy members And if thou mind thee well and see the light Thou shalt behold thyself like a sick woman Who cannot find repose upon her down But by her tossing wardeth off her pain Purgatorio Canto VII After the gracious and glad salutations Had three and four times been reiterated Sordello backward drew and said Who are you Or ever to this mountain were directed The souls deserving to ascend to God My bones were buried by Octavian I am Virgilius and for no crime else Did I lose heaven than for not having faith In this wise then my Leader made reply As one who suddenly before him sees Something whereat he marvels who believes And yet does not saying It is it is not So he appeared and then bowed down his brow And with humility returned towards him And where inferiors embrace embraced him O glory of the Latians thou he said Through whom our language showed what it could do O pride eternal of the place I came from What merit or what grace to me reveals thee If I to hear thy words be worthy tell me If thou dost come from Hell and from what cloister Through all the circles of the doleful realm Responded he have I come hitherward Heaven s power impelled me and with that I come I by not doing not by doing lost The sight of that high sun which thou desirest And which too late by me was recognized A place there is below not sad with torments But darkness only where the lamentations Have not the sound of wailing but are sighs There dwell I with the little innocents Snatched by the teeth of Death or ever they Were from our human sinfulness exempt There dwell I among those who the three saintly Virtues did not put on and without vice The others knew and followed all of them But if thou know and can some indication Give us by which we may the sooner come Where Purgatory has its right beginning He answered No fixed place has been assigned us Tis lawful for me to go up and round So far as I can go as guide I join thee But see already how the day declines And to go up by night we are not able Therefore tis well to think of some fair sojourn Souls are there on the right hand here withdrawn If thou permit me I will lead thee to them And thou shalt know them not without delight How is this was the answer should one wish To mount by night would he prevented be By others or mayhap would not have power And on the ground the good Sordello drew His finger saying See this line alone Thou couldst not pass after the sun is gone Not that aught else would hindrance give however To going up save the nocturnal darkness This with the want of power the will perplexes We might indeed therewith return below And wandering walk the hill side round about While the horizon holds the day imprisoned Thereon my Lord as if in wonder said Do thou conduct us thither where thou sayest That we can take delight in tarrying Little had we withdrawn us from that place When I perceived the mount was hollowed out In fashion as the valleys here are hollowed Thitherward said that shade will we repair Where of itself the hill side makes a lap And there for the new day will we await Twixt hill and plain there was a winding path Which led us to the margin of that dell Where dies the border more than half away Gold and fine silver and scarlet and pearl white The Indian wood resplendent and serene Fresh emerald the moment it is broken By herbage and by flowers within that hollow Planted each one in colour would be vanquished As by its greater vanquished is the less Nor in that place had nature painted only But of the sweetness of a thousand odours Made there a mingled fragrance and unknown Salve Regina on the green and flowers There seated singing spirits I beheld Which were not visible outside the valley Before the scanty sun now seeks his nest Began the Mantuan who had led us thither Among them do not wish me to conduct you Better from off this ledge the acts and faces Of all of them will you discriminate Than in the plain below received among them He who sits highest and the semblance bears Of having what he should have done neglected And to the others song moves not his lips Rudolph the Emperor was who had the power To heal the wounds that Italy have slain So that through others slowly she revives The other who in look doth comfort him Governed the region where the water springs The Moldau bears the Elbe and Elbe the sea His name was Ottocar and in swaddling clothes Far better he than bearded Winceslaus His son who feeds in luxury and ease And the small nosed who close in council seems With him that has an aspect so benign Died fleeing and disflowering the lily Look there how he is beating at his breast Behold the other one who for his cheek Sighing has made of his own palm a bed Father and father in law of France s Pest Are they and know his vicious life and lewd And hence proceeds the grief that so doth pierce them He who appears so stalwart and chimes in Singing with that one of the manly nose The cord of every valour wore begirt And if as King had after him remained The stripling who in rear of him is sitting Well had the valour passed from vase to vase Which cannot of the other heirs be said Frederick and Jacomo possess the realms But none the better heritage possesses Not oftentimes upriseth through the branches The probity of man and this He wills Who gives it so that we may ask of Him Eke to the large nosed reach my words no less Than to the other Pier who with him sings Whence Provence and Apulia grieve already The plant is as inferior to its seed As more than Beatrice and Margaret Costanza boasteth of her husband still Behold the monarch of the simple life Harry of England sitting there alone He in his branches has a better issue He who the lowest on the ground among them Sits looking upward is the Marquis William For whose sake Alessandria and her war Make Monferrat and Canavese weep Purgatorio Canto VIII Twas now the hour that turneth back desire In those who sail the sea and melts the heart The day they ve said to their sweet friends farewell And the new pilgrim penetrates with love If he doth hear from far away a bell That seemeth to deplore the dying day When I began to make of no avail My hearing and to watch one of the souls Uprisen that begged attention with its hand It joined and lifted upward both its palms Fixing its eyes upon the orient As if it said to God Naught else I care for Te lucis ante so devoutly issued Forth from its mouth and with such dulcet notes It made me issue forth from my own mind And then the others sweetly and devoutly Accompanied it through all the hymn entire Having their eyes on the supernal wheels Here Reader fix thine eyes well on the truth For now indeed so subtile is the veil Surely to penetrate within is easy I saw that army of the gentle born Thereafterward in silence upward gaze As if in expectation pale and humble And from on high come forth and down descend I saw two Angels with two flaming swords Truncated and deprived of their points Green as the little leaflets just now born Their garments were which by their verdant pinions Beaten and blown abroad they trailed behind One just above us came to take his station And one descended to the opposite bank So that the people were contained between them Clearly in them discerned I the blond head But in their faces was the eye bewildered As faculty confounded by excess From Mary s bosom both of them have come Sordello said as guardians of the valley Against the serpent that will come anon Whereupon I who knew not by what road Turned round about and closely drew myself Utterly frozen to the faithful shoulders And once again Sordello Now descend we Mid the grand shades and we will speak to them Right pleasant will it be for them to see you Only three steps I think that I descended And was below and saw one who was looking Only at me as if he fain would know me Already now the air was growing dark But not so that between his eyes and mine It did not show what it before locked up Tow rds me he moved and I tow rds him did move Noble Judge Nino how it me delighted When I beheld thee not among the damned No greeting fair was left unsaid between us Then asked he How long is it since thou camest O er the far waters to the mountain s foot Oh said I to him through the dismal places I came this morn and am in the first life Albeit the other going thus I gain And on the instant my reply was heard He and Sordello both shrank back from me Like people who are suddenly bewildered One to Virgilius and the other turned To one who sat there crying Up Currado Come and behold what God in grace has willed Then turned to me By that especial grace Thou owest unto Him who so conceals His own first wherefore that it has no ford When thou shalt be beyond the waters wide Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me Where answer to the innocent is made I do not think her mother loves me more Since she has laid aside her wimple white Which she unhappy needs must wish again Through her full easily is comprehended How long in woman lasts the fire of love If eye or touch do not relight it often So fair a hatchment will not make for her The Viper marshalling the Milanese A field as would have made Gallura s Cock In this wise spake he with the stamp impressed Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal Which measurably burneth in the heart My greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven Still to that point where slowest are the stars Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle And my Conductor Son what dost thou gaze at Up there And I to him At those three torches With which this hither pole is all on fire And he to me The four resplendent stars Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low And these have mounted up to where those were As he was speaking to himself Sordello Drew him and said Lo there our Adversary And pointed with his finger to look thither Upon the side on which the little valley No barrier hath a serpent was perchance The same which gave to Eve the bitter food Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak Turning at times its head about and licking Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself I did not see and therefore cannot say How the celestial falcons gan to move But well I saw that they were both in motion Hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings The serpent fled and round the Angels wheeled Up to their stations flying back alike The shade that to the Judge had near approached When he had called throughout that whole assault Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me So may the light that leadeth thee on high Find in thine own free will as much of wax As needful is up to the highest azure Began it if some true intelligence Of Valdimagra or its neighbourhood Thou knowest tell it me who once was great there Currado Malaspina was I called I m not the elder but from him descended To mine I bore the love which here refineth O said I unto him through your domains I never passed but where is there a dwelling Throughout all Europe where they are not known That fame which doeth honour to your house Proclaims its Signors and proclaims its land So that he knows of them who ne er was there And as I hope for heaven I swear to you Your honoured family in naught abates The glory of the purse and of the sword It is so privileged by use and nature That though a guilty head misguide the world Sole it goes right and scorns the evil way And he Now go for the sun shall not lie Seven times upon the pillow which the Ram With all his four feet covers and bestrides Before that such a courteous opinion Shall in the middle of thy head be nailed With greater nails than of another s speech Unless the course of justice standeth still Purgatorio Canto IX The concubine of old Tithonus now Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour With gems her forehead all relucent was Set in the shape of that cold animal Which with its tail doth smite amain the nations And of the steps with which she mounts the Night Had taken two in that place where we were And now the third was bending down its wings When I who something had of Adam in me Vanquished by sleep upon the grass reclined There were all five of us already sat Just at the hour when her sad lay begins The little swallow near unto the morning Perchance in memory of her former woes And when the mind of man a wanderer More from the flesh and less by thought imprisoned Almost prophetic in its visions is In dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended An eagle in the sky with plumes of gold With wings wide open and intent to stoop And this it seemed to me was where had been By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned When to the high consistory he was rapt I thought within myself perchance he strikes From habit only here and from elsewhere Disdains to bear up any in his feet Then wheeling somewhat more it seemed to me Terrible as the lightning he descended And snatched me upward even to the fire Therein it seemed that he and I were burning And the imagined fire did scorch me so That of necessity my sleep was broken Not otherwise Achilles started up Around him turning his awakened eyes And knowing not the place in which he was What time from Chiron stealthily his mother Carried him sleeping in her arms to Scyros Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards Than I upstarted when from off my face Sleep fled away and pallid I became As doth the man who freezes with affright Only my Comforter was at my side And now the sun was more than two hours high And turned towards the sea shore was my face Be not intimidated said my Lord Be reassured for all is well with us Do not restrain but put forth all thy strength Thou hast at length arrived at Purgatory See there the cliff that closes it around See there the entrance where it seems disjoined Whilom at dawn which doth precede the day When inwardly thy spirit was asleep Upon the flowers that deck the land below There came a Lady and said I am Lucia Let me take this one up who is asleep So will I make his journey easier for him Sordello and the other noble shapes Remained she took thee and as day grew bright Upward she came and I upon her footsteps She laid thee here and first her beauteous eyes That open entrance pointed out to me Then she and sleep together went away In guise of one whose doubts are reassured And who to confidence his fear doth change After the truth has been discovered to him So did I change and when without disquiet My Leader saw me up along the cliff He moved and I behind him tow rd the height Reader thou seest well how I exalt My theme and therefore if with greater art I fortify it marvel not thereat Nearer approached we and were in such place That there where first appeared to me a rift Like to a crevice that disparts a wall I saw a portal and three stairs beneath Diverse in colour to go up to it And a gate keeper who yet spake no word And as I opened more and more mine eyes I saw him seated on the highest stair Such in the face that I endured it not And in his hand he had a naked sword Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow rds us That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes Tell it from where you are what is t you wish Began he to exclaim where is the escort Take heed your coming hither harm you not A Lady of Heaven with these things conversant My Master answered him but even now Said to us Thither go there is the portal And may she speed your footsteps in all good Again began the courteous janitor Come forward then unto these stairs of ours Thither did we approach and the first stair Was marble white so polished and so smooth I mirrored myself therein as I appear The second tinct of deeper hue than perse Was of a calcined and uneven stone Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across The third that uppermost rests massively Porphyry seemed to me as flaming red As blood that from a vein is spirting forth Both of his feet was holding upon this The Angel of God upon the threshold seated Which seemed to me a stone of diamond Along the three stairs upward with good will Did my Conductor draw me saying Ask Humbly that he the fastening may undo Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me For mercy s sake besought that he would open But first upon my breast three times I smote Seven P s upon my forehead he described With the sword s point and Take heed that thou wash These wounds when thou shalt be within he said Ashes or earth that dry is excavated Of the same colour were with his attire And from beneath it he drew forth two keys One was of gold and the other was of silver First with the white and after with the yellow Plied he the door so that I was content Whenever faileth either of these keys So that it turn not rightly in the lock He said to us this entrance doth not open More precious one is but the other needs More art and intellect ere it unlock For it is that which doth the knot unloose From Peter I have them and he bade me err Rather in opening than in keeping shut If people but fall down before my feet Then pushed the portals of the sacred door Exclaiming Enter but I give you warning That forth returns whoever looks behind And when upon their hinges were turned round The swivels of that consecrated gate Which are of metal massive and sonorous Roared not so loud nor so discordant seemed Tarpeia when was ta en from it the good Metellus wherefore meagre it remained At the first thunder peal I turned attentive And Te Deum laudamus seemed to hear In voices mingled with sweet melody Exactly such an image rendered me That which I heard as we are wont to catch When people singing with the organ stand For now we hear and now hear not the words Purgatorio Canto X When we had crossed the threshold of the door Which the perverted love of souls disuses Because it makes the crooked way seem straight Re echoing I heard it closed again And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it What for my failing had been fit excuse We mounted upward through a rifted rock Which undulated to this side and that Even as a wave receding and advancing Here it behoves us use a little art Began my Leader to adapt ourselves Now here now there to the receding side And this our footsteps so infrequent made That sooner had the moon s decreasing disk Regained its bed to sink again to rest Than we were forth from out that needle s eye But when we free and in the open were There where the mountain backward piles itself I wearied out and both of us uncertain About our way we stopped upon a plain More desolate than roads across the deserts From where its margin borders on the void To foot of the high bank that ever rises A human body three times told would measure And far as eye of mine could wing its flight Now on the left and on the right flank now The same this cornice did appear to me Thereon our feet had not been moved as yet When I perceived the embankment round about Which all right of ascent had interdicted To be of marble white and so adorned With sculptures that not only Polycletus But Nature s self had there been put to shame The Angel who came down to earth with tidings Of peace that had been wept for many a year And opened Heaven from its long interdict In front of us appeared so truthfully There sculptured in a gracious attitude He did not seem an image that is silent One would have sworn that he was saying Ave For she was there in effigy portrayed Who turned the key to ope the exalted love And in her mien this language had impressed Ecce ancilla Dei as distinctly As any figure stamps itself in wax Keep not thy mind upon one place alone The gentle Master said who had me standing Upon that side where people have their hearts Whereat I moved mine eyes and I beheld In rear of Mary and upon that side Where he was standing who conducted me Another story on the rock imposed Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near So that before mine eyes it might be set There sculptured in the self same marble were The cart and oxen drawing the holy ark Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed People appeared in front and all of them In seven choirs divided of two senses Made one say No the other Yes they sing Likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense Which there was imaged forth the eyes and nose Were in the yes and no discordant made Preceded there the vessel benedight Dancing with girded loins the humble Psalmist And more and less than King was he in this Opposite represented at the window Of a great palace Michal looked upon him Even as a woman scornful and afflicted I moved my feet from where I had been standing To examine near at hand another story Which after Michal glimmered white upon me There the high glory of the Roman Prince Was chronicled whose great beneficence Moved Gregory to his great victory Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking And a poor widow at his bridle stood In attitude of weeping and of grief Around about him seemed it thronged and full Of cavaliers and the eagles in the gold Above them visibly in the wind were moving The wretched woman in the midst of these Seemed to be saying Give me vengeance Lord For my dead son for whom my heart is breaking And he to answer her Now wait until I shall return And she My Lord like one In whom grief is impatient shouldst thou not Return And he Who shall be where I am Will give it thee And she Good deed of others What boots it thee if thou neglect thine own Whence he Now comfort thee for it behoves me That I discharge my duty ere I move Justice so wills and pity doth retain me He who on no new thing has ever looked Was the creator of this visible language Novel to us for here it is not found While I delighted me in contemplating The images of such humility And dear to look on for their Maker s sake Behold upon this side but rare they make Their steps the Poet murmured many people These will direct us to the lofty stairs Mine eyes that in beholding were intent To see new things of which they curious are In turning round towards him were not slow But still I wish not Reader thou shouldst swerve From thy good purposes because thou hearest How God ordaineth that the debt be paid Attend not to the fashion of the torment Think of what follows think that at the worst It cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence Master began I that which I behold Moving towards us seems to me not persons And what I know not so in sight I waver And he to me The grievous quality Of this their torment bows them so to earth That my own eyes at first contended with it But look there fixedly and disentangle By sight what cometh underneath those stones Already canst thou see how each is stricken O ye proud Christians wretched weary ones Who in the vision of the mind infirm Confidence have in your backsliding steps Do ye not comprehend that we are worms Born to bring forth the angelic butterfly That flieth unto judgment without screen Why floats aloft your spirit high in air Like are ye unto insects undeveloped Even as the worm in whom formation fails As to sustain a ceiling or a roof In place of corbel oftentimes a figure Is seen to join its knees unto its breast Which makes of the unreal real anguish Arise in him who sees it fashioned thus Beheld I those when I had ta en good heed True is it they were more or less bent down According as they more or less were laden And he who had most patience in his looks Weeping did seem to say I can no more Purgatorio Canto XI Our Father thou who dwellest in the heavens Not circumscribed but from the greater love Thou bearest to the first effects on high Praised be thy name and thine omnipotence By every creature as befitting is To render thanks to thy sweet effluence Come unto us the peace of thy dominion For unto it we cannot of ourselves If it come not with all our intellect Even as thine own Angels of their will Make sacrifice to thee Hosanna singing So may all men make sacrifice of theirs Give unto us this day our daily manna Withouten which in this rough wilderness Backward goes he who toils most to advance And even as we the trespass we have suffered Pardon in one another pardon thou Benignly and regard not our desert Our virtue which is easily o ercome Put not to proof with the old Adversary But thou from him who spurs it so deliver This last petition verily dear Lord Not for ourselves is made who need it not But for their sake who have remained behind us Thus for themselves and us good furtherance Those shades imploring went beneath a weight Like unto that of which we sometimes dream Unequally in anguish round and round And weary all upon that foremost cornice Purging away the smoke stains of the world If there good words are always said for us What may not here be said and done for them By those who have a good root to their will Well may we help them wash away the marks That hence they carried so that clean and light They may ascend unto the starry wheels Ah so may pity and justice you disburden Soon that ye may have power to move the wing That shall uplift you after your desire Show us on which hand tow rd the stairs the way Is shortest and if more than one the passes Point us out that which least abruptly falls For he who cometh with me through the burden Of Adam s flesh wherewith he is invested Against his will is chary of his climbing The words of theirs which they returned to those That he whom I was following had spoken It was not manifest from whom they came But it was said To the right hand come with us Along the bank and ye shall find a pass Possible for living person to ascend And were I not impeded by the stone Which this proud neck of mine doth subjugate Whence I am forced to hold my visage down Him who still lives and does not name himself Would I regard to see if I may know him And make him piteous unto this burden A Latian was I and born of a great Tuscan Guglielmo Aldobrandeschi was my father I know not if his name were ever with you The ancient blood and deeds of gallantry Of my progenitors so arrogant made me That thinking not upon the common mother All men I held in scorn to such extent I died therefor as know the Sienese And every child in Campagnatico I am Omberto and not to me alone Has pride done harm but all my kith and kin Has with it dragged into adversity And here must I this burden bear for it Till God be satisfied since I did not Among the living here among the dead Listening I downward bent my countenance And one of them not this one who was speaking Twisted himself beneath the weight that cramps him And looked at me and knew me and called out Keeping his eyes laboriously fixed On me who all bowed down was going with them O asked I him art thou not Oderisi Agobbio s honour and honour of that art Which is in Paris called illuminating Brother said he more laughing are the leaves Touched by the brush of Franco Bolognese All his the honour now and mine in part In sooth I had not been so courteous While I was living for the great desire Of excellence on which my heart was bent Here of such pride is paid the forfeiture And yet I should not be here were it not That having power to sin I turned to God O thou vain glory of the human powers How little green upon thy summit lingers If t be not followed by an age of grossness In painting Cimabue thought that he Should hold the field now Giotto has the cry So that the other s fame is growing dim So has one Guido from the other taken The glory of our tongue and he perchance Is born who from the nest shall chase them both Naught is this mundane rumour but a breath Of wind that comes now this way and now that And changes name because it changes side What fame shalt thou have more if old peel off From thee thy flesh than if thou hadst been dead Before thou left the pappo and the dindi Ere pass a thousand years which is a shorter Space to the eterne than twinkling of an eye Unto the circle that in heaven wheels slowest With him who takes so little of the road In front of me all Tuscany resounded And now he scarce is lisped of in Siena Where he was lord what time was overthrown The Florentine delirium that superb Was at that day as now tis prostitute Your reputation is the colour of grass Which comes and goes and that discolours it By which it issues green from out the earth And I Thy true speech fills my heart with good Humility and great tumour thou assuagest But who is he of whom just now thou spakest That he replied is Provenzan Salvani And he is here because he had presumed To bring Siena all into his hands He has gone thus and goeth without rest E er since he died such money renders back In payment he who is on earth too daring And I If every spirit who awaits The verge of life before that he repent Remains below there and ascends not hither Unless good orison shall him bestead Until as much time as he lived be passed How was the coming granted him in largess When he in greatest splendour lived said he Freely upon the Campo of Siena All shame being laid aside he placed himself And there to draw his friend from the duress Which in the prison house of Charles he suffered He brought himself to tremble in each vein I say no more and know that I speak darkly Yet little time shall pass before thy neighbours Will so demean themselves that thou canst gloss it This action has released him from those confines Purgatorio Canto XII Abreast like oxen going in a yoke I with that heavy laden soul went on As long as the sweet pedagogue permitted But when he said Leave him and onward pass For here tis good that with the sail and oars As much as may be each push on his barque Upright as walking wills it I redressed My person notwithstanding that my thoughts Remained within me downcast and abashed I had moved on and followed willingly The footsteps of my Master and we both Already showed how light of foot we were When unto me he said Cast down thine eyes Twere well for thee to alleviate the way To look upon the bed beneath thy feet As that some memory may exist of them Above the buried dead their tombs in earth Bear sculptured on them what they were before Whence often there we weep for them afresh From pricking of remembrance which alone To the compassionate doth set its spur So saw I there but of a better semblance In point of artifice with figures covered Whate er as pathway from the mount projects I saw that one who was created noble More than all other creatures down from heaven Flaming with lightnings fall upon one side I saw Briareus smitten by the dart Celestial lying on the other side Heavy upon the earth by mortal frost I saw Thymbraeus Pallas saw and Mars Still clad in armour round about their father Gaze at the scattered members of the giants I saw at foot of his great labour Nimrod As if bewildered looking at the people Who had been proud with him in Sennaar O Niobe with what afflicted eyes Thee I beheld upon the pathway traced Between thy seven and seven children slain O Saul how fallen upon thy proper sword Didst thou appear there lifeless in Gilboa That felt thereafter neither rain nor dew O mad Arachne so I thee beheld E en then half spider sad upon the shreds Of fabric wrought in evil hour for thee O Rehoboam no more seems to threaten Thine image there but full of consternation A chariot bears it off when none pursues Displayed moreo er the adamantine pavement How unto his own mother made Alcmaeon Costly appear the luckless ornament Displayed how his own sons did throw themselves Upon Sennacherib within the temple And how he being dead they left him there Displayed the ruin and the cruel carnage That Tomyris wrought when she to Cyrus said Blood didst thou thirst for and with blood I glut thee Displayed how routed fled the Assyrians After that Holofernes had been slain And likewise the remainder of that slaughter I saw there Troy in ashes and in caverns O Ilion thee how abject and debased Displayed the image that is there discerned Whoe er of pencil master was or stile That could portray the shades and traits which there Would cause each subtile genius to admire Dead seemed the dead the living seemed alive Better than I saw not who saw the truth All that I trod upon while bowed I went Now wax ye proud and on with looks uplifted Ye sons of Eve and bow not down your faces So that ye may behold your evil ways More of the mount by us was now encompassed And far more spent the circuit of the sun Than had the mind preoccupied imagined When he who ever watchful in advance Was going on began Lift up thy head Tis no more time to go thus meditating Lo there an Angel who is making haste To come towards us lo returning is From service of the day the sixth handmaiden With reverence thine acts and looks adorn So that he may delight to speed us upward Think that this day will never dawn again I was familiar with his admonition Ever to lose no time so on this theme He could not unto me speak covertly Towards us came the being beautiful Vested in white and in his countenance Such as appears the tremulous morning star His arms he opened and opened then his wings Come said he near at hand here are the steps And easy from henceforth is the ascent At this announcement few are they who come O human creatures born to soar aloft Why fall ye thus before a little wind He led us on to where the rock was cleft There smote upon my forehead with his wings Then a safe passage promised unto me As on the right hand to ascend the mount Where seated is the church that lordeth it O er the well guided above Rubaconte The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken By stairways that were made there in the age When still were safe the ledger and the stave E en thus attempered is the bank which falls Sheer downward from the second circle there But on this side and that the high rock graze As we were turning thitherward our persons Beati pauperes spiritu voices Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not Ah me how different are these entrances From the Infernal for with anthems here One enters and below with wild laments We now were hunting up the sacred stairs And it appeared to me by far more easy Than on the plain it had appeared before Whence I My Master say what heavy thing Has been uplifted from me so that hardly Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking He answered When the P s which have remained Still on thy face almost obliterate Shall wholly as the first is be erased Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will That not alone they shall not feel fatigue But urging up will be to them delight Then did I even as they do who are going With something on the head to them unknown Unless the signs of others make them doubt Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful And seeks and finds and doth fulfill the office Which cannot be accomplished by the sight And with the fingers of the right hand spread I found but six the letters that had carved Upon my temples he who bore the keys Upon beholding which my Leader smiled Purgatorio Canto XIII We were upon the summit of the stairs Where for the second time is cut away The mountain which ascending shriveth all There in like manner doth a cornice bind The hill all round about as does the first Save that its arc more suddenly is curved Shade is there none nor sculpture that appears So seems the bank and so the road seems smooth With but the livid colour of the stone If to inquire we wait for people here The Poet said I fear that peradventure Too much delay will our election have Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed Made his right side the centre of his motion And turned the left part of himself about O thou sweet light with trust in whom I enter Upon this novel journey do thou lead us Said he as one within here should be led Thou warmest the world thou shinest over it If other reason prompt not otherwise Thy rays should evermore our leaders be As much as here is counted for a mile So much already there had we advanced In little time by dint of ready will And tow rds us there were heard to fly albeit They were not visible spirits uttering Unto Love s table courteous invitations The first voice that passed onward in its flight Vinum non habent said in accents loud And went reiterating it behind us And ere it wholly grew inaudible Because of distance passed another crying I am Orestes and it also stayed not O said I Father these what voices are they And even as I asked behold the third Saying Love those from whom ye have had evil And the good Master said This circle scourges The sin of envy and on that account Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge The bridle of another sound shall be I think that thou wilt hear it as I judge Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast And people thou wilt see before us sitting And each one close against the cliff is seated Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened I looked before me and saw shades with mantles Not from the colour of the stone diverse And when we were a little farther onward I heard a cry of Mary pray for us A cry of Michael Peter and all Saints I do not think there walketh still on earth A man so hard that he would not be pierced With pity at what afterward I saw For when I had approached so near to them That manifest to me their acts became Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me And one sustained the other with his shoulder And all of them were by the bank sustained Thus do the blind in want of livelihood Stand at the doors of churches asking alms And one upon another leans his head So that in others pity soon may rise Not only at the accent of their words But at their aspect which no less implores And as unto the blind the sun comes not So to the shades of whom just now I spake Heaven s light will not be bounteous of itself For all their lids an iron wire transpierces And sews them up as to a sparhawk wild Is done because it will not quiet stay To me it seemed in passing to do outrage Seeing the others without being seen Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage Well knew he what the mute one wished to say And therefore waited not for my demand But said Speak and be brief and to the point I had Virgilius upon that side Of the embankment from which one may fall Since by no border tis engarlanded Upon the other side of me I had The shades devout who through the horrible seam Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks To them I turned me and O people certain Began I of beholding the high light Which your desire has solely in its care So may grace speedily dissolve the scum Upon your consciences that limpidly Through them descend the river of the mind Tell me for dear twill be to me and gracious If any soul among you here is Latian And twill perchance be good for him I learn it O brother mine each one is citizen Of one true city but thy meaning is Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim By way of answer this I seemed to hear A little farther on than where I stood Whereat I made myself still nearer heard Among the rest I saw a shade that waited In aspect and should any one ask how Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man Spirit I said who stoopest to ascend If thou art he who did reply to me Make thyself known to me by place or name Sienese was I it replied and with The others here recleanse my guilty life Weeping to Him to lend himself to us Sapient I was not although I Sapia Was called and I was at another s harm More happy far than at my own good fortune And that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee The arc already of my years descending My fellow citizens near unto Colle Were joined in battle with their adversaries And I was praying God for what he willed Routed were they and turned into the bitter Passes of flight and I the chase beholding A joy received unequalled by all others So that I lifted upward my bold face Crying to God Henceforth I fear thee not As did the blackbird at the little sunshine Peace I desired with God at the extreme Of my existence and as yet would not My debt have been by penitence discharged Had it not been that in remembrance held me Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers Who out of charity was grieved for me But who art thou that into our conditions Questioning goest and hast thine eyes unbound As I believe and breathing dost discourse Mine eyes I said will yet be here ta en from me But for short space for small is the offence Committed by their being turned with envy Far greater is the fear wherein suspended My soul is of the torment underneath For even now the load down there weighs on me And she to me Who led thee then among us Up here if to return below thou thinkest And I He who is with me and speaks not And living am I therefore ask of me Spirit elect if thou wouldst have me move O er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee O this is such a novel thing to hear She answered that great sign it is God loves thee Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me And I implore by what thou most desirest If e er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany Well with my kindred reinstate my fame Them wilt thou see among that people vain Who hope in Talamone and will lose there More hope than in discovering the Diana But there still more the admirals will lose Purgatorio Canto XIV Who is this one that goes about our mountain Or ever Death has given him power of flight And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will I know not who but know he s not alone Ask him thyself for thou art nearer to him And gently so that he may speak accost him Thus did two spirits leaning tow rds each other Discourse about me there on the right hand Then held supine their faces to address me And said the one O soul that fastened still Within the body tow rds the heaven art going For charity console us and declare Whence comest and who art thou for thou mak saint us As much to marvel at this grace of thine As must a thing that never yet has been And I Through midst of Tuscany there wanders A streamlet that is born in Falterona And not a hundred miles of course suffice it From thereupon do I this body bring To tell you who I am were speech in vain Because my name as yet makes no great noise If well thy meaning I can penetrate With intellect of mine then answered me He who first spake thou speakest of the Arno And said the other to him Why concealed This one the appellation of that river Even as a man doth of things horrible And thus the shade that questioned was of this Himself acquitted I know not but truly Tis fit the name of such a valley perish For from its fountain head where is so pregnant The Alpine mountain whence is cleft Peloro That in few places it that mark surpasses To where it yields itself in restoration Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up Whence have the rivers that which goes with them Virtue is like an enemy avoided By all as is a serpent through misfortune Of place or through bad habit that impels them On which account have so transformed their nature The dwellers in that miserable valley It seems that Circe had them in her pasture Mid ugly swine of acorns worthier Than other food for human use created It first directeth its impoverished way Curs findeth it thereafter coming downward More snarling than their puissance demands And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle It goes on falling and the more it grows The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves This maledict and misadventurous ditch Descended then through many a hollow gulf It finds the foxes so replete with fraud They fear no cunning that may master them Nor will I cease because another hears me And well twill be for him if still he mind him Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels Thy grandson I behold who doth become A hunter of those wolves upon the bank Of the wild stream and terrifies them all He sells their flesh it being yet alive Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves Many of life himself of praise deprives Blood stained he issues from the dismal forest He leaves it such a thousand years from now In its primeval state tis not re wooded As at the announcement of impending ills The face of him who listens is disturbed From whate er side the peril seize upon him So I beheld that other soul which stood Turned round to listen grow disturbed and sad When it had gathered to itself the word The speech of one and aspect of the other Had me desirous made to know their names And question mixed with prayers I made thereof Whereat the spirit which first spake to me Began again Thou wishest I should bring me To do for thee what thou lieutenant not do for me But since God willeth that in thee shine forth Such grace of his I ll not be chary with thee Know then that I Guido del Duca am My blood was so with envy set on fire That if I had beheld a man make merry Thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled o er with pallor From my own sowing such the straw I reap O human race why dost thou set thy heart Where interdict of partnership must be This is Renier this is the boast and honour Of the house of Calboli where no one since Has made himself the heir of his desert And not alone his blood is made devoid Twixt Po and mount and sea shore and the Reno Of good required for truth and for diversion For all within these boundaries is full Of venomous roots so that too tardily By cultivation now would they diminish Where is good Lizio and Arrigo Manardi Pier Traversaro and Guido di Carpigna O Romagnuoli into bastards turned When in Bologna will a Fabbro rise When in Faenza a Bernardin di Fosco The noble scion of ignoble seed Be not astonished Tuscan if I weep When I remember with Guido da Prata Ugolin d Azzo who was living with us Frederick Tignoso and his company The house of Traversara and th Anastagi And one race and the other is extinct The dames and cavaliers the toils and ease That filled our souls with love and courtesy There where the hearts have so malicious grown O Brettinoro why dost thou not flee Seeing that all thy family is gone And many people not to be corrupted Bagnacaval does well in not begetting And ill does Castrocaro and Conio worse In taking trouble to beget such Counts Will do well the Pagani when their Devil Shall have departed but not therefore pure Will testimony of them e er remain O Ugolin de Fantoli secure Thy name is since no longer is awaited One who degenerating can obscure it But go now Tuscan for it now delights me To weep far better than it does to speak So much has our discourse my mind distressed We were aware that those beloved souls Heard us depart therefore by keeping silent They made us of our pathway confident When we became alone by going onward Thunder when it doth cleave the air appeared A voice that counter to us came exclaiming Shall slay me whosoever findeth me And fled as the reverberation dies If suddenly the cloud asunder bursts As soon as hearing had a truce from this Behold another with so great a crash That it resembled thunderings following fast I am Aglaurus who became a stone And then to press myself close to the Poet I backward and not forward took a step Already on all sides the air was quiet And said he to me That was the hard curb That ought to hold a man within his bounds But you take in the bait so that the hook Of the old Adversary draws you to him And hence availeth little curb or call The heavens are calling you and wheel around you Displaying to you their eternal beauties And still your eye is looking on the ground Whence He who all discerns chastises you Purgatorio Canto XV As much as twixt the close of the third hour And dawn of day appeareth of that sphere Which aye in fashion of a child is playing So much it now appeared towards the night Was of his course remaining to the sun There it was evening and twas midnight here And the rays smote the middle of our faces Because by us the mount was so encircled That straight towards the west we now were going When I perceived my forehead overpowered Beneath the splendour far more than at first And stupor were to me the things unknown Whereat towards the summit of my brow I raised my hands and made myself the visor Which the excessive glare diminishes As when from off the water or a mirror The sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side Ascending upward in the selfsame measure That it descends and deviates as far From falling of a stone in line direct As demonstrate experiment and art So it appeared to me that by a light Refracted there before me I was smitten On which account my sight was swift to flee What is that Father sweet from which I cannot So fully screen my sight that it avail me Said I and seems towards us to be moving Marvel thou not if dazzle thee as yet The family of heaven he answered me An angel tis who comes to invite us upward Soon will it be that to behold these things Shall not be grievous but delightful to thee As much as nature fashioned thee to feel When we had reached the Angel benedight With joyful voice he said Here enter in To stairway far less steep than are the others We mounting were already thence departed And Beati misericordes was Behind us sung Rejoice thou that o ercomest My Master and myself we two alone Were going upward and I thought in going Some profit to acquire from words of his And I to him directed me thus asking What did the spirit of Romagna mean Mentioning interdict and partnership Whence he to me Of his own greatest failing He knows the harm and therefore wonder not If he reprove us that we less may rue it Because are thither pointed your desires Where by companionship each share is lessened Envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs But if the love of the supernal sphere Should upwardly direct your aspiration There would not be that fear within your breast For there as much the more as one says Our So much the more of good each one possesses And more of charity in that cloister burns I am more hungering to be satisfied I said than if I had before been silent And more of doubt within my mind I gather How can it be that boon distributed The more possessors can more wealthy make Therein than if by few it be possessed And he to me Because thou fixest still Thy mind entirely upon earthly things Thou pluckest darkness from the very light That goodness infinite and ineffable Which is above there runneth unto love As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam So much it gives itself as it finds ardour So that as far as charity extends O er it increases the eternal valour And the more people thitherward aspire More are there to love well and more they love there And as a mirror one reflects the other And if my reasoning appease thee not Thou shalt see Beatrice and she will fully Take from thee this and every other longing Endeavour then that soon may be extinct As are the two already the five wounds That close themselves again by being painful Even as I wished to say Thou dost appease me I saw that I had reached another circle So that my eager eyes made me keep silence There it appeared to me that in a vision Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt And in a temple many persons saw And at the door a woman with the sweet Behaviour of a mother saying Son Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us Lo sorrowing thy father and myself Were seeking for thee and as here she ceased That which appeared at first had disappeared Then I beheld another with those waters Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever From great disdain of others it is born And saying If of that city thou art lord For whose name was such strife among the gods And whence doth every science scintillate Avenge thyself on those audacious arms That clasped our daughter O Pisistratus And the lord seemed to me benign and mild To answer her with aspect temperate What shall we do to those who wish us ill If he who loves us be by us condemned Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath With stones a young man slaying clamorously Still crying to each other Kill him kill him And him I saw bow down because of death That weighed already on him to the earth But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven Imploring the high Lord in so great strife That he would pardon those his persecutors With such an aspect as unlocks compassion Soon as my soul had outwardly returned To things external to it which are true Did I my not false errors recognize My Leader who could see me bear myself Like to a man that rouses him from sleep Exclaimed What ails thee that thou canst not stand But hast been coming more than half a league Veiling thine eyes and with thy legs entangled In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues O my sweet Father if thou listen to me I ll tell thee said I what appeared to me When thus from me my legs were ta en away And he If thou shouldst have a hundred masks Upon thy face from me would not be shut Thy cogitations howsoever small What thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace Which from the eternal fountain are diffused I did not ask What ails thee as he does Who only looketh with the eyes that see not When of the soul bereft the body lies But asked it to give vigour to thy feet Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards slow To use their wakefulness when it returns We passed along athwart the twilight peering Forward as far as ever eye could stretch Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent And lo by slow degrees a smoke approached In our direction sombre as the night Nor was there place to hide one s self therefrom This of our eyes and the pure air bereft us Purgatorio Canto XVI Darkness of hell and of a night deprived Of every planet under a poor sky As much as may be tenebrous with cloud Ne er made unto my sight so thick a veil As did that smoke which there enveloped us Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture For not an eye it suffered to stay open Whereat mine escort faithful and sagacious Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder E en as a blind man goes behind his guide Lest he should wander or should strike against Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him So went I through the bitter and foul air Listening unto my Leader who said only Look that from me thou be not separated Voices I heard and every one appeared To supplicate for peace and misericord The Lamb of God who takes away our sins Still Agnus Dei their exordium was One word there was in all and metre one So that all harmony appeared among them Master I said are spirits those I hear And he to me Thou apprehendest truly And they the knot of anger go unloosing Now who art thou that cleavest through our smoke And art discoursing of us even as though Thou didst by calends still divide the time After this manner by a voice was spoken Whereon my Master said Do thou reply And ask if on this side the way go upward And I O creature that dost cleanse thyself To return beautiful to Him who made thee Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me Thee will I follow far as is allowed me He answered and if smoke prevent our seeing Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof Thereon began I With that swathing band Which death unwindeth am I going upward And hither came I through the infernal anguish And if God in his grace has me infolded So that he wills that I behold his court By method wholly out of modern usage Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast But tell it me and tell me if I go Right for the pass and be thy words our escort Lombard was I and I was Marco called The world I knew and loved that excellence At which has each one now unbent his bow For mounting upward thou art going right Thus he made answer and subjoined I pray thee To pray for me when thou shalt be above And I to him My faith I pledge to thee To do what thou dost ask me but am bursting Inly with doubt unless I rid me of it First it was simple and is now made double By thy opinion which makes certain to me Here and elsewhere that which I couple with it The world forsooth is utterly deserted By every virtue as thou tellest me And with iniquity is big and covered But I beseech thee point me out the cause That I may see it and to others show it For one in the heavens and here below one puts it A sigh profound that grief forced into Ai He first sent forth and then began he Brother The world is blind and sooth thou comest from it Ye who are living every cause refer Still upward to the heavens as if all things They of necessity moved with themselves If this were so in you would be destroyed Free will nor any justice would there be In having joy for good or grief for evil The heavens your movements do initiate I say not all but granting that I say it Light has been given you for good and evil And free volition which if some fatigue In the first battles with the heavens it suffers Afterwards conquers all if well tis nurtured To greater force and to a better nature Though free ye subject are and that creates The mind in you the heavens have not in charge Hence if the present world doth go astray In you the cause is be it sought in you And I therein will now be thy true spy Forth from the hand of Him who fondles it Before it is like to a little girl Weeping and laughing in her childish sport Issues the simple soul that nothing knows Save that proceeding from a joyous Maker Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure Of trivial good at first it tastes the savour Is cheated by it and runs after it If guide or rein turn not aside its love Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place Behoved a king to have who at the least Of the true city should discern the tower The laws exist but who sets hand to them No one because the shepherd who precedes Can ruminate but cleaveth not the hoof Wherefore the people that perceives its guide Strike only at the good for which it hankers Feeds upon that and farther seeketh not Clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance The cause is that has made the world depraved And not that nature is corrupt in you Rome that reformed the world accustomed was Two suns to have which one road and the other Of God and of the world made manifest One has the other quenched and to the crosier The sword is joined and ill beseemeth it That by main force one with the other go Because being joined one feareth not the other If thou believe not think upon the grain For by its seed each herb is recognized In the land laved by Po and Adige Valour and courtesy used to be found Before that Frederick had his controversy Now in security can pass that way Whoever will abstain through sense of shame From speaking with the good or drawing near them True three old men are left in whom upbraids The ancient age the new and late they deem it That God restore them to the better life Currado da Palazzo and good Gherardo And Guido da Castel who better named is In fashion of the French the simple Lombard Say thou henceforward that the Church of Rome Confounding in itself two governments Falls in the mire and soils itself and burden O Marco mine I said thou reasonest well And now discern I why the sons of Levi Have been excluded from the heritage But what Gherardo is it who as sample Of a lost race thou sayest has remained In reprobation of the barbarous age Either thy speech deceives me or it tempts me He answered me for speaking Tuscan to me It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest By other surname do I know him not Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia May God be with you for I come no farther Behold the dawn that through the smoke rays out Already whitening and I must depart Yonder the Angel is ere he appear Thus did he speak and would no farther hear me Purgatorio Canto XVII Remember Reader if e er in the Alps A mist o ertook thee through which thou couldst see Not otherwise than through its membrane mole How when the vapours humid and condensed Begin to dissipate themselves the sphere Of the sun feebly enters in among them And thy imagination will be swift In coming to perceive how I re saw The sun at first that was already setting Thus to the faithful footsteps of my Master Mating mine own I issued from that cloud To rays already dead on the low shores O thou Imagination that dost steal us So from without sometimes that man perceives not Although around may sound a thousand trumpets Who moveth thee if sense impel thee not Moves thee a light which in the heaven takes form By self or by a will that downward guides it Of her impiety who changed her form Into the bird that most delights in singing In my imagining appeared the trace And hereupon my mind was so withdrawn Within itself that from without there came Nothing that then might be received by it Then reigned within my lofty fantasy One crucified disdainful and ferocious In countenance and even thus was dying Around him were the great Ahasuerus Esther his wife and the just Mordecai Who was in word and action so entire And even as this image burst asunder Of its own self in fashion of a bubble In which the water it was made of fails There rose up in my vision a young maiden Bitterly weeping and she said O queen Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught Thou saint slain thyself Lavinia not to lose Now hast thou lost me I am she who mourns Mother at thine ere at another s ruin As sleep is broken when upon a sudden New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly So this imagining of mine fell down As soon as the effulgence smote my face Greater by far than what is in our wont I turned me round to see where I might be When said a voice Here is the passage up Which from all other purposes removed me And made my wish so full of eagerness To look and see who was it that was speaking It never rests till meeting face to face But as before the sun which quells the sight And in its own excess its figure veils Even so my power was insufficient here This is a spirit divine who in the way Of going up directs us without asking And who with his own light himself conceals He does with us as man doth with himself For he who sees the need and waits the asking Malignly leans already tow rds denial Accord we now our feet to such inviting Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark For then we could not till the day return Thus my Conductor said and I and he Together turned our footsteps to a stairway And I as soon as the first step I reached Near me perceived a motion as of wings And fanning in the face and saying Beati Pacifici who are without ill anger Already over us were so uplifted The latest sunbeams which the night pursues That upon many sides the stars appeared O manhood mine why dost thou vanish so I said within myself for I perceived The vigour of my legs was put in truce We at the point were where no more ascends The stairway upward and were motionless Even as a ship which at the shore arrives And I gave heed a little if I might hear Aught whatsoever in the circle new Then to my Master turned me round and said Say my sweet Father what delinquency Is purged here in the circle where we are Although our feet may pause pause not thy speech And he to me The love of good remiss In what it should have done is here restored Here plied again the ill belated oar But still more openly to understand Turn unto me thy mind and thou shalt gather Some profitable fruit from our delay Neither Creator nor a creature ever Son he began was destitute of love Natural or spiritual and thou knowest it The natural was ever without error But err the other may by evil object Or by too much or by too little vigour While in the first it well directed is And in the second moderates itself It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure But when to ill it turns and with more care Or lesser than it ought runs after good Gainst the Creator works his own creation Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be The seed within yourselves of every virtue And every act that merits punishment Now inasmuch as never from the welfare Of its own subject can love turn its sight From their own hatred all things are secure And since we cannot think of any being Standing alone nor from the First divided Of hating Him is all desire cut off Hence if discriminating I judge well The evil that one loves is of one s neighbour And this is born in three modes in your clay There are who by abasement of their neighbour Hope to excel and therefore only long That from his greatness he may be cast down There are who power grace honour and renown Fear they may lose because another rises Thence are so sad that the reverse they love And there are those whom injury seems to chafe So that it makes them greedy for revenge And such must needs shape out another s harm This threefold love is wept for down below Now of the other will I have thee hear That runneth after good with measure faulty Each one confusedly a good conceives Wherein the mind may rest and longeth for it Therefore to overtake it each one strives If languid love to look on this attract you Or in attaining unto it this cornice After just penitence torments you for it There s other good that does not make man happy Tis not felicity tis not the good Essence of every good the fruit and root The love that yields itself too much to this Above us is lamented in three circles But how tripartite it may be described I say not that thou seek it for thyself Purgatorio Canto XVIII An end had put unto his reasoning The lofty Teacher and attent was looking Into my face if I appeared content And I whom a new thirst still goaded on Without was mute and said within Perchance The too much questioning I make annoys him But that true Father who had comprehended The timid wish that opened not itself By speaking gave me hardihood to speak Whence I My sight is Master vivified So in thy light that clearly I discern Whate er thy speech importeth or describes Therefore I thee entreat sweet Father dear To teach me love to which thou dost refer Every good action and its contrary Direct he said towards me the keen eyes Of intellect and clear will be to thee The error of the blind who would be leaders The soul which is created apt to love Is mobile unto everything that pleases Soon as by pleasure she is waked to action Your apprehension from some real thing An image draws and in yourselves displays it So that it makes the soul turn unto it And if when turned towards it she incline Love is that inclination it is nature Which is by pleasure bound in you anew Then even as the fire doth upward move By its own form which to ascend is born Where longest in its matter it endures So comes the captive soul into desire Which is a motion spiritual and ne er rests Until she doth enjoy the thing beloved Now may apparent be to thee how hidden The truth is from those people who aver All love is in itself a laudable thing Because its matter may perchance appear Aye to be good but yet not each impression Is good albeit good may be the wax Thy words and my sequacious intellect I answered him have love revealed to me But that has made me more impregned with doubt For if love from without be offered us And with another foot the soul go not If right or wrong she go tis not her merit And he to me What reason seeth here Myself can tell thee beyond that await For Beatrice since tis a work of faith Every substantial form that segregate From matter is and with it is united Specific power has in itself collected Which without act is not perceptible Nor shows itself except by its effect As life does in a plant by the green leaves But still whence cometh the intelligence Of the first notions man is ignorant And the affection for the first allurements Which are in you as instinct in the bee To make its honey and this first desire Merit of praise or blame containeth not Now that to this all others may be gathered Innate within you is the power that counsels And it should keep the threshold of assent This is the principle from which is taken Occasion of desert in you according As good and guilty loves it takes and winnows Those who in reasoning to the bottom went Were of this innate liberty aware Therefore bequeathed they Ethics to the world Supposing then that from necessity Springs every love that is within you kindled Within yourselves the power is to restrain it The noble virtue Beatrice understands By the free will and therefore see that thou Bear it in mind if she should speak of it The moon belated almost unto midnight Now made the stars appear to us more rare Formed like a bucket that is all ablaze And counter to the heavens ran through those paths Which the sun sets aflame when he of Rome Sees it twixt Sardes and Corsicans go down And that patrician shade for whom is named Pietola more than any Mantuan town Had laid aside the burden of my lading Whence I who reason manifest and plain In answer to my questions had received Stood like a man in drowsy reverie But taken from me was this drowsiness Suddenly by a people that behind Our backs already had come round to us And as of old Ismenus and Asopus Beside them saw at night the rush and throng If but the Thebans were in need of Bacchus So they along that circle curve their step From what I saw of those approaching us Who by good will and righteous love are ridden Full soon they were upon us because running Moved onward all that mighty multitude And two in the advance cried out lamenting Mary in haste unto the mountain ran And Caesar that he might subdue Ilerda Thrust at Marseilles and then ran into Spain Quick quick so that the time may not be lost By little love forthwith the others cried For ardour in well doing freshens grace O folk in whom an eager fervour now Supplies perhaps delay and negligence Put by you in well doing through lukewarmness This one who lives and truly I lie not Would fain go up if but the sun relight us So tell us where the passage nearest is These were the words of him who was my Guide And some one of those spirits said Come on Behind us and the opening shalt thou find So full of longing are we to move onward That stay we cannot therefore pardon us If thou for churlishness our justice take I was San Zeno s Abbot at Verona Under the empire of good Barbarossa Of whom still sorrowing Milan holds discourse And he has one foot in the grave already Who shall erelong lament that monastery And sorry be of having there had power Because his son in his whole body sick And worse in mind and who was evil born He put into the place of its true pastor If more he said or silent was I know not He had already passed so far beyond us But this I heard and to retain it pleased me And he who was in every need my succour Said Turn thee hitherward see two of them Come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth In rear of all they shouted Sooner were The people dead to whom the sea was opened Than their inheritors the Jordan saw And those who the fatigue did not endure Unto the issue with Anchises son Themselves to life withouten glory offered Then when from us so separated were Those shades that they no longer could be seen Within me a new thought did entrance find Whence others many and diverse were born And so I lapsed from one into another That in a reverie mine eyes I closed And meditation into dream transmuted Purgatorio Canto XIX It was the hour when the diurnal heat No more can warm the coldness of the moon Vanquished by earth or peradventure Saturn When geomancers their Fortuna Major See in the orient before the dawn Rise by a path that long remains not dim There came to me in dreams a stammering woman Squint in her eyes and in her feet distorted With hands dissevered and of sallow hue I looked at her and as the sun restores The frigid members which the night benumbs Even thus my gaze did render voluble Her tongue and made her all erect thereafter In little while and the lost countenance As love desires it so in her did colour When in this wise she had her speech unloosed She gan to sing so that with difficulty Could I have turned my thoughts away from her I am she sang I am the Siren sweet Who mariners amid the main unman So full am I of pleasantness to hear I drew Ulysses from his wandering way Unto my song and he who dwells with me Seldom departs so wholly I content him Her mouth was not yet closed again before Appeared a Lady saintly and alert Close at my side to put her to confusion Virgilius O Virgilius who is this Sternly she said and he was drawing near With eyes still fixed upon that modest one She seized the other and in front laid open Rending her garments and her belly showed me This waked me with the stench that issued from it I turned mine eyes and good Virgilius said At least thrice have I called thee rise and come Find we the opening by which thou mayst enter I rose and full already of high day Were all the circles of the Sacred Mountain And with the new sun at our back we went Following behind him I my forehead bore Like unto one who has it laden with thought Who makes himself the half arch of a bridge When I heard say Come here the passage is Spoken in a manner gentle and benign Such as we hear not in this mortal region With open wings which of a swan appeared Upward he turned us who thus spake to us Between the two walls of the solid granite He moved his pinions afterwards and fanned us Affirming those qui lugent to be blessed For they shall have their souls with comfort filled What aileth thee that aye to earth thou gazest To me my Guide began to say we both Somewhat beyond the Angel having mounted And I With such misgiving makes me go A vision new which bends me to itself So that I cannot from the thought withdraw me Didst thou behold he said that old enchantress Who sole above us henceforth is lamented Didst thou behold how man is freed from her Suffice it thee and smite earth with thy heels Thine eyes lift upward to the lure that whirls The Eternal King with revolutions vast Even as the hawk that first his feet surveys Then turns him to the call and stretches forward Through the desire of food that draws him thither Such I became and such as far as cleaves The rock to give a way to him who mounts Went on to where the circling doth begin On the fifth circle when I had come forth People I saw upon it who were weeping Stretched prone upon the ground all downward turned Adhaesit pavimento anima mea I heard them say with sighings so profound That hardly could the words be understood O ye elect of God whose sufferings Justice and Hope both render less severe Direct ye us towards the high ascents If ye are come secure from this prostration And wish to find the way most speedily Let your right hands be evermore outside Thus did the Poet ask and thus was answered By them somewhat in front of us whence I In what was spoken divined the rest concealed And unto my Lord s eyes mine eyes I turned Whence he assented with a cheerful sign To what the sight of my desire implored When of myself I could dispose at will Above that creature did I draw myself Whose words before had caused me to take note Saying O Spirit in whom weeping ripens That without which to God we cannot turn Suspend awhile for me thy greater care Who wast thou and why are your backs turned upwards Tell me and if thou wouldst that I procure thee Anything there whence living I departed And he to me Wherefore our backs the heaven Turns to itself know shalt thou but beforehand Scias quod ego fui successor Petri Between Siestri and Chiaveri descends A river beautiful and of its name The title of my blood its summit makes A month and little more essayed I how Weighs the great cloak on him from mire who keeps it For all the other burdens seem a feather Tardy ah woe is me was my conversion But when the Roman Shepherd I was made Then I discovered life to be a lie I saw that there the heart was not at rest Nor farther in that life could one ascend Whereby the love of this was kindled in me Until that time a wretched soul and parted From God was I and wholly avaricious Now as thou seest I here am punished for it What avarice does is here made manifest In the purgation of these souls converted And no more bitter pain the Mountain has Even as our eye did not uplift itself Aloft being fastened upon earthly things So justice here has merged it in the earth As avarice had extinguished our affection For every good whereby was action lost So justice here doth hold us in restraint Bound and imprisoned by the feet and hands And so long as it pleases the just Lord Shall we remain immovable and prostrate I on my knees had fallen and wished to speak But even as I began and he was ware Only by listening of my reverence What cause he said has downward bent thee thus And I to him For your own dignity Standing my conscience stung me with remorse Straighten thy legs and upward raise thee brother He answered Err not fellow servant am I With thee and with the others to one power If e er that holy evangelic sound Which sayeth neque nubent thou hast heard Well canst thou see why in this wise I speak Now go no longer will I have thee linger Because thy stay doth incommode my weeping With which I ripen that which thou hast said On earth I have a grandchild named Alagia Good in herself unless indeed our house Malevolent may make her by example And she alone remains to me on earth Purgatorio Canto XX Ill strives the will against a better will Therefore to pleasure him against my pleasure I drew the sponge not saturate from the water Onward I moved and onward moved my Leader Through vacant places skirting still the rock As on a wall close to the battlements For they that through their eyes pour drop by drop The malady which all the world pervades On the other side too near the verge approach Accursed mayst thou be thou old she wolf That more than all the other beasts hast prey Because of hunger infinitely hollow O heaven in whose gyrations some appear To think conditions here below are changed When will he come through whom she shall depart Onward we went with footsteps slow and scarce And I attentive to the shades I heard Piteously weeping and bemoaning them And I by peradventure heard Sweet Mary Uttered in front of us amid the weeping Even as a woman does who is in child birth And in continuance How poor thou wast Is manifested by that hostelry Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down Thereafterward I heard O good Fabricius Virtue with poverty didst thou prefer To the possession of great wealth with vice So pleasurable were these words to me That I drew farther onward to have knowledge Touching that spirit whence they seemed to come He furthermore was speaking of the largess Which Nicholas unto the maidens gave In order to conduct their youth to honour O soul that dost so excellently speak Tell me who wast thou said I and why only Thou dost renew these praises well deserved Not without recompense shall be thy word If I return to finish the short journey Of that life which is flying to its end And he I ll tell thee not for any comfort I may expect from earth but that so much Grace shines in thee or ever thou art dead I was the root of that malignant plant Which overshadows all the Christian world So that good fruit is seldom gathered from it But if Douay and Ghent and Lille and Bruges Had Power soon vengeance would be taken on it And this I pray of Him who judges all Hugh Capet was I called upon the earth From me were born the Louises and Philips By whom in later days has France been governed I was the son of a Parisian butcher What time the ancient kings had perished all Excepting one contrite in cloth of gray I found me grasping in my hands the rein Of the realm s government and so great power Of new acquest and so with friends abounding That to the widowed diadem promoted The head of mine own offspring was from whom The consecrated bones of these began So long as the great dowry of Provence Out of my blood took not the sense of shame Twas little worth but still it did no harm Then it began with falsehood and with force Its rapine and thereafter for amends Took Ponthieu Normandy and Gascony Charles came to Italy and for amends A victim made of Conradin and then Thrust Thomas back to heaven for amends A time I see not very distant now Which draweth forth another Charles from France The better to make known both him and his Unarmed he goes and only with the lance That Judas jousted with and that he thrusts So that he makes the paunch of Florence burst He thence not land but sin and infamy Shall gain so much more grievous to himself As the more light such damage he accounts The other now gone forth ta en in his ship See I his daughter sell and chaffer for her As corsairs do with other female slaves What more O Avarice canst thou do to us Since thou my blood so to thyself hast drawn It careth not for its own proper flesh That less may seem the future ill and past I see the flower de luce Alagna enter And Christ in his own Vicar captive made I see him yet another time derided I see renewed the vinegar and gall And between living thieves I see him slain I see the modern Pilate so relentless This does not sate him but without decretal He to the temple bears his sordid sails When O my Lord shall I be joyful made By looking on the vengeance which concealed Makes sweet thine anger in thy secrecy What I was saying of that only bride Of the Holy Ghost and which occasioned thee To turn towards me for some commentary So long has been ordained to all our prayers As the day lasts but when the night comes on Contrary sound we take instead thereof At that time we repeat Pygmalion Of whom a traitor thief and parricide Made his insatiable desire of gold And the misery of avaricious Midas That followed his inordinate demand At which forevermore one needs but laugh The foolish Achan each one then records And how he stole the spoils so that the wrath Of Joshua still appears to sting him here Then we accuse Sapphira with her husband We laud the hoof beats Heliodorus had And the whole mount in infamy encircles Polymnestor who murdered Polydorus Here finally is cried O Crassus tell us For thou dost know what is the taste of gold Sometimes we speak one loud another low According to desire of speech that spurs us To greater now and now to lesser pace But in the good that here by day is talked of Erewhile alone I was not yet near by No other person lifted up his voice From him already we departed were And made endeavour to o ercome the road As much as was permitted to our power When I perceived like something that is falling The mountain tremble whence a chill seized on me As seizes him who to his death is going Certes so violently shook not Delos Before Latona made her nest therein To give birth to the two eyes of the heaven Then upon all sides there began a cry Such that the Master drew himself towards me Saying Fear not while I am guiding thee Gloria in excelsis Deo all Were saying from what near I comprehended Where it was possible to hear the cry We paused immovable and in suspense Even as the shepherds who first heard that song Until the trembling ceased and it was finished Then we resumed again our holy path Watching the shades that lay upon the ground Already turned to their accustomed plaint No ignorance ever with so great a strife Had rendered me importunate to know If erreth not in this my memory As meditating then I seemed to have Nor out of haste to question did I dare Nor of myself I there could aught perceive So I went onward timorous and thoughtful Purgatorio Canto XXI The natural thirst that ne er is satisfied Excepting with the water for whose grace The woman of Samaria besought Put me in travail and haste goaded me Along the encumbered path behind my Leader And I was pitying that righteous vengeance And lo in the same manner as Luke writeth That Christ appeared to two upon the way From the sepulchral cave already risen A shade appeared to us and came behind us Down gazing on the prostrate multitude Nor were we ware of it until it spake Saying My brothers may God give you peace We turned us suddenly and Virgilius rendered To him the countersign thereto conforming Thereon began he In the blessed council Thee may the court veracious place in peace That me doth banish in eternal exile How said he and the while we went with speed If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high Who up his stairs so far has guided you And said my Teacher If thou note the marks Which this one bears and which the Angel traces Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign But because she who spinneth day and night For him had not yet drawn the distaff off Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts His soul which is thy sister and my own In coming upwards could not come alone By reason that it sees not in our fashion Whence I was drawn from out the ample throat Of Hell to be his guide and I shall guide him As far on as my school has power to lead But tell us if thou knowest why such a shudder Erewhile the mountain gave and why together All seemed to cry as far as its moist feet In asking he so hit the very eye Of my desire that merely with the hope My thirst became the less unsatisfied Naught is there he began that without order May the religion of the mountain feel Nor aught that may be foreign to its custom Free is it here from every permutation What from itself heaven in itself receiveth Can be of this the cause and naught beside Because that neither rain nor hail nor snow Nor dew nor hoar frost any higher falls Than the short little stairway of three steps Dense clouds do not appear nor rarefied Nor coruscation nor the daughter of Thaumas That often upon earth her region shifts No arid vapour any farther rises Than to the top of the three steps I spake of Whereon the Vicar of Peter has his feet Lower down perchance it trembles less or more But for the wind that in the earth is hidden I know not how up here it never trembled It trembles here whenever any soul Feels itself pure so that it soars or moves To mount aloft and such a cry attends it Of purity the will alone gives proof Which being wholly free to change its convent Takes by surprise the soul and helps it fly First it wills well but the desire permits not Which divine justice with the self same will There was to sin upon the torment sets And I who have been lying in this pain Five hundred years and more but just now felt A free volition for a better seat Therefore thou heardst the earthquake and the pious Spirits along the mountain rendering praise Unto the Lord that soon he speed them upwards So said he to him and since we enjoy As much in drinking as the thirst is great I could not say how much it did me good And the wise Leader Now I see the net That snares you here and how ye are set free Why the earth quakes and wherefore ye rejoice Now who thou wast be pleased that I may know And why so many centuries thou hast here Been lying let me gather from thy words In days when the good Titus with the aid Of the supremest King avenged the wounds Whence issued forth the blood by Judas sold Under the name that most endures and honours Was I on earth that spirit made reply Greatly renowned but not with faith as yet My vocal spirit was so sweet that Rome Me a Thoulousian drew unto herself Where I deserved to deck my brows with myrtle Statius the people name me still on earth I sang of Thebes and then of great Achilles But on the way fell with my second burden The seeds unto my ardour were the sparks Of that celestial flame which heated me Whereby more than a thousand have been fired Of the Aeneid speak I which to me A mother was and was my nurse in song Without this weighed I not a drachma s weight And to have lived upon the earth what time Virgilius lived I would accept one sun More than I must ere issuing from my ban These words towards me made Virgilius turn With looks that in their silence said Be silent But yet the power that wills cannot do all things For tears and laughter are such pursuivants Unto the passion from which each springs forth In the most truthful least the will they follow I only smiled as one who gives the wink Whereat the shade was silent and it gazed Into mine eyes where most expression dwells And As thou well mayst consummate a labour So great it said why did thy face just now Display to me the lightning of a smile Now am I caught on this side and on that One keeps me silent one to speak conjures me Wherefore I sigh and I am understood Speak said my Master and be not afraid Of speaking but speak out and say to him What he demands with such solicitude Whence I Thou peradventure marvellest O antique spirit at the smile I gave But I will have more wonder seize upon thee This one who guides on high these eyes of mine Is that Virgilius from whom thou didst learn To sing aloud of men and of the Gods If other cause thou to my smile imputedst Abandon it as false and trust it was Those words which thou hast spoken concerning him Already he was stooping to embrace My Teacher s feet but he said to him Brother Do not for shade thou art and shade beholdest And he uprising Now canst thou the sum Of love which warms me to thee comprehend When this our vanity I disremember Treating a shadow as substantial thing Purgatorio Canto XXII Already was the Angel left behind us The Angel who to the sixth round had turned us Having erased one mark from off my face And those who have in justice their desire Had said to us Beati in their voices With sitio and without more ended it And I more light than through the other passes Went onward so that without any labour I followed upward the swift footed spirits When thus Virgilius began The love Kindled by virtue aye another kindles Provided outwardly its flame appear Hence from the hour that Juvenal descended Among us into the infernal Limbo Who made apparent to me thy affection My kindliness towards thee was as great As ever bound one to an unseen person So that these stairs will now seem short to me But tell me and forgive me as a friend If too great confidence let loose the rein And as a friend now hold discourse with me How was it possible within thy breast For avarice to find place mid so much wisdom As thou wast filled with by thy diligence These words excited Statius at first Somewhat to laughter afterward he answered Each word of thine is love s dear sign to me Verily oftentimes do things appear Which give fallacious matter to our doubts Instead of the true causes which are hidden Thy question shows me thy belief to be That I was niggard in the other life It may be from the circle where I was Therefore know thou that avarice was removed Too far from me and this extravagance Thousands of lunar periods have punished And were it not that I my thoughts uplifted When I the passage heard where thou exclaimest As if indignant unto human nature To what impellest thou not O cursed hunger Of gold the appetite of mortal men Revolving I should feel the dismal joustings Then I perceived the hands could spread too wide Their wings in spending and repented me As well of that as of my other sins How many with shorn hair shall rise again Because of ignorance which from this sin Cuts off repentance living and in death And know that the transgression which rebuts By direct opposition any sin Together with it here its verdure dries Therefore if I have been among that folk Which mourns its avarice to purify me For its opposite has this befallen me Now when thou sangest the relentless weapons Of the twofold affliction of Jocasta The singer of the Songs Bucolic said From that which Clio there with thee preludes It does not seem that yet had made thee faithful That faith without which no good works suffice If this be so what candles or what sun Scattered thy darkness so that thou didst trim Thy sails behind the Fisherman thereafter And he to him Thou first directedst me Towards Parnassus in its grots to drink And first concerning God didst me enlighten Thou didst as he who walketh in the night Who bears his light behind which helps him not But wary makes the persons after him When thou didst say The age renews itself Justice returns and man s primeval time And a new progeny descends from heaven Through thee I Poet was through thee a Christian But that thou better see what I design To colour it will I extend my hand Already was the world in every part Pregnant with the true creed disseminated By messengers of the eternal kingdom And thy assertion spoken of above With the new preachers was in unison Whence I to visit them the custom took Then they became so holy in my sight That when Domitian persecuted them Not without tears of mine were their laments And all the while that I on earth remained Them I befriended and their upright customs Made me disparage all the other sects And ere I led the Greeks unto the rivers Of Thebes in poetry I was baptized But out of fear was covertly a Christian For a long time professing paganism And this lukewarmness caused me the fourth circle To circuit round more than four centuries Thou therefore who hast raised the covering That hid from me whatever good I speak of While in ascending we have time to spare Tell me in what place is our friend Terentius Caecilius Plautus Varro if thou knowest Tell me if they are damned and in what alley These Persius and myself and others many Replied my Leader with that Grecian are Whom more than all the rest the Muses suckled In the first circle of the prison blind Ofttimes we of the mountain hold discourse Which has our nurses ever with itself Euripides is with us Antiphon Simonides Agatho and many other Greeks who of old their brows with laurel decked There some of thine own people may be seen Antigone Deiphile and Argia And there Ismene mournful as of old There she is seen who pointed out Langia There is Tiresias daughter and there Thetis And there Deidamia with her sisters Silent already were the poets both Attent once more in looking round about From the ascent and from the walls released And four handmaidens of the day already Were left behind and at the pole the fifth Was pointing upward still its burning horn What time my Guide I think that tow rds the edge Our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn Circling the mount as we are wont to do Thus in that region custom was our ensign And we resumed our way with less suspicion For the assenting of that worthy soul They in advance went on and I alone Behind them and I listened to their speech Which gave me lessons in the art of song But soon their sweet discourses interrupted A tree which midway in the road we found With apples sweet and grateful to the smell And even as a fir tree tapers upward From bough to bough so downwardly did that I think in order that no one might climb it On that side where our pathway was enclosed Fell from the lofty rock a limpid water And spread itself abroad upon the leaves The Poets twain unto the tree drew near And from among the foliage a voice Cried Of this food ye shall have scarcity Then said More thoughtful Mary was of making The marriage feast complete and honourable Than of her mouth which now for you responds And for their drink the ancient Roman women With water were content and Daniel Disparaged food and understanding won The primal age was beautiful as gold Acorns it made with hunger savorous And nectar every rivulet with thirst Honey and locusts were the aliments That fed the Baptist in the wilderness Whence he is glorious and so magnified As by the Evangel is revealed to you Purgatorio Canto XXIII The while among the verdant leaves mine eyes I riveted as he is wont to do Who wastes his life pursuing little birds My more than Father said unto me Son Come now because the time that is ordained us More usefully should be apportioned out I turned my face and no less soon my steps Unto the Sages who were speaking so They made the going of no cost to me And lo were heard a song and a lament Labia mea Domine in fashion Such that delight and dolence it brought forth O my sweet Father what is this I hear Began I and he answered Shades that go Perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt In the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do Who unknown people on the road o ertaking Turn themselves round to them and do not stop Even thus behind us with a swifter motion Coming and passing onward gazed upon us A crowd of spirits silent and devout Each in his eyes was dark and cavernous Pallid in face and so emaciate That from the bones the skin did shape itself I do not think that so to merest rind Could Erisichthon have been withered up By famine when most fear he had of it Thinking within myself I said Behold This is the folk who lost Jerusalem When Mary made a prey of her own son Their sockets were like rings without the gems Whoever in the face of men reads omo Might well in these have recognised the m Who would believe the odour of an apple Begetting longing could consume them so And that of water without knowing how I still was wondering what so famished them For the occasion not yet manifest Of their emaciation and sad squalor And lo from out the hollow of his head His eyes a shade turned on me and looked keenly Then cried aloud What grace to me is this Never should I have known him by his look But in his voice was evident to me That which his aspect had suppressed within it This spark within me wholly re enkindled My recognition of his altered face And I recalled the features of Forese Ah do not look at this dry leprosy Entreated he which doth my skin discolour Nor at default of flesh that I may have But tell me truth of thee and who are those Two souls that yonder make for thee an escort Do not delay in speaking unto me That face of thine which dead I once bewept Gives me for weeping now no lesser grief I answered him beholding it so changed But tell me for God s sake what thus denudes you Make me not speak while I am marvelling For ill speaks he who s full of other longings And he to me From the eternal council Falls power into the water and the tree Behind us left whereby I grow so thin All of this people who lamenting sing For following beyond measure appetite In hunger and thirst are here re sanctified Desire to eat and drink enkindles in us The scent that issues from the apple tree And from the spray that sprinkles o er the verdure And not a single time alone this ground Encompassing is refreshed our pain I say our pain and ought to say our solace For the same wish doth lead us to the tree Which led the Christ rejoicing to say Eli When with his veins he liberated us And I to him Forese from that day When for a better life thou changedst worlds Up to this time five years have not rolled round If sooner were the power exhausted in thee Of sinning more than thee the hour surprised Of that good sorrow which to God reweds us How hast thou come up hitherward already I thought to find thee down there underneath Where time for time doth restitution make And he to me Thus speedily has led me To drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments My Nella with her overflowing tears She with her prayers devout and with her sighs Has drawn me from the coast where one where one awaits And from the other circles set me free So much more dear and pleasing is to God My little widow whom so much I loved As in good works she is the more alone For the Barbagia of Sardinia By far more modest in its women is Than the Barbagia I have left her in O brother sweet what wilt thou have me say A future time is in my sight already To which this hour will not be very old When from the pulpit shall be interdicted To the unblushing womankind of Florence To go about displaying breast and paps What savages were e er what Saracens Who stood in need to make them covered go Of spiritual or other discipline But if the shameless women were assured Of what swift Heaven prepares for them already Wide open would they have their mouths to howl For if my foresight here deceive me not They shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks Who now is hushed to sleep with lullaby O brother now no longer hide thee from me See that not only I but all these people Are gazing there where thou dost veil the sun Whence I to him If thou bring back to mind What thou with me hast been and I with thee The present memory will be grievous still Out of that life he turned me back who goes In front of me two days agone when round The sister of him yonder showed herself And to the sun I pointed Through the deep Night of the truly dead has this one led me With this true flesh that follows after him Thence his encouragements have led me up Ascending and still circling round the mount That you doth straighten whom the world made crooked He says that he will bear me company Till I shall be where Beatrice will be There it behoves me to remain without him This is Virgilius who thus says to me And him I pointed at the other is That shade for whom just now shook every slope Your realm that from itself discharges him Purgatorio Canto XXIV Nor speech the going nor the going that Slackened but talking we went bravely on Even as a vessel urged by a good wind And shadows that appeared things doubly dead From out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed Wonder at me aware that I was living And I continuing my colloquy Said Peradventure he goes up more slowly Than he would do for other people s sake But tell me if thou knowest where is Piccarda Tell me if any one of note I see Among this folk that gazes at me so My sister who twixt beautiful and good I know not which was more triumphs rejoicing Already in her crown on high Olympus So said he first and then Tis not forbidden To name each other here so milked away Is our resemblance by our dieting This pointing with his finger is Buonagiunta Buonagiunta of Lucca and that face Beyond him there more peaked than the others Has held the holy Church within his arms From Tours was he and purges by his fasting Bolsena s eels and the Vernaccia wine He named me many others one by one And all contented seemed at being named So that for this I saw not one dark look I saw for hunger bite the empty air Ubaldin dalla Pila and Boniface Who with his crook had pastured many people I saw Messer Marchese who had leisure Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness And he was one who ne er felt satisfied But as he does who scans and then doth prize One more than others did I him of Lucca Who seemed to take most cognizance of me He murmured and I know not what Gentucca From that place heard I where he felt the wound Of justice that doth macerate them so O soul I said that seemest so desirous To speak with me do so that I may hear thee And with thy speech appease thyself and me A maid is born and wears not yet the veil Began he who to thee shall pleasant make My city howsoever men may blame it Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived True things hereafter will declare it to thee But say if him I here behold who forth Evoked the new invented rhymes beginning Ladies that have intelligence of love And I to him One am I who whenever Love doth inspire me note and in that measure Which he within me dictates singing go O brother now I see he said the knot Which me the Notary and Guittone held Short of the sweet new style that now I hear I do perceive full clearly how your pens Go closely following after him who dictates Which with our own forsooth came not to pass And he who sets himself to go beyond No difference sees from one style to another And as if satisfied he held his peace Even as the birds that winter tow rds the Nile Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves Then fly in greater haste and go in file In such wise all the people who were there Turning their faces hurried on their steps Both by their leanness and their wishes light And as a man who weary is with trotting Lets his companions onward go and walks Until he vents the panting of his chest So did Forese let the holy flock Pass by and came with me behind it saying When will it be that I again shall see thee How long I answered I may live I know not Yet my return will not so speedy be But I shall sooner in desire arrive Because the place where I was set to live From day to day of good is more depleted And unto dismal ruin seems ordained Now go he said for him most guilty of it At a beast s tail behold I dragged along Towards the valley where is no repentance Faster at every step the beast is going Increasing evermore until it smites him And leaves the body vilely mutilated Not long those wheels shall turn and he uplifted His eyes to heaven ere shall be clear to thee That which my speech no farther can declare Now stay behind because the time so precious Is in this kingdom that I lose too much By coming onward thus abreast with thee As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop A cavalier from out a troop that ride And seeks the honour of the first encounter So he with greater strides departed from us And on the road remained I with those two Who were such mighty marshals of the world And when before us he had gone so far Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants As was my understanding to his words Appeared to me with laden and living boughs Another apple tree and not far distant From having but just then turned thitherward People I saw beneath it lift their hands And cry I know not what towards the leaves Like little children eager and deluded Who pray and he they pray to doth not answer But to make very keen their appetite Holds their desire aloft and hides it not Then they departed as if undeceived And now we came unto the mighty tree Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses Pass farther onward without drawing near The tree of which Eve ate is higher up And out of that one has this tree been raised Thus said I know not who among the branches Whereat Virgilius Statius and myself Went crowding forward on the side that rises Be mindful said he of the accursed ones Formed of the cloud rack who inebriate Combated Theseus with their double breasts And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking Whence Gideon would not have them for companions When he tow rds Midian the hills descended Thus closely pressed to one of the two borders On passed we hearing sins of gluttony Followed forsooth by miserable gains Then set at large upon the lonely road A thousand steps and more we onward went In contemplation each without a word What go ye thinking thus ye three alone Said suddenly a voice whereat I started As terrified and timid beasts are wont I raised my head to see who this might be And never in a furnace was there seen Metals or glass so lucent and so red As one I saw who said If it may please you To mount aloft here it behoves you turn This way goes he who goeth after peace His aspect had bereft me of my sight So that I turned me back unto my Teachers Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him And as the harbinger of early dawn The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst My front and felt the moving of the plumes That breathed around an odour of ambrosia And heard it said Blessed are they whom grace So much illumines that the love of taste Excites not in their breasts too great desire Hungering at all times so far as is just Purgatorio Canto XXV Now was it the ascent no hindrance brooked Because the sun had his meridian circle To Taurus left and night to Scorpio Wherefore as doth a man who tarries not But goes his way whate er to him appear If of necessity the sting transfix him In this wise did we enter through the gap Taking the stairway one before the other Which by its narrowness divides the climbers And as the little stork that lifts its wing With a desire to fly and does not venture To leave the nest and lets it downward droop Even such was I with the desire of asking Kindled and quenched unto the motion coming He makes who doth address himself to speak Not for our pace though rapid it might be My father sweet forbore but said Let fly The bow of speech thou to the barb hast drawn With confidence I opened then my mouth And I began How can one meagre grow There where the need of nutriment applies not If thou wouldst call to mind how Meleager Was wasted by the wasting of a brand This would not said he be to thee so sour And wouldst thou think how at each tremulous motion Trembles within a mirror your own image That which seems hard would mellow seem to thee But that thou mayst content thee in thy wish Lo Statius here and him I call and pray He now will be the healer of thy wounds If I unfold to him the eternal vengeance Responded Statius where thou present art Be my excuse that I can naught deny thee Then he began Son if these words of mine Thy mind doth contemplate and doth receive They ll be thy light unto the How thou sayest The perfect blood which never is drunk up Into the thirsty veins and which remaineth Like food that from the table thou removest Takes in the heart for all the human members Virtue informative as being that Which to be changed to them goes through the veins Again digest descends it where tis better Silent to be than say and then drops thence Upon another s blood in natural vase There one together with the other mingles One to be passive meant the other active By reason of the perfect place it springs from And being conjoined begins to operate Coagulating first then vivifying What for its matter it had made consistent The active virtue being made a soul As of a plant in so far different This on the way is that arrived already Then works so much that now it moves and feels Like a sea fungus and then undertakes To organize the powers whose seed it is Now Son dilates and now distends itself The virtue from the generator s heart Where nature is intent on all the members But how from animal it man becomes Thou dost not see as yet this is a point Which made a wiser man than thou once err So far that in his doctrine separate He made the soul from possible intellect For he no organ saw by this assumed Open thy breast unto the truth that s coming And know that just as soon as in the foetus The articulation of the brain is perfect The primal Motor turns to it well pleased At so great art of nature and inspires A spirit new with virtue all replete Which what it finds there active doth attract Into its substance and becomes one soul Which lives and feels and on itself revolves And that thou less may wonder at my word Behold the sun s heat which becometh wine Joined to the juice that from the vine distils Whenever Lachesis has no more thread It separates from the flesh and virtually Bears with itself the human and divine The other faculties are voiceless all The memory the intelligence and the will In action far more vigorous than before Without a pause it falleth of itself In marvellous way on one shore or the other There of its roads it first is cognizant Soon as the place there circumscribeth it The virtue informative rays round about As and as much as in the living members And even as the air when full of rain By alien rays that are therein reflected With divers colours shows itself adorned So there the neighbouring air doth shape itself Into that form which doth impress upon it Virtually the soul that has stood still And then in manner of the little flame Which followeth the fire where er it shifts After the spirit followeth its new form Since afterwards it takes from this its semblance It is called shade and thence it organizes Thereafter every sense even to the sight Thence is it that we speak and thence we laugh Thence is it that we form the tears and sighs That on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard According as impress us our desires And other affections so the shade is shaped And this is cause of what thou wonderest at And now unto the last of all the circles Had we arrived and to the right hand turned And were attentive to another care There the embankment shoots forth flames of fire And upward doth the cornice breathe a blast That drives them back and from itself sequesters Hence we must needs go on the open side And one by one and I did fear the fire On this side and on that the falling down My Leader said Along this place one ought To keep upon the eyes a tightened rein Seeing that one so easily might err Summae Deus clementiae in the bosom Of the great burning chanted then I heard Which made me no less eager to turn round And spirits saw I walking through the flame Wherefore I looked to my own steps and theirs Apportioning my sight from time to time After the close which to that hymn is made Aloud they shouted Virum non cognosco Then recommenced the hymn with voices low This also ended cried they To the wood Diana ran and drove forth Helice Therefrom who had of Venus felt the poison Then to their song returned they then the wives They shouted and the husbands who were chaste As virtue and the marriage vow imposes And I believe that them this mode suffices For all the time the fire is burning them With such care is it needful and such food That the last wound of all should be closed up Purgatorio Canto XXVI While on the brink thus one before the other We went upon our way oft the good Master Said Take thou heed suffice it that I warn thee On the right shoulder smote me now the sun That raying out already the whole west Changed from its azure aspect into white And with my shadow did I make the flame Appear more red and even to such a sign Shades saw I many as they went give heed This was the cause that gave them a beginning To speak of me and to themselves began they To say That seems not a factitious body Then towards me as far as they could come Came certain of them always with regard Not to step forth where they would not be burned O thou who goest not from being slower But reverent perhaps behind the others Answer me who in thirst and fire am burning Nor to me only is thine answer needful For all of these have greater thirst for it Than for cold water Ethiop or Indian Tell us how is it that thou makest thyself A wall unto the sun as if thou hadst not Entered as yet into the net of death Thus one of them addressed me and I straight Should have revealed myself were I not bent On other novelty that then appeared For through the middle of the burning road There came a people face to face with these Which held me in suspense with gazing at them There see I hastening upon either side Each of the shades and kissing one another Without a pause content with brief salute Thus in the middle of their brown battalions Muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another Perchance to spy their journey or their fortune No sooner is the friendly greeting ended Or ever the first footstep passes onward Each one endeavours to outcry the other The new come people Sodom and Gomorrah The rest Into the cow Pasiphae enters So that the bull unto her lust may run Then as the cranes that to Riphaean mountains Might fly in part and part towards the sands These of the frost those of the sun avoidant One folk is going and the other coming And weeping they return to their first songs And to the cry that most befitteth them And close to me approached even as before The very same who had entreated me Attent to listen in their countenance I who their inclination twice had seen Began O souls secure in the possession Whene er it may be of a state of peace Neither unripe nor ripened have remained My members upon earth but here are with me With their own blood and their articulations I go up here to be no longer blind A Lady is above who wins this grace Whereby the mortal through your world I bring But as your greatest longing satisfied May soon become so that the Heaven may house you Which full of love is and most amply spreads Tell me that I again in books may write it Who are you and what is that multitude Which goes upon its way behind your backs Not otherwise with wonder is bewildered The mountaineer and staring round is dumb When rough and rustic to the town he goes Than every shade became in its appearance But when they of their stupor were disburdened Which in high hearts is quickly quieted Blessed be thou who of our border lands He recommenced who first had questioned us Experience freightest for a better life The folk that comes not with us have offended In that for which once Caesar triumphing Heard himself called in contumely Queen Therefore they separate exclaiming Sodom Themselves reproving even as thou hast heard And add unto their burning by their shame Our own transgression was hermaphrodite But because we observed not human law Following like unto beasts our appetite In our opprobrium by us is read When we part company the name of her Who bestialized herself in bestial wood Now knowest thou our acts and what our crime was Wouldst thou perchance by name know who we are There is not time to tell nor could I do it Thy wish to know me shall in sooth be granted I m Guido Guinicelli and now purge me Having repented ere the hour extreme The same that in the sadness of Lycurgus Two sons became their mother re beholding Such I became but rise not to such height The moment I heard name himself the father Of me and of my betters who had ever Practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love And without speech and hearing thoughtfully For a long time I went beholding him Nor for the fire did I approach him nearer When I was fed with looking utterly Myself I offered ready for his service With affirmation that compels belief And he to me Thou leavest footprints such In me from what I hear and so distinct Lethe cannot efface them nor make dim But if thy words just now the truth have sworn Tell me what is the cause why thou displayest In word and look that dear thou holdest me And I to him Those dulcet lays of yours Which long as shall endure our modern fashion Shall make for ever dear their very ink O brother said he he whom I point out And here he pointed at a spirit in front Was of the mother tongue a better smith Verses of love and proses of romance He mastered all and let the idiots talk Who think the Lemosin surpasses him To clamour more than truth they turn their faces And in this way establish their opinion Ere art or reason has by them been heard Thus many ancients with Guittone did From cry to cry still giving him applause Until the truth has conquered with most persons Now if thou hast such ample privilege Tis granted thee to go unto the cloister Wherein is Christ the abbot of the college To him repeat for me a Paternoster So far as needful to us of this world Where power of sinning is no longer ours Then to give place perchance to one behind Whom he had near he vanished in the fire As fish in water going to the bottom I moved a little tow rds him pointed out And said that to his name my own desire An honourable place was making ready He of his own free will began to say Tan m abellis vostre cortes deman Que jeu nom puesc ni vueill a vos cobrire Jeu sui Arnaut que plor e vai chantan Consiros vei la passada folor E vei jauzen lo jorn qu esper denan Ara vus prec per aquella valor Que vus condus al som de la scalina Sovenga vus a temprar ma dolor Then hid him in the fire that purifies them So pleases me your courteous demand I cannot and I will not hide me from you I am Arnaut who weep and singing go Contrite I see the folly of the past And joyous see the hoped for day before me Therefore do I implore you by that power Which guides you to the summit of the stairs Be mindful to assuage my suffering Purgatorio Canto XXVII As when he vibrates forth his earliest rays In regions where his Maker shed his blood The Ebro falling under lofty Libra And waters in the Ganges burnt with noon So stood the Sun hence was the day departing When the glad Angel of God appeared to us Outside the flame he stood upon the verge And chanted forth Beati mundo corde In voice by far more living than our own Then No one farther goes souls sanctified If first the fire bite not within it enter And be not deaf unto the song beyond When we were close beside him thus he said Wherefore e en such became I when I heard him As he is who is put into the grave Upon my clasped hands I straightened me Scanning the fire and vividly recalling The human bodies I had once seen burned Towards me turned themselves my good Conductors And unto me Virgilius said My son Here may indeed be torment but not death Remember thee remember and if I On Geryon have safely guided thee What shall I do now I am nearer God Believe for certain shouldst thou stand a full Millennium in the bosom of this flame It could not make thee bald a single hair And if perchance thou think that I deceive thee Draw near to it and put it to the proof With thine own hands upon thy garment s hem Now lay aside now lay aside all fear Turn hitherward and onward come securely And I still motionless and gainst my conscience Seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn Somewhat disturbed he said Now look thou Son Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall As at the name of Thisbe oped his lids The dying Pyramus and gazed upon her What time the mulberry became vermilion Even thus my obduracy being softened I turned to my wise Guide hearing the name That in my memory evermore is welling Whereat he wagged his head and said How now Shall we stay on this side then smiled as one Does at a child who s vanquished by an apple Then into the fire in front of me he entered Beseeching Statius to come after me Who a long way before divided us When I was in it into molten glass I would have cast me to refresh myself So without measure was the burning there And my sweet Father to encourage me Discoursing still of Beatrice went on Saying Her eyes I seem to see already A voice that on the other side was singing Directed us and we attent alone On that came forth where the ascent began Venite benedicti Patris mei Sounded within a splendour which was there Such it o ercame me and I could not look The sun departs it added and night cometh Tarry ye not but onward urge your steps So long as yet the west becomes not dark Straight forward through the rock the path ascended In such a way that I cut off the rays Before me of the sun that now was low And of few stairs we yet had made assay Ere by the vanished shadow the sun s setting Behind us we perceived I and my Sages And ere in all its parts immeasurable The horizon of one aspect had become And Night her boundless dispensation held Each of us of a stair had made his bed Because the nature of the mount took from us The power of climbing more than the delight Even as in ruminating passive grow The goats who have been swift and venturesome Upon the mountain tops ere they were fed Hushed in the shadow while the sun is hot Watched by the herdsman who upon his staff Is leaning and in leaning tendeth them And as the shepherd lodging out of doors Passes the night beside his quiet flock Watching that no wild beast may scatter it Such at that hour were we all three of us I like the goat and like the herdsmen they Begirt on this side and on that by rocks Little could there be seen of things without But through that little I beheld the stars More luminous and larger than their wont Thus ruminating and beholding these Sleep seized upon me sleep that oftentimes Before a deed is done has tidings of it It was the hour I think when from the East First on the mountain Citherea beamed Who with the fire of love seems always burning Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought I saw a lady walking in a meadow Gathering flowers and singing she was saying Know whosoever may my name demand That I am Leah and go moving round My beauteous hands to make myself a garland To please me at the mirror here I deck me But never does my sister Rachel leave Her looking glass and sitteth all day long To see her beauteous eyes as eager is she As I am to adorn me with my hands Her seeing and me doing satisfies And now before the antelucan splendours That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise As home returning less remote they lodge The darkness fled away on every side And slumber with it whereupon I rose Seeing already the great Masters risen That apple sweet which through so many branches The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of To day shall put in peace thy hungerings Speaking to me Virgilius of such words As these made use and never were there guerdons That could in pleasantness compare with these Such longing upon longing came upon me To be above that at each step thereafter For flight I felt in me the pinions growing When underneath us was the stairway all Run o er and we were on the highest step Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes And said The temporal fire and the eternal Son thou hast seen and to a place art come Where of myself no farther I discern By intellect and art I here have brought thee Take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth Beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou Behold the sun that shines upon thy forehead Behold the grass the flowerets and the shrubs Which of itself alone this land produces Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes Which weeping caused me to come unto thee Thou canst sit down and thou canst walk among them Expect no more or word or sign from me Free and upright and sound is thy free will And error were it not to do its bidding Thee o er thyself I therefore crown and mitre Purgatorio Canto XXVIII Eager already to search in and round The heavenly forest dense and living green Which tempered to the eyes the new born day Withouten more delay I left the bank Taking the level country slowly slowly Over the soil that everywhere breathes fragrance A softly breathing air that no mutation Had in itself upon the forehead smote me No heavier blow than of a gentle wind Whereat the branches lightly tremulous Did all of them bow downward toward that side Where its first shadow casts the Holy Mountain Yet not from their upright direction swayed So that the little birds upon their tops Should leave the practice of each art of theirs But with full ravishment the hours of prime Singing received they in the midst of leaves That ever bore a burden to their rhymes Such as from branch to branch goes gathering on Through the pine forest on the shore of Chiassi When Eolus unlooses the Sirocco Already my slow steps had carried me Into the ancient wood so far that I Could not perceive where I had entered it And lo my further course a stream cut off Which tow rd the left hand with its little waves Bent down the grass that on its margin sprang All waters that on earth most limpid are Would seem to have within themselves some mixture Compared with that which nothing doth conceal Although it moves on with a brown brown current Under the shade perpetual that never Ray of the sun lets in nor of the moon With feet I stayed and with mine eyes I passed Beyond the rivulet to look upon The great variety of the fresh may And there appeared to me even as appears Suddenly something that doth turn aside Through very wonder every other thought A lady all alone who went along Singing and culling floweret after floweret With which her pathway was all painted over Ah beauteous lady who in rays of love Dost warm thyself if I may trust to looks Which the heart s witnesses are wont to be May the desire come unto thee to draw Near to this river s bank I said to her So much that I might hear what thou art singing Thou makest me remember where and what Proserpina that moment was when lost Her mother her and she herself the Spring As turns herself with feet together pressed And to the ground a lady who is dancing And hardly puts one foot before the other On the vermilion and the yellow flowerets She turned towards me not in other wise Than maiden who her modest eyes casts down And my entreaties made to be content So near approaching that the dulcet sound Came unto me together with its meaning As soon as she was where the grasses are Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river To lift her eyes she granted me the boon I do not think there shone so great a light Under the lids of Venus when transfixed By her own son beyond his usual custom Erect upon the other bank she smiled Bearing full many colours in her hands Which that high land produces without seed Apart three paces did the river make us But Hellespont where Xerxes passed across A curb still to all human arrogance More hatred from Leander did not suffer For rolling between Sestos and Abydos Than that from me because it oped not then Ye are new comers and because I smile Began she peradventure in this place Elect to human nature for its nest Some apprehension keeps you marvelling But the psalm Delectasti giveth light Which has the power to uncloud your intellect And thou who foremost art and didst entreat me Speak if thou wouldst hear more for I came ready To all thy questionings as far as needful The water said I and the forest s sound Are combating within me my new faith In something which I heard opposed to this Whence she I will relate how from its cause Proceedeth that which maketh thee to wonder And purge away the cloud that smites upon thee The Good Supreme sole in itself delighting Created man good and this goodly place Gave him as hansel of eternal peace By his default short while he sojourned here By his default to weeping and to toil He changed his innocent laughter and sweet play That the disturbance which below is made By exhalations of the land and water Which far as may be follow after heat Might not upon mankind wage any war This mount ascended tow rds the heaven so high And is exempt from there where it is locked Now since the universal atmosphere Turns in a circuit with the primal motion Unless the circle is broken on some side Upon this height that all is disengaged In living ether doth this motion strike And make the forest sound for it is dense And so much power the stricken plant possesses That with its virtue it impregns the air And this revolving scatters it around And yonder earth according as tis worthy In self or in its clime conceives and bears Of divers qualities the divers trees It should not seem a marvel then on earth This being heard whenever any plant Without seed manifest there taketh root And thou must know this holy table land In which thou art is full of every seed And fruit has in it never gathered there The water which thou seest springs not from vein Restored by vapour that the cold condenses Like to a stream that gains or loses breath But issues from a fountain safe and certain Which by the will of God as much regains As it discharges open on two sides Upon this side with virtue it descends Which takes away all memory of sin On that of every good deed done restores it Here Lethe as upon the other side Eunoe it is called and worketh not If first on either side it be not tasted This every other savour doth transcend And notwithstanding slaked so far may be Thy thirst that I reveal to thee no more I ll give thee a corollary still in grace Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear If it spread out beyond my promise to thee Those who in ancient times have feigned in song The Age of Gold and its felicity Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus Here was the human race in innocence Here evermore was Spring and every fruit This is the nectar of which each one speaks Then backward did I turn me wholly round Unto my Poets and saw that with a smile They had been listening to these closing words Then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes Purgatorio Canto XXIX Singing like unto an enamoured lady She with the ending of her words continued Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata And even as Nymphs that wandered all alone Among the sylvan shadows sedulous One to avoid and one to see the sun She then against the stream moved onward going Along the bank and I abreast of her Her little steps with little steps attending Between her steps and mine were not a hundred When equally the margins gave a turn In such a way that to the East I faced Nor even thus our way continued far Before the lady wholly turned herself Unto me saying Brother look and listen And lo a sudden lustre ran across On every side athwart the spacious forest Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning But since the lightning ceases as it comes And that continuing brightened more and more Within my thought I said What thing is this And a delicious melody there ran Along the luminous air whence holy zeal Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve For there where earth and heaven obedient were The woman only and but just created Could not endure to stay neath any veil Underneath which had she devoutly stayed I sooner should have tasted those delights Ineffable and for a longer time While mid such manifold first fruits I walked Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt And still solicitous of more delights In front of us like an enkindled fire Became the air beneath the verdant boughs And the sweet sound as singing now was heard O Virgins sacrosanct if ever hunger Vigils or cold for you I have endured The occasion spurs me their reward to claim Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me And with her choir Urania must assist me To put in verse things difficult to think A little farther on seven trees of gold In semblance the long space still intervening Between ourselves and them did counterfeit But when I had approached so near to them The common object which the sense deceives Lost not by distance any of its marks The faculty that lends discourse to reason Did apprehend that they were candlesticks And in the voices of the song Hosanna Above them flamed the harness beautiful Far brighter than the moon in the serene Of midnight at the middle of her month I turned me round with admiration filled To good Virgilius and he answered me With visage no less full of wonderment Then back I turned my face to those high things Which moved themselves towards us so sedately They had been distanced by new wedded brides The lady chid me Why dost thou burn only So with affection for the living lights And dost not look at what comes after them Then saw I people as behind their leaders Coming behind them garmented in white And such a whiteness never was on earth The water on my left flank was resplendent And back to me reflected my left side E en as a mirror if I looked therein When I upon my margin had such post That nothing but the stream divided us Better to see I gave my steps repose And I beheld the flamelets onward go Leaving behind themselves the air depicted And they of trailing pennons had the semblance So that it overhead remained distinct With sevenfold lists all of them of the colours Whence the sun s bow is made and Delia s girdle These standards to the rearward longer were Than was my sight and as it seemed to me Ten paces were the outermost apart Under so fair a heaven as I describe The four and twenty Elders two by two Came on incoronate with flower de luce They all of them were singing Blessed thou Among the daughters of Adam art and blessed For evermore shall be thy loveliness After the flowers and other tender grasses In front of me upon the other margin Were disencumbered of that race elect Even as in heaven star followeth after star There came close after them four animals Incoronate each one with verdant leaf Plumed with six wings was every one of them The plumage full of eyes the eyes of Argus If they were living would be such as these Reader to trace their forms no more I waste My rhymes for other spendings press me so That I in this cannot be prodigal But read Ezekiel who depicteth them As he beheld them from the region cold Coming with cloud with whirlwind and with fire And such as thou shalt find them in his pages Such were they here saving that in their plumage John is with me and differeth from him The interval between these four contained A chariot triumphal on two wheels Which by a Griffin s neck came drawn along And upward he extended both his wings Between the middle list and three and three So that he injured none by cleaving it So high they rose that they were lost to sight His limbs were gold so far as he was bird And white the others with vermilion mingled Not only Rome with no such splendid car E er gladdened Africanus or Augustus But poor to it that of the Sun would be That of the Sun which swerving was burnt up At the importunate orison of Earth When Jove was so mysteriously just Three maidens at the right wheel in a circle Came onward dancing one so very red That in the fire she hardly had been noted The second was as if her flesh and bones Had all been fashioned out of emerald The third appeared as snow but newly fallen And now they seemed conducted by the white Now by the red and from the song of her The others took their step or slow or swift Upon the left hand four made holiday Vested in purple following the measure Of one of them with three eyes m her head In rear of all the group here treated of Two old men I beheld unlike in habit But like in gait each dignified and grave One showed himself as one of the disciples Of that supreme Hippocrates whom nature Made for the animals she holds most dear Contrary care the other manifested With sword so shining and so sharp it caused Terror to me on this side of the river Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect And behind all an aged man alone Walking in sleep with countenance acute And like the foremost company these seven Were habited yet of the flower de luce No garland round about the head they wore But of the rose and other flowers vermilion At little distance would the sight have sworn That all were in a flame above their brows And when the car was opposite to me Thunder was heard and all that folk august Seemed to have further progress interdicted There with the vanward ensigns standing still Purgatorio Canto XXX When the Septentrion of the highest heaven Which never either setting knew or rising Nor veil of other cloud than that of sin And which made every one therein aware Of his own duty as the lower makes Whoever turns the helm to come to port Motionless halted the veracious people That came at first between it and the Griffin Turned themselves to the car as to their peace And one of them as if by Heaven commissioned Singing Veni sponsa de Libano Shouted three times and all the others after Even as the Blessed at the final summons Shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern Uplifting light the reinvested flesh So upon that celestial chariot A hundred rose ad vocem tanti senis Ministers and messengers of life eternal They all were saying Benedictus qui venis And scattering flowers above and round about Manibus o date lilia plenis Ere now have I beheld as day began The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose And the other heaven with fair serene adorned And the sun s face uprising overshadowed So that by tempering influence of vapours For a long interval the eye sustained it Thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers Which from those hands angelical ascended And downward fell again inside and out Over her snow white veil with olive cinct Appeared a lady under a green mantle Vested in colour of the living flame And my own spirit that already now So long a time had been that in her presence Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed Without more knowledge having by mine eyes Through occult virtue that from her proceeded Of ancient love the mighty influence felt As soon as on my vision smote the power Sublime that had already pierced me through Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth To the left hand I turned with that reliance With which the little child runs to his mother When he has fear or when he is afflicted To say unto Virgilius Not a drachm Of blood remains in me that does not tremble I know the traces of the ancient flame But us Virgilius of himself deprived Had left Virgilius sweetest of all fathers Virgilius to whom I for safety gave me Nor whatsoever lost the ancient mother Availed my cheeks now purified from dew That weeping they should not again be darkened Dante because Virgilius has departed Do not weep yet do not weep yet awhile For by another sword thou need saint must weep E en as an admiral who on poop and prow Comes to behold the people that are working In other ships and cheers them to well doing Upon the left hand border of the car When at the sound I turned of my own name Which of necessity is here recorded I saw the Lady who erewhile appeared Veiled underneath the angelic festival Direct her eyes to me across the river Although the veil that from her head descended Encircled with the foliage of Minerva Did not permit her to appear distinctly In attitude still royally majestic Continued she like unto one who speaks And keeps his warmest utterance in reserve Look at me well in sooth I m Beatrice How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain Didst thou not know that man is happy here Mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain But seeing myself therein I sought the grass So great a shame did weigh my forehead down As to the son the mother seems superb So she appeared to me for somewhat bitter Tasteth the savour of severe compassion Silent became she and the Angels sang Suddenly In te Domine speravi But beyond pedes meos did not pass Even as the snow among the living rafters Upon the back of Italy congeals Blown on and drifted by Sclavonian winds And then dissolving trickles through itself Whene er the land that loses shadow breathes So that it seems a fire that melts a taper E en thus was I without a tear or sigh Before the song of those who sing for ever After the music of the eternal spheres But when I heard in their sweet melodies Compassion for me more than had they said O wherefore lady dost thou thus upbraid him The ice that was about my heart congealed To air and water changed and in my anguish Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast She on the right hand border of the car Still firmly standing to those holy beings Thus her discourse directed afterwards Ye keep your watch in the eternal day So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you One step the ages make upon their path Therefore my answer is with greater care That he may hear me who is weeping yonder So that the sin and dole be of one measure Not only by the work of those great wheels That destine every seed unto some end According as the stars are in conjunction But by the largess of celestial graces Which have such lofty vapours for their rain That near to them our sight approaches not Such had this man become in his new life Potentially that every righteous habit Would have made admirable proof in him But so much more malignant and more savage Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed The more good earthly vigour it possesses Some time did I sustain him with my look Revealing unto him my youthful eyes I led him with me turned in the right way As soon as ever of my second age I was upon the threshold and changed life Himself from me he took and gave to others When from the flesh to spirit I ascended And beauty and virtue were in me increased I was to him less dear and less delightful And into ways untrue he turned his steps Pursuing the false images of good That never any promises fulfil Nor prayer for inspiration me availed By means of which in dreams and otherwise I called him back so little did he heed them So low he fell that all appliances For his salvation were already short Save showing him the people of perdition For this I visited the gates of death And unto him who so far up has led him My intercessions were with weeping borne God s lofty fiat would be violated If Lethe should be passed and if such viands Should tasted be withouten any scot Of penitence that gushes forth in tears Purgatorio Canto XXXI O thou who art beyond the sacred river Turning to me the point of her discourse That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen She recommenced continuing without pause Say say if this be true to such a charge Thy own confession needs must be conjoined My faculties were in so great confusion That the voice moved but sooner was extinct Than by its organs it was set at large Awhile she waited then she said What thinkest Answer me for the mournful memories In thee not yet are by the waters injured Confusion and dismay together mingled Forced such a Yes from out my mouth that sight Was needful to the understanding of it Even as a cross bow breaks when tis discharged Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow And with less force the arrow hits the mark So I gave way beneath that heavy burden Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs And the voice flagged upon its passage forth Whence she to me In those desires of mine Which led thee to the loving of that good Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to What trenches lying traverse or what chains Didst thou discover that of passing onward Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope And what allurements or what vantages Upon the forehead of the others showed That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them After the heaving of a bitter sigh Hardly had I the voice to make response And with fatigue my lips did fashion it Weeping I said The things that present were With their false pleasure turned aside my steps Soon as your countenance concealed itself And she Shouldst thou be silent or deny What thou confessest not less manifest Would be thy fault by such a Judge tis known But when from one s own cheeks comes bursting forth The accusal of the sin in our tribunal Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself But still that thou mayst feel a greater shame For thy transgression and another time Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong Cast down the seed of weeping and attend So shalt thou hear how in an opposite way My buried flesh should have directed thee Never to thee presented art or nature Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein I was enclosed which scattered are in earth And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee By reason of my death what mortal thing Should then have drawn thee into its desire Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft Of things fallacious to have risen up To follow me who was no longer such Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward To wait for further blows or little girl Or other vanity of such brief use The callow birdlet waits for two or three But to the eyes of those already fledged In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot Even as children silent in their shame Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground And conscious of their fault and penitent So was I standing and she said If thou In hearing sufferest pain lift up thy beard And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing With less resistance is a robust holm Uprooted either by a native wind Or else by that from regions of Iarbas Than I upraised at her command my chin And when she by the beard the face demanded Well I perceived the venom of her meaning And as my countenance was lifted up Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful Had rested from the strewing of the flowers And still but little reassured mine eyes Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster That is one person only in two natures Beneath her veil beyond the margent green She seemed to me far more her ancient self To excel than others here when she was here So pricked me then the thorn of penitence That of all other things the one which turned me Most to its love became the most my foe Such self conviction stung me at the heart O erpowered I fell and what I then became She knoweth who had furnished me the cause Then when the heart restored my outward sense The lady I had found alone above me I saw and she was saying Hold me hold me Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me And dragging me behind her she was moving Upon the water lightly as a shuttle When I was near unto the blessed shore Asperges me I heard so sweetly sung Remember it I cannot much less write it The beautiful lady opened wide her arms Embraced my head and plunged me underneath Where I was forced to swallow of the water Then forth she drew me and all dripping brought Into the dance of the four beautiful And each one with her arm did cover me We here are Nymphs and in the Heaven are stars Ere Beatrice descended to the world We as her handmaids were appointed her We ll lead thee to her eyes but for the pleasant Light that within them is shall sharpen thine The three beyond who more profoundly look Thus singing they began and afterwards Unto the Griffin s breast they led me with them Where Beatrice was standing turned towards us See that thou dost not spare thine eyes they said Before the emeralds have we stationed thee Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons A thousand longings hotter than the flame Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed As in a glass the sun not otherwise Within them was the twofold monster shining Now with the one now with the other nature Think Reader if within myself I marvelled When I beheld the thing itself stand still And in its image it transformed itself While with amazement filled and jubilant My soul was tasting of the food that while It satisfies us makes us hunger for it Themselves revealing of the highest rank In bearing did the other three advance Singing to their angelic saraband Turn Beatrice O turn thy holy eyes Such was their song unto thy faithful one Who has to see thee ta en so many steps In grace do us the grace that thou unveil Thy face to him so that he may discern The second beauty which thou dost conceal O splendour of the living light eternal Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus Has grown so pale or drunk so at its cistern He would not seem to have his mind encumbered Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear Where the harmonious heaven o ershadowed thee When in the open air thou didst unveil Purgatorio Canto XXXII So steadfast and attentive were mine eyes In satisfying their decennial thirst That all my other senses were extinct And upon this side and on that they had Walls of indifference so the holy smile Drew them unto itself with the old net When forcibly my sight was turned away Towards my left hand by those goddesses Because I heard from them a Too intently And that condition of the sight which is In eyes but lately smitten by the sun Bereft me of my vision some short while But to the less when sight re shaped itself I say the less in reference to the greater Splendour from which perforce I had withdrawn I saw upon its right wing wheeled about The glorious host returning with the sun And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces As underneath its shields to save itself A squadron turns and with its banner wheels Before the whole thereof can change its front That soldiery of the celestial kingdom Which marched in the advance had wholly passed us Before the chariot had turned its pole Then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves And the Griffin moved his burden benedight But so that not a feather of him fluttered The lady fair who drew me through the ford Followed with Statius and myself the wheel Which made its orbit with the lesser arc So passing through the lofty forest vacant By fault of her who in the serpent trusted Angelic music made our steps keep time Perchance as great a space had in three flights An arrow loosened from the string o erpassed As we had moved when Beatrice descended I heard them murmur altogether Adam Then circled they about a tree despoiled Of blooms and other leafage on each bough Its tresses which so much the more dilate As higher they ascend had been by Indians Among their forests marvelled at for height Blessed art thou O Griffin who dost not Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste Since appetite by this was turned to evil After this fashion round the tree robust The others shouted and the twofold creature Thus is preserved the seed of all the just And turning to the pole which he had dragged He drew it close beneath the widowed bough And what was of it unto it left bound In the same manner as our trees when downward Falls the great light with that together mingled Which after the celestial Lasca shines Begin to swell and then renew themselves Each one with its own colour ere the Sun Harness his steeds beneath another star Less than of rose and more than violet A hue disclosing was renewed the tree That had erewhile its boughs so desolate I never heard nor here below is sung The hymn which afterward that people sang Nor did I bear the melody throughout Had I the power to paint how fell asleep Those eyes compassionless of Syrinx hearing Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear Even as a painter who from model paints I would portray how I was lulled asleep He may who well can picture drowsihood Therefore I pass to what time I awoke And say a splendour rent from me the veil Of slumber and a calling Rise what dost thou As to behold the apple tree in blossom Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven Peter and John and James conducted were And overcome recovered at the word By which still greater slumbers have been broken And saw their school diminished by the loss Not only of Elias but of Moses And the apparel of their Master changed So I revived and saw that piteous one Above me standing who had been conductress Aforetime of my steps beside the river And all in doubt I said Where s Beatrice And she Behold her seated underneath The leafage new upon the root of it Behold the company that circles her The rest behind the Griffin are ascending With more melodious song and more profound And if her speech were more diffuse I know not Because already in my sight was she Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me Alone she sat upon the very earth Left there as guardian of the chariot Which I had seen the biform monster fasten Encircling her a cloister made themselves The seven Nymphs with those lights in their hands Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster Short while shalt thou be here a forester And thou shalt be with me for evermore A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman Therefore for that world s good which liveth ill Fix on the car thine eyes and what thou seest Having returned to earth take heed thou write Thus Beatrice and I who at the feet Of her commandments all devoted was My mind and eyes directed where she willed Never descended with so swift a motion Fire from a heavy cloud when it is raining From out the region which is most remote As I beheld the bird of Jove descend Down through the tree rending away the bark As well as blossoms and the foliage new And he with all his might the chariot smote Whereat it reeled like vessel in a tempest Tossed by the waves now starboard and now larboard Thereafter saw I leap into the body Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox That seemed unfed with any wholesome food But for his hideous sins upbraiding him My Lady put him to as swift a flight As such a fleshless skeleton could bear Then by the way that it before had come Into the chariot s chest I saw the Eagle Descend and leave it feathered with his plumes And such as issues from a heart that mourns A voice from Heaven there issued and it said My little bark how badly art thou freighted Methought then that the earth did yawn between Both wheels and I saw rise from it a Dragon Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail And as a wasp that draweth back its sting Drawing unto himself his tail malign Drew out the floor and went his way rejoicing That which remained behind even as with grass A fertile region with the feathers offered Perhaps with pure intention and benign Reclothed itself and with them were reclothed The pole and both the wheels so speedily A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart Transfigured thus the holy edifice Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it Three on the pole and one at either corner The first were horned like oxen but the four Had but a single horn upon the forehead A monster such had never yet been seen Firm as a rock upon a mountain high Seated upon it there appeared to me A shameless whore with eyes swift glancing round And as if not to have her taken from him Upright beside her I beheld a giant And ever and anon they kissed each other But because she her wanton roving eye Turned upon me her angry paramour Did scourge her from her head unto her feet Then full of jealousy and fierce with wrath He loosed the monster and across the forest Dragged it so far he made of that alone A shield unto the whore and the strange beast Purgatorio Canto XXXIII Deus venerunt gentes alternating Now three now four melodious psalmody The maidens in the midst of tears began And Beatrice compassionate and sighing Listened to them with such a countenance That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross But when the other virgins place had given For her to speak uprisen to her feet With colour as of fire she made response Modicum et non videbitis me Et iterum my sisters predilect Modicum et vos videbitis me Then all the seven in front of her she placed And after her by beckoning only moved Me and the lady and the sage who stayed So she moved onward and I do not think That her tenth step was placed upon the ground When with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote And with a tranquil aspect Come more quickly To me she said that if I speak with thee To listen to me thou mayst be well placed As soon as I was with her as I should be She said to me Why brother dost thou not Venture to question now in coming with me As unto those who are too reverential Speaking in presence of superiors Who drag no living utterance to their teeth It me befell that without perfect sound Began I My necessity Madonna You know and that which thereunto is good And she to me Of fear and bashfulness Henceforward I will have thee strip thyself So that thou speak no more as one who dreams Know that the vessel which the serpent broke Was and is not but let him who is guilty Think that God s vengeance does not fear a sop Without an heir shall not for ever be The Eagle that left his plumes upon the car Whence it became a monster then a prey For verily I see and hence narrate it The stars already near to bring the time From every hindrance safe and every bar Within which a Five hundred Ten and Five One sent from God shall slay the thievish woman And that same giant who is sinning with her And peradventure my dark utterance Like Themis and the Sphinx may less persuade thee Since in their mode it clouds the intellect But soon the facts shall be the Naiades Who shall this difficult enigma solve Without destruction of the flocks and harvests Note thou and even as by me are uttered These words so teach them unto those who live That life which is a running unto death And bear in mind whene er thou writest them Not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant That twice already has been pillaged here Whoever pillages or shatters it With blasphemy of deed offendeth God Who made it holy for his use alone For biting that in pain and in desire Five thousand years and more the first born soul Craved Him who punished in himself the bite Thy genius slumbers if it deem it not For special reason so pre eminent In height and so inverted in its summit And if thy vain imaginings had not been Water of Elsa round about thy mind And Pyramus to the mulberry their pleasure Thou by so many circumstances only The justice of the interdict of God Morally in the tree wouldst recognize But since I see thee in thine intellect Converted into stone and stained with sin So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee I will too if not written at least painted Thou bear it back within thee for the reason That cinct with palm the pilgrim s staff is borne And I As by a signet is the wax Which does not change the figure stamped upon it My brain is now imprinted by yourself But wherefore so beyond my power of sight Soars your desirable discourse that aye The more I strive so much the more I lose it That thou mayst recognize she said the school Which thou hast followed and mayst see how far Its doctrine follows after my discourse And mayst behold your path from the divine Distant as far as separated is From earth the heaven that highest hastens on Whence her I answered I do not remember That ever I estranged myself from you Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me And if thou art not able to remember Smiling she answered recollect thee now That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe And if from smoke a fire may be inferred Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates Some error in thy will elsewhere intent Truly from this time forward shall my words Be naked so far as it is befitting To lay them open unto thy rude gaze And more coruscant and with slower steps The sun was holding the meridian circle Which with the point of view shifts here and there When halted as he cometh to a halt Who goes before a squadron as its escort If something new he find upon his way The ladies seven at a dark shadow s edge Such as beneath green leaves and branches black The Alp upon its frigid border wears In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain And slowly part like friends from one another O light O glory of the human race What stream is this which here unfolds itself From out one source and from itself withdraws For such a prayer twas said unto me Pray Matilda that she tell thee and here answered As one does who doth free himself from blame The beautiful lady This and other things Were told to him by me and sure I am The water of Lethe has not hid them from him And Beatrice Perhaps a greater care Which oftentimes our memory takes away Has made the vision of his mind obscure But Eunoe behold that yonder rises Lead him to it and as thou art accustomed Revive again the half dead virtue in him Like gentle soul that maketh no excuse But makes its own will of another s will As soon as by a sign it is disclosed Even so when she had taken hold of me The beautiful lady moved and unto Statius Said in her womanly manner Come with him If Reader I possessed a longer space For writing it I yet would sing in part Of the sweet draught that ne

85-121551-0090	train-other-500	furnish thee occasion Souls seeming to return unto the stars According to the sentiment of Plato These are the questions which upon thy wish Are thrusting equally and therefore first Will I treat that which hath the most of gall
85-121551-0091	train-other-500	He of the Seraphim most absorbed in God Moses and Samuel and whichever John Thou mayst select I say and even Mary Have not in any other heaven their seats Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee
85-121551-0092	train-other-500	Nor of existence more or fewer years But all make beautiful the primal circle And have sweet life in different degrees By feeling more or less the eternal breath They showed themselves here
85-121551-0093	train-other-500	not because allotted This sphere has been to them but to give sign Of the celestial which is least exalted
none	none	 To speak thus is adapted to your mind 
85-121551-0094	train-other-500	Since only through the sense it apprehendeth
none	none	 What then it worthy makes of intellect 
85-121551-0095	train-other-500	On this account
none	none	 the Scripture condescends Unto your faculties 
85-121551-0096	train-other-500	and feet and hands To God attributes and means something else And Holy Church under an aspect human Gabriel and Michael represent to you And him who made Tobias whole again That which Timaeus argues of the soul
85-121551-0097	train-other-500	Doth not resemble that which here is seen Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks He says the soul unto its star returns Believing it to have been severed thence Whenever nature gave it as a form
none	none	 Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise Than the words sound and possibly may be With meaning that is not to be derided If he doth mean that to these wheels return The honour of their influence and the blame 
85-121551-0098	train-other-500	Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth
none	none	 This principle ill understood once warped The whole world nearly till it went astray Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars 
85-121551-0099	train-other-500	The other doubt which doth disquiet thee Less venom has for its malevolence Could never lead thee otherwhere from me That as unjust our justice should appear In eyes of mortals is an argument Of faith
85-121551-0100	train-other-500	and not of sin heretical But still that your perception may be able To thoroughly penetrate this verity As thou desirest I will satisfy thee
none	none	 If it be violence when he who suffers company operates not with him who uses force These souls were not on that account excused For will is never quenched unless it will But operates as nature doth in fire If violence a thousand times distort it Hence if it yieldeth more or less it seconds The force and these have done so having power Of turning back unto the holy place 
85-121551-0101	train-other-500	If their will had been perfect like to that Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held And Mutius made severe to his own hand It would have urged them back along the road Whence they were dragged as soon as they were free
85-121551-0102	train-other-500	But such a solid will is all too rare And by these words if thou hast gathered them As thou shouldst do the argument is refuted That would have still annoyed thee many times
85-121551-0103	train-other-500	But now another passage runs across Before thine eyes and such that by thyself Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary I have for certain put into thy mind That soul beatified could never lie
85-121551-0104	train-other-500	For it is near the primal Truth And then thou from Piccarda might saint have heard Costanza kept affection for the veil So that she seemeth here to contradict me Many times brother has it come to pass That to escape from peril
85-121551-0105	train-other-500	with reluctance That has been done it was not right to do E en as Alcmaeon
none	none	 who being by his father Thereto entreated his own mother slew Not to lose pity pitiless became At this point I desire thee to remember 
85-121551-0106	train-other-500	That force with will commingles and they cause That the offences cannot be excused Will absolute consenteth not to evil But in so far consenteth as it fears If it refrain
85-121551-0107	train-other-500	to fall into more harm Hence when Piccarda uses this expression She meaneth the will absolute and I The other
none	none	 so that both of us speak truth 
85-121551-0108	train-other-500	Such was the flowing of the holy river That issued from the fount whence springs all truth This put to rest my wishes one and all O love of the first lover
85-121551-0109	train-other-500	O divine Said I forthwith whose speech inundates me And warms me so it more and more revives me My own affection is not so profound As to suffice in rendering grace for grace
none	none	 Let Him who sees and can thereto respond 
85-121551-0110	train-other-500	Well I perceive that never sated is Our intellect unless the Truth illume it Beyond which nothing true expands itself It rests therein as wild beast in his lair When it attains it
85-121551-0111	train-other-500	and it can attain it If not then each desire would frustrate be
none	none	 Therefore springs up in fashion of a shoot 
85-121551-0112	train-other-500	Doubt at the foot of truth and this is nature Which to the top from height to height impels us This doth invite me
none	none	 this assurance give me With reverence Lady to inquire of you 
85-121551-0113	train-other-500	Another truth which is obscure to me I wish to know if man can satisfy you For broken vows with other good deeds so That in your balance they will not be light
85-121551-0114	train-other-500	Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes Full of the sparks of love and so divine That overcome my power I turned my back And almost lost myself with eyes downcast Paradiso
none	none	 Canto V 
85-121551-0115	train-other-500	If in the heat of love I flame upon thee Beyond the measure that on earth is seen So that the valour of thine eyes I vanquish Marvel thou not thereat for this proceeds From perfect sight
85-121551-0116	train-other-500	which as it apprehends To the good apprehended moves its feet Well I perceive how is already shining Into thine intellect the eternal light That only seen enkindles always love
85-121551-0117	train-other-500	And if some other thing your love seduce Tis nothing but a vestige of the same Ill understood which there is shining through Thou fain wouldst know
85-121551-0118	train-other-500	if with another service For broken vow can such return be made As to secure the soul from further claim This Canto thus did Beatrice begin And as a man who breaks not off his speech
85-121551-0119	train-other-500	Continued thus her holy argument The greatest gift that in his largess God Creating made and unto his own goodness Nearest conformed and that which he doth prize Most highly is the freedom of the will
none	none	 Wherewith the creatures of intelligence Both all and only were and are endowed Now wilt thou see if thence thou reasonest The high worth of a vow if it he made So that when thou consentest God consents For closing between God and man the compact 
85-121551-0120	train-other-500	A sacrifice is of this treasure made Such as I say and made by its own act What can be rendered then as compensation Think saint thou to make good use of what thou saint offered
85-121551-0121	train-other-500	With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed Now art thou certain of the greater point But because Holy Church in this dispenses Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee
none	none	 Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table 
85-121551-0122	train-other-500	Because the solid food which thou hast taken Requireth further aid for thy digestion Open thy mind to that which I reveal And fix it there within for tis not knowledge
85-121551-0123	train-other-500	The having heard without retaining it In the essence of this sacrifice two things Convene together and the one is that Of which tis made the other is the agreement This last for evermore is cancelled not
85-121551-0124	train-other-500	Unless complied with and concerning this With such precision has above been spoken Therefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews To offer still though sometimes what was offered Might be commuted as thou ought saint to know The other
85-121551-0125	train-other-500	which is known to thee as matter May well indeed be such that one errs not
none	none	 If it for other matter be exchanged But let none shift the burden on his shoulder 
85-121551-0126	train-other-500	At his arbitrament without the turning Both of the white and of the yellow key And every permutation deem as foolish If in the substitute the thing relinquished As the four is in six be not contained
85-121551-0127	train-other-500	Therefore whatever thing has so great weight In value that it drags down every balance Cannot be satisfied with other spending Let mortals never take a vow in jest
85-121551-0128	train-other-500	Be faithful and not blind in doing that As Jephthah was in his first offering Whom more beseemed to say I have done wrong Than to do worse by keeping
85-121551-0129	train-other-500	and as foolish Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find Whence wept Iphigenia her fair face And made for her both wise and simple weep
none	none	 Who heard such kind of worship spoken of Christians 
85-121551-0130	train-other-500	be ye more serious in your movements Be ye not like a feather at each wind And think not every water washes you Ye have the Old and the New Testament And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you Let this suffice you unto your salvation
85-121551-0131	train-other-500	If evil appetite cry aught else to you Be ye as men and not as silly sheep So that the Jew among you may not mock you Be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon Its mother s milk
none	none	 and frolicsome and simple Combats at its own pleasure with itself Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it Then all desireful turned herself again To that part where the world is most alive Her silence and her change of countenance 
85-121551-0132	train-other-500	Silence imposed upon my eager mind That had already in advance new questions And as an arrow that upon the mark Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become So did we speed into the second realm
85-121551-0133	train-other-500	My Lady there so joyful I beheld As into the brightness of that heaven she entered More luminous thereat the planet grew And if the star itself was changed and smiled
85-121551-0134	train-other-500	What became I who by my nature am Exceeding mutable in every guise As in a fish pond which is pure and tranquil The fishes draw to that which from without Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it
none	none	 So I beheld more than a thousand splendours Drawing towards us and in each was heard Lo this is she who shall increase our love And as each one was coming unto us 
85-121551-0135	train-other-500	Full of beatitude the shade was seen By the effulgence clear that issued from it Think Reader if what here is just beginning No farther should proceed
none	none	 how thou wouldst have An agonizing need of knowing more And of thyself 
85-121551-0136	train-other-500	thou lieutenant see how I from these Was in desire of hearing their conditions As they unto mine eyes were manifest O thou well born unto whom Grace concedes To see the thrones of the eternal triumph
85-121551-0137	train-other-500	Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned With light that through the whole of heaven is spread Kindled are we and hence if thou desirest To know of us at thine own pleasure sate thee
none	none	 Thus by some one among those holy spirits Was spoken 
85-121551-0138	train-other-500	and by Beatrice Speak speak Securely and believe them even as Gods Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself In thine own light and drawest it from thine eyes
85-121551-0139	train-other-500	Because they coruscate when thou dost smile But know not who thou art nor why thou hast Spirit august thy station in the sphere That veils itself to men in alien rays
none	none	 This said I in direction of the light Which first had spoken to me whence it became By far more lucent than it was before 
85-121551-0140	train-other-500	Even as the sun that doth conceal himself By too much light
none	none	 when heat has worn away The tempering influence of the vapours dense By greater rapture thus concealed itself In its own radiance the figure saintly And thus close close enfolded answered me In fashion as the following Canto sings Paradiso Canto VI After that Constantine the eagle turned Against the course of heaven which it had followed Behind the ancient who Lavinia took Two hundred years and more the bird of God In the extreme of Europe held itself Near to the mountains whence it issued first And under shadow of the sacred plumes It governed there the world from hand to hand And changing thus upon mine own alighted Caesar I was and am Justinian Who by the will of primal Love I feel Took from the laws the useless and redundant And ere unto the work I was attent One nature to exist in Christ not more Believed and with such faith was I contented But blessed Agapetus he who was The supreme pastor to the faith sincere Pointed me out the way by words of his Him I believed and what was his assertion I now see clearly even as thou seest Each contradiction to be false and true As soon as with the Church I moved my feet God in his grace it pleased with this high task To inspire me and I gave me wholly to it And to my Belisarius I commended The arms to which was heaven s right hand so joined It was a signal that I should repose Now here to the first question terminates My answer but the character thereof Constrains me to continue with a sequel In order that thou see with how great reason Men move against the standard sacrosanct Both who appropriate and who oppose it Behold how great a power has made it worthy Of reverence beginning from the hour When Pallas died to give it sovereignty Thou knowest it made in Alba its abode Three hundred years and upward till at last The three to three fought for it yet again Thou knowest what it achieved from Sabine wrong Down to Lucretia s sorrow in seven kings O ercoming round about the neighboring nations Thou knowest what it achieved borne by the Romans Illustrious against Brennus against Pyrrhus Against the other princes and confederates Torquatus thence and Quinctius who from locks Unkempt was named Decii and Fabii Received the fame I willingly embalm It struck to earth the pride of the Arabians Who following Hannibal had passed across The Alpine ridges Po from which thou glidest Beneath it triumphed while they yet were young Pompey and Scipio and to the hill Beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed Then near unto the time when heaven had willed To bring the whole world to its mood serene Did Caesar by the will of Rome assume it What it achieved from Var unto the Rhine Isere beheld and Saone beheld the Seine And every valley whence the Rhone is filled What it achieved when it had left Ravenna And leaped the Rubicon was such a flight That neither tongue nor pen could follow it Round towards Spain it wheeled its legions then Towards Durazzo and Pharsalia smote That to the calid Nile was felt the pain Antandros and the Simois whence it started It saw again and there where Hector lies And ill for Ptolemy then roused itself From thence it came like lightning upon Juba Then wheeled itself again into your West Where the Pompeian clarion it heard From what it wrought with the next standard bearer Brutus and Cassius howl in Hell together And Modena and Perugia dolent were Still doth the mournful Cleopatra weep Because thereof who fleeing from before it Took from the adder sudden and black death With him it ran even to the Red Sea shore With him it placed the world in so great peace That unto Janus was his temple closed But what the standard that has made me speak Achieved before and after should achieve Throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it Becometh in appearance mean and dim If in the hand of the third Caesar seen With eye unclouded and affection pure Because the living Justice that inspires me Granted it in the hand of him I speak of The glory of doing vengeance for its wrath Now here attend to what I answer thee Later it ran with Titus to do vengeance Upon the vengeance of the ancient sin And when the tooth of Lombardy had bitten The Holy Church then underneath its wings Did Charlemagne victorious succor her Now hast thou power to judge of such as those Whom I accused above and of their crimes Which are the cause of all your miseries To the public standard one the yellow lilies Opposes the other claims it for a party So that tis hard to see which sins the most Let let the Ghibellines ply their handicraft Beneath some other standard for this ever Ill follows he who it and justice parts And let not this new Charles e er strike it down He and his Guelfs but let him fear the talons That from a nobler lion stripped the fell Already oftentimes the sons have wept The father s crime and let him not believe That God will change His scutcheon for the lilies This little planet doth adorn itself With the good spirits that have active been That fame and honour might come after them And whensoever the desires mount thither Thus deviating must perforce the rays Of the true love less vividly mount upward But in commensuration of our wages With our desert is portion of our joy Because we see them neither less nor greater Herein doth living Justice sweeten so Affection in us that for evermore It cannot warp to any iniquity Voices diverse make up sweet melodies So in this life of ours the seats diverse Render sweet harmony among these spheres And in the compass of this present pearl Shineth the sheen of Romeo of whom The grand and beauteous work was ill rewarded But the Provencals who against him wrought They have not laughed and therefore ill goes he Who makes his hurt of the good deeds of others Four daughters and each one of them a queen Had Raymond Berenger and this for him Did Romeo a poor man and a pilgrim And then malicious words incited him To summon to a reckoning this just man Who rendered to him seven and five for ten Then he departed poor and stricken in years And if the world could know the heart he had In begging bit by bit his livelihood Though much it laud him it would laud him more Paradiso Canto VII Osanna sanctus Deus Sabaoth Superillustrans claritate tua Felices ignes horum malahoth In this wise to his melody returning This substance upon which a double light Doubles itself was seen by me to sing And to their dance this and the others moved And in the manner of swift hurrying sparks Veiled themselves from me with a sudden distance Doubting was I and saying Tell her tell her Within me tell her saying tell my Lady Who slakes my thirst with her sweet effluences And yet that reverence which doth lord it over The whole of me only by B and ICE Bowed me again like unto one who drowses Short while did Beatrice endure me thus And she began lighting me with a smile Such as would make one happy in the fire According to infallible advisement After what manner a just vengeance justly Could be avenged has put thee upon thinking But I will speedily thy mind unloose And do thou listen for these words of mine Of a great doctrine will a present make thee By not enduring on the power that wills Curb for his good that man who ne er was born Damning himself damned all his progeny Whereby the human species down below Lay sick for many centuries in great error Till to descend it pleased the Word of God To where the nature which from its own Maker Estranged itself he joined to him in person By the sole act of his eternal love Now unto what is said direct thy sight This nature when united to its Maker Such as created was sincere and good But by itself alone was banished forth From Paradise because it turned aside Out of the way of truth and of its life Therefore the penalty the cross held out If measured by the nature thus assumed None ever yet with so great justice stung And none was ever of so great injustice Considering who the Person was that suffered Within whom such a nature was contracted From one act therefore issued things diverse To God and to the Jews one death was pleasing Earth trembled at it and the Heaven was opened It should no longer now seem difficult To thee when it is said that a just vengeance By a just court was afterward avenged But now do I behold thy mind entangled From thought to thought within a knot from which With great desire it waits to free itself Thou sayest Well discern I what I hear But it is hidden from me why God willed For our redemption only this one mode Buried remaineth brother this decree Unto the eyes of every one whose nature Is in the flame of love not yet adult Verily inasmuch as at this mark One gazes long and little is discerned Wherefore this mode was worthiest will I say Goodness Divine which from itself doth spurn All envy burning in itself so sparkles That the eternal beauties it unfolds Whate er from this immediately distils Has afterwards no end for ne er removed Is its impression when it sets its seal Whate er from this immediately rains down Is wholly free because it is not subject Unto the influences of novel things The more conformed thereto the more it pleases For the blest ardour that irradiates all things In that most like itself is most vivacious With all of these things has advantaged been The human creature and if one be wanting From his nobility he needs must fall Tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him And render him unlike the Good Supreme So that he little with its light is blanched And to his dignity no more returns Unless he fill up where transgression empties With righteous pains for criminal delights Your nature when it sinned so utterly In its own seed out of these dignities Even as out of Paradise was driven Nor could itself recover if thou notest With nicest subtilty by any way Except by passing one of these two fords Either that God through clemency alone Had pardon granted or that man himself Had satisfaction for his folly made Fix now thine eye deep into the abyss Of the eternal counsel to my speech As far as may be fastened steadfastly Man in his limitations had not power To satisfy not having power to sink In his humility obeying then Far as he disobeying thought to rise And for this reason man has been from power Of satisfying by himself excluded Therefore it God behoved in his own ways Man to restore unto his perfect life I say in one or else in both of them But since the action of the doer is So much more grateful as it more presents The goodness of the heart from which it issues Goodness Divine that doth imprint the world Has been contented to proceed by each And all its ways to lift you up again Nor twixt the first day and the final night Such high and such magnificent proceeding By one or by the other was or shall be For God more bounteous was himself to give To make man able to uplift himself Than if he only of himself had pardoned And all the other modes were insufficient For justice were it not the Son of God Himself had humbled to become incarnate Now to fill fully each desire of thine Return I to elucidate one place In order that thou there mayst see as I do Thou sayst I see the air I see the fire The water and the earth and all their mixtures Come to corruption and short while endure And these things notwithstanding were created Therefore if that which I have said were true They should have been secure against corruption The Angels brother and the land sincere In which thou art created may be called Just as they are in their entire existence But all the elements which thou hast named And all those things which out of them are made By a created virtue are informed Created was the matter which they have Created was the informing influence Within these stars that round about them go The soul of every brute and of the plants By its potential temperament attracts The ray and motion of the holy lights But your own life immediately inspires Supreme Beneficence and enamours it So with herself it evermore desires her And thou from this mayst argue furthermore Your resurrection if thou think again How human flesh was fashioned at that time When the first parents both of them were made Paradiso Canto VIII The world used in its peril to believe That the fair Cypria delirious love Rayed out in the third epicycle turning Wherefore not only unto her paid honour Of sacrifices and of votive cry The ancient nations in the ancient error But both Dione honoured they and Cupid That as her mother this one as her son And said that he had sat in Dido s lap And they from her whence I beginning take Took the denomination of the star That woos the sun now following now in front I was not ware of our ascending to it But of our being in it gave full faith My Lady whom I saw more beauteous grow And as within a flame a spark is seen And as within a voice a voice discerned When one is steadfast and one comes and goes Within that light beheld I other lamps Move in a circle speeding more and less Methinks in measure of their inward vision From a cold cloud descended never winds Or visible or not so rapidly They would not laggard and impeded seem To any one who had those lights divine Seen come towards us leaving the gyration Begun at first in the high Seraphim And behind those that most in front appeared Sounded Osanna so that never since To hear again was I without desire Then unto us more nearly one approached And it alone began We all are ready Unto thy pleasure that thou joy in us We turn around with the celestial Princes One gyre and one gyration and one thirst To whom thou in the world of old didst say Ye who intelligent the third heaven are moving And are so full of love to pleasure thee A little quiet will not be less sweet After these eyes of mine themselves had offered Unto my Lady reverently and she Content and certain of herself had made them Back to the light they turned which so great promise Made of itself and Say who art thou was My voice imprinted with a great affection O how and how much I beheld it grow With the new joy that superadded was Unto its joys as soon as I had spoken Thus changed it said to me The world possessed me Short time below and if it had been more Much evil will be which would not have been My gladness keepeth me concealed from thee Which rayeth round about me and doth hide me Like as a creature swathed in its own silk Much didst thou love me and thou hadst good reason For had I been below I should have shown thee Somewhat beyond the foliage of my love That left hand margin which doth bathe itself In Rhone when it is mingled with the Sorgue Me for its lord awaited in due time And that horn of Ausonia which is towned With Bari with Gaeta and Catona Whence Tronto and Verde in the sea disgorge Already flashed upon my brow the crown Of that dominion which the Danube waters After the German borders it abandons And beautiful Trinacria that is murky Twixt Pachino and Peloro on the gulf Which greatest scath from Eurus doth receive Not through Typhoeus but through nascent sulphur Would have awaited her own monarchs still Through me from Charles descended and from Rudolph If evil lordship that exasperates ever The subject populations had not moved Palermo to the outcry of Death death And if my brother could but this foresee The greedy poverty of Catalonia Straight would he flee that it might not molest him For verily tis needful to provide Through him or other so that on his bark Already freighted no more freight be placed His nature which from liberal covetous Descended such a soldiery would need As should not care for hoarding in a chest Because I do believe the lofty joy Thy speech infuses into me my Lord Where every good thing doth begin and end Thou seest as I see it the more grateful Is it to me and this too hold I dear That gazing upon God thou dost discern it Glad hast thou made me so make clear to me Since speaking thou hast stirred me up to doubt How from sweet seed can bitter issue forth This I to him and he to me If I Can show to thee a truth to what thou askest Thy face thou lieutenant hold as thou dost hold thy back The Good which all the realm thou art ascending Turns and contents maketh its providence To be a power within these bodies vast And not alone the natures are foreseen Within the mind that in itself is perfect But they together with their preservation For whatsoever thing this bow shoots forth Falls foreordained unto an end foreseen Even as a shaft directed to its mark If that were not the heaven which thou dost walk Would in such manner its effects produce That they no longer would be arts but ruins This cannot be if the Intelligences That keep these stars in motion are not maimed And maimed the First that has not made them perfect Wilt thou this truth have clearer made to thee And I Not so for tis impossible That nature tire I see in what is needful Whence he again Now say would it be worse For men on earth were they not citizens Yes I replied and here I ask no reason And can they be so if below they live not Diversely unto offices diverse No if your master writeth well for you So came he with deductions to this point Then he concluded Therefore it behoves The roots of your effects to be diverse Hence one is Solon born another Xerxes Another Melchisedec and another he Who flying through the air his son did lose Revolving Nature which a signet is To mortal wax doth practise well her art But not one inn distinguish from another Thence happens it that Esau differeth In seed from Jacob and Quirinus comes From sire so vile that he is given to Mars A generated nature its own way Would always make like its progenitors If Providence divine were not triumphant Now that which was behind thee is before thee But that thou know that I with thee am pleased With a corollary will I mantle thee Evermore nature if it fortune find Discordant to it like each other seed Out of its region maketh evil thrift And if the world below would fix its mind On the foundation which is laid by nature Pursuing that twould have the people good But you unto religion wrench aside Him who was born to gird him with the sword And make a king of him who is for sermons Therefore your footsteps wander from the road Paradiso Canto IX Beautiful Clemence after that thy Charles Had me enlightened he narrated to me The treacheries his seed should undergo But said Be still and let the years roll round So I can only say that lamentation Legitimate shall follow on your wrongs And of that holy light the life already Had to the Sun which fills it turned again As to that good which for each thing sufficeth Ah souls deceived and creatures impious Who from such good do turn away your hearts Directing upon vanity your foreheads And now behold another of those splendours Approached me and its will to pleasure me It signified by brightening outwardly The eyes of Beatrice that fastened were Upon me as before of dear assent To my desire assurance gave to me Ah bring swift compensation to my wish Thou blessed spirit I said and give me proof That what I think in thee I can reflect Whereat the light that still was new to me Out of its depths whence it before was singing As one delighted to do good continued Within that region of the land depraved Of Italy that lies between Rialto And fountain heads of Brenta and of Piava Rises a hill and mounts not very high Wherefrom descended formerly a torch That made upon that region great assault Out of one root were born both I and it Cunizza was I called and here I shine Because the splendour of this star o ercame me But gladly to myself the cause I pardon Of my allotment and it does not grieve me Which would perhaps seem strong unto your vulgar Of this so luculent and precious jewel Which of our heaven is nearest unto me Great fame remained and ere it die away This hundredth year shall yet quintupled be See if man ought to make him excellent So that another life the first may leave And thus thinks not the present multitude Shut in by Adige and Tagliamento Nor yet for being scourged is penitent But soon twill be that Padua in the marsh Will change the water that Vicenza bathes Because the folk are stubborn against duty And where the Sile and Cagnano join One lordeth it and goes with lofty head For catching whom e en now the net is making Feltro moreover of her impious pastor Shall weep the crime which shall so monstrous be That for the like none ever entered Malta Ample exceedingly would be the vat That of the Ferrarese could hold the blood And weary who should weigh it ounce by ounce Of which this courteous priest shall make a gift To show himself a partisan and such gifts Will to the living of the land conform Above us there are mirrors Thrones you call them From which shines out on us God Judicant So that this utterance seems good to us Here it was silent and it had the semblance Of being turned elsewhither by the wheel On which it entered as it was before The other joy already known to me Became a thing transplendent in my sight As a fine ruby smitten by the sun Through joy effulgence is acquired above As here a smile but down below the shade Outwardly darkens as the mind is sad God seeth all things and in Him blest spirit Thy sight is said I so that never will Of his can possibly from thee be hidden Thy voice then that for ever makes the heavens Glad with the singing of those holy fires Which of their six wings make themselves a cowl Wherefore does it not satisfy my longings Indeed I would not wait thy questioning If I in thee were as thou art in me The greatest of the valleys where the water Expands itself forthwith its words began That sea excepted which the earth engarlands Between discordant shores against the sun Extends so far that it meridian makes Where it was wont before to make the horizon I was a dweller on that valley s shore Twixt Ebro and Magra that with journey short Doth from the Tuscan part the Genoese With the same sunset and same sunrise nearly Sit Buggia and the city whence I was That with its blood once made the harbour hot Folco that people called me unto whom My name was known and now with me this heaven Imprints itself as I did once with it For more the daughter of Belus never burned Offending both Sichaeus and Creusa Than I so long as it became my locks Nor yet that Rodophean who deluded was by Demophoon nor yet Alcides When Iole he in his heart had locked Yet here is no repenting but we smile Not at the fault which comes not back to mind But at the power which ordered and foresaw Here we behold the art that doth adorn With such affection and the good discover Whereby the world above turns that below But that thou wholly satisfied mayst bear Thy wishes hence which in this sphere are born Still farther to proceed behoveth me Thou fain wouldst know who is within this light That here beside me thus is scintillating Even as a sunbeam in the limpid water Then know thou that within there is at rest Rahab and being to our order joined With her in its supremest grade tis sealed Into this heaven where ends the shadowy cone Cast by your world before all other souls First of Christ s triumph was she taken up Full meet it was to leave her in some heaven Even as a palm of the high victory Which he acquired with one palm and the other Because she favoured the first glorious deed Of Joshua upon the Holy Land That little stirs the memory of the Pope Thy city which an offshoot is of him Who first upon his Maker turned his back And whose ambition is so sorely wept Brings forth and scatters the accursed flower Which both the sheep and lambs hath led astray Since it has turned the shepherd to a wolf For this the Evangel and the mighty Doctors Are derelict and only the Decretals So studied that it shows upon their margins On this are Pope and Cardinals intent Their meditations reach not Nazareth There where his pinions Gabriel unfolded But Vatican and the other parts elect Of Rome which have a cemetery been Unto the soldiery that followed Peter Shall soon be free from this adultery Paradiso Canto X Looking into his Son with all the Love Which each of them eternally breathes forth The Primal and unutterable Power Whate er before the mind or eye revolves With so much order made there can be none Who this beholds without enjoying Him Lift up then Reader to the lofty wheels With me thy vision straight unto that part Where the one motion on the other strikes And there begin to contemplate with joy That Master s art who in himself so loves it That never doth his eye depart therefrom Behold how from that point goes branching off The oblique circle which conveys the planets To satisfy the world that calls upon them And if their pathway were not thus inflected Much virtue in the heavens would be in vain And almost every power below here dead If from the straight line distant more or less Were the departure much would wanting be Above and underneath of mundane order Remain now Reader still upon thy bench In thought pursuing that which is foretasted If thou wouldst jocund be instead of weary I ve set before thee henceforth feed thyself For to itself diverteth all my care That theme whereof I have been made the scribe The greatest of the ministers of nature Who with the power of heaven the world imprints And measures with his light the time for us With that part which above is called to mind Conjoined along the spirals was revolving Where each time earlier he presents himself And I was with him but of the ascending I was not conscious saving as a man Of a first thought is conscious ere it come And Beatrice she who is seen to pass From good to better and so suddenly That not by time her action is expressed How lucent in herself must she have been And what was in the sun wherein I entered Apparent not by colour but by light I though I call on genius art and practice Cannot so tell that it could be imagined Believe one can and let him long to see it And if our fantasies too lowly are For altitude so great it is no marvel Since o er the sun was never eye could go Such in this place was the fourth family Of the high Father who forever sates it Showing how he breathes forth and how begets And Beatrice began Give thanks give thanks Unto the Sun of Angels who to this Sensible one has raised thee by his grace Never was heart of mortal so disposed To worship nor to give itself to God With all its gratitude was it so ready As at those words did I myself become And all my love was so absorbed in Him That in oblivion Beatrice was eclipsed Nor this displeased her but she smiled at it So that the splendour of her laughing eyes My single mind on many things divided Lights many saw I vivid and triumphant Make us a centre and themselves a circle More sweet in voice than luminous in aspect Thus girt about the daughter of Latona We sometimes see when pregnant is the air So that it holds the thread which makes her zone Within the court of Heaven whence I return Are many jewels found so fair and precious They cannot be transported from the realm And of them was the singing of those lights Who takes not wings that he may fly up thither The tidings thence may from the dumb await As soon as singing thus those burning suns Had round about us whirled themselves three times Like unto stars neighbouring the steadfast poles Ladies they seemed not from the dance released But who stop short in silence listening Till they have gathered the new melody And within one I heard beginning When The radiance of grace by which is kindled True love and which thereafter grows by loving Within thee multiplied is so resplendent That it conducts thee upward by that stair Where without reascending none descends Who should deny the wine out of his vial Unto thy thirst in liberty were not Except as water which descends not seaward Fain wouldst thou know with what plants is enflowered This garland that encircles with delight The Lady fair who makes thee strong for heaven Of the lambs was I of the holy flock Which Dominic conducteth by a road Where well one fattens if he strayeth not He who is nearest to me on the right My brother and master was and he Albertus Is of Cologne I Thomas of Aquinum If thou of all the others wouldst be certain Follow behind my speaking with thy sight Upward along the blessed garland turning That next effulgence issues from the smile Of Gratian who assisted both the courts In such wise that it pleased in Paradise The other which near by adorns our choir That Peter was who e en as the poor widow Offered his treasure unto Holy Church The fifth light that among us is the fairest Breathes forth from such a love that all the world Below is greedy to learn tidings of it Within it is the lofty mind where knowledge So deep was put that if the true be true To see so much there never rose a second Thou seest next the lustre of that taper Which in the flesh below looked most within The angelic nature and its ministry Within that other little light is smiling The advocate of the Christian centuries Out of whose rhetoric Augustine was furnished Now if thou trainest thy mind s eye along From light to light pursuant of my praise With thirst already of the eighth thou waitest By seeing every good therein exults The sainted soul which the fallacious world Makes manifest to him who listeneth well The body whence twas hunted forth is lying Down in Cieldauro and from martyrdom And banishment it came unto this peace See farther onward flame the burning breath Of Isidore of Beda and of Richard Who was in contemplation more than man This whence to me returneth thy regard The light is of a spirit unto whom In his grave meditations death seemed slow It is the light eternal of Sigier Who reading lectures in the Street of Straw Did syllogize invidious verities Then as a horologe that calleth us What time the Bride of God is rising up With matins to her Spouse that he may love her Wherein one part the other draws and urges Ting ting resounding with so sweet a note That swells with love the spirit well disposed Thus I beheld the glorious wheel move round And render voice to voice in modulation And sweetness that can not be comprehended Excepting there where joy is made eternal Paradiso Canto XI O Thou insensate care of mortal men How inconclusive are the syllogisms That make thee beat thy wings in downward flight One after laws and one to aphorisms Was going and one following the priesthood And one to reign by force or sophistry And one in theft and one in state affairs One in the pleasures of the flesh involved Wearied himself one gave himself to ease When I from all these things emancipate With Beatrice above there in the Heavens With such exceeding glory was received When each one had returned unto that point Within the circle where it was before It stood as in a candlestick a candle And from within the effulgence which at first Had spoken unto me I heard begin Smiling while it more luminous became Even as I am kindled in its ray So looking into the Eternal Light The occasion of thy thoughts I apprehend Thou doubtest and wouldst have me to resift In language so extended and so open My speech that to thy sense it may be plain Where just before I said where well one fattens And where I said there never rose a second And here tis needful we distinguish well The Providence which governeth the world With counsel wherein all created vision Is vanquished ere it reach unto the bottom So that towards her own Beloved might go The bride of Him who uttering a loud cry Espoused her with his consecrated blood Self confident and unto Him more faithful Two Princes did ordain in her behoof Which on this side and that might be her guide The one was all seraphical in ardour The other by his wisdom upon earth A splendour was of light cherubical One will I speak of for of both is spoken In praising one whichever may be taken Because unto one end their labours were Between Tupino and the stream that falls Down from the hill elect of blessed Ubald A fertile slope of lofty mountain hangs From which Perugia feels the cold and heat Through Porta Sole and behind it weep Gualdo and Nocera their grievous yoke From out that slope there where it breaketh most Its steepness rose upon the world a sun As this one does sometimes from out the Ganges Therefore let him who speaketh of that place Say not Ascesi for he would say little But Orient if he properly would speak He was not yet far distant from his rising Before he had begun to make the earth Some comfort from his mighty virtue feel For he in youth his father s wrath incurred For certain Dame to whom as unto death The gate of pleasure no one doth unlock And was before his spiritual court Et coram patre unto her united Then day by day more fervently he loved her She reft of her first husband scorned obscure One thousand and one hundred years and more Waited without a suitor till he came Naught it availed to hear that with Amyclas Found her unmoved at sounding of his voice He who struck terror into all the world Naught it availed being constant and undaunted So that when Mary still remained below She mounted up with Christ upon the cross But that too darkly I may not proceed Francis and Poverty for these two lovers Take thou henceforward in my speech diffuse Their concord and their joyous semblances The love the wonder and the sweet regard They made to be the cause of holy thoughts So much so that the venerable Bernard First bared his feet and after so great peace Ran and in running thought himself too slow O wealth unknown O veritable good Giles bares his feet and bares his feet Sylvester Behind the bridegroom so doth please the bride Then goes his way that father and that master He and his Lady and that family Which now was girding on the humble cord Nor cowardice of heart weighed down his brow At being son of Peter Bernardone Nor for appearing marvellously scorned But regally his hard determination To Innocent he opened and from him Received the primal seal upon his Order After the people mendicant increased Behind this man whose admirable life Better in glory of the heavens were sung Incoronated with a second crown Was through Honorius by the Eternal Spirit The holy purpose of this Archimandrite And when he had through thirst of martyrdom In the proud presence of the Sultan preached Christ and the others who came after him And finding for conversion too unripe The folk and not to tarry there in vain Returned to fruit of the Italic grass On the rude rock twixt Tiber and the Arno From Christ did he receive the final seal Which during two whole years his members bore When He who chose him unto so much good Was pleased to draw him up to the reward That he had merited by being lowly Unto his friars as to the rightful heirs His most dear Lady did he recommend And bade that they should love her faithfully And from her bosom the illustrious soul Wished to depart returning to its realm And for its body wished no other bier Think now what man was he who was a fit Companion over the high seas to keep The bark of Peter to its proper bearings And this man was our Patriarch hence whoever Doth follow him as he commands can see That he is laden with good merchandise But for new pasturage his flock has grown So greedy that it is impossible They be not scattered over fields diverse And in proportion as his sheep remote And vagabond go farther off from him More void of milk return they to the fold Verily some there are that fear a hurt And keep close to the shepherd but so few That little cloth doth furnish forth their hoods Now if my utterance be not indistinct If thine own hearing hath attentive been If thou recall to mind what I have said In part contented shall thy wishes be For thou shalt see the plant that s chipped away And the rebuke that lieth in the words Where well one fattens if he strayeth not Paradiso Canto XII Soon as the blessed flame had taken up The final word to give it utterance Began the holy millstone to revolve And in its gyre had not turned wholly round Before another in a ring enclosed it And motion joined to motion song to song

87_121553_000113_000000	train-clean-100	The One and Two and Three who ever liveth And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One Not circumscribed and all things circumscribing

87_121553_000115_000000	train-clean-100	And in the lustre most divine of all The lesser ring I heard a modest voice Such as perhaps the Angel s was to Mary 
87_121553_000116_000000	train-clean-100	Answer As long as the festivity Of Paradise shall be so long our love Shall radiate round about us such a vesture 
87_121553_000117_000000	train-clean-100	Its brightness is proportioned to the ardour The ardour to the vision and the vision Equals what grace it has above its worth 
87_121553_000118_000000	train-clean-100	When glorious and sanctified our flesh Is reassumed then shall our persons be More pleasing by their being all complete 
87_121553_000119_000000	train-clean-100	For will increase whate er bestows on us Of light gratuitous the Good Supreme Light which enables us to look on Him 
87_121553_000120_000000	train-clean-100	Therefore the vision must perforce increase Increase the ardour which from that is kindled Increase the radiance which from this proceeds 
87_121553_000121_000000	train-clean-100	But even as a coal that sends forth flame And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it So that its own appearance it maintains 
87_121553_000122_000000	train-clean-100	Thus the effulgence that surrounds us now Shall be o erpowered in aspect by the flesh Which still to day the earth doth cover up 
none	none	Nor can so great a splendour weary us For strong will be the organs of the body To everything which hath the power to please us 
87_121553_000124_000000	train-clean-100	So sudden and alert appeared to me Both one and the other choir to say Amen That well they showed desire for their dead bodies 
none	none	Nor sole for them perhaps but for the mothers The fathers and the rest who had been dear Or ever they became eternal flames 
87_121553_000126_000000	train-clean-100	And lo all round about of equal brightness Arose a lustre over what was there Like an horizon that is clearing up 
none	none	And as at rise of early eve begin Along the welkin new appearances So that the sight seems real and unreal It seemed to me that new subsistences Began there to be seen and make a circle Outside the other two circumferences O very sparkling of the Holy Spirit How sudden and incandescent it became Unto mine eyes that vanquished bore it not 
87_121553_000130_000000	train-clean-100	But Beatrice so beautiful and smiling Appeared to me that with the other sights That followed not my memory I must leave her 
87_121553_000131_000000	train-clean-100	Then to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed The power and I beheld myself translated To higher salvation with my Lady only 
87_121553_000132_000000	train-clean-100	Well was I ware that I was more uplifted By the enkindled smiling of the star That seemed to me more ruddy than its wont 
87_121553_000133_000000	train-clean-100	With all my heart and in that dialect Which is the same in all such holocaust To God I made as the new grace beseemed 
87_121553_000134_000000	train-clean-100	And not yet from my bosom was exhausted The ardour of sacrifice before I knew This offering was accepted and auspicious 
none	none	For with so great a lustre and so red Splendours appeared to me in twofold rays I said O Helios who dost so adorn them Even as distinct with less and greater lights Glimmers between the two poles of the world The Galaxy that maketh wise men doubt 
87_121553_000137_000000	train-clean-100	Thus constellated in the depths of Mars Those rays described the venerable sign That quadrants joining in a circle make 
none	none	Here doth my memory overcome my genius For on that cross as levin gleamed forth Christ So that I cannot find ensample worthy 
87_121553_000139_000000	train-clean-100	But he who takes his cross and follows Christ Again will pardon me what I omit Seeing in that aurora lighten Christ

87_121553_000144_000000	train-clean-100	So from the lights that there to me appeared Upgathered through the cross a melody Which rapt me not distinguishing the hymn 
87_121553_000145_000000	train-clean-100	Well was I ware it was of lofty laud Because there came to me Arise and conquer As unto him who hears and comprehends not 
none	none	So much enamoured I became therewith That until then there was not anything That e er had fettered me with such sweet bonds 
87_121553_000147_000000	train-clean-100	Perhaps my word appears somewhat too bold Postponing the delight of those fair eyes Into which gazing my desire has rest 
none	none	But who bethinks him that the living seals Of every beauty grow in power ascending And that I there had not turned round to those 
87_121553_000149_000000	train-clean-100	Can me excuse if I myself accuse To excuse myself and see that I speak truly For here the holy joy is not disclosed

none	none	Paradiso Canto XV 
87_121553_000152_000000	train-clean-100	A will benign in which reveals itself Ever the love that righteously inspires As in the iniquitous cupidity 
none	none	Silence imposed upon that dulcet lyre And quieted the consecrated chords That Heaven s right hand doth tighten and relax 
87_121553_000154_000000	train-clean-100	How unto just entreaties shall be deaf Those substances which to give me desire Of praying them with one accord grew silent 
87_121553_000155_000000	train-clean-100	 Tis well that without end he should lament Who for the love of thing that doth not last Eternally despoils him of that love 
87_121553_000156_000000	train-clean-100	As through the pure and tranquil evening air There shoots from time to time a sudden fire Moving the eyes that steadfast were before 
none	none	And seems to be a star that changeth place Except that in the part where it is kindled Nothing is missed and this endureth little So from the horn that to the right extends Unto that cross s foot there ran a star Out of the constellation shining there Nor was the gem dissevered from its ribbon But down the radiant fillet ran along So that fire seemed it behind alabaster Thus piteous did Anchises shade reach forward If any faith our greatest Muse deserve When in Elysium he his son perceived O sanguis meus O superinfusa Gratia Dei sicut tibi cui Bis unquam Coeli janua reclusa 
87_121553_000162_000000	train-clean-100	Thus that effulgence whence I gave it heed Then round unto my Lady turned my sight And on this side and that was stupefied 
87_121553_000163_000000	train-clean-100	For in her eyes was burning such a smile That with mine own methought I touched the bottom Both of my grace and of my Paradise 
none	none	Then pleasant to the hearing and the sight The spirit joined to its beginning things I understood not so profound it spake 
87_121553_000165_000000	train-clean-100	Nor did it hide itself from me by choice But by necessity for its conception Above the mark of mortals set itself 
87_121553_000166_000000	train-clean-100	And when the bow of burning sympathy Was so far slackened that its speech descended Towards the mark of our intelligence 
87_121553_000167_000000	train-clean-100	The first thing that was understood by me Was Benedight be Thou O Trine and One Who hast unto my seed so courteous been

Beatrice and by the holy light That first on my account had changed its place Therefore my Lady said to me Send forth The flame of thy desire so that it issue Imprinted well with the internal stamp Not that our knowledge may be greater made By speech of thine but to accustom thee To tell thy thirst that we may give thee drink O my beloved tree that so dost lift thee That even as minds terrestrial perceive No triangle containeth two obtuse So thou beholdest the contingent things Ere in themselves they are fixing thine eyes Upon the point in which all times are present While I was with Virgilius conjoined Upon the mountain that the souls doth heal And when descending into the dead world Were spoken to me of my future life Some grievous words although I feel myself In sooth foursquare against the blows of chance On this account my wish would be content To hear what fortune is approaching me Because foreseen an arrow comes more slowly Thus did I say unto that selfsame light That unto me had spoken before and even As Beatrice willed was my own will confessed Not in vague phrase in which the foolish folk Ensnared themselves of old ere yet was slain The Lamb of God who taketh sins away But with clear words and unambiguous Language responded that paternal love Hid and revealed by its own proper smile Contingency that outside of the volume Of your materiality extends not Is all depicted in the eternal aspect Necessity however thence it takes not Except as from the eye in which tis mirrored A ship that with the current down descends From thence e en as there cometh to the ear Sweet harmony from an organ comes in sight To me the time that is preparing for thee As forth from Athens went Hippolytus By reason of his step dame false and cruel So thou from Florence must perforce depart Already this is willed and this is sought for And soon it shall be done by him who thinks it Where every day the Christ is bought and sold The blame shall follow the offended party In outcry as is usual but the vengeance Shall witness to the truth that doth dispense it Thou shalt abandon everything beloved Most tenderly and this the arrow is Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth Thou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt The bread of others and how hard a road The going down and up another s stairs And that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders Will be the bad and foolish company With which into this valley thou shalt fall For all ingrate all mad and impious Will they become against thee but soon after They and not thou shall have the forehead scarlet Of their bestiality their own proceedings Shall furnish proof so twill be well for thee A party to have made thee by thyself Thine earliest refuge and thine earliest inn Shall be the mighty Lombard s courtesy Who on the Ladder bears the holy bird Who such benign regard shall have for thee That twixt you twain in doing and in asking That shall be first which is with others last With him shalt thou see one who at his birth Has by this star of strength been so impressed That notable shall his achievements be Not yet the people are aware of him Through his young age since only nine years yet Around about him have these wheels revolved But ere the Gascon cheat the noble Henry Some sparkles of his virtue shall appear In caring not for silver nor for toil So recognized shall his magnificence Become hereafter that his enemies Will not have power to keep mute tongues about it On him rely and on his benefits By him shall many people be transformed Changing condition rich and mendicant And written in thy mind thou hence shalt bear Of him but shalt not say it and things said he Incredible to those who shall be present Then added Son these are the commentaries On what was said to thee behold the snares That are concealed behind few revolutions Yet would I not thy neighbours thou shouldst envy Because thy life into the future reaches Beyond the punishment of their perfidies When by its silence showed that sainted soul That it had finished putting in the woof Into that web which I had given it warped Began I even as he who yearneth after Being in doubt some counsel from a person Who seeth and uprightly wills and loves Well see I father mine how spurreth on The time towards me such a blow to deal me As heaviest is to him who most gives way Therefore with foresight it is well I arm me That if the dearest place be taken from me I may not lose the others by my songs Down through the world of infinite bitterness And o er the mountain from whose beauteous summit The eyes of my own Lady lifted me And afterward through heaven from light to light I have learned that which if I tell again Will be a savour of strong herbs to many And if I am a timid friend to truth I fear lest I may lose my life with those Who will hereafter call this time the olden The light in which was smiling my own treasure Which there I had discovered flashed at first As in the sunshine doth a golden mirror Then made reply A conscience overcast Or with its own or with another s shame Will taste forsooth the tartness of thy word But ne ertheless all falsehood laid aside Make manifest thy vision utterly And let them scratch wherever is the itch For if thine utterance shall offensive be At the first taste a vital nutriment Twill leave thereafter when it is digested This cry of thine shall do as doth the wind Which smiteth most the most exalted summits And that is no slight argument of honour Therefore are shown to thee within these wheels Upon the mount and in the dolorous valley Only the souls that unto fame are known Because the spirit of the hearer rests not Nor doth confirm its faith by an example Which has the root of it unknown and hidden Or other reason that is not apparent Paradiso Canto XVIII Now was alone rejoicing in its word That soul beatified and I was tasting My own the bitter tempering with the sweet And the Lady who to God was leading me Said Change thy thought consider that I am Near unto Him who every wrong disburdens Unto the loving accents of my comfort I turned me round and then what love I saw Within those holy eyes I here relinquish Not only that my language I distrust But that my mind cannot return so far Above itself unless another guide it Thus much upon that point can I repeat That her again beholding my affection From every other longing was released While the eternal pleasure which direct Rayed upon Beatrice from her fair face Contented me with its reflected aspect Conquering me with the radiance of a smile She said to me Turn thee about and listen Not in mine eyes alone is Paradise Even as sometimes here do we behold The affection in the look if it be such That all the soul is wrapt away by it So by the flaming of the effulgence holy To which I turned I recognized therein The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther And it began In this fifth resting place Upon the tree that liveth by its summit And aye bears fruit and never loses leaf Are blessed spirits that below ere yet They came to Heaven were of such great renown That every Muse therewith would affluent be Therefore look thou upon the cross s horns He whom I now shall name will there enact What doth within a cloud its own swift fire I saw athwart the Cross a splendour drawn By naming Joshua even as he did it Nor noted I the word before the deed And at the name of the great Maccabee I saw another move itself revolving And gladness was the whip unto that top Likewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando Two of them my regard attentive followed As followeth the eye its falcon flying William thereafterward and Renouard And the Duke Godfrey did attract my sight Along upon that Cross and Robert Guiscard Then moved and mingled with the other lights The soul that had addressed me showed how great An artist twas among the heavenly singers To my right side I turned myself around My duty to behold in Beatrice Either by words or gesture signified And so translucent I beheld her eyes So full of pleasure that her countenance Surpassed its other and its latest wont And as by feeling greater delectation A man in doing good from day to day Becomes aware his virtue is increasing So I became aware that my gyration With heaven together had increased its arc That miracle beholding more adorned And such as is the change in little lapse Of time in a pale woman when her face Is from the load of bashfulness unladen Such was it in mine eyes when I had turned Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star The sixth which to itself had gathered me Within that Jovial torch did I behold The sparkling of the love which was therein Delineate our language to mine eyes And even as birds uprisen from the shore As in congratulation o er their food Make squadrons of themselves now round now long So from within those lights the holy creatures Sang flying to and fro and in their figures Made of themselves now D now I now L First singing they to their own music moved Then one becoming of these characters A little while they rested and were silent O divine Pegasea thou who genius Dost glorious make and render it long lived And this through thee the cities and the kingdoms Illume me with thyself that I may bring Their figures out as I have them conceived Apparent be thy power in these brief verses Themselves then they displayed in five times seven Vowels and consonants and I observed The parts as they seemed spoken unto me Diligite justitiam these were First verb and noun of all that was depicted Qui judicatis terram were the last Thereafter in the M of the fifth word Remained they so arranged that Jupiter Seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid And other lights I saw descend where was The summit of the M and pause there singing The good I think that draws them to itself Then as in striking upon burning logs Upward there fly innumerable sparks Whence fools are wont to look for auguries More than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise And to ascend some more and others less Even as the Sun that lights them had allotted And each one being quiet in its place The head and neck beheld I of an eagle Delineated by that inlaid fire He who there paints has none to be his guide But Himself guides and is from Him remembered That virtue which is form unto the nest The other beatitude that contented seemed At first to bloom a lily on the M By a slight motion followed out the imprint O gentle star what and how many gems Did demonstrate to me that all our justice Effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest Wherefore I pray the Mind in which begin Thy motion and thy virtue to regard Whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays So that a second time it now be wroth With buying and with selling in the temple Whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms O soldiery of heaven whom I contemplate Implore for those who are upon the earth All gone astray after the bad example Once twas the custom to make war with swords But now tis made by taking here and there The bread the pitying Father shuts from none Yet thou who writest but to cancel think That Peter and that Paul who for this vineyard Which thou art spoiling died are still alive Well canst thou say So steadfast my desire Is unto him who willed to live alone And for a dance was led to martyrdom That I know not the Fisherman nor Paul Paradiso Canto XIX Appeared before me with its wings outspread The beautiful image that in sweet fruition Made jubilant the interwoven souls Appeared a little ruby each wherein Ray of the sun was burning so enkindled That each into mine eyes refracted it And what it now behoves me to retrace Nor voice has e er reported nor ink written Nor was by fantasy e er comprehended For speak I saw and likewise heard the beak And utter with its voice both I and My When in conception it was We and Our And it began Being just and merciful Am I exalted here unto that glory Which cannot be exceeded by desire And upon earth I left my memory Such that the evil minded people there Commend it but continue not the story So doth a single heat from many embers Make itself felt even as from many loves Issued a single sound from out that image Whence I thereafter O perpetual flowers Of the eternal joy that only one Make me perceive your odours manifold Exhaling break within me the great fast Which a long season has in hunger held me Not finding for it any food on earth Well do I know that if in heaven its mirror Justice Divine another realm doth make Yours apprehends it not through any veil You know how I attentively address me To listen and you know what is the doubt That is in me so very old a fast Even as a falcon issuing from his hood Doth move his head and with his wings applaud him Showing desire and making himself fine Saw I become that standard which of lauds Was interwoven of the grace divine With such songs as he knows who there rejoices Then it began He who a compass turned On the world s outer verge and who within it Devised so much occult and manifest Could not the impress of his power so make On all the universe as that his Word Should not remain in infinite excess And this makes certain that the first proud being Who was the paragon of every creature By not awaiting light fell immature And hence appears it that each minor nature Is scant receptacle unto that good Which has no end and by itself is measured In consequence our vision which perforce Must be some ray of that intelligence With which all things whatever are replete Cannot in its own nature be so potent That it shall not its origin discern Far beyond that which is apparent to it Therefore into the justice sempiternal The power of vision that your world receives As eye into the ocean penetrates Which though it see the bottom near the shore Upon the deep perceives it not and yet Tis there but it is hidden by the depth There is no light but comes from the serene That never is o ercast nay it is darkness Or shadow of the flesh or else its poison Amply to thee is opened now the cavern Which has concealed from thee the living justice Of which thou mad saint such frequent questioning For saidst thou Born a man is on the shore Of Indus and is none who there can speak Of Christ nor who can read nor who can write And all his inclinations and his actions Are good so far as human reason sees Without a sin in life or in discourse He dieth unbaptised and without faith Where is this justice that condemneth him Where is his fault if he do not believe Now who art thou that on the bench wouldst sit In judgment at a thousand miles away With the short vision of a single span Truly to him who with me subtilizes If so the Scripture were not over you For doubting there were marvellous occasion O animals terrene O stolid minds The primal will that in itself is good Ne er from itself the Good Supreme has moved So much is just as is accordant with it No good created draws it to itself But it by raying forth occasions that Even as above her nest goes circling round The stork when she has fed her little ones And he who has been fed looks up at her So lifted I my brows and even such Became the blessed image which its wings Was moving by so many counsels urged Circling around it sang and said As are My notes to thee who dost not comprehend them Such is the eternal judgment to you mortals Those lucent splendours of the Holy Spirit Grew quiet then but still within the standard That made the Romans reverend to the world It recommenced Unto this kingdom never Ascended one who had not faith in Christ Before or since he to the tree was nailed But look thou many crying are Christ Christ Who at the judgment shall be far less near To him than some shall be who knew not Christ Such Christians shall the Ethiop condemn When the two companies shall be divided The one for ever rich the other poor What to your kings may not the Persians say When they that volume opened shall behold In which are written down all their dispraises There shall be seen among the deeds of Albert That which ere long shall set the pen in motion For which the realm of Prague shall be deserted There shall be seen the woe that on the Seine He brings by falsifying of the coin Who by the blow of a wild boar shall die There shall be seen the pride that causes thirst Which makes the Scot and Englishman so mad That they within their boundaries cannot rest Be seen the luxury and effeminate life Of him of Spain and the Bohemian Who valour never knew and never wished Be seen the Cripple of Jerusalem His goodness represented by an I While the reverse an M shall represent Be seen the avarice and poltroonery Of him who guards the Island of the Fire Wherein Anchises finished his long life And to declare how pitiful he is Shall be his record in contracted letters Which shall make note of much in little space And shall appear to each one the foul deeds Of uncle and of brother who a nation So famous have dishonoured and two crowns And he of Portugal and he of Norway Shall there be known and he of Rascia too Who saw in evil hour the coin of Venice O happy Hungary if she let herself Be wronged no farther and Navarre the happy If with the hills that gird her she be armed And each one may believe that now as hansel Thereof do Nicosia and Famagosta Lament and rage because of their own beast Who from the others flank departeth not Paradiso Canto XX When he who all the world illuminates Out of our hemisphere so far descends That on all sides the daylight is consumed The heaven that erst by him alone was kindled Doth suddenly reveal itself again By many lights wherein is one resplendent And came into my mind this act of heaven When the ensign of the world and of its leaders Had silent in the blessed beak become Because those living luminaries all By far more luminous did songs begin Lapsing and falling from my memory O gentle Love that with a smile dost cloak thee How ardent in those sparks didst thou appear That had the breath alone of holy thoughts After the precious and pellucid crystals With which begemmed the sixth light I beheld Silence imposed on the angelic bells I seemed to hear the murmuring of a river That clear descendeth down from rock to rock Showing the affluence of its mountain top And as the sound upon the cithern s neck Taketh its form and as upon the vent Of rustic pipe the wind that enters it Even thus relieved from the delay of waiting That murmuring of the eagle mounted up Along its neck as if it had been hollow There it became a voice and issued thence From out its beak in such a form of words As the heart waited for wherein I wrote them The part in me which sees and bears the sun In mortal eagles it began to me Now fixedly must needs be looked upon For of the fires of which I make my figure Those whence the eye doth sparkle in my head Of all their orders the supremest are He who is shining in the midst as pupil Was once the singer of the Holy Spirit Who bore the ark from city unto city Now knoweth he the merit of his song In so far as effect of his own counsel By the reward which is commensurate Of five that make a circle for my brow He that approacheth nearest to my beak Did the poor widow for her son console Now knoweth he how dearly it doth cost Not following Christ by the experience Of this sweet life and of its opposite He who comes next in the circumference Of which I speak upon its highest arc Did death postpone by penitence sincere Now knoweth he that the eternal judgment Suffers no change albeit worthy prayer Maketh below to morrow of to day The next who follows with the laws and me Under the good intent that bore bad fruit Became a Greek by ceding to the pastor Now knoweth he how all the ill deduced From his good action is not harmful to him Although the world thereby may be destroyed And he whom in the downward arc thou seest Guglielmo was whom the same land deplores That weepeth Charles and Frederick yet alive Now knoweth he how heaven enamoured is With a just king and in the outward show Of his effulgence he reveals it still Who would believe down in the errant world That e er the Trojan Ripheus in this round Could be the fifth one of the holy lights Now knoweth he enough of what the world Has not the power to see of grace divine Although his sight may not discern the bottom Like as a lark that in the air expatiates First singing and then silent with content Of the last sweetness that doth satisfy her Such seemed to me the image of the imprint Of the eternal pleasure by whose will Doth everything become the thing it is And notwithstanding to my doubt I was As glass is to the colour that invests it To wait the time in silence it endured not But forth from out my mouth What things are these Extorted with the force of its own weight Whereat I saw great joy of coruscation Thereafterward with eye still more enkindled The blessed standard made to me reply To keep me not in wonderment suspended I see that thou believest in these things Because I say them but thou seest not how So that although believed in they are hidden Thou doest as he doth who a thing by name Well apprehendeth but its quiddity Cannot perceive unless another show it Regnum coelorum suffereth violence From fervent love and from that living hope That overcometh the Divine volition Not in the guise that man o ercometh man But conquers it because it will be conquered And conquered conquers by benignity The first life of the eyebrow and the fifth Cause thee astonishment because with them Thou seest the region of the angels painted They passed not from their bodies as thou thinkest Gentiles but Christians in the steadfast faith Of feet that were to suffer and had suffered For one from Hell where no one e er turns back Unto good will returned unto his bones And that of living hope was the reward Of living hope that placed its efficacy In prayers to God made to resuscitate him So that twere possible to move his will The glorious soul concerning which I speak Returning to the flesh where brief its stay Believed in Him who had the power to aid it And in believing kindled to such fire Of genuine love that at the second death Worthy it was to come unto this joy The other one through grace that from so deep A fountain wells that never hath the eye Of any creature reached its primal wave Set all his love below on righteousness Wherefore from grace to grace did God unclose His eye to our redemption yet to be Whence he believed therein and suffered not From that day forth the stench of paganism And he reproved therefor the folk perverse Those Maidens three whom at the right hand wheel Thou didst behold were unto him for baptism More than a thousand years before baptizing O thou predestination how remote Thy root is from the aspect of all those Who the First Cause do not behold entire And you O mortals hold yourselves restrained In judging for ourselves who look on God We do not know as yet all the elect And sweet to us is such a deprivation Because our good in this good is made perfect That whatsoe er God wills we also will After this manner by that shape divine To make clear in me my short sightedness Was given to me a pleasant medicine And as good singer a good lutanist Accompanies with vibrations of the chords Whereby more pleasantness the song acquires So while it spake do I remember me That I beheld both of those blessed lights Even as the winking of the eyes concords Moving unto the words their little flames Paradiso Canto XXI Already on my Lady s face mine eyes Again were fastened and with these my mind And from all other purpose was withdrawn And she smiled not but If I were to smile She unto me began thou wouldst become Like Semele when she was turned to ashes Because my beauty that along the stairs Of the eternal palace more enkindles As thou hast seen the farther we ascend If it were tempered not is so resplendent That all thy mortal power in its effulgence Would seem a leaflet that the thunder crushes We are uplifted to the seventh splendour That underneath the burning Lion s breast Now radiates downward mingled with his power Fix in direction of thine eyes the mind And make of them a mirror for the figure That in this mirror shall appear to thee He who could know what was the pasturage My sight had in that blessed countenance When I transferred me to another care Would recognize how grateful was to me Obedience unto my celestial escort By counterpoising one side with the other Within the crystal which around the world Revolving bears the name of its dear leader Under whom every wickedness lay dead Coloured like gold on which the sunshine gleams A stairway I beheld to such a height Uplifted that mine eye pursued it not Likewise beheld I down the steps descending So many splendours that I thought each light That in the heaven appears was there diffused And as accordant with their natural custom The rooks together at the break of day Bestir themselves to warm their feathers cold Then some of them fly off without return Others come back to where they started from And others wheeling round still keep at home Such fashion it appeared to me was there Within the sparkling that together came As soon as on a certain step it struck And that which nearest unto us remained Became so clear that in my thought I said Well I perceive the love thou showest me But she from whom I wait the how and when Of speech and silence standeth still whence I Against desire do well if I ask not She thereupon who saw my silentness In the sight of Him who seeth everything Said unto me Let loose thy warm desire And I began No merit of my own Renders me worthy of response from thee But for her sake who granteth me the asking Thou blessed life that dost remain concealed In thy beatitude make known to me The cause which draweth thee so near my side And tell me why is silent in this wheel The dulcet symphony of Paradise That through the rest below sounds so devoutly Thou hast thy hearing mortal as thy sight It answer made to me they sing not here For the same cause that Beatrice has not smiled Thus far adown the holy stairway s steps Have I descended but to give thee welcome With words and with the light that mantles me Nor did more love cause me to be more ready For love as much and more up there is burning As doth the flaming manifest to thee But the high charity that makes us servants Prompt to the counsel which controls the world Allotteth here even as thou dost observe I see full well said I O sacred lamp How love unfettered in this court sufficeth To follow the eternal Providence But this is what seems hard for me to see Wherefore predestinate wast thou alone Unto this office from among thy consorts No sooner had I come to the last word Than of its middle made the light a centre Whirling itself about like a swift millstone When answer made the love that was therein On me directed is a light divine Piercing through this in which I am embosomed Of which the virtue with my sight conjoined Lifts me above myself so far I see The supreme essence from which this is drawn Hence comes the joyfulness with which I flame For to my sight as far as it is clear The clearness of the flame I equal make But that soul in the heaven which is most pure That seraph which his eye on God most fixes Could this demand of thine not satisfy Because so deeply sinks in the abyss Of the eternal statute what thou askest From all created sight it is cut off And to the mortal world when thou returnest This carry back that it may not presume Longer tow rd such a goal to move its feet The mind that shineth here on earth doth smoke From this observe how can it do below That which it cannot though the heaven assume it Such limit did its words prescribe to me The question I relinquished and restricted Myself to ask it humbly who it was Between two shores of Italy rise cliffs And not far distant from thy native place So high the thunders far below them sound And form a ridge that Catria is called Neath which is consecrate a hermitage Wont to be dedicate to worship only Thus unto me the third speech recommenced And then continuing it said Therein Unto God s service I became so steadfast That feeding only on the juice of olives Lightly I passed away the heats and frosts Contented in my thoughts contemplative That cloister used to render to these heavens Abundantly and now is empty grown So that perforce it soon must be revealed I in that place was Peter Damiano And Peter the Sinner was I in the house Of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore Little of mortal life remained to me When I was called and dragged forth to the hat Which shifteth evermore from bad to worse Came Cephas and the mighty Vessel came Of the Holy Spirit meagre and barefooted Taking the food of any hostelry Now some one to support them on each side The modern shepherds need and some to lead them So heavy are they and to hold their trains They cover up their palfreys with their cloaks So that two beasts go underneath one skin O Patience that dost tolerate so much At this voice saw I many little flames From step to step descending and revolving And every revolution made them fairer Round about this one came they and stood still And a cry uttered of so loud a sound It here could find no parallel nor I Distinguished it the thunder so o ercame me Paradiso Canto XXII Oppressed with stupor I unto my guide Turned like a little child who always runs For refuge there where he confideth most And she even as a mother who straightway Gives comfort to her pale and breathless boy With voice whose wont it is to reassure him Said to me Knowest thou not thou art in heaven And knowest thou not that heaven is holy all And what is done here cometh from good zeal After what wise the singing would have changed thee And I by smiling thou canst now imagine Since that the cry has startled thee so much In which if thou hadst understood its prayers Already would be known to thee the vengeance Which thou shalt look upon before thou diest The sword above here smiteth not in haste Nor tardily howe er it seem to him Who fearing or desiring waits for it But turn thee round towards the others now For very illustrious spirits shalt thou see If thou thy sight directest as I say As it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned And saw a hundred spherules that together With mutual rays each other more embellished I stood as one who in himself represses The point of his desire and ventures not To question he so feareth the too much And now the largest and most luculent Among those pearls came forward that it might Make my desire concerning it content Within it then I heard If thou couldst see Even as myself the charity that burns Among us thy conceits would be expressed But that by waiting thou mayst not come late To the high end I will make answer even Unto the thought of which thou art so chary That mountain on whose slope Cassino stands Was frequented of old upon its summit By a deluded folk and ill disposed And I am he who first up thither bore The name of Him who brought upon the earth The truth that so much sublimateth us And such abundant grace upon me shone That all the neighbouring towns I drew away From the impious worship that seduced the world These other fires each one of them were men Contemplative enkindled by that heat Which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up Here is Macarius here is Romualdus Here are my brethren who within the cloisters Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart And I to him The affection which thou showest Speaking with me and the good countenance Which I behold and note in all your ardours In me have so my confidence dilated As the sun doth the rose when it becomes As far unfolded as it hath the power Therefore I pray and thou assure me father If I may so much grace receive that I May thee behold with countenance unveiled He thereupon Brother thy high desire In the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled Where are fulfilled all others and my own There perfect is and ripened and complete Every desire within that one alone Is every part where it has always been For it is not in space nor turns on poles And unto it our stairway reaches up Whence thus from out thy sight it steals away Up to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it Extending its supernal part what time So thronged with angels it appeared to him But to ascend it now no one uplifts His feet from off the earth and now my Rule Below remaineth for mere waste of paper The walls that used of old to be an Abbey Are changed to dens of robbers and the cowls Are sacks filled full of miserable flour But heavy usury is not taken up So much against God s pleasure as that fruit Which maketh so insane the heart of monks For whatsoever hath the Church in keeping Is for the folk that ask it in God s name Not for one s kindred or for something worse The flesh of mortals is so very soft That good beginnings down below suffice not From springing of the oak to bearing acorns Peter began with neither gold nor silver And I with orison and abstinence And Francis with humility his convent And if thou lookest at each one s beginning And then regardest whither he has run Thou shalt behold the white changed into brown In verity the Jordan backward turned And the sea s fleeing when God willed were more A wonder to behold than succour here Thus unto me he said and then withdrew To his own band and the band closed together Then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt The gentle Lady urged me on behind them Up o er that stairway by a single sign So did her virtue overcome my nature Nor here below where one goes up and down By natural law was motion e er so swift That it could be compared unto my wing Reader as I may unto that devout Triumph return on whose account I often For my transgressions weep and beat my breast Thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire And drawn it out again before I saw The sign that follows Taurus and was in it O glorious stars O light impregnated With mighty virtue from which I acknowledge All of my genius whatsoe er it be With you was born and hid himself with you He who is father of all mortal life When first I tasted of the Tuscan air And then when grace was freely given to me To enter the high wheel which turns you round Your region was allotted unto me To you devoutly at this hour my soul Is sighing that it virtue may acquire For the stern pass that draws it to itself Thou art so near unto the last salvation Thus Beatrice began thou oughtest now To have thine eves unclouded and acute And therefore ere thou enter farther in Look down once more and see how vast a world Thou hast already put beneath thy feet So that thy heart as jocund as it may Present itself to the triumphant throng That comes rejoicing through this rounded ether I with my sight returned through one and all The sevenfold spheres and I beheld this globe Such that I smiled at its ignoble semblance And that opinion I approve as best Which doth account it least and he who thinks Of something else may truly be called just I saw the daughter of Latona shining Without that shadow which to me was cause That once I had believed her rare and dense The aspect of thy son Hyperion Here I sustained and saw how move themselves Around and near him Maia and Dione Thence there appeared the temperateness of Jove Twixt son and father and to me was clear The change that of their whereabout they make And all the seven made manifest to me How great they are and eke how swift they are And how they are in distant habitations The threshing floor that maketh us so proud To me revolving with the eternal Twins Was all apparent made from hill to harbour Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes I turned Paradiso Canto XXIII Even as a bird mid the beloved leaves Quiet upon the nest of her sweet brood Throughout the night that hideth all things from us Who that she may behold their longed for looks And find the food wherewith to nourish them In which to her grave labours grateful are Anticipates the time on open spray And with an ardent longing waits the sun Gazing intent as soon as breaks the dawn Even thus my Lady standing was erect And vigilant turned round towards the zone Underneath which the sun displays less haste So that beholding her distraught and wistful Such I became as he is who desiring For something yearns and hoping is appeased But brief the space from one When to the other Of my awaiting say I and the seeing The welkin grow resplendent more and more And Beatrice exclaimed Behold the hosts Of Christ s triumphal march and all the fruit Harvested by the rolling of these spheres It seemed to me her face was all aflame And eyes she had so full of ecstasy That I must needs pass on without describing As when in nights serene of the full moon Smiles Trivia among the nymphs eternal Who paint the firmament through all its gulfs Saw I above the myriads of lamps A Sun that one and all of them enkindled E en as our own doth the supernal sights And through the living light transparent shone The lucent substance so intensely clear Into my sight that I sustained it not O Beatrice thou gentle guide and dear To me she said What overmasters thee A virtue is from which naught shields itself There are the wisdom and the omnipotence That oped the thoroughfares twixt heaven and earth For which there erst had been so long a yearning As fire from out a cloud unlocks itself Dilating so it finds not room therein And down against its nature falls to earth So did my mind among those aliments Becoming larger issue from itself And that which it became cannot remember Open thine eyes and look at what I am Thou hast beheld such things that strong enough Hast thou become to tolerate my smile I was as one who still retains the feeling Of a forgotten vision and endeavours In vain to bring it back into his mind When I this invitation heard deserving Of so much gratitude it never fades Out of the book that chronicles the past If at this moment sounded all the tongues That Polyhymnia and her sisters made Most lubrical with their delicious milk To aid me to a thousandth of the truth It would not reach singing the holy smile And how the holy aspect it illumed And therefore representing Paradise The sacred poem must perforce leap over Even as a man who finds his way cut off But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme And of the mortal shoulder laden with it Should blame it not if under this it tremble It is no passage for a little boat This which goes cleaving the audacious prow Nor for a pilot who would spare himself Why doth my face so much enamour thee That to the garden fair thou turnest not Which under the rays of Christ is blossoming There is the Rose in which the Word Divine Became incarnate there the lilies are By whose perfume the good way was discovered Thus Beatrice and I who to her counsels Was wholly ready once again betook me Unto the battle of the feeble brows As in the sunshine that unsullied streams Through fractured cloud ere now a meadow of flowers Mine eyes with shadow covered o er have seen So troops of splendours manifold I saw Illumined from above with burning rays Beholding not the source of the effulgence O power benignant that dost so imprint them Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope There to mine eyes that were not strong enough The name of that fair flower I e er invoke Morning and evening utterly enthralled My soul to gaze upon the greater fire And when in both mine eyes depicted were The glory and greatness of the living star Which there excelleth as it here excelled Athwart the heavens a little torch descended Formed in a circle like a coronal And cinctured it and whirled itself about it Whatever melody most sweetly soundeth On earth and to itself most draws the soul Would seem a cloud that rent asunder thunders Compared unto the sounding of that lyre Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue I am Angelic Love that circle round The joy sublime which breathes from out the womb That was the hostelry of our Desire And I shall circle Lady of Heaven while Thou followest thy Son and mak saint diviner The sphere supreme because thou enterest there Thus did the circulated melody Seal itself up and all the other lights Were making to resound the name of Mary The regal mantle of the volumes all Of that world which most fervid is and living With breath of God and with his works and ways Extended over us its inner border So very distant that the semblance of it There where I was not yet appeared to me Therefore mine eyes did not possess the power Of following the incoronated flame Which mounted upward near to its own seed And as a little child that towards its mother Stretches its arms when it the milk has taken Through impulse kindled into outward flame Each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached So with its summit that the deep affection They had for Mary was revealed to me Thereafter they remained there in my sight Regina coeli singing with such sweetness That ne er from me has the delight departed O what exuberance is garnered up Within those richest coffers which had been Good husbandmen for sowing here below There they enjoy and live upon the treasure Which was acquired while weeping in the exile Of Babylon wherein the gold was left There triumpheth beneath the exalted Son Of God and Mary in his victory Both with the ancient council and the new He who doth keep the keys of such a glory Paradiso Canto XXIV O company elect to the great supper Of the Lamb benedight who feedeth you So that for ever full is your desire If by the grace of God this man foretaste Something of that which falleth from your table Or ever death prescribe to him the time Direct your mind to his immense desire And him somewhat bedew ye drinking are For ever at the fount whence comes his thought Thus Beatrice and those souls beatified Transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles Flaming intensely in the guise of comets And as the wheels in works of horologes Revolve so that the first to the beholder Motionless seems and the last one to fly So in like manner did those carols dancing In different measure of their affluence Give me the gauge as they were swift or slow From that one which I noted of most beauty Beheld I issue forth a fire so happy That none it left there of a greater brightness And around Beatrice three several times It whirled itself with so divine a song My fantasy repeats it not to me Therefore the pen skips and I write it not Since our imagination for such folds Much more our speech is of a tint too glaring O holy sister mine who us implorest With such devotion by thine ardent love Thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere Thereafter having stopped the blessed fire Unto my Lady did direct its breath Which spake in fashion as I here have said And she O light eterne of the great man To whom our Lord delivered up the keys He carried down of this miraculous joy This one examine on points light and grave As good beseemeth thee about the Faith By means of which thou on the sea didst walk If he love well and hope well and believe From thee tis hid not for thou hast thy sight There where depicted everything is seen But since this kingdom has made citizens By means of the true Faith to glorify it Tis well he have the chance to speak thereof As baccalaureate arms himself and speaks not Until the master doth propose the question To argue it and not to terminate it So did I arm myself with every reason While she was speaking that I might be ready For such a questioner and such profession Say thou good Christian manifest thyself What is the Faith Whereat I raised my brow Unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth Then turned I round to Beatrice and she Prompt signals made to me that I should pour The water forth from my internal fountain May grace that suffers me to make confession Began I to the great centurion Cause my conceptions all to be explicit And I continued As the truthful pen Father of thy dear brother wrote of it Who put with thee Rome into the good way Faith is the substance of the things we hope for And evidence of those that are not seen And this appears to me its quiddity Then heard I Very rightly thou perceivest If well thou understandest why he placed it With substances and then with evidences And I thereafterward The things profound That here vouchsafe to me their apparition Unto all eyes below are so concealed That they exist there only in belief Upon the which is founded the high hope And hence it takes the nature of a substance And it behoveth us from this belief To reason without having other sight And hence it has the nature of evidence Then heard I If whatever is acquired Below by doctrine were thus understood No sophist s subtlety would there find place Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love Then added Very well has been gone over Already of this coin the alloy and weight But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse And I Yes both so shining and so round That in its stamp there is no peradventure Thereafter issued from the light profound That there resplendent was This precious jewel Upon the which is every virtue founded Whence hadst thou it And I The large outpouring Of Holy Spirit which has been diffused Upon the ancient parchments and the new A syllogism is which proved it to me With such acuteness that compared therewith All demonstration seems to me obtuse And then I heard The ancient and the new Postulates that to thee are so conclusive Why dost thou take them for the word divine And I The proofs which show the truth to me Are the works subsequent whereunto Nature Ne er heated iron yet nor anvil beat Twas answered me Say who assureth thee That those works ever were the thing itself That must be proved nought else to thee affirms it Were the world to Christianity converted I said withouten miracles this one Is such the rest are not its hundredth part Because that poor and fasting thou didst enter Into the field to sow there the good plant Which was a vine and has become a thorn This being finished the high holy Court Resounded through the spheres One God we praise In melody that there above is chanted And then that Baron who from branch to branch Examining had thus conducted me Till the extremest leaves we were approaching Again began The Grace that dallying Plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened Up to this point as it should opened be So that I do approve what forth emerged But now thou must express what thou believest And whence to thy belief it was presented O holy father spirit who beholdest What thou believedst so that thou o ercamest Towards the sepulchre more youthful feet Began I thou dost wish me in this place The form to manifest of my prompt belief And likewise thou the cause thereof demandest And I respond In one God I believe Sole and eterne who moveth all the heavens With love and with desire himself unmoved And of such faith not only have I proofs Physical and metaphysical but gives them Likewise the truth that from this place rains down Through Moses through the Prophets and the Psalms Through the Evangel and through you who wrote After the fiery Spirit sanctified you In Persons three eterne believe and these One essence I believe so one and trine They bear conjunction both with sunt and est With the profound condition and divine Which now I touch upon doth stamp my mind Ofttimes the doctrine evangelical This the beginning is this is the spark Which afterwards dilates to vivid flame And like a star in heaven is sparkling in me Even as a lord who hears what pleaseth him His servant straight embraces gratulating For the good news as soon as he is silent So giving me its benediction singing Three times encircled me when I was silent The apostolic light at whose command I spoken had in speaking I so pleased him Paradiso Canto XXV If e er it happen that the Poem Sacred To which both heaven and earth have set their hand So that it many a year hath made me lean O ercome the cruelty that bars me out From the fair sheepfold where a lamb I slumbered An enemy to the wolves that war upon it With other voice forthwith with other fleece Poet will I return and at my font Baptismal will I take the laurel crown Because into the Faith that maketh known All souls to God there entered I and then Peter for her sake thus my brow encircled Thereafterward towards us moved a light Out of that band whence issued the first fruits Which of his vicars Christ behind him left And then my Lady full of ecstasy Said unto me Look look behold the Baron For whom below Galicia is frequented In the same way as when a dove alights Near his companion both of them pour forth Circling about and murmuring their affection So one beheld I by the other grand Prince glorified to be with welcome greeted Lauding the food that there above is eaten But when their gratulations were complete Silently coram me each one stood still So incandescent it o ercame my sight Smiling thereafterwards said Beatrice Illustrious life by whom the benefactions Of our Basilica have been described Make Hope resound within this altitude Thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it As Jesus to the three gave greater clearness Lift up thy head and make thyself assured For what comes hither from the mortal world Must needs be ripened in our radiance This comfort came to me from the second fire Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills Which bent them down before with too great weight Since through his grace our Emperor wills that thou Shouldst find thee face to face before thy death In the most secret chamber with his Counts So that the truth beholden of this court Hope which below there rightfully enamours Thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others Say what it is and how is flowering with it Thy mind and say from whence it came to thee Thus did the second light again continue And the Compassionate who piloted The plumage of my wings in such high flight Did in reply anticipate me thus No child whatever the Church Militant Of greater hope possesses as is written In that Sun which irradiates all our band Therefore it is conceded him from Egypt To come into Jerusalem to see Or ever yet his warfare be completed The two remaining points that not for knowledge Have been demanded but that he report How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing To him I leave for hard he will not find them Nor of self praise and let him answer them And may the grace of God in this assist him As a disciple who his teacher follows Ready and willing where he is expert That his proficiency may be displayed Hope said I is the certain expectation Of future glory which is the effect Of grace divine and merit precedent From many stars this light comes unto me But he instilled it first into my heart Who was chief singer unto the chief captain Sperent in te in the high Theody He sayeth those who know thy name and who Knoweth it not if he my faith possess Thou didst instil me then with his instilling In the Epistle so that I am full And upon others rain again your rain While I was speaking in the living bosom Of that combustion quivered an effulgence Sudden and frequent in the guise of lightning Then breathed The love wherewith I am inflamed Towards the virtue still which followed me Unto the palm and issue of the field Wills that I breathe to thee that thou delight In her and grateful to me is thy telling Whatever things Hope promises to thee And I The ancient Scriptures and the new The mark establish and this shows it me Of all the souls whom God hath made his friends Isaiah saith that each one garmented In his own land shall be with twofold garments And his own land is this delightful life Thy brother too far more explicitly There where he treateth of the robes of white This revelation manifests to us And first and near the ending of these words Sperent in te from over us was heard To which responsive answered all the carols Thereafterward a light among them brightened So that if Cancer one such crystal had Winter would have a month of one sole day And as uprises goes and enters the dance A winsome maiden only to do honour To the new bride and not from any failing Even thus did I behold the brightened splendour Approach the two who in a wheel revolved As was beseeming to their ardent love Into the song and music there it entered And fixed on them my Lady kept her look Even as a bride silent and motionless This is the one who lay upon the breast Of him our Pelican and this is he To the great office from the cross elected My Lady thus but therefore none the more Did move her sight from its attentive gaze Before or afterward these words of hers Even as a man who gazes and endeavours To see the eclipsing of the sun a little And who by seeing sightless doth become So I became before that latest fire While it was said Why dost thou daze thyself To see a thing which here hath no existence Earth in the earth my body is and shall be With all the others there until our number With the eternal proposition tallies With the two garments in the blessed cloister Are the two lights alone that have ascended And this shalt thou take back into your world And at this utterance the flaming circle Grew quiet with the dulcet intermingling Of sound that by the trinal breath was made As to escape from danger or fatigue The oars that erst were in the water beaten Are all suspended at a whistle s sound Ah how much in my mind was I disturbed When I turned round to look on Beatrice That her I could not see although I was Close at her side and in the Happy World Paradiso Canto XXVI While I was doubting for my vision quenched Out of the flame refulgent that had quenched it Issued a breathing that attentive made me Saying While thou recoverest the sense Of seeing which in me thou hast consumed Tis well that speaking thou shouldst compensate it Begin then and declare to what thy soul Is aimed and count it for a certainty Sight is in thee bewildered and not dead Because the Lady who through this divine Region conducteth thee has in her look The power the hand of Ananias had I said As pleaseth her or soon or late Let the cure come to eyes that portals were When she with fire I ever burn with entered The Good that gives contentment to this Court The Alpha and Omega is of all The writing that love reads me low or loud The selfsame voice that taken had from me The terror of the sudden dazzlement To speak still farther put it in my thought And said In verity with finer sieve Behoveth thee to sift thee it behoveth To say who aimed thy bow at such a target And I By philosophic arguments And by authority that hence descends Such love must needs imprint itself in me For Good so far as good when comprehended Doth straight enkindle love and so much greater As more of goodness in itself it holds Then to that Essence whose is such advantage That every good which out of it is found Is nothing but a ray of its own light More than elsewhither must the mind be moved Of every one in loving who discerns The truth in which this evidence is founded Such truth he to my intellect reveals Who demonstrates to me the primal love Of all the sempiternal substances The voice reveals it of the truthful Author Who says to Moses speaking of Himself I will make all my goodness pass before thee Thou too revealest it to me beginning The loud Evangel that proclaims the secret Of heaven to earth above all other edict And I heard say By human intellect And by authority concordant with it Of all thy loves reserve for God the highest But say again if other cords thou feelest Draw thee towards Him that thou mayst proclaim With how many teeth this love is biting thee The holy purpose of the Eagle of Christ Not latent was nay rather I perceived Whither he fain would my profession lead Therefore I recommenced All of those bites Which have the power to turn the heart to God Unto my charity have been concurrent The being of the world and my own being The death which He endured that I may live And that which all the faithful hope as I do With the forementioned vivid consciousness Have drawn me from the sea of love perverse And of the right have placed me on the shore The leaves wherewith embowered is all the garden Of the Eternal Gardener do I love As much as he has granted them of good As soon as I had ceased a song most sweet Throughout the heaven resounded and my Lady Said with the others Holy holy holy And as at some keen light one wakes from sleep By reason of the visual spirit that runs Unto the splendour passed from coat to coat And he who wakes abhorreth what he sees So all unconscious is his sudden waking Until the judgment cometh to his aid So from before mine eyes did Beatrice Chase every mote with radiance of her own That cast its light a thousand miles and more Whence better after than before I saw And in a kind of wonderment I asked About a fourth light that I saw with us And said my Lady There within those rays Gazes upon its Maker the first soul That ever the first virtue did create Even as the bough that downward bends its top At transit of the wind and then is lifted By its own virtue which inclines it upward Likewise did I the while that she was speaking Being amazed and then I was made bold By a desire to speak wherewith I burned And I began O apple that mature Alone hast been produced O ancient father To whom each wife is daughter and daughter in law Devoutly as I can I supplicate thee That thou wouldst speak to me thou seest my wish And I to hear thee quickly speak it not Sometimes an animal when covered struggles So that his impulse needs must be apparent By reason of the wrappage following it And in like manner the primeval soul Made clear to me athwart its covering How jubilant it was to give me pleasure Then breathed Without thy uttering it to me Thine inclination better I discern Than thou whatever thing is surest to thee For I behold it in the truthful mirror That of Himself all things parhelion makes And none makes Him parhelion of itself Thou fain wouldst hear how long ago God placed me Within the lofty garden where this Lady Unto so long a stairway thee disposed And how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure And of the great disdain the proper cause And the language that I used and that I made Now son of mine the tasting of the tree Not in itself was cause of so great exile But solely the o erstepping of the bounds There whence thy Lady moved Virgilius Four thousand and three hundred and two circuits Made by the sun this Council I desired And him I saw return to all the lights Of his highway nine hundred times and thirty Whilst I upon the earth was tarrying The language that I spake was quite extinct Before that in the work interminable The people under Nimrod were employed For nevermore result of reasoning Because of human pleasure that doth change Obedient to the heavens was durable A natural action is it that man speaks But whether thus or thus doth nature leave To your own art as seemeth best to you Ere I descended to the infernal anguish El was on earth the name of the Chief Good From whom comes all the joy that wraps me round Eli he then was called and that is proper Because the use of men is like a leaf On bough which goeth and another cometh Upon the mount that highest o er the wave Rises was I in life or pure or sinful From the first hour to that which is the second As the sun changes quadrant to the sixth Paradiso Canto XXVII Glory be to the Father to the Son And Holy Ghost all Paradise began So that the melody inebriate made me What I beheld seemed unto me a smile Of the universe for my inebriation Found entrance through the hearing and the sight O joy O gladness inexpressible O perfect life of love and peacefulness O riches without hankering secure Before mine eyes were standing the four torches Enkindled and the one that first had come Began to make itself more luminous And even such in semblance it became As Jupiter would become if he and Mars Were birds and they should interchange their feathers That Providence which here distributeth Season and service in the blessed choir Had silence upon every side imposed When I heard say If I my colour change Marvel not at it for while I am speaking Thou shalt behold all these their colour change He who usurps upon the earth my place My place my place which vacant has become Before the presence of the Son of God Has of my cemetery made a sewer Of blood and stench whereby the Perverse One Who fell from here below there is appeased With the same colour which through sun adverse Painteth the clouds at evening or at morn Beheld I then the whole of heaven suffused And as a modest woman who abides Sure of herself and at another s failing From listening only timorous becomes Even thus did Beatrice change countenance And I believe in heaven was such eclipse When suffered the supreme Omnipotence Thereafterward proceeded forth his words With voice so much transmuted from itself The very countenance was not more changed The spouse of Christ has never nurtured been On blood of mine of Linus and of Cletus To be made use of in acquest of gold But in acquest of this delightful life Sixtus and Pius Urban and Calixtus After much lamentation shed their blood Our purpose was not that on the right hand Of our successors should in part be seated The Christian folk in part upon the other Nor that the keys which were to me confided Should e er become the escutcheon on a banner That should wage war on those who are baptized Nor I be made the figure of a seal To privileges venal and mendacious Whereat I often redden and flash with fire In garb of shepherds the rapacious wolves Are seen from here above o er all the pastures O wrath of God why dost thou slumber still To drink our blood the Caorsines and Gascons Are making ready O thou good beginning Unto how vile an end must thou needs fall But the high Providence that with Scipio At Rome the glory of the world defended Will speedily bring aid as I conceive And thou my son who by thy mortal weight Shalt down return again open thy mouth What I conceal not do not thou conceal As with its frozen vapours downward falls In flakes our atmosphere what time the horn Of the celestial Goat doth touch the sun Upward in such array saw I the ether Become and flaked with the triumphant vapours Which there together with us had remained My sight was following up their semblances And followed till the medium by excess The passing farther onward took from it Whereat the Lady who beheld me freed From gazing upward said to me Cast down Thy sight and see how far thou art turned round Since the first time that I had downward looked I saw that I had moved through the whole arc Which the first climate makes from midst to end So that I saw the mad track of Ulysses Past Gades and this side well nigh the shore Whereon became Europa a sweet burden And of this threshing floor the site to me Were more unveiled but the sun was proceeding Under my feet a sign and more removed My mind enamoured which is dallying At all times with my Lady to bring back To her mine eyes was more than ever ardent And if or Art or Nature has made bait To catch the eyes and so possess the mind In human flesh or in its portraiture All joined together would appear as nought To the divine delight which shone upon me When to her smiling face I turned me round The virtue that her look endowed me with From the fair nest of Leda tore me forth And up into the swiftest heaven impelled me Its parts exceeding full of life and lofty Are all so uniform I cannot say Which Beatrice selected for my place But she who was aware of my desire Began the while she smiled so joyously That God seemed in her countenance to rejoice The nature of that motion which keeps quiet The centre and all the rest about it moves From hence begins as from its starting point And in this heaven there is no other Where Than in the Mind Divine wherein is kindled The love that turns it and the power it rains Within a circle light and love embrace it Even as this doth the others and that precinct He who encircles it alone controls Its motion is not by another meted But all the others measured are by this As ten is by the half and by the fifth And in what manner time in such a pot May have its roots and in the rest its leaves Now unto thee can manifest be made O Covetousness that mortals dost ingulf Beneath thee so that no one hath the power Of drawing back his eyes from out thy waves Full fairly blossoms in mankind the will But the uninterrupted rain converts Into abortive wildings the true plums Fidelity and innocence are found Only in children afterwards they both Take flight or e er the cheeks with down are covered One while he prattles still observes the fasts Who when his tongue is loosed forthwith devours Whatever food under whatever moon Another while he prattles loves and listens Unto his mother who when speech is perfect Forthwith desires to see her in her grave Even thus is swarthy made the skin so white In its first aspect of the daughter fair Of him who brings the morn and leaves the night Thou that it may not be a marvel to thee Think that on earth there is no one who governs Whence goes astray the human family Ere January be unwintered wholly By the centesimal on earth neglected Shall these supernal circles roar so loud The tempest that has been so long awaited Shall whirl the poops about where are the prows So that the fleet shall run its course direct And the true fruit shall follow on the flower Paradiso Canto XXVIII After the truth against the present life Of miserable mortals was unfolded By her who doth imparadise my mind As in a looking glass a taper s flame He sees who from behind is lighted by it Before he has it in his sight or thought And turns him round to see if so the glass Tell him the truth and sees that it accords Therewith as doth a music with its metre In similar wise my memory recollecteth That I did looking into those fair eyes Of which Love made the springes to ensnare me And as I turned me round and mine were touched By that which is apparent in that volume Whenever on its gyre we gaze intent A point beheld I that was raying out Light so acute the sight which it enkindles Must close perforce before such great acuteness And whatsoever star seems smallest here Would seem to be a moon if placed beside it As one star with another star is placed Perhaps at such a distance as appears A halo cincturing the light that paints it When densest is the vapour that sustains it Thus distant round the point a circle of fire So swiftly whirled that it would have surpassed Whatever motion soonest girds the world And this was by another circumcinct That by a third the third then by a fourth By a fifth the fourth and then by a sixth the fifth The seventh followed thereupon in width So ample now that Juno s messenger Entire would be too narrow to contain it Even so the eighth and ninth and every one More slowly moved according as it was In number distant farther from the first And that one had its flame most crystalline From which less distant was the stainless spark I think because more with its truth imbued My Lady who in my anxiety Beheld me much perplexed said From that point Dependent is the heaven and nature all Behold that circle most conjoined to it And know thou that its motion is so swift Through burning love whereby it is spurred on And I to her If the world were arranged In the order which I see in yonder wheels What s set before me would have satisfied me But in the world of sense we can perceive That evermore the circles are diviner As they are from the centre more remote Wherefore if my desire is to be ended In this miraculous and angelic temple That has for confines only love and light To hear behoves me still how the example And the exemplar go not in one fashion Since for myself in vain I contemplate it If thine own fingers unto such a knot Be insufficient it is no great wonder So hard hath it become for want of trying My Lady thus then said she Do thou take What I shall tell thee if thou wouldst be sated And exercise on that thy subtlety The circles corporal are wide and narrow According to the more or less of virtue Which is distributed through all their parts The greater goodness works the greater weal The greater weal the greater body holds If perfect equally are all its parts Therefore this one which sweeps along with it The universe sublime doth correspond Unto the circle which most loves and knows On which account if thou unto the virtue Apply thy measure not to the appearance Of substances that unto thee seem round Thou wilt behold a marvellous agreement Of more to greater and of less to smaller In every heaven with its Intelligence Even as remaineth splendid and serene The hemisphere of air when Boreas Is blowing from that cheek where he is mildest Because is purified and resolved the rack That erst disturbed it till the welkin laughs With all the beauties of its pageantry Thus did I likewise after that my Lady Had me provided with her clear response And like a star in heaven the truth was seen And soon as to a stop her words had come Not otherwise does iron scintillate When molten than those circles scintillated Their coruscation all the sparks repeated And they so many were their number makes More millions than the doubling of the chess I heard them sing hosanna choir by choir To the fixed point which holds them at the Ubi And ever will where they have ever been And she who saw the dubious meditations Within my mind The primal circles said Have shown thee Seraphim and Cherubim Thus rapidly they follow their own bonds To be as like the point as most they can And can as far as they are high in vision Those other Loves that round about them go Thrones of the countenance divine are called Because they terminate the primal Triad And thou shouldst know that they all have delight As much as their own vision penetrates The Truth in which all intellect finds rest From this it may be seen how blessedness Is founded in the faculty which sees And not in that which loves and follows next And of this seeing merit is the measure Which is brought forth by grace and by good will Thus on from grade to grade doth it proceed The second Triad which is germinating In such wise in this sempiternal spring That no nocturnal Aries despoils Perpetually hosanna warbles forth With threefold melody that sounds in three Orders of joy with which it is intrined The three Divine are in this hierarchy First the Dominions and the Virtues next And the third order is that of the Powers Then in the dances twain penultimate The Principalities and Archangels wheel The last is wholly of angelic sports These orders upward all of them are gazing And downward so prevail that unto God They all attracted are and all attract And Dionysius with so great desire To contemplate these Orders set himself He named them and distinguished them as I do But Gregory afterwards dissented from him Wherefore as soon as he unclosed his eyes Within this heaven he at himself did smile And if so much of secret truth a mortal Proffered on earth I would not have thee marvel For he who saw it here revealed it to him With much more of the truth about these circles Paradiso Canto XXIX At what time both the children of Latona Surmounted by the Ram and by the Scales Together make a zone of the horizon As long as from the time the zenith holds them In equipoise till from that girdle both Changing their hemisphere disturb the balance So long her face depicted with a smile Did Beatrice keep silence while she gazed Fixedly at the point which had o ercome me Then she began I say and I ask not What thou dost wish to hear for I have seen it Where centres every When and every Ubi Not to acquire some good unto himself Which is impossible but that his splendour In its resplendency may say Subsisto In his eternity outside of time Outside all other limits as it pleased him Into new Loves the Eternal Love unfolded Nor as if torpid did he lie before For neither after nor before proceeded The going forth of God upon these waters Matter and Form unmingled and conjoined Came into being that had no defect E en as three arrows from a three stringed bow And as in glass in amber or in crystal A sunbeam flashes so that from its coming To its full being is no interval So from its Lord did the triform effect Ray forth into its being all together Without discrimination of beginning Order was con created and constructed In substances and summit of the world Were those wherein the pure act was produced Pure potentiality held the lowest part Midway bound potentiality with act Such bond that it shall never be unbound Jerome has written unto you of angels Created a long lapse of centuries Or ever yet the other world was made But written is this truth in many places By writers of the Holy Ghost and thou Shalt see it if thou lookest well thereat And even reason seeth it somewhat For it would not concede that for so long Could be the motors without their perfection Now dost thou know both where and when these Loves Created were and how so that extinct In thy desire already are three fires Nor could one reach in counting unto twenty So swiftly as a portion of these angels Disturbed the subject of your elements The rest remained and they began this art Which thou discernest with so great delight That never from their circling do they cease The occasion of the fall was the accursed Presumption of that One whom thou hast seen By all the burden of the world constrained Those whom thou here beholdest modest were To recognise themselves as of that goodness Which made them apt for so much understanding On which account their vision was exalted By the enlightening grace and their own merit So that they have a full and steadfast will I would not have thee doubt but certain be Tis meritorious to receive this grace According as the affection opens to it Now round about in this consistory Much mayst thou contemplate if these my words Be gathered up without all further aid But since upon the earth throughout your schools They teach that such is the angelic nature That it doth hear and recollect and will More will I say that thou mayst see unmixed The truth that is confounded there below Equivocating in such like prelections These substances since in God s countenance They jocund were turned not away their sight From that wherefrom not anything is hidden Hence they have not their vision intercepted By object new and hence they do not need To recollect through interrupted thought So that below not sleeping people dream Believing they speak truth and not believing And in the last is greater sin and shame Below you do not journey by one path Philosophising so transporteth you Love of appearance and the thought thereof And even this above here is endured With less disdain than when is set aside The Holy Writ or when it is distorted They think not there how much of blood it costs To sow it in the world and how he pleases Who in humility keeps close to it Each striveth for appearance and doth make His own inventions and these treated are By preachers and the Evangel holds its peace One sayeth that the moon did backward turn In the Passion of Christ and interpose herself So that the sunlight reached not down below And lies for of its own accord the light Hid itself whence to Spaniards and to Indians As to the Jews did such eclipse respond Florence has not so many Lapi and Bindi As fables such as these that every year Are shouted from the pulpit back and forth In such wise that the lambs who do not know Come back from pasture fed upon the wind And not to see the harm doth not excuse them Christ did not to his first disciples say Go forth and to the world preach idle tales But unto them a true foundation gave And this so loudly sounded from their lips That in the warfare to enkindle Faith They made of the Evangel shields and lances Now men go forth with jests and drolleries To preach and if but well the people laugh The hood puffs out and nothing more is asked But in the cowl there nestles such a bird That if the common people were to see it They would perceive what pardons they confide in For which so great on earth has grown the folly That without proof of any testimony To each indulgence they would flock together By this Saint Anthony his pig doth fatten And many others who are worse than pigs Paying in money without mark of coinage But since we have digressed abundantly Turn back thine eyes forthwith to the right path So that the way be shortened with the time This nature doth so multiply itself In numbers that there never yet was speech Nor mortal fancy that can go so far And if thou notest that which is revealed By Daniel thou wilt see that in his thousands Number determinate is kept concealed The primal light that all irradiates it By modes as many is received therein As are the splendours wherewith it is mated Hence inasmuch as on the act conceptive The affection followeth of love the sweetness Therein diversely fervid is or tepid The height behold now and the amplitude Of the eternal power since it hath made Itself so many mirrors where tis broken One in itself remaining as before Paradiso Canto XXX Perchance six thousand miles remote from us Is glowing the sixth hour and now this world Inclines its shadow almost to a level When the mid heaven begins to make itself So deep to us that here and there a star Ceases to shine so far down as this depth And as advances bright exceedingly The handmaid of the sun the heaven is closed Light after light to the most beautiful Not otherwise the Triumph which for ever Plays round about the point that vanquished me Seeming enclosed by what itself encloses Little by little from my vision faded Whereat to turn mine eyes on Beatrice My seeing nothing and my love constrained me If what has hitherto been said of her Were all concluded in a single praise Scant would it be to serve the present turn Not only does the beauty I beheld Transcend ourselves but truly I believe Its Maker only may enjoy it all Vanquished do I confess me by this passage More than by problem of his theme was ever O ercome the comic or the tragic poet For as the sun the sight that trembles most Even so the memory of that sweet smile My mind depriveth of its very self From the first day that I beheld her face In this life to the moment of this look The sequence of my song has ne er been severed But now perforce this sequence must desist From following her beauty with my verse As every artist at his uttermost Such as I leave her to a greater fame Than any of my trumpet which is bringing Its arduous matter to a final close With voice and gesture of a perfect leader She recommenced We from the greatest body Have issued to the heaven that is pure light Light intellectual replete with love Love of true good replete with ecstasy Ecstasy that transcendeth every sweetness Here shalt thou see the one host and the other Of Paradise and one in the same aspects Which at the final judgment thou shalt see Even as a sudden lightning that disperses The visual spirits so that it deprives The eye of impress from the strongest objects Thus round about me flashed a living light And left me swathed around with such a veil Of its effulgence that I nothing saw Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven Welcomes into itself with such salute To make the candle ready for its flame No sooner had within me these brief words An entrance found than I perceived myself To be uplifted over my own power And I with vision new rekindled me Such that no light whatever is so pure But that mine eyes were fortified against it And light I saw in fashion of a river Fulvid with its effulgence twixt two banks Depicted with an admirable Spring Out of this river issued living sparks And on all sides sank down into the flowers Like unto rubies that are set in gold And then as if inebriate with the odours They plunged again into the wondrous torrent And as one entered issued forth another The high desire that now inflames and moves thee To have intelligence of what thou seest Pleaseth me all the more the more it swells But of this water it behoves thee drink Before so great a thirst in thee be slaked Thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes And added The river and the topazes Going in and out and the laughing of the herbage Are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces Not that these things are difficult in themselves But the deficiency is on thy side For yet thou hast not vision so exalted There is no babe that leaps so suddenly With face towards the milk if he awake Much later than his usual custom is As I did that I might make better mirrors Still of mine eyes down stooping to the wave Which flows that we therein be better made And even as the penthouse of mine eyelids Drank of it it forthwith appeared to me Out of its length to be transformed to round Then as a folk who have been under masks Seem other than before if they divest The semblance not their own they disappeared in Thus into greater pomp were changed for me The flowerets and the sparks so that I saw Both of the Courts of Heaven made manifest O splendour of God by means of which I saw The lofty triumph of the realm veracious Give me the power to say how it I saw There is a light above which visible Makes the Creator unto every creature Who only in beholding Him has peace And it expands itself in circular form To such extent that its circumference Would be too large a girdle for the sun The semblance of it is all made of rays Reflected from the top of Primal Motion Which takes therefrom vitality and power And as a hill in water at its base Mirrors itself as if to see its beauty When affluent most in verdure and in flowers So ranged aloft all round about the light Mirrored I saw in more ranks than a thousand All who above there have from us returned And if the lowest row collect within it So great a light how vast the amplitude Is of this Rose in its extremest leaves My vision in the vastness and the height Lost not itself but comprehended all The quantity and quality of that gladness There near and far nor add nor take away For there where God immediately doth govern The natural law in naught is relevant Into the yellow of the Rose Eternal That spreads and multiplies and breathes an odour Of praise unto the ever vernal Sun As one who silent is and fain would speak Me Beatrice drew on and said Behold Of the white stoles how vast the convent is Behold how vast the circuit of our city Behold our seats so filled to overflowing That here henceforward are few people wanting On that great throne whereon thine eyes are fixed For the crown s sake already placed upon it Before thou suppest at this wedding feast Shall sit the soul that is to be Augustus On earth of noble Henry who shall come To redress Italy ere she be ready Blind covetousness that casts its spell upon you Has made you like unto the little child Who dies of hunger and drives off the nurse And in the sacred forum then shall be A Prefect such that openly or covert On the same road he will not walk with him But long of God he will not be endured In holy office he shall be thrust down Where Simon Magus is for his deserts And make him of Alagna lower go Paradiso Canto XXXI In fashion then as of a snow white rose Displayed itself to me the saintly host Whom Christ in his own blood had made his bride But the other host that flying sees and sings The glory of Him who doth enamour it And the goodness that created it so noble Even as a swarm of bees that sinks in flowers One moment and the next returns again To where its labour is to sweetness turned Sank into the great flower that is adorned With leaves so many and thence reascended To where its love abideth evermore Their faces had they all of living flame And wings of gold and all the rest so white No snow unto that limit doth attain From bench to bench into the flower descending They carried something of the peace and ardour Which by the fanning of their flanks they won Nor did the interposing twixt the flower And what was o er it of such plenitude Of flying shapes impede the sight and splendour Because the light divine so penetrates The universe according to its merit That naught can be an obstacle against it This realm secure and full of gladsomeness Crowded with ancient people and with modern Unto one mark had all its look and love O Trinal Light that in a single star Sparkling upon their sight so satisfies them Look down upon our tempest here below If the barbarians coming from some region That every day by Helice is covered Revolving with her son whom she delights in Beholding Rome and all her noble works Were wonder struck what time the Lateran Above all mortal things was eminent I who to the divine had from the human From time unto eternity had come From Florence to a people just and sane With what amazement must I have been filled Truly between this and the joy it was My pleasure not to hear and to be mute And as a pilgrim who delighteth him In gazing round the temple of his vow And hopes some day to retell how it was So through the living light my way pursuing Directed I mine eyes o er all the ranks Now up now down and now all round about Faces I saw of charity persuasive Embellished by His light and their own smile And attitudes adorned with every grace The general form of Paradise already My glance had comprehended as a whole In no part hitherto remaining fixed And round I turned me with rekindled wish My Lady to interrogate of things Concerning which my mind was in suspense One thing I meant another answered me I thought I should see Beatrice and saw An Old Man habited like the glorious people O erflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks With joy benign in attitude of pity As to a tender father is becoming And She where is she instantly I said Whence he To put an end to thy desire Me Beatrice hath sent from mine own place And if thou lookest up to the third round Of the first rank again shalt thou behold her Upon the throne her merits have assigned her Without reply I lifted up mine eyes And saw her as she made herself a crown Reflecting from herself the eternal rays Not from that region which the highest thunders Is any mortal eye so far removed In whatsoever sea it deepest sinks As there from Beatrice my sight but this Was nothing unto me because her image Descended not to me by medium blurred O Lady thou in whom my hope is strong And who for my salvation didst endure In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet Of whatsoever things I have beheld As coming from thy power and from thy goodness I recognise the virtue and the grace Thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom By all those ways by all the expedients Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it Preserve towards me thy magnificence So that this soul of mine which thou hast healed Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body Thus I implored and she so far away Smiled as it seemed and looked once more at me Then unto the eternal fountain turned And said the Old Man holy That thou mayst Accomplish perfectly thy journeying Whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me Fly with thine eyes all round about this garden For seeing it will discipline thy sight Farther to mount along the ray divine And she the Queen of Heaven for whom I burn Wholly with love will grant us every grace Because that I her faithful Bernard am As he who peradventure from Croatia Cometh to gaze at our Veronica Who through its ancient fame is never sated But says in thought the while it is displayed My Lord Christ Jesus God of very God Now was your semblance made like unto this Even such was I while gazing at the living Charity of the man who in this world By contemplation tasted of that peace Thou son of grace this jocund life began he Will not be known to thee by keeping ever Thine eyes below here on the lowest place But mark the circles to the most remote Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen To whom this realm is subject and devoted I lifted up mine eyes and as at morn The oriental part of the horizon Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down Thus as if going with mine eyes from vale To mount I saw a part in the remoteness Surpass in splendour all the other front And even as there where we await the pole That Phaeton drove badly blazes more The light and is on either side diminished So likewise that pacific oriflamme Gleamed brightest in the centre and each side In equal measure did the flame abate And at that centre with their wings expanded More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I Each differing in effulgence and in kind I saw there at their sports and at their songs A beauty smiling which the gladness was Within the eyes of all the other saints And if I had in speaking as much wealth As in imagining I should not dare To attempt the smallest part of its delight Bernard as soon as he beheld mine eyes Fixed and intent upon its fervid fervour His own with such affection turned to her That it made mine more ardent to behold Paradiso Canto XXXII Absorbed in his delight that contemplator Assumed the willing office of a teacher And gave beginning to these holy words The wound that Mary closed up and anointed She at her feet who is so beautiful She is the one who opened it and pierced it Within that order which the third seats make Is seated Rachel lower than the other With Beatrice in manner as thou seest Sarah Rebecca Judith and her who was Ancestress of the Singer who for dole Of the misdeed said Miserere mei Canst thou behold from seat to seat descending Down in gradation as with each one s name I through the Rose go down from leaf to leaf And downward from the seventh row even as Above the same succeed the Hebrew women Dividing all the tresses of the flower Because according to the view which Faith In Christ had taken these are the partition By which the sacred stairways are divided Upon this side where perfect is the flower With each one of its petals seated are Those who believed in Christ who was to come Upon the other side where intersected With vacant spaces are the semicircles Are those who looked to Christ already come And as upon this side the glorious seat Of the Lady of Heaven and the other seats Below it such a great division make So opposite doth that of the great John Who ever holy desert and martyrdom Endured and afterwards two years in Hell And under him thus to divide were chosen Francis and Benedict and Augustine And down to us the rest from round to round Behold now the high providence divine For one and other aspect of the Faith In equal measure shall this garden fill And know that downward from that rank which cleaves Midway the sequence of the two divisions Not by their proper merit are they seated But by another s under fixed conditions For these are spirits one and all assoiled Before they any true election had Well canst thou recognise it in their faces And also in their voices puerile If thou regard them well and hearken to them Now doubtest thou and doubting thou art silent But I will loosen for thee the strong bond In which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast Within the amplitude of this domain No casual point can possibly find place No more than sadness can or thirst or hunger For by eternal law has been established Whatever thou beholdest so that closely The ring is fitted to the finger here And therefore are these people festinate Unto true life not sine causa here More and less excellent among themselves The King by means of whom this realm reposes In so great love and in so great delight That no will ventureth to ask for more In his own joyous aspect every mind Creating at his pleasure dowers with grace Diversely and let here the effect suffice And this is clearly and expressly noted For you in Holy Scripture in those twins Who in their mother had their anger roused According to the colour of the hair Therefore with such a grace the light supreme Consenteth that they worthily be crowned Without then any merit of their deeds Stationed are they in different gradations Differing only in their first acuteness Tis true that in the early centuries With innocence to work out their salvation Sufficient was the faith of parents only After the earlier ages were completed Behoved it that the males by circumcision Unto their innocent wings should virtue add But after that the time of grace had come Without the baptism absolute of Christ Such innocence below there was retained Look now into the face that unto Christ Hath most resemblance for its brightness only Is able to prepare thee to see Christ On her did I behold so great a gladness Rain down borne onward in the holy minds Created through that altitude to fly That whatsoever I had seen before Did not suspend me in such admiration Nor show me such similitude of God And the same Love that first descended there Ave Maria gratia plena singing In front of her his wings expanded wide Unto the canticle divine responded From every part the court beatified So that each sight became serener for it O holy father who for me endurest To be below here leaving the sweet place In which thou sittest by eternal lot Who is the Angel that with so much joy Into the eyes is looking of our Queen Enamoured so that he seems made of fire Thus I again recourse had to the teaching Of that one who delighted him in Mary As doth the star of morning in the sun And he to me Such gallantry and grace As there can be in Angel and in soul All is in him and thus we fain would have it Because he is the one who bore the palm Down unto Mary when the Son of God To take our burden on himself decreed But now come onward with thine eyes as I Speaking shall go and note the great patricians Of this most just and merciful of empires Those two that sit above there most enrapture As being very near unto Augusta Are as it were the two roots of this Rose He who upon the left is near her placed The father is by whose audacious taste The human species so much bitter tastes Upon the right thou seest that ancient father Of Holy Church into whose keeping Christ The keys committed of this lovely flower And he who all the evil days beheld Before his death of her the beauteous bride Who with the spear and with the nails was won Beside him sits and by the other rests That leader under whom on manna lived The people ingrate fickle and stiff necked Opposite Peter seest thou Anna seated So well content to look upon her daughter Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna And opposite the eldest household father Lucia sits she who thy Lady moved When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows But since the moments of thy vision fly Here will we make full stop as a good tailor Who makes the gown according to his cloth And unto the first Love will turn our eyes That looking upon Him thou penetrate As far as possible through his effulgence Truly lest peradventure thou recede Moving thy wings believing to advance By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained Grace from that one who has the power to aid thee And thou shalt follow me with thy affection That from my words thy heart turn not aside And he began this holy orison Paradiso Canto XXXIII Thou Virgin Mother daughter of thy Son Humble and high beyond all other creature The limit fixed of the eternal counsel Thou art the one who such nobility To human nature gave that its Creator Did not disdain to make himself its creature Within thy womb rekindled was the love By heat of which in the eternal peace After such wise this flower has germinated Here unto us thou art a noonday torch Of charity and below there among mortals Thou art the living fountain head of hope Lady thou art so great and so prevailing That he who wishes grace nor runs to thee His aspirations without wings would fly Not only thy benignity gives succour To him who asketh it but oftentimes Forerunneth of its own accord the asking In thee compassion is in thee is pity In thee magnificence in thee unites Whate er of goodness is in any creature Now doth this man who from the lowest depth Of the universe as far as here has seen One after one the spiritual lives Supplicate thee through grace for so much power That with his eyes he may uplift himself Higher towards the uttermost salvation And I who never burned for my own seeing More than I do for his all of my prayers Proffer to thee and pray they come not short That thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud Of his mortality so with thy prayers That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed Still farther do I pray thee Queen who canst Whate er thou wilt that sound thou mayst preserve After so great a vision his affections Let thy protection conquer human movements See Beatrice and all the blessed ones My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee The eyes beloved and revered of God Fastened upon the speaker showed to us How grateful unto her are prayers devout Then unto the Eternal Light they turned On which it is not credible could be By any creature bent an eye so clear And I who to the end of all desires Was now approaching even as I ought The ardour of desire within me ended Bernard was beckoning unto me and smiling That I should upward look but I already Was of my own accord such as he wished Because my sight becoming purified Was entering more and more into the ray Of the High Light which of itself is true From that time forward what I saw was greater Than our discourse that to such vision yields And yields the memory unto such excess Even as he is who seeth in a dream And after dreaming the imprinted passion Remains and to his mind the rest returns not Even such am I for almost utterly Ceases my vision and distilleth yet Within my heart the sweetness born of it Even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost O Light Supreme that dost so far uplift thee From the conceits of mortals to my mind Of what thou didst appear re lend a little And make my tongue of so great puissance That but a single sparkle of thy glory It may bequeath unto the future people For by returning to my memory somewhat And by a little sounding in these verses More of thy victory shall be conceived I think the keenness of the living ray Which I endured would have bewildered me If but mine eyes had been averted from it And I remember that I was more bold On this account to bear so that I joined My aspect with the Glory Infinite O grace abundant by which I presumed To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal So that the seeing I consumed therein I saw that in its depth far down is lying Bound up with love together in one volume What through the universe in leaves is scattered Substance and accident and their operations All interfused together in such wise That what I speak of is one simple light The universal fashion of this knot Methinks I saw since more abundantly In saying this I feel that I rejoice One moment is more lethargy to me Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo My mind in this wise wholly in suspense Steadfast immovable attentive gazed And evermore with gazing grew enkindled In presence of that light one such becomes That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect It is impossible he e er consent Because the good which object is of will Is gathered all in this and out of it That is defective which is perfect there Shorter henceforward will my language fall Of what I yet remember than an infant s Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast Not because more than one unmingled semblance Was in the living light on which I looked For it is always what it was before But through the sight that fortified itself In me by looking one appearance only To me was ever changing as I changed Within the deep and luminous subsistence Of the High Light appeared to me three circles Of threefold colour and of one dimension And by the second seemed the first reflected As Iris is by Iris and the third Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed O how all speech is feeble and falls short Of my conceit and this to what I saw Is such tis not enough to call it little O Light Eterne sole in thyself that dwellest Sole knowest thyself and known unto thyself And knowing lovest and smilest on thyself That circulation which being thus conceived Appeared in thee as a reflected light When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes Within itself of its own very colour Seemed to me painted with our effigy Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein As the geometrician who endeavours To square the circle and discovers not By taking thought the principle he wants Even such was I at that new apparition I wished to see how the image to the circle Conformed itself and how it there finds place But my own wings were not enough for this Had it not been that then my mind there smote A flash of lightning wherein came its wish Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy But now was turning my desire and will Even as a wheel that equally is moved The Love which moves the sun and the other stars APPENDIX SIX SONNETS ON DANTE S DIVINE COMEDY BY HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW eighteen oh seven eighteen eighty two I Oft have I seen at some cathedral door A laborer pausing in the dust and heat Lay down his burden and with reverent feet Enter and cross himself and on the floor Kneel to repeat his paternoster o er Far off the noises of the world retreat The loud vociferations of the street Become an undistinguishable roar So as I enter here from day to day And leave my burden at this minster gate Kneeling in prayer and not ashamed to pray The tumult of the time disconsolate To inarticulate murmurs dies away While the eternal ages watch and wait II How strange the sculptures that adorn these towers This crowd of statues in whose folded sleeves Birds build their nests while canopied with leaves Parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers And the vast minster seems a cross of flowers But fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves Watch the dead Christ between the living thieves And underneath the traitor Judas lowers Ah from what agonies of heart and brain What exultations trampling on despair What tenderness what tears what hate of wrong What passionate outcry of a soul in pain Uprose this poem of the earth and air This mediaeval miracle of song III I enter and I see thee in the gloom Of the long aisles O poet saturnine And strive to make my steps keep pace with thine The air is filled with some unknown perfume The congregation of the dead make room For thee to pass the votive tapers shine Like rooks that haunt Ravenna s groves of pine The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb From the confessionals I hear arise Rehearsals of forgotten tragedies And lamentations from the crypts below And then a voice celestial that begins With the pathetic words Although your sins As scarlet be and ends with as the snow IV With snow white veil and garments as of flame She stands before thee who so long ago Filled thy young heart with passion and the woe From which thy song in all its splendors came And while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name The ice about thy heart melts as the snow On mountain heights and in swift overflow Comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame Thou makest full confession and a gleam As of the dawn on some dark forest cast Seems on thy lifted forehead to increase Lethe and Eunoe the remembered dream And the forgotten sorrow bring at last That perfect pardon which is perfect peace V I Lift mine eyes and all the windows blaze With forms of saints and holy men who died Here martyred and hereafter glorified And the great Rose upon its leaves displays Christ s Triumph and the angelic roundelays With splendor upon splendor multiplied And Beatrice again at Dante s side No more rebukes but smiles her words of praise And then the organ sounds and unseen choirs Sing the old Latin hymns of peace and love And benedictions of the Holy Ghost And the melodious bells among the spires O er all the house tops and through heaven above Proclaim the elevation of the Host VI O star of morning and of liberty O bringer of the light whose splendor shines Above the darkness of the Apennines Forerunner of the day that is to be The voices of the city and the sea The voices of the mountains and the pines Repeat thy song till the familiar lines Are footpaths for the thought of Italy Thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights Through all the nations and a sound is heard As of a mighty wind and men devout Strangers of Rome and the new proselytes In their own language hear thy wondrous word And many are amazed and many doubt POSTSCRIPT Ich habe unter meinen Papieren ein Blatt gefunden wo ich die Baukunst eine erstarrte Musik nenne Johann Wolfgang Goethe eighteen twenty nine March twenty three I found Dante in a bar The Poet had indeed lost the True Way to be found reduced to party chatter in a Capitol Hill basement but I had found him at last I must have been drinking in the Dark Tavern of Error for I did not even realize I had begun the dolorous path followed by many since the Poet s journey of A D thirteen hundred Actually no one spoke a word about Dante or his Divine Comedy rather I heard a second hand Goethe call architecture frozen music Soon I took my second step through the gate to a people lost this time on a more respectable occasion a lecture at the Catholic University of America Clio the muse of history must have been aiding Prof Schumacher that evening because it sustained my full three hour attention even after I had just presented an all night project There I heard of a most astonishing Italian translation of la Divina Commedia di Dante Alighieri An Italian architect Giuseppi Terragni had translated the Comedy into the Danteum a projected stone and glass monument to Poet and Poem near the Basilica of Maxentius in Rome Do not look for the Danteum in the Eternal City In true Dantean form politics stood in the way of its construction in nineteen thirty eight Ironically this literature inspired building can itself most easily be found in book form Reading this book I remembered Goethe s quote about frozen music Did Terragni try to freeze Dante s medieval miracle of song Certainly a cold poem seems artistically repulsive Unflattering comparisons to the lake of Cocytus spring to mind too While I cannot read Italian I can read some German After locating the original quotation I discovered that frozen is a problematic though common translation of Goethe s original erstarrte The verb erstarren more properly means to solidify or to stiffen This suggests a chemical reaction in which the art does not necessarily chill in the transformation Nor can simple thawing yield the original work Like a chemical reaction it requires an artistic catalyst a muse Indeed the Danteum is not a physical translation of the Poem Terragni thought it inappropriate to translate the Comedy literally into a non literary work The Danteum would not be a stage set rather Terragni generated his design from the Comedy s structure not its finishes The poem is divided into three canticles of thirty three cantos each plus one extra in the first the Inferno making a total of one hundred cantos Each canto is composed of three line tercets the first and third lines rhyme the second line rhymes with the beginning of the next tercet establishing a kind of overlap reflected in the overlapping motif of the Danteum design Dante s realms are further subdivided the Inferno is composed of nine levels the vestibule makes a tenth Purgatory has seven terraces plus two ledges in an ante purgatory adding these to the Earthly Paradise yields ten zones Paradise is composed of nine heavens Empyrean makes the tenth In the Inferno sinners are organized by three vices Incontinence Violence and Fraud and further subdivided by the seven deadly sins In Purgatory penance is ordered on the basis of three types of natural love Paradise is organized on the basis of three types of Divine Love and further subdivided according to the three theological and four cardinal virtues Thomas Schumacher The Danteum Princeton Architectural Press nineteen ninety three By translating the structure Terragni could then layer the literal and the spiritual meanings of the Poem without allowing either to dominate These layers of meaning are native to the Divine Comedy as they are native to much medieval literature although modern readers and tourists may not be so familiar with them They are literal allegorical moral and anagogical I offer you saint Thomas of Aquinas definition of these last three as they relate to Sacred Scripture this spiritual sense has a threefold division so far as the things of the Old Law signify the things of the New Law there is the allegorical sense so far as the things done in Christ or so far as the things which signify Christ are types of what we ought to do there is the moral sense But so far as they signify what relates to eternal glory there is the anagogical sense Summa Theologica I one ten Within the Danteum the Poet s meanings lurk in solid form An example the Danteum design does have spaces literally associated with the Comedy the Dark Wood of Error Inferno Purgatorio and the Paradiso but these spaces also relate among themselves spiritually Dante often highlights a virtue by first condemning its corruption Within Dante s system Justice is the greatest of the cardinal virtues its corruption Fraud is the most contemptible of vices Because Dante saw the papacy as the most precious of sacred institutions corrupt popes figure prominently among the damned in the Poet s Inferno In the Danteum the materiality of the worldly Dark Wood directly opposes the transcendence of the Paradiso In the realm of error every thought is lost and secular while in heaven every soul s intent is directed toward God The shadowy Inferno of the Danteum mirrors the Purgatorio s illuminated ascent to heaven Purgatory embodies hope and growth where hell chases its own dark inertia Such is the cosmography shared by Terragni and Dante In this postscript I intend neither to fully examine the meaning nor the plan of the Danteum but rather to evince the power that art has acted as a catalyst to other artists The Danteum a modern design inspired by a medieval poem is but one example Dante s poem is filled with characters epitomizing the full range of vices and virtues of human personalities Dante s characters come from his present and literature s past they are mythological biblical classical ancient and medieval They rather than Calliope and her sisters were Dante s muses La Divina Commedia seems a natural candidate to complete Project Gutenberg s first milleditio and to begin its second thousand e texts Although distinctly medieval its continuum of influence spans the Renaissance and modernity Terragni saw his place within the Comedy as surely as Dante saw his own We too fit within Dante s understanding of the human condition we differ less from our past than we might like to believe T S Eliot understood this when he wrote Dante and Shakespeare divide the modern world between them there is no third So now Dante joins Shakespeare e text one hundred in the Project Gutenberg collection Two works that influenced Dante are also part of the collection The Bible ten and Virgil s Aeneid two hundred twenty seven Other major influences saint Thomas of Aquinas Summa Theologica The Metamorphoses of Ovid and Aristotle s Nicomachean Ethics are available in electronic form at other Internet sites If one searches enough he may even find a computer rendering of the Danteum on the Internet By presenting this electronic text to Project Gutenberg it is my hope that in will not rest in a computer unknown and unread it is my hope that artists will see themselves in the Divine Comedy and be inspired just as Dante ran the paths left by Virgil and saint Thomas that led him to the stars Dennis McCarthy July nineteen
