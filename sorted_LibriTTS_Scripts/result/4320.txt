none	none	AN ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE PRINCIPLES OF MORALS SECTION I OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MORALS DISPUTES with men pertinaciously obstinate in their principles are of all others the most irksome except perhaps those with persons entirely disingenuous who really do not believe the opinions they defend but engage in the controversy from affectation from a spirit of opposition or from a desire of showing wit and ingenuity superior to the rest of mankind The same blind adherence to their own arguments is to be expected in both the same contempt of their antagonists and the same passionate vehemence in inforcing sophistry and falsehood And as reasoning is not the source whence either disputant derives his tenets it is in vain to expect that any logic which speaks not to the affections will ever engage him to embrace sounder principles Those who have denied the reality of moral distinctions may be ranked among the disingenuous disputants nor is it conceivable that any human creature could ever seriously believe that all characters and actions were alike entitled to the affection and regard of everyone The difference which nature has placed between one man and another is so wide and this difference is still so much farther widened by education example and habit that where the opposite extremes come at once under our apprehension there is no scepticism so scrupulous and scarce any assurance so determined as absolutely to deny all distinction between them Let a man s insensibility be ever so great he must often be touched with the images of Right and Wrong and let his prejudices be ever so obstinate he must observe that others are susceptible of like impressions The only way therefore of converting an antagonist of this kind is to leave him to himself For finding that nobody keeps up the controversy with him it is probable he will at last of himself from mere weariness come over to the side of common sense and reason There has been a controversy started of late much better worth examination concerning the general foundation of Morals whether they be derived from Reason or from Sentiment whether we attain the knowledge of them by a chain of argument and induction or by an immediate feeling and finer internal sense whether like all sound judgement of truth and falsehood they should be the same to every rational intelligent being or whether like the perception of beauty and deformity they be founded entirely on the particular fabric and constitution of the human species The ancient philosophers though they often affirm that virtue is nothing but conformity to reason yet in general seem to consider morals as deriving their existence from taste and sentiment On the other hand our modern enquirers though they also talk much of the beauty of virtue and deformity of vice yet have commonly endeavoured to account for these distinctions by metaphysical reasonings and by deductions from the most abstract principles of the understanding Such confusion reigned in these subjects that an opposition of the greatest consequence could prevail between one system and another and even in the parts of almost each individual system and yet nobody till very lately was ever sensible of it The elegant Lord Shaftesbury who first gave occasion to remark this distinction and who in general adhered to the principles of the ancients is not himself entirely free from the same confusion It must be acknowledged that both sides of the question are susceptible of specious arguments Moral distinctions it may be said are discernible by pure reason else whence the many disputes that reign in common life as well as in philosophy with regard to this subject the long chain of proofs often produced on both sides the examples cited the authorities appealed to the analogies employed the fallacies detected the inferences drawn and the several conclusions adjusted to their proper principles Truth is disputable not taste what exists in the nature of things is the standard of our judgement what each man feels within himself is the standard of sentiment Propositions in geometry may be proved systems in physics may be controverted but the harmony of verse the tenderness of passion the brilliancy of wit must give immediate pleasure No man reasons concerning another s beauty but frequently concerning the justice or injustice of his actions In every criminal trial the first object of the prisoner is to disprove the facts alleged and deny the actions imputed to him the second to prove that even if these actions were real they might be justified as innocent and lawful It is confessedly by deductions of the understanding that the first point is ascertained how can we suppose that a different faculty of the mind is employed in fixing the other On the other hand those who would resolve all moral determinations into sentiment may endeavour to show that it is impossible for reason ever to draw conclusions of this nature To virtue say they it belongs to be amiable and vice odious This forms their very nature or essence But can reason or argumentation distribute these different epithets to any subjects and pronounce beforehand that this must produce love and that hatred Or what other reason can we ever assign for these affections but the original fabric and formation of the human mind which is naturally adapted to receive them The end of all moral speculations is to teach us our duty and by proper representations of the deformity of vice and beauty of virtue beget correspondent habits and engage us to avoid the one and embrace the other But is this ever to be expected from inferences and conclusions of the understanding which of themselves have no hold of the affections or set in motion the active powers of men They discover truths but where the truths which they discover are indifferent and beget no desire or aversion they can have no influence on conduct and behaviour What is honourable what is fair what is becoming what is noble what is generous takes possession of the heart and animates us to embrace and maintain it What is intelligible what is evident what is probable what is true procures only the cool assent of the understanding and gratifying a speculative curiosity puts an end to our researches Extinguish all the warm feelings and prepossessions in favour of virtue and all disgust or aversion to vice render men totally indifferent towards these distinctions and morality is no longer a practical study nor has any tendency to regulate our lives and actions These arguments on each side and many more might be produced are so plausible that I am apt to suspect they may the one as well as the other be solid and satisfactory and that reason and sentiment concur in almost all moral determinations and conclusions The final sentence it is probable which pronounces characters and actions amiable or odious praise worthy or blameable that which stamps on them the mark of honour or infamy approbation or censure that which renders morality an active principle and constitutes virtue our happiness and vice our misery it is probable I say that this final sentence depends on some internal sense or feeling which nature has made universal in the whole species For what else can have an influence of this nature But in order to pave the way for such a sentiment and give a proper discernment of its object it is often necessary we find that much reasoning should precede that nice distinctions be made just conclusions drawn distant comparisons formed complicated relations examined and general facts fixed and ascertained Some species of beauty especially the natural kinds on their first appearance command our affection and approbation and where they fail of this effect it is impossible for any reasoning to redress their influence or adapt them better to our taste and sentiment But in many orders of beauty particularly those of the finer arts it is requisite to employ much reasoning in order to feel the proper sentiment and a false relish may frequently be corrected by argument and reflection There are just grounds to conclude that moral beauty partakes much of this latter species and demands the assistance of our intellectual faculties in order to give it a suitable influence on the human mind But though this question concerning the general principles of morals be curious and important it is needless for us at present to employ farther care in our researches concerning it For if we can be so happy in the course of this enquiry as to discover the true origin of morals it will then easily appear how far either sentiment or reason enters into all determinations of this nature Footnote See Appendix I In order to attain this purpose we shall endeavour to follow a very simple method we shall analyse that complication of mental qualities which form what in common life we call Personal Merit we shall consider every attribute of the mind which renders a man an object either of esteem and affection or of hatred and contempt every habit or sentiment or faculty which if ascribed to any person implies either praise or blame and may enter into any panegyric or satire of his character and manners The quick sensibility which on this head is so universal among mankind gives a philosopher sufficient assurance that he can never be considerably mistaken in framing the catalogue or incur any danger of misplacing the objects of his contemplation he needs only enter into his own breast for a moment and consider whether or not he should desire to have this or that quality ascribed to him and whether such or such an imputation would proceed from a friend or an enemy The very nature of language guides us almost infallibly in forming a judgement of this nature and as every tongue possesses one set of words which are taken in a good sense and another in the opposite the least acquaintance with the idiom suffices without any reasoning to direct us in collecting and arranging the estimable or blameable qualities of men The only object of reasoning is to discover the circumstances on both sides which are common to these qualities to observe that particular in which the estimable qualities agree on the one hand and the blameable on the other and thence to reach the foundation of ethics and find those universal principles from which all censure or approbation is ultimately derived As this is a question of fact not of abstract science we can only expect success by following the experimental method and deducing general maxims from a comparison of particular instances The other scientific method where a general abstract principle is first established and is afterwards branched out into a variety of inferences and conclusions may be more perfect in itself but suits less the imperfection of human nature and is a common source of illusion and mistake in this as well as in other subjects Men are now cured of their passion for hypotheses and systems in natural philosophy and will hearken to no arguments but those which are derived from experience It is full time they should attempt a like reformation in all moral disquisitions and reject every system of ethics however subtle or ingenious which is not founded on fact and observation We shall begin our enquiry on this head by the consideration of the social virtues Benevolence and Justice The explication of them will probably give us an opening by which the others may be accounted for SECTION II OF BENEVOLENCE PART I It may be esteemed perhaps a superfluous task to prove that the benevolent or softer affections are estimable and wherever they appear engage the approbation and good will of mankind The epithets SOCIABLE GOOD NATURED HUMANE MERCIFUL GRATEFUL FRIENDLY GENEROUS BENEFICENT or their equivalents are known in all languages and universally express the highest merit which HUMAN NATURE is capable of attaining Where these amiable qualities are attended with birth and power and eminent abilities and display themselves in the good government or useful instruction of mankind they seem even to raise the possessors of them above the rank of HUMAN NATURE and make them approach in some measure to the divine Exalted capacity undaunted courage prosperous success these may only expose a hero or politician to the envy and ill will of the public but as soon as the praises are added of humane and beneficent when instances are displayed of lenity tenderness or friendship envy itself is silent or joins the general voice of approbation and applause When Pericles the great Athenian statesman and general was on his death bed his surrounding friends deeming him now insensible began to indulge their sorrow for their expiring patron by enumerating his great qualities and successes his conquests and victories the unusual length of his administration and his nine trophies erected over the enemies of the republic YOU FORGET cries the dying hero who had heard all YOU FORGET THE MOST EMINENT OF MY PRAISES WHILE YOU DWELL SO MUCH ON THOSE VULGAR ADVANTAGES IN WHICH FORTUNE HAD A PRINCIPAL SHARE YOU HAVE NOT OBSERVED THAT NO CITIZEN HAS EVER YET WORNE MOURNING ON MY ACCOUNT Plut in Pericle In men of more ordinary talents and capacity the social virtues become if possible still more essentially requisite there being nothing eminent in that case to compensate for the want of them or preserve the person from our severest hatred as well as contempt A high ambition an elevated courage is apt says Cicero in less perfect characters to degenerate into a turbulent ferocity The more social and softer virtues are there chiefly to be regarded These are always good and amiable Cic de Officiis lib I The principal advantage which Juvenal discovers in the extensive capacity of the human species is that it renders our benevolence also more extensive and gives us larger opportunities of spreading our kindly influence than what are indulged to the inferior creation Sat XV one hundred thirty nine and seq It must indeed be confessed that by doing good only can a man truly enjoy the advantages of being eminent His exalted station of itself but the more exposes him to danger and tempest His sole prerogative is to afford shelter to inferiors who repose themselves under his cover and protection But I forget that it is not my present business to recommend generosity and benevolence or to paint in their true colours all the genuine charms of the social virtues These indeed sufficiently engage every heart on the first apprehension of them and it is difficult to abstain from some sally of panegyric as often as they occur in discourse or reasoning But our object here being more the speculative than the practical part of morals it will suffice to remark what will readily I believe be allowed that no qualities are more intitled to the general good will and approbation of mankind than beneficence and humanity friendship and gratitude natural affection and public spirit or whatever proceeds from a tender sympathy with others and a generous concern for our kind and species These wherever they appear seem to transfuse themselves in a manner into each beholder and to call forth in their own behalf the same favourable and affectionate sentiments which they exert on all around PART II We may observe that in displaying the praises of any humane beneficent man there is one circumstance which never fails to be amply insisted on namely the happiness and satisfaction derived to society from his intercourse and good offices To his parents we are apt to say he endears himself by his pious attachment and duteous care still more than by the connexions of nature His children never feel his authority but when employed for their advantage With him the ties of love are consolidated by beneficence and friendship The ties of friendship approach in a fond observance of each obliging office to those of love and inclination His domestics and dependants have in him a sure resource and no longer dread the power of fortune but so far as she exercises it over him From him the hungry receive food the naked clothing the ignorant and slothful skill and industry Like the sun an inferior minister of providence he cheers invigorates and sustains the surrounding world If confined to private life the sphere of his activity is narrower but his influence is all benign and gentle If exalted into a higher station mankind and posterity reap the fruit of his labours As these topics of praise never fail to be employed and with success where we would inspire esteem for any one may it not thence be concluded that the utility resulting from the social virtues forms at least a PART of their merit and is one source of that approbation and regard so universally paid to them When we recommend even an animal or a plant as USEFUL and BENEFICIAL we give it an applause and recommendation suited to its nature As on the other hand reflection on the baneful influence of any of these inferior beings always inspires us with the sentiment of aversion The eye is pleased with the prospect of corn fields and loaded vine yards horses grazing and flocks pasturing but flies the view of briars and brambles affording shelter to wolves and serpents A machine a piece of furniture a vestment a house well contrived for use and conveniency is so far beautiful and is contemplated with pleasure and approbation An experienced eye is here sensible to many excellencies which escape persons ignorant and uninstructed Can anything stronger be said in praise of a profession such as merchandize or manufacture than to observe the advantages which it procures to society and is not a monk and inquisitor enraged when we treat his order as useless or pernicious to mankind The historian exults in displaying the benefit arising from his labours The writer of romance alleviates or denies the bad consequences ascribed to his manner of composition In general what praise is implied in the simple epithet USEFUL What reproach in the contrary Your Gods says Cicero De Nat Deor lib i in opposition to the Epicureans cannot justly claim any worship or adoration with whatever imaginary perfections you may suppose them endowed They are totally useless and inactive Even the Egyptians whom you so much ridicule never consecrated any animal but on account of its utility The sceptics assert Sext Emp adrersus Math lib viii though absurdly that the origin of all religious worship was derived from the utility of inanimate objects as the sun and moon to the support and well being of mankind This is also the common reason assigned by historians for the deification of eminent heroes and legislators Diod Sic passim To plant a tree to cultivate a field to beget children meritorious acts according to the religion of Zoroaster In all determinations of morality this circumstance of public utility is ever principally in view and wherever disputes arise either in philosophy or common life concerning the bounds of duty the question cannot by any means be decided with greater certainty than by ascertaining on any side the true interests of mankind If any false opinion embraced from appearances has been found to prevail as soon as farther experience and sounder reasoning have given us juster notions of human affairs we retract our first sentiment and adjust anew the boundaries of moral good and evil Giving alms to common beggars is naturally praised because it seems to carry relief to the distressed and indigent but when we observe the encouragement thence arising to idleness and debauchery we regard that species of charity rather as a weakness than a virtue Tyrannicide or the assassination of usurpers and oppressive princes was highly extolled in ancient times because it both freed mankind from many of these monsters and seemed to keep the others in awe whom the sword or poinard could not reach But history and experience having since convinced us that this practice increases the jealousy and cruelty of princes a Timoleon and a Brutus though treated with indulgence on account of the prejudices of their times are now considered as very improper models for imitation Liberality in princes is regarded as a mark of beneficence but when it occurs that the homely bread of the honest and industrious is often thereby converted into delicious cates for the idle and the prodigal we soon retract our heedless praises The regrets of a prince for having lost a day were noble and generous but had he intended to have spent it in acts of generosity to his greedy courtiers it was better lost than misemployed after that manner Luxury or a refinement on the pleasures and conveniences of life had not long been supposed the source of every corruption in government and the immediate cause of faction sedition civil wars and the total loss of liberty It was therefore universally regarded as a vice and was an object of declamation to all satirists and severe moralists Those who prove or attempt to prove that such refinements rather tend to the increase of industry civility and arts regulate anew our MORAL as well as POLITICAL sentiments and represent as laudable or innocent what had formerly been regarded as pernicious and blameable Upon the whole then it seems undeniable THAT nothing can bestow more merit on any human creature than the sentiment of benevolence in an eminent degree and THAT a PART at least of its merit arises from its tendency to promote the interests of our species and bestow happiness on human society We carry our view into the salutary consequences of such a character and disposition and whatever has so benign an influence and forwards so desirable an end is beheld with complacency and pleasure The social virtues are never regarded without their beneficial tendencies nor viewed as barren and unfruitful The happiness of mankind the order of society the harmony of families the mutual support of friends are always considered as the result of their gentle dominion over the breasts of men How considerable a PART of their merit we ought to ascribe to their utility will better appear from future disquisitions Footnote Sect III and IV as well as the reason why this circumstance has such a command over our esteem and approbation Footnote Sect V SECTION III OF JUSTICE PART I THAT Justice is useful to society and consequently that PART of its merit at least must arise from that consideration it would be a superfluous undertaking to prove That public utility is the SOLE origin of justice and that reflections on the beneficial consequences of this virtue are the SOLE foundation of its merit this proposition being more curious and important will better deserve our examination and enquiry Let us suppose that nature has bestowed on the human race such profuse ABUNDANCE of all EXTERNAL conveniencies that without any uncertainty in the event without any care or industry on our part every individual finds himself fully provided with whatever his most voracious appetites can want or luxurious imagination wish or desire His natural beauty we shall suppose surpasses all acquired ornaments the perpetual clemency of the seasons renders useless all clothes or covering the raw herbage affords him the most delicious fare the clear fountain the richest beverage No laborious occupation required no tillage no navigation Music poetry and contemplation form his sole business conversation mirth and friendship his sole amusement It seems evident that in such a happy state every other social virtue would flourish and receive tenfold increase but the cautious jealous virtue of justice would never once have been dreamed of For what purpose make a partition of goods where every one has already more than enough Why give rise to property where there cannot possibly be any injury Why call this object MINE when upon the seizing of it by another I need but stretch out my hand to possess myself to what is equally valuable Justice in that case being totally useless would be an idle ceremonial and could never possibly have place in the catalogue of virtues We see even in the present necessitous condition of mankind that wherever any benefit is bestowed by nature in an unlimited abundance we leave it always in common among the whole human race and make no subdivisions of right and property Water and air though the most necessary of all objects are not challenged as the property of individuals nor can any man commit injustice by the most lavish use and enjoyment of these blessings In fertile extensive countries with few inhabitants land is regarded on the same footing And no topic is so much insisted on by those who defend the liberty of the seas as the unexhausted use of them in navigation Were the advantages procured by navigation as inexhaustible these reasoners had never had any adversaries to refute nor had any claims ever been advanced of a separate exclusive dominion over the ocean It may happen in some countries at some periods that there be established a property in water none in land Footnote Genesis chaps xiii and xxi if the latter be in greater abundance than can be used by the inhabitants and the former be found with difficulty and in very small quantities Again suppose that though the necessities of human race continue the same as at present yet the mind is so enlarged and so replete with friendship and generosity that every man has the utmost tenderness for every man and feels no more concern for his own interest than for that of his fellows it seems evident that the use of justice would in this case be suspended by such an extensive benevolence nor would the divisions and barriers of property and obligation have ever been thought of Why should I bind another by a deed or promise to do me any good office when I know that he is already prompted by the strongest inclination to seek my happiness and would of himself perform the desired service except the hurt he thereby receives be greater than the benefit accruing to me in which case he knows that from my innate humanity and friendship I should be the first to oppose myself to his imprudent generosity Why raise landmarks between my neighbour s field and mine when my heart has made no division between our interests but shares all his joys and sorrows with the same force and vivacity as if originally my own Every man upon this supposition being a second self to another would trust all his interests to the discretion of every man without jealousy without partition without distinction And the whole human race would form only one family where all would lie in common and be used freely without regard to property but cautiously too with as entire regard to the necessities of each individual as if our own interests were most intimately concerned In the present disposition of the human heart it would perhaps be difficult to find complete instances of such enlarged affections but still we may observe that the case of families approaches towards it and the stronger the mutual benevolence is among the individuals the nearer it approaches till all distinction of property be in a great measure lost and confounded among them Between married persons the cement of friendship is by the laws supposed so strong as to abolish all division of possessions and has often in reality the force ascribed to it And it is observable that during the ardour of new enthusiasms when every principle is inflamed into extravagance the community of goods has frequently been attempted and nothing but experience of its inconveniencies from the returning or disguised selfishness of men could make the imprudent fanatics adopt anew the ideas of justice and of separate property So true is it that this virtue derives its existence entirely from its necessary USE to the intercourse and social state of mankind To make this truth more evident let us reverse the foregoing suppositions and carrying everything to the opposite extreme consider what would be the effect of these new situations Suppose a society to fall into such want of all common necessaries that the utmost frugality and industry cannot preserve the greater number from perishing and the whole from extreme misery it will readily I believe be admitted that the strict laws of justice are suspended in such a pressing emergence and give place to the stronger motives of necessity and self preservation Is it any crime after a shipwreck to seize whatever means or instrument of safety one can lay hold of without regard to former limitations of property Or if a city besieged were perishing with hunger can we imagine that men will see any means of preservation before them and lose their lives from a scrupulous regard to what in other situations would be the rules of equity and justice The use and tendency of that virtue is to procure happiness and security by preserving order in society but where the society is ready to perish from extreme necessity no greater evil can be dreaded from violence and injustice and every man may now provide for himself by all the means which prudence can dictate or humanity permit The public even in less urgent necessities opens granaries without the consent of proprietors as justly supposing that the authority of magistracy may consistent with equity extend so far but were any number of men to assemble without the tie of laws or civil jurisdiction would an equal partition of bread in a famine though effected by power and even violence be regarded as criminal or injurious Suppose likewise that it should be a virtuous man s fate to fall into the society of ruffians remote from the protection of laws and government what conduct must he embrace in that melancholy situation He sees such a desperate rapaciousness prevail such a disregard to equity such contempt of order such stupid blindness to future consequences as must immediately have the most tragical conclusion and must terminate in destruction to the greater number and in a total dissolution of society to the rest He meanwhile can have no other expedient than to arm himself to whomever the sword he seizes or the buckler may belong To make provision of all means of defence and security And his particular regard to justice being no longer of use to his own safety or that of others he must consult the dictates of self preservation alone without concern for those who no longer merit his care and attention When any man even in political society renders himself by his crimes obnoxious to the public he is punished by the laws in his goods and person that is the ordinary rules of justice are with regard to him suspended for a moment and it becomes equitable to inflict on him for the BENEFIT of society what otherwise he could not suffer without wrong or injury The rage and violence of public war what is it but a suspension of justice among the warring parties who perceive that this virtue is now no longer of any USE or advantage to them The laws of war which then succeed to those of equity and justice are rules calculated for the ADVANTAGE and UTILITY of that particular state in which men are now placed And were a civilized nation engaged with barbarians who observed no rules even of war the former must also suspend their observance of them where they no longer serve to any purpose and must render every action or recounter as bloody and pernicious as possible to the first aggressors Thus the rules of equity or justice depend entirely on the particular state and condition in which men are placed and owe their origin and existence to that utility which results to the public from their strict and regular observance Reverse in any considerable circumstance the condition of men Produce extreme abundance or extreme necessity Implant in the human breast perfect moderation and humanity or perfect rapaciousness and malice By rendering justice totally USELESS you thereby totally destroy its essence and suspend its obligation upon mankind The common situation of society is a medium amidst all these extremes We are naturally partial to ourselves and to our friends but are capable of learning the advantage resulting from a more equitable conduct Few enjoyments are given us from the open and liberal hand of nature but by art labour and industry we can extract them in great abundance Hence the ideas of property become necessary in all civil society Hence justice derives its usefulness to the public And hence alone arises its merit and moral obligation These conclusions are so natural and obvious that they have not escaped even the poets in their descriptions of the felicity attending the golden age or the reign of Saturn The seasons in that first period of nature were so temperate if we credit these agreeable fictions that there was no necessity for men to provide themselves with clothes and houses as a security against the violence of heat and cold The rivers flowed with wine and milk The oaks yielded honey and nature spontaneously produced her greatest delicacies Nor were these the chief advantages of that happy age Tempests were not alone removed from nature but those more furious tempests were unknown to human breasts which now cause such uproar and engender such confusion Avarice ambition cruelty selfishness were never heard of Cordial affection compassion sympathy were the only movements with which the mind was yet acquainted Even the punctilious distinction of MINE and THINE was banished from among the happy race of mortals and carried with it the very notion of property and obligation justice and injustice This POETICAL fiction of the GOLDEN AGE is in some respects of a piece with the PHILOSOPHICAL fiction of the STATE OF NATURE only that the former is represented as the most charming and most peaceable condition which can possibly be imagined whereas the latter is painted out as a state of mutual war and violence attended with the most extreme necessity On the first origin of mankind we are told their ignorance and savage nature were so prevalent that they could give no mutual trust but must each depend upon himself and his own force or cunning for protection and security No law was heard of No rule of justice known No distinction of property regarded Power was the only measure of right and a perpetual war of all against all was the result of men s untamed selfishness and barbarity Footnote This fiction of a state of nature as a state of war was not first started by mister Hobbes as is commonly imagined Plato endeavours to refute an hypothesis very like it in the second third and fourth books de republica Cicero on the contrary supposes it certain and universally acknowledged in the following passage Quis enim vestrum judices ignorat ita naturam rerum tulisse ut quodam tempore homines nondum neque naturali neque civili jure descripto fusi per agros ac dispersi vagarentur tantumque haberent quantum manu ac viribus per caedem ac vulnera aut eripere aut retinere potuissent Qui igitur primi virtute consilio praestanti extiterunt ii perspecto genere humanae docilitatis atque ingenii dissipatos unum in locum congregarunt eosque ex feritate illa ad justitiam ac mansuetudinem transduxerunt Tum res ad communem utilitatem quas publicas appellamus tum conventicula hominum quae postea civitates nominatae sunt tum domicilia conjuncta quas urbes dicamus invento divino humano jure moenibus sepserunt Atque inter hanc vitam perpolitam humanitate llam immanem nihil tam interest quam JUS atque VIS Horum utro uti nolimus altero est utendum Vim volumus extingui Jus valeat necesse est idi est judicia quibus omne jus continetur Judicia displicent ant nulla sunt Vis dominetur necesse est Haec vident omnes Pro Sext sec forty two Whether such a condition of human nature could ever exist or if it did could continue so long as to merit the appellation of a STATE may justly be doubted Men are necessarily born in a family society at least and are trained up by their parents to some rule of conduct and behaviour But this must be admitted that if such a state of mutual war and violence was ever real the suspension of all laws of justice from their absolute inutility is a necessary and infallible consequence The more we vary our views of human life and the newer and more unusual the lights are in which we survey it the more shall we be convinced that the origin here assigned for the virtue of justice is real and satisfactory Were there a species of creatures intermingled with men which though rational were possessed of such inferior strength both of body and mind that they were incapable of all resistance and could never upon the highest provocation make us feel the effects of their resentment the necessary consequence I think is that we should be bound by the laws of humanity to give gentle usage to these creatures but should not properly speaking lie under any restraint of justice with regard to them nor could they possess any right or property exclusive of such arbitrary lords Our intercourse with them could not be called society which supposes a degree of equality but absolute command on the one side and servile obedience on the other Whatever we covet they must instantly resign Our permission is the only tenure by which they hold their possessions Our compassion and kindness the only check by which they curb our lawless will And as no inconvenience ever results from the exercise of a power so firmly established in nature the restraints of justice and property being totally USELESS would never have place in so unequal a confederacy This is plainly the situation of men with regard to animals and how far these may be said to possess reason I leave it to others to determine The great superiority of civilized Europeans above barbarous Indians tempted us to imagine ourselves on the same footing with regard to them and made us throw off all restraints of justice and even of humanity in our treatment of them In many nations the female sex are reduced to like slavery and are rendered incapable of all property in opposition to their lordly masters But though the males when united have in all countries bodily force sufficient to maintain this severe tyranny yet such are the insinuation address and charms of their fair companions that women are commonly able to break the confederacy and share with the other sex in all the rights and privileges of society Were the human species so framed by nature as that each individual possessed within himself every faculty requisite both for his own preservation and for the propagation of his kind Were all society and intercourse cut off between man and man by the primary intention of the supreme Creator It seems evident that so solitary a being would be as much incapable of justice as of social discourse and conversation Where mutual regards and forbearance serve to no manner of purpose they would never direct the conduct of any reasonable man The headlong course of the passions would be checked by no reflection on future consequences And as each man is here supposed to love himself alone and to depend only on himself and his own activity for safety and happiness he would on every occasion to the utmost of his power challenge the preference above every other being to none of which he is bound by any ties either of nature or of interest But suppose the conjunction of the sexes to be established in nature a family immediately arises and particular rules being found requisite for its subsistence these are immediately embraced though without comprehending the rest of mankind within their prescriptions Suppose that several families unite together into one society which is totally disjoined from all others the rules which preserve peace and order enlarge themselves to the utmost extent of that society but becoming then entirely useless lose their force when carried one step farther But again suppose that several distinct societies maintain a kind of intercourse for mutual convenience and advantage the boundaries of justice still grow larger in proportion to the largeness of men s views and the force of their mutual connexions History experience reason sufficiently instruct us in this natural progress of human sentiments and in the gradual enlargement of our regards to justice in proportion as we become acquainted with the extensive utility of that virtue PART II If we examine the PARTICULAR laws by which justice is directed and property determined we shall still be presented with the same conclusion The good of mankind is the only object of all these laws and regulations Not only is it requisite for the peace and interest of society that men s possessions should be separated but the rules which we follow in making the separation are such as can best be contrived to serve farther the interests of society We shall suppose that a creature possessed of reason but unacquainted with human nature deliberates with himself what rules of justice or property would best promote public interest and establish peace and security among mankind His most obvious thought would be to assign the largest possessions to the most extensive virtue and give every one the power of doing good proportioned to his inclination In a perfect theocracy where a being infinitely intelligent governs by particular volitions this rule would certainly have place and might serve to the wisest purposes But were mankind to execute such a law so great is the uncertainty of merit both from its natural obscurity and from the self conceit of each individual that no determinate rule of conduct would ever result from it and the total dissolution of society must be the immediate consequence Fanatics may suppose THAT DOMINION IS FOUNDED ON GRACE and THAT SAINTS ALONE INHERIT THE EARTH but the civil magistrate very justly puts these sublime theorists on the same footing with common robbers and teaches them by the severest discipline that a rule which in speculation may seem the most advantageous to society may yet be found in practice totally pernicious and destructive That there were RELIGIOUS fanatics of this kind in England during the civil wars we learn from history though it is probable that the obvious TENDENCY of these principles excited such horror in mankind as soon obliged the dangerous enthusiasts to renounce or at least conceal their tenets Perhaps the LEVELLERS who claimed an equal distribution of property were a kind of POLITICAL fanatics which arose from the religious species and more openly avowed their pretensions as carrying a more plausible appearance of being practicable in themselves as well as useful to human society It must indeed be confessed that nature is so liberal to mankind that were all her presents equally divided among the species and improved by art and industry every individual would enjoy all the necessaries and even most of the comforts of life nor would ever be liable to any ills but such as might accidentally arise from the sickly frame and constitution of his body It must also be confessed that wherever we depart from this equality we rob the poor of more satisfaction than we add to the rich and that the slight gratification of a frivolous vanity in one individual frequently costs more than bread to many families and even provinces It may appear withal that the rule of equality as it would be highly USEFUL is not altogether IMPRACTICABLE but has taken place at least in an imperfect degree in some republics particularly that of Sparta where it was attended it is said with the most beneficial consequences Not to mention that the Agrarian laws so frequently claimed in Rome and carried into execution in many Greek cities proceeded all of them from a general idea of the utility of this principle But historians and even common sense may inform us that however specious these ideas of PERFECT equality may seem they are really at bottom IMPRACTICABLE and were they not so would be extremely PERNICIOUS to human society Render possessions ever so equal men s different degrees of art care and industry will immediately break that equality Or if you check these virtues you reduce society to the most extreme indigence and instead of preventing want and beggary in a few render it unavoidable to the whole community The most rigorous inquisition too is requisite to watch every inequality on its first appearance and the most severe jurisdiction to punish and redress it But besides that so much authority must soon degenerate into tyranny and be exerted with great partialities who can possibly be possessed of it in such a situation as is here supposed Perfect equality of possessions destroying all subordination weakens extremely the authority of magistracy and must reduce all power nearly to a level as well as property We may conclude therefore that in order to establish laws for the regulation of property we must be acquainted with the nature and situation of man must reject appearances which may be false though specious and must search for those rules which are on the whole most USEFUL and BENEFICIAL Vulgar sense and slight experience are sufficient for this purpose where men give not way to too selfish avidity or too extensive enthusiasm Who sees not for instance that whatever is produced or improved by a man s art or industry ought for ever to be secured to him in order to give encouragement to such USEFUL habits and accomplishments That the property ought also to descend to children and relations for the same USEFUL purpose That it may be alienated by consent in order to beget that commerce and intercourse which is so BENEFICIAL to human society And that all contracts and promises ought carefully to be fulfilled in order to secure mutual trust and confidence by which the general INTEREST of mankind is so much promoted Examine the writers on the laws of nature and you will always find that whatever principles they set out with they are sure to terminate here at last and to assign as the ultimate reason for every rule which they establish the convenience and necessities of mankind A concession thus extorted in opposition to systems has more authority than if it had been made in prosecution of them What other reason indeed could writers ever give why this must be MINE and that YOURS since uninstructed nature surely never made any such distinction The objects which receive those appellations are of themselves foreign to us they are totally disjoined and separated from us and nothing but the general interests of society can form the connexion Sometimes the interests of society may require a rule of justice in a particular case but may not determine any particular rule among several which are all equally beneficial In that case the slightest analogies are laid hold of in order to prevent that indifference and ambiguity which would be the source of perpetual dissension Thus possession alone and first possession is supposed to convey property where no body else has any preceding claim and pretension Many of the reasonings of lawyers are of this analogical nature and depend on very slight connexions of the imagination Does any one scruple in extraordinary cases to violate all regard to the private property of individuals and sacrifice to public interest a distinction which had been established for the sake of that interest The safety of the people is the supreme law All other particular laws are subordinate to it and dependent on it And if in the COMMON course of things they be followed and regarded it is only because the public safety and interest COMMONLY demand so equal and impartial an administration Sometimes both UTILITY and ANALOGY fail and leave the laws of justice in total uncertainty Thus it is highly requisite that prescription or long possession should convey property but what number of days or months or years should be sufficient for that purpose it is impossible for reason alone to determine CIVIL LAWS here supply the place of the natural CODE and assign different terms for prescription according to the different UTILITIES proposed by the legislator Bills of exchange and promissory notes by the laws of most countries prescribe sooner than bonds and mortgages and contracts of a more formal nature In general we may observe that all questions of property are subordinate to the authority of civil laws which extend restrain modify and alter the rules of natural justice according to the particular CONVENIENCE of each community The laws have or ought to have a constant reference to the constitution of government the manners the climate the religion the commerce the situation of each society A late author of genius as well as learning has prosecuted this subject at large and has established from these principles a system of political knowledge which abounds in ingenious and brilliant thoughts and is not wanting in solidity Footnote The author of L ESPRIT DES LOIX This illustrious writer however sets out with a different theory and supposes all right to be founded on certain RAPPORTS or relations which is a system that in my opinion never will be reconciled with true philosophy Father Malebranche as far as I can learn was the first that started this abstract theory of morals which was afterwards adopted by Cudworth Clarke and others and as it excludes all sentiment and pretends to found everything on reason it has not wanted followers in this philosophic age See Section I Appendix I With regard to justice the virtue here treated of the inference against this theory seems short and conclusive Property is allowed to be dependent on civil laws civil laws are allowed to have no other object but the interest of society This therefore must be allowed to be the sole foundation of property and justice Not to mention that our obligation itself to obey the magistrate and his laws is founded on nothing but the interests of society If the ideas of justice sometimes do not follow the dispositions of civil law we shall find that these cases instead of objections are confirmations of the theory delivered above Where a civil law is so perverse as to cross all the interests of society it loses all its authority and men judge by the ideas of natural justice which are conformable to those interests Sometimes also civil laws for useful purposes require a ceremony or form to any deed and where that is wanting their decrees run contrary to the usual tenour of justice but one who takes advantage of such chicanes is not commonly regarded as an honest man Thus the interests of society require that contracts be fulfilled and there is not a more material article either of natural or civil justice But the omission of a trifling circumstance will often by law invalidate a contract in foro humano but not in foro conscientiae as divines express themselves In these cases the magistrate is supposed only to withdraw his power of enforcing the right not to have altered the right Where his intention extends to the right and is conformable to the interests of society it never fails to alter the right a clear proof of the origin of justice and of property as assigned above WHAT IS A MAN S PROPERTY Anything which it is lawful for him and for him alone to use BUT WHAT RULE HAVE WE BY WHICH WE CAN DISTINGUISH THESE OBJECTS Here we must have recourse to statutes customs precedents analogies and a hundred other circumstances some of which are constant and inflexible some variable and arbitrary But the ultimate point in which they all professedly terminate is the interest and happiness of human society Where this enters not into consideration nothing can appear more whimsical unnatural and even superstitious than all or most of the laws of justice and of property Those who ridicule vulgar superstitions and expose the folly of particular regards to meats days places postures apparel have an easy task while they consider all the qualities and relations of the objects and discover no adequate cause for that affection or antipathy veneration or horror which have so mighty an influence over a considerable part of mankind A Syrian would have starved rather than taste pigeon an Egyptian would not have approached bacon But if these species of food be examined by the senses of sight smell or taste or scrutinized by the sciences of chemistry medicine or physics no difference is ever found between them and any other species nor can that precise circumstance be pitched on which may afford a just foundation for the religious passion A fowl on Thursday is lawful food on Friday abominable Eggs in this house and in this diocese are permitted during Lent a hundred paces farther to eat them is a damnable sin This earth or building yesterday was profane to day by the muttering of certain words it has become holy and sacred Such reflections as these in the mouth of a philosopher one may safely say are too obvious to have any influence because they must always to every man occur at first sight and where they prevail not of themselves they are surely obstructed by education prejudice and passion not by ignorance or mistake It may appear to a careless view or rather a too abstracted reflection that there enters a like superstition into all the sentiments of justice and that if a man expose its object or what we call property to the same scrutiny of sense and science he will not by the most accurate enquiry find any foundation for the difference made by moral sentiment I may lawfully nourish myself from this tree but the fruit of another of the same species ten paces off it is criminal for me to touch Had I worn this apparel an hour ago I had merited the severest punishment but a man by pronouncing a few magical syllables has now rendered it fit for my use and service Were this house placed in the neighbouring territory it had been immoral for me to dwell in it but being built on this side the river it is subject to a different municipal law and by its becoming mine I incur no blame or censure The same species of reasoning it may be thought which so successfully exposes superstition is also applicable to justice nor is it possible in the one case more than in the other to point out in the object that precise quality or circumstance which is the foundation of the sentiment But there is this material difference between SUPERSTITION and JUSTICE that the former is frivolous useless and burdensome the latter is absolutely requisite to the well being of mankind and existence of society When we abstract from this circumstance for it is too apparent ever to be overlooked it must be confessed that all regards to right and property seem entirely without foundation as much as the grossest and most vulgar superstition Were the interests of society nowise concerned it is as unintelligible why another s articulating certain sounds implying consent should change the nature of my actions with regard to a particular object as why the reciting of a liturgy by a priest in a certain habit and posture should dedicate a heap of brick and timber and render it thenceforth and for ever sacred Footnote It is evident that the will or consent alone never transfers property nor causes the obligation of a promise for the same reasoning extends to both but the will must be expressed by words or signs in order to impose a tie upon any man The expression being once brought in as subservient to the will soon becomes the principal part of the promise nor will a man be less bound by his word though he secretly give a different direction to his intention and withhold the assent of his mind But though the expression makes on most occasions the whole of the promise yet it does not always so and one who should make use of any expression of which he knows not the meaning and which he uses without any sense of the consequences would not certainly be bound by it Nay though he know its meaning yet if he use it in jest only and with such signs as evidently show that he has no serious intention of binding himself he would not lie under any obligation of performance but it is necessary that the words be a perfect expression of the will without any contrary signs Nay even this we must not carry so far as to imagine that one whom by our quickness of understanding we conjecture from certain signs to have an intention of deceiving us is not bound by his expression or verbal promise if we accept of it but must limit this conclusion to those cases where the signs are of a different nature from those of deceit All these contradictions are easily accounted for if justice arise entirely from its usefulness to society but will never be explained on any other hypothesis It is remarkable that the moral decisions of the JESUITS and other relaxed casuists were commonly formed in prosecution of some such subtilties of reasoning as are here pointed out and proceed as much from the habit of scholastic refinement as from any corruption of the heart if we may follow the authority of Mons Bayle See his Dictionary article Loyola And why has the indignation of mankind risen so high against these casuists but because every one perceived that human society could not subsist were such practices authorized and that morals must always be handled with a view to public interest more than philosophical regularity If the secret direction of the intention said every man of sense could invalidate a contract where is our security And yet a metaphysical schoolman might think that where an intention was supposed to be requisite if that intention really had not place no consequence ought to follow and no obligation be imposed The casuistical subtilties may not be greater than the snbtilties of lawyers hinted at above but as the former are PERNICIOUS and the latter INNOCENT and even NECESSARY this is the reason of the very different reception they meet with from the world It is a doctrine of the Church of Rome that the priest by a secret direction of his intention can invalidate any sacrament This position is derived from a strict and regular prosecution of the obvious truth that empty words alone without any meaning or intention in the speaker can never be attended with any effect If the same conclusion be not admitted in reasonings concerning civil contracts where the affair is allowed to be of so much less consequence than the eternal salvation of thousands it proceeds entirely from men s sense of the danger and inconvenience of the doctrine in the former case And we may thence observe that however positive arrogant and dogmatical any superstition may appear it never can convey any thorough persuasion of the reality of its objects or put them in any degree on a balance with the common incidents of life which we learn from daily observation and experimental reasoning These reflections are far from weakening the obligations of justice or diminishing anything from the most sacred attention to property On the contrary such sentiments must acquire new force from the present reasoning For what stronger foundation can be desired or conceived for any duty than to observe that human society or even human nature could not subsist without the establishment of it and will still arrive at greater degrees of happiness and perfection the more inviolable the regard is which is paid to that duty The dilemma seems obvious As justice evidently tends to promote public utility and to support civil society the sentiment of justice is either derived from our reflecting on that tendency or like hunger thirst and other appetites resentment love of life attachment to offspring and other passions arises from a simple original instinct in the human breast which nature has implanted for like salutary purposes If the latter be the case it follows that property which is the object of justice is also distinguished by a simple original instinct and is not ascertained by any argument or reflection But who is there that ever heard of such an instinct Or is this a subject in which new discoveries can be made We may as well expect to discover in the body new senses which had before escaped the observation of all mankind But farther though it seems a very simple proposition to say that nature by an instinctive sentiment distinguishes property yet in reality we shall find that there are required for that purpose ten thousand different instincts and these employed about objects of the greatest intricacy and nicest discernment For when a definition of PROPERTY is required that relation is found to resolve itself into any possession acquired by occupation by industry by prescription by inheritance by contract c Can we think that nature by an original instinct instructs us in all these methods of acquisition These words too inheritance and contract stand for ideas infinitely complicated and to define them exactly a hundred volumes of laws and a thousand volumes of commentators have not been found sufficient Does nature whose instincts in men are all simple embrace such complicated and artificial objects and create a rational creature without trusting anything to the operation of his reason But even though all this were admitted it would not be satisfactory Positive laws can certainly transfer property It is by another original instinct that we recognize the authority of kings and senates and mark all the boundaries of their jurisdiction Judges too even though their sentence be erroneous and illegal must be allowed for the sake of peace and order to have decisive authority and ultimately to determine property Have we original innate ideas of praetors and chancellors and juries Who sees not that all these institutions arise merely from the necessities of human society All birds of the same species in every age and country built their nests alike In this we see the force of instinct Men in different times and places frame their houses differently Here we perceive the influence of reason and custom A like inference may be drawn from comparing the instinct of generation and the institution of property How great soever the variety of municipal laws it must be confessed that their chief outlines pretty regularly concur because the purposes to which they tend are everywhere exactly similar In like manner all houses have a roof and walls windows and chimneys though diversified in their shape figure and materials The purposes of the latter directed to the conveniencies of human life discover not more plainly their origin from reason and reflection than do those of the former which point all to a like end I need not mention the variations which all the rules of property receive from the finer turns and connexions of the imagination and from the subtilties and abstractions of law topics and reasonings There is no possibility of reconciling this observation to the notion of original instincts What alone will beget a doubt concerning the theory on which I insist is the influence of education and acquired habits by which we are so accustomed to blame injustice that we are not in every instance conscious of any immediate reflection on the pernicious consequences of it The views the most familiar to us are apt for that very reason to escape us and what we have very frequently performed from certain motives we are apt likewise to continue mechanically without recalling on every occasion the reflections which first determined us The convenience or rather necessity which leads to justice is so universal and everywhere points so much to the same rules that the habit takes place in all societies and it is not without some scrutiny that we are able to ascertain its true origin The matter however is not so obscure but that even in common life we have every moment recourse to the principle of public utility and ask WHAT MUST BECOME OF THE WORLD IF SUCH PRACTICES PREVAIL HOW COULD SOCIETY SUBSIST UNDER SUCH DISORDERS Were the distinction or separation of possessions entirely useless can any one conceive that it ever should have obtained in society Thus we seem upon the whole to have attained a knowledge of the force of that principle here insisted on and can determine what degree of esteem or moral approbation may result from reflections on public interest and utility The necessity of justice to the support of society is the sole foundation of that virtue and since no moral excellence is more highly esteemed we may conclude that this circumstance of usefulness has in general the strongest energy and most entire command over our sentiments It must therefore be the source of a considerable part of the merit ascribed to humanity benevolence friendship public spirit and other social virtues of that stamp as it is the sole source of the moral approbation paid to fidelity justice veracity integrity and those other estimable and useful qualities and principles It is entirely agreeable to the rules of philosophy and even of common reason where any principle has been found to have a great force and energy in one instance to ascribe to it a like energy in all similar instances This indeed is Newton s chief rule of philosophizing

8273-283127-0005	train-other-500	that therefore it ought also according to this system to merit he appellation of VIRTUOUS The sentiments excited by utility are in the two cases very different
none	none	 and the one is mixed with affection esteem approbation c and not the other 
8273-283127-0006	train-other-500	In like manner an inanimate object may have good colour and proportions as well as a human figure But can we ever be in love with the former There are a numerous set of passions and sentiments of which thinking rational beings are
8273-283127-0007	train-other-500	by the original constitution of nature the only proper objects and though the very same qualities be transferred to an insensible inanimate being they will not excite the same sentiments
none	none	 The beneficial qualities of herbs and minerals are indeed sometimes called their VIRTUES but this is an effect of the caprice of language which out not to be regarded in reasoning For though there be a species of approbation attending even inanimate objects when beneficial yet this sentiment is so weak and so different from that which is directed to beneficent magistrates or statesman 
8273-283127-0008	train-other-500	that they ought not to be ranked under the same class or appellation A very small variation of the object even where the same qualities are preserved will destroy a sentiment
none	none	 Thus the same beauty transferred to a different sex 
8273-283127-0009	train-other-500	excites no amorous passion where nature is not extremely perverted
8273-283127-0010	train-other-500	But perhaps the difficulty of accounting for these effects of usefulness or its contrary has kept philosophers from admitting them into their systems of ethics and has induced them rather to employ any other principle in explaining the origin of moral good and evil
8273-283127-0011	train-other-500	But it is no just reason for rejecting any principle confirmed by experience that we cannot give a satisfactory account of its origin nor are able to resolve it into other more general principles
8273-283127-0012	train-other-500	And if we would employ a little thought on the present subject we need be at no loss to account for the influence of utility and to deduce it from principles the most known and avowed in human nature
none	none	 From the apparent usefulness of the social virtues it has readily been inferred by sceptics both ancient and modern that all moral distinctions arise from education and were at first invented and afterwards encouraged by the art of politicians in order to render men tractable and subdue their natural ferocity and selfishness which incapacitated them for society This principle indeed of precept and education must so far be owned to have a powerful influence 
8273-283127-0013	train-other-500	that it may frequently increase or diminish beyond their natural standard the sentiments of approbation or dislike and may even in particular instances create without any natural principle a new sentiment of this kind
8273-283127-0014	train-other-500	as is evident in all superstitious practices and observances But that ALL moral affection or dislike arises from this origin will never surely be allowed by any judicious enquirer Had nature made no such distinction
8273-283127-0015	train-other-500	founded on the original constitution of the mind the words HONOURABLE and SHAMEFUL LOVELY and ODIOUS NOBLE and DESPICABLE had never had place in any language nor could politicians had they invented these terms
8273-283127-0016	train-other-500	ever have been able to render them intelligible or make them convey any idea to the audience So that nothing can be more superficial than this paradox of the sceptics and it were well if in the abstruser studies of logic and metaphysics
8273-283127-0017	train-other-500	we could as easily obviate the cavils of that sect as in the practical and more intelligible sciences of politics and morals The social virtues must therefore be allowed to have a natural beauty and amiableness
8273-283127-0018	train-other-500	which at first antecedent to all precept or education recommends them to the esteem of uninstructed mankind and engages their affections And as the public utility of these virtues is the chief circumstance whence they derive their merit
8273-283127-0019	train-other-500	it follows that the end which they have a tendency to promote must be some way agreeable to us and take hold of some natural affection It must please either from considerations of self interest or from more generous motives and regards
8273-283127-0020	train-other-500	It has often been asserted that as every man has a strong connexion with society and perceives the impossibility of his solitary subsistence he becomes on that account favourable to all those habits or principles which promote order in society
8273-283127-0021	train-other-500	and insure to him the quiet possession of so inestimable a blessing As much as we value our own happiness and welfare as much must we applaud the practice of justice and humanity by which alone the social confederacy can be maintained
8273-283127-0022	train-other-500	and every man reap the fruits of mutual protection and assistance This deduction of morals from self love or a regard to private interest is an obvious thought
none	none	 and has not arisen wholly from the wanton sallies and sportive assaults of the sceptics To mention no others Polybius one of the gravest and most judicious as well as most moral writers of antiquity has assigned this selfish origin to all our sentiments of virtue Footnote Undutifulness to parents is disapproved of by mankind Greek quotation inserted here Ingratitude for a like reason though he seems there to mix a more generous regard Greek quotation inserted here Lib vi cap four Ed Gronorius Perhaps the historian only meant that our sympathy and humanity was more enlivened by our considering the similarity of our case with that of the person suffering which is a just sentiment But though the solid practical sense of that author and his aversion to all vain subtilties render his authority on the present subject very considerable yet is not this an affair to be decided by authority 
8273-283127-0023	train-other-500	and the voice of nature and experience seems plainly to oppose the selfish theory We frequently bestow praise on virtuous actions performed in very distant ages and remote countries
8273-283127-0024	train-other-500	where the utmost subtilty of imagination would not discover any appearance of self interest or find any connexion of our present happiness and security with events so widely separated from us A generous a brave
8273-283127-0025	train-other-500	a noble deed performed by an adversary commands our approbation while in its consequences it may be acknowledged prejudicial to our particular interest Where private advantage concurs with general affection for virtue
8273-283127-0026	train-other-500	we readily perceive and avow the mixture of these distinct sentiments which have a very different feeling and influence on the mind We praise perhaps with more alacrity where the generous humane action contributes to our particular interest
8273-283127-0027	train-other-500	But the topics of praise which we insist on are very wide of this circumstance And we may attempt to bring over others to our sentiments without endeavouring to convince them

8273-283127-0032	train-other-500	And had it that universal infallible influence supposed it would turn into ridicule every composition and almost every conversation which contain any praise or censure of men and manners It is but a weak subterfuge

none	none	 It is not conceivable how a REAL sentiment or passion can ever arise from a known IMAGINARY interest especially when our REAL interest is still kept in view and is often acknowledged to be entirely distinct from the imaginary and even sometimes opposite to it 
8273-283127-0034	train-other-500	A man brought to the brink of a precipice cannot look down without trembling and the sentiment of IMAGINARY danger actuates him in opposition to the opinion and belief of REAL safety But the imagination is here assisted by the presence of a striking object
8273-283127-0035	train-other-500	and yet prevails not except it be also aided by novelty and the unusual appearance of the object Custom soon reconciles us to heights and precipices and wears off these false and delusive terrors
8273-283127-0036	train-other-500	The reverse is observable in the estimates which we form of characters and manners and the more we habituate ourselves to an accurate scrutiny of morals the more delicate feeling do we acquire of the most minute distinctions between vice and virtue
8273-283127-0037	train-other-500	Such frequent occasion indeed have we in common life to pronounce all kinds of moral determinations that no object of this kind can be new or unusual to us
none	none	 nor could any FALSE views or prepossessions maintain their ground against an experience so common and familiar Experience being chiefly what forms the associations of ideas 
8273-283127-0038	train-other-500	it is impossible that any association could establish and support itself in direct opposition to that principle Usefulness is agreeable and engages our approbation This is a matter of fact confirmed by daily observation
8273-283127-0039	train-other-500	But USEFUL For what For somebody s interest surely Whose interest then Not our own only For our approbation frequently extends farther It must therefore
8273-283127-0040	train-other-500	be the interest of those who are served by the character or action approved of and these we may conclude however remote are not totally indifferent to us
none	none	 By opening up this principle we shall discover one great source of moral distinctions PART II Self love is a principle in human nature of such extensive energy and the interest of each individual is in general so closely connected with that of the community that those philosophers were excusable who fancied that all our concern for the public might be resolved into a concern for our own happiness and preservation They saw every moment instances of approbation or blame satisfaction or displeasure towards characters and actions they denominated the objects of these sentiments VIRTUES or VICES they observed that the former had a tendency to increase the happiness and the latter the misery of mankind they asked whether it were possible that we could have any general concern for society or any disinterested resentment of the welfare or injury of others they found it simpler to consider all these sentiments as modifications of self love and they discovered a pretence at least for this unity of principle in that close union of interest which is so observable between the public and each individual But notwithstanding this frequent confusion of interests it is easy to attain what natural philosophers after Lord Bacon have affected to call the experimentum crucis or that experiment which points out the right way in any doubt or ambiguity We have found instances in which private interest was separate from public in which it was even contrary And yet we observed the moral sentiment to continue notwithstanding this disjunction of interests And wherever these distinct interests sensibly concurred we always found a sensible increase of the sentiment and a more warm affection to virtue and detestation of vice or what we properly call GRATITUDE and REVENGE Compelled by these instances we must renounce the theory which accounts for every moral sentiment by the principle of self love We must adopt a more public affection and allow that the interests of society are not even on their own account entirely indifferent to us Usefulness is only a tendency to a certain end and it is a contradiction in terms that anything pleases as means to an end where the end itself no wise affects us If usefulness therefore be a source of moral sentiment and if this usefulness be not always considered with a reference to self it follows that everything which contributes to the happiness of society recommends itself directly to our approbation and good will Here is a principle which accounts in great part for the origin of morality And what need we seek for abstruse and remote systems when there occurs one so obvious and natural FOOTNOTE It is needless to push our researches so far as to ask why we have humanity or a fellow feeling with others It is sufficient that this is experienced to be a principle in human nature We must stop somewhere in our examination of causes and there are in every science some general principles beyond which we cannot hope to find any principle more general No man is absolutely indifferent to the happiness and misery of others The first has a natural tendency to give pleasure the second pain This every one may find in himself It is not probable that these principles can be resolved into principles more simple and universal whatever attempts may have been made to that purpose But if it were possible it belongs not to the present subject and we may here safely consider these principles as original happy if we can render all the consequences sufficiently plain and perspicuous Have we any difficulty to comprehend the force of humanity and benevolence Or to conceive that the very aspect of happiness joy prosperity gives pleasure that of pain suffering sorrow communicates uneasiness The human countenance says Horace Uti ridentibus arrident ita flentibus adflent Humani vultus Hor borrows smiles or tears from the human countenance Reduce a person to solitude and he loses all enjoyment except either of the sensual or speculative kind and that because the movements of his heart are not forwarded by correspondent movements in his fellow creatures The signs of sorrow and mourning though arbitrary affect us with melancholy but the natural symptoms tears and cries and groans never fail to infuse compassion and uneasiness And if the effects of misery touch us in so lively a manner can we be supposed altogether insensible or indifferent towards its causes when a malicious or treacherous character and behaviour are presented to us We enter I shall suppose into a convenient warm well contrived apartment We necessarily receive a pleasure from its very survey because it presents us with the pleasing ideas of ease satisfaction and enjoyment The hospitable good humoured humane landlord appears This circumstance surely must embellish the whole nor can we easily forbear reflecting with pleasure on the satisfaction which results to every one from his intercourse and good offices His whole family by the freedom ease confidence and calm enjoyment diffused over their countenances sufficiently express their happiness I have a pleasing sympathy in the prospect of so much joy and can never consider the source of it without the most agreeable emotions He tells me that an oppressive and powerful neighbour had attempted to dispossess him of his inheritance and had long disturbed all his innocent and social pleasures I feel an immediate indignation arise in me against such violence and injury But it is no wonder he adds that a private wrong should proceed from a man who had enslaved provinces depopulated cities and made the field and scaffold stream with human blood I am struck with horror at the prospect of so much misery and am actuated by the strongest antipathy against its author In general it is certain that wherever we go whatever we reflect on or converse about everything still presents us with the view of human happiness or misery and excites in our breast a sympathetic movement of pleasure or uneasiness In our serious occupations in our careless amusements this principle still exerts its active energy A man who enters the theatre is immediately struck with the view of so great a multitude participating of one common amusement and experiences from their very aspect a superior sensibility or disposition of being affected with every sentiment which he shares with his fellow creatures He observes the actors to be animated by the appearance of a full audience and raised to a degree of enthusiasm which they cannot command in any solitary or calm moment Every movement of the theatre by a skilful poet is communicated as it were by magic to the spectators who weep tremble resent rejoice and are inflamed with all the variety of passions which actuate the several personages of the drama Where any event crosses our wishes and interrupts the happiness of the favourite characters we feel a sensible anxiety and concern But where their sufferings proceed from the treachery cruelty or tyranny of an enemy our breasts are affected with the liveliest resentment against the author of these calamities It is here esteemed contrary to the rules of art to represent anything cool and indifferent A distant friend or a confident who has no immediate interest in the catastrophe ought if possible to be avoided by the poet as communicating a like indifference to the audience and checking the progress of the passions Few species of poetry are more entertaining than PASTORAL and every one is sensible that the chief source of its pleasure arises from those images of a gentle and tender tranquillity which it represents in its personages and of which it communicates a like sentiment to the reader Sannazarius who transferred the scene to the sea shore though he presented the most magnificent object in nature is confessed to have erred in his choice The idea of toil labour and danger suffered by the fishermen is painful by an unavoidable sympathy which attends every conception of human happiness or misery When I was twenty says a French poet Ovid was my favourite Now I am forty I declare for Horace We enter to be sure more readily into sentiments which resemble those we feel every day But no passion when well represented can be entirely indifferent to us because there is none of which every man has not within him at least the seeds and first principles It is the business of poetry to bring every affection near to us by lively imagery and representation and make it look like truth and reality A certain proof that wherever that reality is found our minds are disposed to be strongly affected by it Any recent event or piece of news by which the fate of states provinces or many individuals is affected is extremely interesting even to those whose welfare is not immediately engaged Such intelligence is propagated with celerity heard with avidity and enquired into with attention and concern The interest of society appears on this occasion to be in some degree the interest of each individual The imagination is sure to be affected though the passions excited may not always be so strong and steady as to have great influence on the conduct and behaviour The perusal of a history seems a calm entertainment but would be no entertainment at all did not our hearts beat with correspondent movements to those which are described by the historian Thucydides and Guicciardin support with difficulty our attention while the former describes the trivial encounters of the small cities of Greece and the latter the harmless wars of Pisa The few persons interested and the small interest fill not the imagination and engage not the affections The deep distress of the numerous Athenian army before Syracuse the danger which so nearly threatens Venice these excite compassion these move terror and anxiety The indifferent uninteresting style of Suetonius equally with the masterly pencil of Tacitus may convince us of the cruel depravity of Nero or Tiberius But what a difference of sentiment While the former coldly relates the facts and the latter sets before our eyes the venerable figures of a Soranus and a Thrasea intrepid in their fate and only moved by the melting sorrows of their friends and kindred What sympathy then touches every human heart What indignation against the tyrant whose causeless fear or unprovoked malice gave rise to such detestable barbarity If we bring these subjects nearer If we remove all suspicion of fiction and deceit What powerful concern is excited and how much superior in many instances to the narrow attachments of self love and private interest Popular sedition party zeal a devoted obedience to factious leaders these are some of the most visible though less laudable effects of this social sympathy in human nature The frivolousness of the subject too we may observe is not able to detach us entirely from what carries an image of human sentiment and affection When a person stutters and pronounces with difficulty we even sympathize with this trivial uneasiness and suffer for him And it is a rule in criticism that every combination of syllables or letters which gives pain to the organs of speech in the recital appears also from a species of sympathy harsh and disagreeable to the ear Nay when we run over a book with our eye we are sensible of such unharmonious composition because we still imagine that a person recites it to us and suffers from the pronunciation of these jarring sounds So delicate is our sympathy Easy and unconstrained postures and motions are always beautiful An air of health and vigour is agreeable Clothes which warm without burthening the body which cover without imprisoning the limbs are well fashioned In every judgement of beauty the feelings of the person affected enter into consideration and communicate to the spectator similar touches of pain or pleasure Footnote Decentior equus cujus astricta suntilia sed idem velocior Pulcher aspectu sit athleta cujus lacertos execitatio expressit idem certamini paratior nunquam enim SPECIES ab UTILITATE dividitur Sed hoc quidem discernere modici judicii est Quintilian Inst lib viii cap three What wonder then if we can pronounce no judgement concerning the character and conduct of men without considering the tendencies of their actions and the happiness or misery which thence arises to society What association of ideas would ever operate were that principle here totally unactive Footnote In proportion to the station which a man possesses according to the relations in which he is placed we always expect from him a greater or less degree of good and when disappointed blame his inutility and much more do we blame him if any ill or prejudice arise from his conduct and behaviour When the interests of one country interfere with those of another we estimate the merits of a statesman by the good or ill which results to his own country from his measures and councils without regard to the prejudice which he brings on its enemies and rivals His fellow citizens are the objects which lie nearest the eye while we determine his character And as nature has implanted in every one a superior affection to his own country we never expect any regard to distant nations where a competition arises Not to mention that while every man consults the good of his own community we are sensible that the general interest of mankind is better promoted than any loose indeterminate views to the good of a species whence no beneficial action could ever result for want of a duly limited object on which they could exert themselves If any man from a cold insensibility or narrow selfishness of temper is unaffected with the images of human happiness or misery he must be equally indifferent to the images of vice and virtue As on the other hand it is always found that a warm concern for the interests of our species is attended with a delicate feeling of all moral distinctions a strong resentment of injury done to men a lively approbation of their welfare In this particular though great superiority is observable of one man above another yet none are so entirely indifferent to the interest of their fellow creatures as to perceive no distinctions of moral good and evil in consequence of the different tendencies of actions and principles How indeed can we suppose it possible in any one who wears a human heart that if there be subjected to his censure one character or system of conduct which is beneficial and another which is pernicious to his species or community he will not so much as give a cool preference to the former or ascribe to it the smallest merit or regard Let us suppose such a person ever so selfish let private interest have ingrossed ever so much his attention yet in instances where that is not concerned he must unavoidably feel SOME propensity to the good of mankind and make it an object of choice if everything else be equal Would any man who is walking along tread as willingly on another s gouty toes whom he has no quarrel with as on the hard flint and pavement There is here surely a difference in the case We surely take into consideration the happiness and misery of others in weighing the several motives of action and incline to the former where no private regards draw us to seek our own promotion or advantage by the injury of our fellow creatures And if the principles of humanity are capable in many instances of influencing our actions they must at all times have some authority over our sentiments and give us a general approbation of what is useful to society and blame of what is dangerous or pernicious The degrees of these sentiments may be the subject of controversy but the reality of their existence one should think must be admitted in every theory or system A creature absolutely malicious and spiteful were there any such in nature must be worse than indifferent to the images of vice and virtue All his sentiments must be inverted and directly opposite to those which prevail in the human species Whatever contributes to the good of mankind as it crosses the constant bent of his wishes and desires must produce uneasiness and disapprobation and on the contrary whatever is the source of disorder and misery in society must for the same reason be regarded with pleasure and complacency Timon who probably from his affected spleen more than an inveterate malice was denominated the manhater embraced Alcibiades with great fondness GO ON MY BOY cried he ACQUIRE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE YOU WILL ONE DAY I FORESEE BE THE CAUSE OF GREAT CALAMITIES TO THEM Footnote Plutarch fit vita Ale Could we admit the two principles of the Manicheans it is an infallible consequence that their sentiments of human actions as well as of everything else must be totally opposite and that every instance of justice and humanity from its necessary tendency must please the one deity and displease the other All mankind so far resemble the good principle that where interest or revenge or envy perverts not our disposition we are always inclined from our natural philanthropy to give the preference to the happiness of society and consequently to virtue above its opposite Absolute unprovoked disinterested malice has never perhaps place in any human breast or if it had must there pervert all the sentiments of morals as well as the feelings of humanity If the cruelty of Nero be allowed entirely voluntary and not rather the effect of constant fear and resentment it is evident that Tigellinus preferably to Seneca or Burrhus must have possessed his steady and uniform approbation A statesman or patriot who serves our own country in our own time has always a more passionate regard paid to him than one whose beneficial influence operated on distant ages or remote nations where the good resulting from his generous humanity being less connected with us seems more obscure and affects us with a less lively sympathy We may own the merit to be equally great though our sentiments are not raised to an equal height in both cases The judgement here corrects the inequalities of our internal emotions and perceptions in like manner as it preserves us from error in the several variations of images presented to our external senses The same object at a double distance really throws on the eye a picture of but half the bulk yet we imagine that it appears of the same size in both situations because we know that on our approach to it its image would expand on the eye and that the difference consists not in the object itself but in our position with regard to it And indeed without such a correction of appearances both in internal and external sentiment men could never think or talk steadily on any subject while their fluctuating situations produce a continual variation on objects and throw them into such different and contrary lights and positions Footnote For a little reason the tendencies of actions and characters not their real accidental consequences are alone regarded in our more determinations or general judgements though in our real feeling or sentiment we cannot help paying greater regard to one whose station joined to virtue renders him really useful to society then to one who exerts the social virtues only in good intentions and benevolent affections Separating the character from the furtone by an easy and necessary effort of thought we pronounce these persons alike and give them the appearance But is not able entirely to prevail our sentiment Why is this peach tree said to be better than that other but because it produces more or better fruit And would not the same praise be given it though snails or vermin had destroyed the peaches before they came to full maturity In morals too is not THE TREE KNOWN BY THE FRUIT And cannot we easily distinguish between nature and accident in the one case as well as in the other The more we converse with mankind and the greater social intercourse we maintain the more shall we be familiarized to these general preferences and distinctions without which our conversation and discourse could scarcely be rendered intelligible to each other Every man s interest is peculiar to himself and the aversions and desires which result from it cannot be supposed to affect others in a like degree General language therefore being formed for general use must be moulded on some more general views and must affix the epithets of praise or blame in conformity to sentiments which arise from the general interests of the community And if these sentiments in most men be not so strong as those which have a reference to private good yet still they must make some distinction even in persons the most depraved and selfish and must attach the notion of good to a beneficent conduct and of evil to the contrary Sympathy we shall allow is much fainter than our concern for ourselves and sympathy with persons remote from us much fainter than that with persons near and contiguous but for this very reason it is necessary for us in our calm judgements and discourse concerning the characters of men to neglect all these differences and render our sentiments more public and social Besides that we ourselves often change our situation in this particular we every day meet with persons who are in a situation different from us and who could never converse with us were we to remain constantly in that position and point of view which is peculiar to ourselves The intercourse of sentiments therefore in society and conversation makes us form some general unalterable standard by which we may approve or disapprove of characters and manners And though the heart takes not part entirely with those general notions nor regulates all its love and hatred by the universal abstract differences of vice and virtue without regard to self or the persons with whom we are more intimately connected yet have these moral differences a considerable influence and being sufficient at least for discourse serve all our purposes in company in the pulpit on the theatre and in the schools Footnote It is wisely ordained by nature that private connexions should commonly prevail over univeral views and considerations otherwise our affections and actions would be dissopated and lost for want of a proper limited object Thus a small benefit done to ourselves or our near friends excites more lively sentiments of love and approbation than a great benefit done to a distant commonwealth But still we know here as in all the senses to correct these inequalities by reflection and retain a general standard of vice and virtue founded chiefly on a general usefulness Thus in whatever light we take this subject the merit ascribed to the social virtues appears still uniform and arises chiefly from that regard which the natural sentiment of benevolence engages us to pay to the interests of mankind and society If we consider the principles of the human make such as they appear to daily experience and observation we must A PRIORI conclude it impossible for such a creature as man to be totally indifferent to the well or ill being of his fellow creatures and not readily of himself to pronounce where nothing gives him any particular bias that what promotes their happiness is good what tends to their misery is evil without any farther regard or consideration Here then are the faint rudiments at least or outlines of a GENERAL distinction between actions and in proportion as the humanity of the person is supposed to increase his connexion with those who are injured or benefited and his lively conception of their misery or happiness his consequent censure or approbation acquires proportionable vigour There is no necessity that a generous action barely mentioned in an old history or remote gazette should communicate any strong feelings of applause and admiration Virtue placed at such a distance is like a fixed star which though to the eye of reason it may appear as luminous as the sun in his meridian is so infinitely removed as to affect the senses neither with light nor heat Bring this virtue nearer by our acquaintance or connexion with the persons or even by an eloquent recital of the case our hearts are immediately caught our sympathy enlivened and our cool approbation converted into the warmest sentiments of friendship and regard These seem necessary and infallible consequences of the general principles of human nature as discovered in common life and practice Again reverse these views and reasonings Consider the matter a posteriori and weighing the consequences enquire if the merit of social virtue be not in a great measure derived from the feelings of humanity with which it affects the spectators It appears to be matter of fact that the circumstance of UTILITY in all subjects is a source of praise and approbation That it is constantly appealed to in all moral decisions concerning the merit and demerit of actions That it is the SOLE source of that high regard paid to justice fidelity honour allegiance and chastity That it is inseparable from all the other social virtues humanity generosity charity affability lenity mercy and moderation And in a word that it is a foundation of the chief part of morals which has a reference to mankind and our fellow creatures It appears also that in our general approbation of characters and manners the useful tendency of the social virtues moves us not by any regards to self interest but has an influence much more universal and extensive It appears that a tendency to public good and to the promoting of peace harmony and order in society does always by affecting the benevolent principles of our frame engage us on the side of the social virtues And it appears as an additional confirmation that these principles of humanity and sympathy enter so deeply into all our sentiments and have so powerful an influence as may enable them to excite the strongest censure and applause The present theory is the simple result of all these inferences each of which seems founded on uniform experience and observation Were it doubtful whether there were any such principle in our nature as humanity or a concern for others yet when we see in numberless instances that whatever has a tendency to promote the interests of society is so highly approved of we ought thence to learn the force of the benevolent principle since it is impossible for anything to please as means to an end where the end is totally indifferent On the other hand were it doubtful whether there were implanted in our nature any general principle of moral blame and approbation yet when we see in numberless instances the influence of humanity we ought thence to conclude that it is impossible but that everything which promotes the interest of society must communicate pleasure and what is pernicious give uneasiness But when these different reflections and observations concur in establishing the same conclusion must they not bestow an undisputed evidence upon it It is however hoped that the progress of this argument will bring a farther confirmation of the present theory by showing the rise of other sentiments of esteem and regard from the same or like principles SECTION VI OF QUALITIES USEFUL TO OURSELVES PART I IT seems evident that where a quality or habit is subjected to our examination if it appear in any respect prejudicial to the person possessed of it or such as incapacitates him for business and action it is instantly blamed and ranked among his faults and imperfections Indolence negligence want of order and method obstinacy fickleness rashness credulity these qualities were never esteemed by any one indifferent to a character much less extolled as accomplishments or virtues The prejudice resulting from them immediately strikes our eye and gives us the sentiment of pain and disapprobation No quality it is allowed is absolutely either blameable or praiseworthy It is all according to its degree A due medium says the Peripatetics is the characteristic of virtue But this medium is chiefly determined by utility A proper celerity for instance and dispatch in business is commendable When defective no progress is ever made in the execution of any purpose When excessive it engages us in precipitate and ill concerted measures and enterprises By such reasonings we fix the proper and commendable mediocrity in all moral and prudential disquisitions and never lose view of the advantages which result from any character or habit Now as these advantages are enjoyed by the person possessed of the character it can never be SELF LOVE which renders the prospect of them agreeable to us the spectators and prompts our esteem and approbation No force of imagination can convert us into another person and make us fancy that we being that person reap benefit from those valuable qualities which belong to him Or if it did no celerity of imagination could immediately transport us back into ourselves and make us love and esteem the person as different from us Views and sentiments so opposite to known truth and to each other could never have place at the same time in the same person All suspicion therefore of selfish regards is here totally excluded It is a quite different principle which actuates our bosom and interests us in the felicity of the person whom we contemplate Where his natural talents and acquired abilities give us the prospect of elevation advancement a figure in life prosperous success a steady command over fortune and the execution of great or advantageous undertakings we are struck with such agreeable images and feel a complacency and regard immediately arise towards him The ideas of happiness joy triumph prosperity are connected with every circumstance of his character and diffuse over our minds a pleasing sentiment of sympathy and humanity Footnote One may venture to affirm that there is no human nature to whom the appearance of happiness where envy or revenge has no place does not give pleasure that of misery uneasiness This seems inseparable from our make and constitution But they are only more generous minds that are thence prompted to seek zealously the good of others and to have a real passion for their welfare With men of narrow and ungenerous spirits this sympathy goes not beyond a slight feeling of the imagination which serves only to excite sentiments of complacency or ensure and makes them apply to the object either honorable or dishonorable appellations A griping miser for instance praises extremely INDUSTRY and FRUGALITY even in others and sets them in his estimation above all the other virtues He knows the good that results from them and feels that species of happiness with a more lively sympathy than any other you could represent to him though perhaps he would not part with a shilling to make the fortune of the industrious man whom he praises so highly Let us suppose a person originally framed so as to have no manner of concern for his fellow creatures but to regard the happiness and misery of all sensible beings with greater indifference than even two contiguous shades of the same colour Let us suppose if the prosperity of nations were laid on the one hand and their ruin on the other and he were desired to choose that he would stand like the schoolman s ass irresolute and undetermined between equal motives or rather like the same ass between two pieces of wood or marble without any inclination or propensity to either side The consequence I believe must be allowed just that such a person being absolutely unconcerned either for the public good of a community or the private utility of others would look on every quality however pernicious or however beneficial to society or to its possessor with the same indifference as on the most common and uninteresting object But if instead of this fancied monster we suppose a MAN to form a judgement or determination in the case there is to him a plain foundation of preference where everything else is equal and however cool his choice may be if his heart be selfish or if the persons interested be remote from him there must still be a choice or distinction between what is useful and what is pernicious Now this distinction is the same in all its parts with the MORAL DISTINCTION whose foundation has been so often and so much in vain enquired after The same endowments of the mind in every circumstance are agreeable to the sentiment of morals and to that of humanity the same temper is susceptible of high degrees of the one sentiment and of the other and the same alteration in the objects by their nearer approach or by connexions enlivens the one and the other By all the rules of philosophy therefore we must conclude that these sentiments are originally the same since in each particular even the most minute they are governed by the same laws and are moved by the same objects Why do philosophers infer with the greatest certainty that the moon is kept in its orbit by the same force of gravity that makes bodies fall near the surface of the earth but because these effects are upon computation found similar and equal And must not this argument bring as strong conviction in moral as in natural disquisitions To prove by any long detail that all the qualities useful to the possessor are approved of and the contrary censured would be superfluous The least reflection on what is every day experienced in life will be sufficient We shall only mention a few instances in order to remove if possible all doubt and hesitation The quality the most necessary for the execution of any useful enterprise is discretion by which we carry on a safe intercourse with others give due attention to our own and to their character weigh each circumstance of the business which we undertake and employ the surest and safest means for the attainment of any end or purpose To a Cromwell perhaps or a De Retz discretion may appear an alderman like virtue as doctor Swift calls it and being incompatible with those vast designs to which their courage and ambition prompted them it might really in them be a fault or imperfection But in the conduct of ordinary life no virtue is more requisite not only to obtain success but to avoid the most fatal miscarriages and disappointments The greatest parts without it as observed by an elegant writer may be fatal to their owner as Polyphemus deprived of his eye was only the more exposed on account of his enormous strength and stature The best character indeed were it not rather too perfect for human nature is that which is not swayed by temper of any kind but alternately employs enterprise and caution as each is useful to the particular purpose intended Such is the excellence which saint Evremond ascribes to Mareschal Turenne who displayed every campaign as he grew older more temerity in his military enterprises and being now from long experience perfectly acquainted with every incident in war he advanced with greater firmness and security in a road so well known to him Fabius says Machiavel was cautious Scipio enterprising And both succeeded because the situation of the Roman affairs during the command of each was peculiarly adapted to his genius but both would have failed had these situations been reversed He is happy whose circumstances suit his temper but he is more excellent who can suit his temper to any circumstances What need is there to display the praises of industry and to extol its advantages in the acquisition of power and riches or in raising what we call a FORTUNE in the world The tortoise according to the fable by his perseverance gained the race of the hare though possessed of much superior swiftness A man s time when well husbanded is like a cultivated field of which a few acres produce more of what is useful to life than extensive provinces even of the richest soil when over run with weeds and brambles But all prospect of success in life or even of tolerable subsistence must fail where a reasonable frugality is wanting The heap instead of increasing diminishes daily and leaves its possessor so much more unhappy as not having been able to confine his expences to a large revenue he will still less be able to live contentedly on a small one The souls of men according to Plato Footnote Phaedo inflamed with impure appetites and losing the body which alone afforded means of satisfaction hover about the earth and haunt the places where their bodies are deposited possessed with a longing desire to recover the lost organs of sensation So may we see worthless prodigals having consumed their fortune in wild debauches thrusting themselves into every plentiful table and every party of pleasure hated even by the vicious and despised even by fools The one extreme of frugality is avarice which as it both deprives a man of all use of his riches and checks hospitality and every social enjoyment is justly censured on a double account PRODIGALITY the other extreme is commonly more hurtful to a man himself and each of these extremes is blamed above the other according to the temper of the person who censures and according to his greater or less sensibility to pleasure either social or sensual Qualities often derive their merit from complicated sources Honesty fidelity truth are praised for their immediate tendency to promote the interests of society but after those virtues are once established upon this foundation they are also considered as advantageous to the person himself and as the source of that trust and confidence which can alone give a man any consideration in life One becomes contemptible no less than odious when he forgets the duty which in this particular he owes to himself as well as to society Perhaps this consideration is one CHIEF source of the high blame which is thrown on any instance of failure among women in point of CHASTITY The greatest regard which can be acquired by that sex is derived from their fidelity and a woman becomes cheap and vulgar loses her rank and is exposed to every insult who is deficient in this particular The smallest failure is here sufficient to blast her character A female has so many opportunities of secretly indulging these appetites that nothing can give us security but her absolute modesty and reserve and where a breach is once made it can scarcely ever be fully repaired If a man behave with cowardice on one occasion a contrary conduct reinstates him in his character But by what action can a woman whose behaviour has once been dissolute be able to assure us that she has formed better resolutions and has self command enough to carry them into execution All men it is allowed are equally desirous of happiness but few are successful in the pursuit One considerable cause is the want of strength of mind which might enable them to resist the temptation of present ease or pleasure and carry them forward in the search of more distant profit and enjoyment Our affections on a general prospect of their objects form certain rules of conduct and certain measures of preference of one above another and these decisions though really the result of our calm passions and propensities for what else can pronounce any object eligible or the contrary are yet said by a natural abuse of terms to be the determinations of pure REASON and reflection But when some of these objects approach nearer to us or acquire the advantages of favourable lights and positions which catch the heart or imagination our general resolutions are frequently confounded a small enjoyment preferred and lasting shame and sorrow entailed upon us And however poets may employ their wit and eloquence in celebrating present pleasure and rejecting all distant views to fame health or fortune it is obvious that this practice is the source of all dissoluteness and disorder repentance and misery A man of a strong and determined temper adheres tenaciously to his general resolutions and is neither seduced by the allurements of pleasure nor terrified by the menaces of pain but keeps still in view those distant pursuits by which he at once ensures his happiness and his honour Self satisfaction at least in some degree is an advantage which equally attends the fool and the wise man But it is the only one nor is there any other circumstance in the conduct of life where they are upon an equal footing Business books conversation for all of these a fool is totally incapacitated and except condemned by his station to the coarsest drudgery remains a useless burthen upon the earth Accordingly it is found that men are extremely jealous of their character in this particular and many instances are seen of profligacy and treachery the most avowed and unreserved none of bearing patiently the imputation of ignorance and stupidity Dicaearchus the Macedonian general who as Polybius tells us Footnote Lib xvi Cap thirty five openly erected one altar to impiety another to injustice in order to bid defiance to mankind even he I am well assured would have started at the epithet of FOOL and have meditated revenge for so injurious an appellation Except the affection of parents the strongest and most indissoluble bond in nature no connexion has strength sufficient to support the disgust arising from this character Love itself which can subsist under treachery ingratitude malice and infidelity is immediately extinguished by it when perceived and acknowledged nor are deformity and old age more fatal to the dominion of that passion So dreadful are the ideas of an utter incapacity for any purpose or undertaking and of continued error and misconduct in life When it is asked whether a quick or a slow apprehension be most valuable Whether one that at first view penetrates far into a subject but can perform nothing upon study or a contrary character which must work out everything by dint of application Whether a clear head or a copious invention Whether a profound genius or a sure judgement In short what character or peculiar turn of understanding is more excellent than another It is evident that we can answer none of these questions without considering which of those qualities capacitates a man best for the world and carries him farthest in any undertaking If refined sense and exalted sense be not so USEFUL as common sense their rarity their novelty and the nobleness of their objects make some compensation and render them the admiration of mankind As gold though less serviceable than iron acquires from its scarcity a value which is much superior The defects of judgement can be supplied by no art or invention but those of memory frequently may both in business and in study by method and industry and by diligence in committing everything to writing and we scarcely ever hear a short memory given as a reason for a man s failure in any undertaking But in ancient times when no man could make a figure without the talent of speaking and when the audience were too delicate to bear such crude undigested harangues as our extemporary orators offer to public assemblies the faculty of memory was then of the utmost consequence and was accordingly much more valued than at present Scarce any great genius is mentioned in antiquity who is not celebrated for this talent and Cicero enumerates it among the other sublime qualities of Caesar himself Footnote Fruit in Illo Ingenium ratio memoria literae cura cogitatio diligentia c Phillip two Particular customs and manners alter the usefulness of qualities they also alter their merit Particular situations and accidents have in some degree the same influence He will always be more esteemed who possesses those talents and accomplishments which suit his station and profession than he whom fortune has misplaced in the part which she has assigned him The private or selfish virtues are in this respect more arbitrary than the public and social In other respects they are perhaps less liable to doubt and controversy In this kingdom such continued ostentation of late years has prevailed among men in ACTIVE life with regard to PUBLIC SPIRIT and among those in SPECULATIVE with regard to BENEVOLENCE and so many false pretensions to each have been no doubt detected that men of the world are apt without any bad intention to discover a sullen incredulity on the head of those moral endowments and even sometimes absolutely to deny their existence and reality In like manner I find that of old the perpetual cant of the STOICS and CYNICS concerning VIRTUE their magnificent professions and slender performances bred a disgust in mankind and Lucian who though licentious with regard to pleasure is yet in other respects a very moral writer cannot sometimes talk of virtue so much boasted without betraying symptoms of spleen and irony But surely this peevish delicacy whence ever it arises can never be carried so far as to make us deny the existence of every species of merit and all distinction of manners and behaviour Besides DISCRETION CAUTION ENTERPRISE INDUSTRY ASSIDUITY FRUGALITY ECONOMY GOOD SENSE PRUDENCE DISCERNMENT besides these endowments I say whose very names force an avowal of their merit there are many others to which the most determined scepticism cannot for a moment refuse the tribute of praise and approbation TEMPERANCE SOBRIETY PATIENCE CONSTANCY PERSEVERANCE FORETHOUGHT CONSIDERATENESS SECRECY ORDER INSINUATION ADDRESS PRESENCE OF MIND QUICKNESS OF CONCEPTION FACILITY OF EXPRESSION these and a thousand more of the same kind no man will ever deny to be excellencies and perfections As their merit consists in their tendency to serve the person possessed of them without any magnificent claim to public and social desert we are the less jealous of their pretensions and readily admit them into the catalogue of laudable qualities We are not sensible that by this concession we have paved the way for all the other moral excellencies and cannot consistently hesitate any longer with regard to disinterested benevolence patriotism and humanity It seems indeed certain that first appearances are here as usual extremely deceitful and that it is more difficult in a speculative way to resolve into self love the merit which we ascribe to the selfish virtues above mentioned than that even of the social virtues justice and beneficence For this latter purpose we need but say that whatever conduct promotes the good of the community is loved praised and esteemed by the community on account of that utility and interest of which every one partakes and though this affection and regard be in reality gratitude not self love yet a distinction even of this obvious nature may not readily be made by superficial reasoners and there is room at least to support the cavil and dispute for a moment But as qualities which tend only to the utility of their possessor without any reference to us or to the community are yet esteemed and valued by what theory or system can we account for this sentiment from self love or deduce it from that favourite origin There seems here a necessity for confessing that the happiness and misery of others are not spectacles entirely indifferent to us but that the view of the former whether in its causes or effects like sunshine or the prospect of well cultivated plains to carry our pretensions no higher communicates a secret joy and satisfaction the appearance of the latter like a lowering cloud or barren landscape throws a melancholy damp over the imagination And this concession being once made the difficulty is over and a natural unforced interpretation of the phenomena of human life will afterwards we may hope prevail among all speculative enquirers PART II 
8273-283130-0000	train-other-500	It may not be improper in this place to examine the influence of bodily endowments and of the goods of fortune over our sentiments of regard and esteem and to consider whether these phenomena fortify or weaken the present theory
8273-283130-0001	train-other-500	It will naturally be expected that the beauty of the body as is supposed by all ancient moralists will be similar in some respects to that of the mind and that every kind of esteem which is paid to a man will have something similar in its origin
8273-283130-0002	train-other-500	whether it arise from his mental endowments or from the situation of his exterior circumstances It is evident that one considerable source of BEAUTY in all animals is the advantage which they reap from the particular structure of their limbs and members

8273-283130-0003	train-other-500	Ideas of utility and its contrary though they do not entirely determine what is handsome or deformed are evidently the source of a considerable part of approbation or dislike In ancient times

8273-283130-0005	train-other-500	in order to show the idea of perfect merit which prevailed in those ages In other illustrious men say he you will observe that each possessed some one shining quality which was the foundation of his fame In Epaminondas all the VIRTUES are found united

8273-283130-0008	train-other-500	is a reproach but not in the same degree of which the reason is very obvious according to the present theory There is no rule in painting or statuary more indispensible than that of balancing the figures
8273-283130-0009	train-other-500	and placing them with the greatest exactness on their proper centre of gravity A figure which is not justly balanced is ugly because it conveys the disagreeable ideas of fall harm and pain Footenote

8273-283130-0011	train-other-500	But comparing our own species to superior ones it is a very mortifying consideration that we should all be so liable to diseases and infirmities and divines accordingly employ this topic in order to depress self conceit and vanity
8273-283130-0012	train-other-500	They would have more success if the common bent of our thoughts were not perpetually turned to compare ourselves with others The infirmities of old age are mortifying because a comparison with the young may take place

8273-283130-0015	train-other-500	A disposition or turn of mind which qualifies a man to rise in the world and advance his fortune is entitled to esteem and regard as has already been explained It may therefore naturally be supposed
8273-283130-0016	train-other-500	that the actual possession of riches and authority will have a considerable influence over these sentiments Let us examine any hypothesis by which we can account for the regard paid to the rich and powerful we shall find none satisfactory

8273-283130-0019	train-other-500	though we naturally respect the rich
none	none	 even before they discover any such favourable disposition towards us

8273-283130-0021	train-other-500	and riches it is evident go far towards fixing the condition of any person If birth and quality enter for a share this still affords us an argument to our present purpose For what is it we call a man of birth
8273-283130-0022	train-other-500	but one who is descended from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors
none	none	 and who acquires our esteem by his connexion with persons whom we esteem His ancestors therefore though dead are respected in some measure on account of their riches and consequently without any kind of expectation 
8273-283130-0023	train-other-500	But not to go so far as prisoners of war or the dead to find instances of this disinterested regard for riches we may only observe with a little attention those phenomena which occur in common life and conversation
8273-283130-0024	train-other-500	A man who is himself we shall suppose of a competent fortune and of no profession being introduced to a company of strangers naturally treats them with different degrees of respect as he is informed of their different fortunes and conditions

none	none	 speak him a man of great or moderate fortune 
8273-283130-0026	train-other-500	In short the different ranks of men are in a great measure regulated by riches
none	none	 and that with regard to superiors as well as inferiors strangers as well as acquaintance 
8273-283130-0027	train-other-500	What remains therefore but to conclude that as riches are desired for ourselves only as the means of gratifying our appetites either at present or in some imaginary future period they beget esteem in others

none	none	 What else do we mean by saying that one is rich 
8273-283130-0032	train-other-500	the other poor And as regard or contempt is the natural consequence of those different situations in life
none	none	 it is easily seen what additional light and evidence this throws on our preceding theory with regard to all moral distinctions Footnote There is something extraordinary and seemingly unaccountable in the operation of our passions when we consider the fortune and situation of others 
8273-283130-0033	train-other-500	Very often another s advancement and prosperity produces envy which has a strong mixture of hatred and arises chiefly from the comparison of ourselves with the person At the very same time
none	none	 or at least in very short intervals we may feel the passion of respect which is a species of affection or good will with a mixture of humility On the other hand the misfortunes of our fellows often cause pity 
8273-283130-0034	train-other-500	which has in it a strong mixture of good will This sentiment of pity is nearly allied to contempt which is a species of dislike with a mixture of pride I only point out these phenomena
8273-283130-0035	train-other-500	as a subject of speculation to such as are curious with regard to moral enquiries It is sufficient for the present purpose to observe in general that power and riches commonly cause respect poverty and meanness contempt

none	none	 and of pity A man who has cured himself of all ridiculous pre possessions and is fully sincerely and steadily convinced from experience as well as philosophy that the difference of fortune makes less difference in happiness than is vulgarly imagined

none	none	 And we accordingly find that each of these forms of government by varying the utility of those customs has commonly a proportionable effect on the sentiments of mankind SECTION VII OF QUALITIES IMMEDIATELY AGREEABLE TO OURSELVES Whoever has passed an evening with serious melancholy people and has observed how suddenly the conversation was animated and what sprightliness diffused itself over the countenance discourse and behaviour of every one on the accession of a good humoured lively companion such a one will easily allow that cheerfulness carries great merit with it and naturally conciliates the good will of mankind No quality indeed more readily communicates itself to all around because no one has a greater propensity to display itself in jovial talk and pleasant entertainment The flame spreads through the whole circle and the most sullen and morose are often caught by it That the melancholy hate the merry even though Horace says it I have some difficulty to allow because I have always observed that where the jollity is moderate and decent serious people are so much the more delighted as it dissipates the gloom with which they are commonly oppressed and gives them an unusual enjoyment From this influence of cheerfulness both to communicate itself and to engage approbation we may perceive that there is another set of mental qualities which without any utility or any tendency to farther good either of the community or of the possessor diffuse a satisfaction on the beholders and procure friendship and regard Their immediate sensation to the person possessed of them is agreeable Others enter into the same humour and catch the sentiment by a contagion or natural sympathy and as we cannot forbear loving whatever pleases a kindly emotion arises towards the person who communicates so much satisfaction He is a more animating spectacle his presence diffuses over us more serene complacency and enjoyment our imagination entering into his feelings and disposition is affected in a more agreeable manner than if a melancholy dejected sullen anxious temper were presented to us Hence the affection and probation which attend the former the aversion and disgust with which we regard the latter Footnote There is no man who on particular occasions is not affected with all the disagreeable passions fear anger dejection grief melancholy anxiety c But these so far as they are natural and universal make no difference between one man and another and can never be the object of blame It is only when the disposition gives a PROPENSITY to any of these disagreeable passions that they disfigure the character and by giving uneasiness convey the sentiment of disapprobation to the spectator Few men would envy the character which Caesar gives of Cassius He loves no play As thou do saint Anthony he hears no music Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort As if he mock d himself and scorn d his spirit That could be mov d to smile at any thing Not only such men as Caesar adds are commonly DANGEROUS but also having little enjoyment within themselves they can never become agreeable to others or contribute to social entertainment In all polite nations and ages a relish for pleasure if accompanied with temperance and decency is esteemed a considerable merit even in the greatest men and becomes still more requisite in those of inferior rank and character It is an agreeable representation which a French writer gives of the situation of his own mind in this particular VIRTUE I LOVE says he WITHOUT AUSTERITY PLEASURE WITHOUT EFFEMINACY AND LIFE

greatness of mind or dignity of character with elevation of sentiment disdain of slavery and with that noble pride and spirit which arises from conscious virtue The sublime says Longinus is often nothing but the echo or image of magnanimity and where this quality appears in any one even though a syllable be not uttered it excites our applause and admiration as may be observed of the famous silence of Ajax in the Odyssey which expresses more noble disdain and resolute indignation than any language can convey Footnote Cap nine WERE I Alexander said Parmenio I WOULD ACCEPT OF THESE OFFERS

soldiers among barbarians not yet fully subdued felt in himself such a dignity and right of empire that he could not believe it possible that any one would refuse to obey him Whether in Europe or in Asia among Greeks or Persians all was indifferent to him wherever he found men he fancied he should find subjects The confident of Medea in the tragedy recommends caution and submission and enumerating all the distresses of that unfortunate heroine asks her what she has to support her against her numerous and implacable enemies MYSELF replies she MYSELF I SAY AND IT IS ENOUGH Boileau justly recommends this passage as an instance of true sublime Footnote Reflexion ten sur Longin When Phocion the modest the gentle Phocion was led to execution he turned to one of his fellow sufferers

from empire prolonging his ignominy from a wretched love of life delivered over to the merciless rabble tossed buffeted and kicked about constrained by their holding a poinard under his chin to raise his head and expose himself to every contumely What abject infamy What low humiliation Yet even here says the historian he discovered some symptoms of a mind not wholly degenerate To a tribune who insulted him he replied I AM STILL YOUR EMPEROR Footnote Tacit hist lib iii The author entering upon the narration says LANIATA VESTE FOEDUM SPECACULUM DUCEBATUR MULTIS INCREPANTIBUS NULLO INLACRIMANTE deformatitas exitus misericordiam abstulerat To enter thoroughly into this method of thinking we must make allowance for the ancient maxims that no one ought to prolong his life after it became dishonourable but as he had always a right to dispose of it it then became a duty to part with it We never excuse the absolute want of spirit and dignity of character or a proper sense of what is due to one s self in society and the common intercourse of life This vice constitutes what we properly call MEANNESS when a man can submit to the basest slavery in order to gain his ends fawn upon those who abuse him and degrade himself by intimacies and familiarities with undeserving inferiors A certain degree of generous pride or self value is so requisite that the absence of it in the mind displeases after the same manner as the want of a nose eye or any of the most material feature of the face or member of the body Footnote The absence of virtue may often be a vice and that of the highest kind as in the instance of ingratitude as well as meanness Where we expect a beauty the disappointment gives an uneasy sensation and produces a real deformity An abjectness of character likewise is disgustful and contemptible in another view Where a man has no sense of value in himself we are not likely to have any higher esteem of him And if the same person who crouches to his superiors is insolent to his inferiors as often happens this contrariety of behaviour instead of correcting the former vice aggravates it extremely by the addition of a vice still more odious See Sect VIII The utility of courage both to the public and to the person possessed of it is an obvious foundation of merit But to any one who duly considers of the matter it will appear that this quality has a peculiar lustre which it derives wholly from itself and from that noble elevation inseparable from it Its figure drawn by painters and by poets displays in each feature a sublimity and daring confidence which catches the eye engages the affections and diffuses by sympathy a like sublimity of sentiment over every spectator Under what shining colours does Demosthenes Footnote De Corona represent Philip where the orator apologizes for his own administration and justifies that pertinacious love of liberty with which he had inspired the Athenians I beheld Philip says he he with whom was your contest resolutely while in pursuit of empire and dominion exposing himself to every wound his eye gored his neck wrested his arm his thigh pierced what ever part of his body fortune should seize on that cheerfully relinquishing provided that with what remained he might live in honour and renown And shall it be said that he born in Pella a place heretofore mean and ignoble should be inspired with so high an ambition and thirst of fame while you Athenians c These praises excite the most lively admiration but the views presented by the orator carry us not we see beyond the hero himself nor ever regard the future advantageous consequences of his valour The material temper of the Romans inflamed by continual wars had raised their esteem of courage so high that in their language it was called VIRTUE by way of excellence and of distinction from all other moral qualities THE Suevi in the opinion of Tacitus tus Footnote De moribus Germ DRESSED THEIR HAIR WITH A LAUDIBLE INTENT NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOVING OR BEING LOVES THEY DORNED THEMSELVES ONLY FOR THEIR ENEMIES AND IN ORDER TO APPEAR MORE TERRIBLE A sentiment of the historian which would sound a little oddly in other nations and other ages The Scythians according to Herodotus Footnote Lib iv after scalping their enemies dressed the skin like leather and used it as a towel and whoever had the most of those towels was most esteemed among them So much had martial bravery in that nation as well as in many others destroyed the sentiments of humanity a virtue surely much more useful and engaging It is indeed observable that among all uncultivated nations who have not as yet had full experience of the advantages attending beneficence justice and the social virtues courage is the predominant excellence what is most celebrated by poets recommended by parents and instructors and admired by the public in general The ethics of Homer are in this particular very different from those of Fenelon his elegant imitator and such as were well suited to an age when one hero as remarked by Thucydides Lib i could ask another without offence whether he were a robber or not Such also very lately was the system of ethics which prevailed in many barbarous parts of Ireland if we may credit Spencer in his judicious account of the state of that kingdom Footnote from Spencer It is a common use says he amongst their gentlemen s sons that as soon as they are able to use their weapons they strait gather to themselves three or four stragglers or kern with whom wandering a while up and down idly the country taking only meat he at last falleth into some bad occasion that shall be offered which being once made known he is thenceforth counted a man of worth in whom there is courage Of the same class of virtues with courage is that undisturbed philosophical tranquillity superior to pain sorrow anxiety and each assault of adverse fortune Conscious of his own virtue say the philosophers the sage elevates himself above every accident of life and securely placed in the temple of wisdom looks down on inferior mortals engaged in pursuit of honours riches reputation and every frivolous enjoyment These pretentious no doubt when stretched to the utmost are by far too magnificent for human nature They carry however a grandeur with them which seizes the spectator and strikes him with admiration And the nearer we can approach in practice to this sublime tranquillity and indifference for we must distinguish it from a stupid insensibility the more secure enjoyment shall we attain within ourselves and the more greatness of mind shall we discover to the world The philosophical tranquillity may indeed be considered only as a branch of magnanimity Who admires not Socrates his perpetual serenity and contentment amidst the greatest poverty and domestic vexations his resolute contempt of riches and his magnanimous care of preserving liberty while he refused all assistance from his friends and disciples and avoided even the dependence of an obligation Epictetus had not so much as a door to his little house or hovel and therefore soon lost his iron lamp the only furniture which he had worth taking But resolving to disappoint all robbers for the future he supplied its place with an earthen lamp of which he very peacefully kept possession ever after Among the ancients the heroes in philosophy as well as those in war and patriotism have a grandeur and force of sentiment which astonishes our narrow souls and is rashly rejected as extravagant and supernatural They in their turn I allow would have had equal reason to consider as romantic and incredible the degree of humanity clemency order tranquillity and other social virtues to which in the administration of government we have attained in modern times had any one been then able to have made a fair representation of them Such is the compensation which nature or rather education has made in the distribution of excellencies and virtues in those different ages The merit of benevolence arising from its utility and its tendency to promote the good of mankind has been already explained and is no doubt the source of a CONSIDERABLE part of that esteem which is so universally paid to it But it will also be allowed that the very softness and tenderness of the sentiment its engaging endearments its fond expressions its delicate attentions and all that flow of mutual confidence and regard which enters into a warm attachment of love and friendship it will be allowed I say that these feelings being delightful in themselves are necessarily communicated to the spectators and melt them into the same fondness and delicacy The tear naturally starts in our eye on the apprehension of a warm sentiment of this nature our breast heaves our heart is agitated and every humane tender principle of our frame is set in motion and gives us the purest and most satisfactory enjoyment When poets form descriptions of Elysian fields where the blessed inhabitants stand in no need of each other s assistance they yet represent them as maintaining a constant intercourse of love and friendship and sooth our fancy with the pleasing image of these soft and gentle passions The idea of tender tranquillity in a pastoral Arcadia is agreeable from a like principle as has been observed above Footnote Sect v Part two Who would live amidst perpetual wrangling and scolding and mutual reproaches The roughness and harshness of these emotions disturb and displease us we suffer by contagion and sympathy nor can we remain indifferent spectators even though certain that no pernicious consequences would ever follow from such angry passions As a certain proof that the whole merit of benevolence is not derived from its usefulness we may observe that in a kind way of blame we say a person is TOO GOOD when he exceeds his part in society and carries his attention for others beyond the proper bounds In like manner we say a man is too HIGH SPIRITED TOO INTREPID TOO INDIFFERENT ABOUT FORTUNE reproaches which really at bottom imply more esteem than many panegyrics Being accustomed to rate the merit and demerit of characters chiefly by their useful or pernicious tendencies we cannot forbear applying the epithet of blame when we discover a sentiment which rises to a degree that is hurtful but it may happen at the same time that its noble elevation or its engaging tenderness so seizes the heart as rather to increase our friendship and concern for the person Footnote Cheerfulness could scarce admit of blame from its excess were it not that dissolute mirth without a proper cause or subject is a sure symptom and characteristic of folly and on that account disgustful The amours and attachments of Harry the IVth of France during the civil wars of the league frequently hurt his interest and his cause but all the young at least and amorous who can sympathize with the tender passions will allow that this very weakness for they will readily call it such chiefly endears that hero and interests them in his fortunes The excessive bravery and resolute inflexibility of Charles the XIIth ruined his own country and infested all his neighbours but have such splendour and greatness in their appearance as strikes us with admiration and they might in some degree be even approved of if they betrayed not sometimes too evident symptoms of madness and disorder The Athenians pretended to the first invention of agriculture and of laws and always valued themselves extremely on the benefit thereby procured to the whole race of mankind They also boasted and with reason of their war like enterprises particularly against those innumerable fleets and armies of Persians which invaded Greece during the reigns of Darius and Xerxes But though there be no comparison in point of utility between these peaceful and military honours yet we find that the orators who have writ such elaborate panegyrics on that famous city have chiefly triumphed in displaying the warlike achievements Lysias Thucydides Plato and Isocrates discover all of them the same partiality which though condemned by calm reason and reflection appears so natural in the mind of man It is observable that the great charm of poetry consists in lively pictures of the sublime passions magnanimity courage disdain of fortune or those of the tender affections love and friendship which warm the heart and diffuse over it similar sentiments and emotions And though all kinds of passion even the most disagreeable such as grief and anger are observed when excited by poetry to convey a satisfaction from a mechanism of nature not easy to be explained Yet those more elevated or softer affections have a peculiar influence and please from more than one cause or principle Not to mention that they alone interest us in the fortune of the persons represented or communicate any esteem and affection for their character And can it possibly be doubted that this talent itself of poets to move the passions this pathetic and sublime of sentiment is a very considerable merit and being enhanced by its extreme rarity may exalt the person possessed of it above every character of the age in which he lives The prudence address steadiness and benign government of Augustus adorned with all the splendour of his noble birth and imperial crown render him but an unequal competitor for fame with Virgil who lays nothing into the opposite scale but the divine beauties of his poetical genius The very sensibility to these beauties or a delicacy of taste is itself a beauty in any character as conveying the purest the most durable and most innocent of all enjoyments These are some instances of the several species of merit that are valued for the immediate pleasure which they communicate to the person possessed of them No views of utility or of future beneficial consequences enter into this sentiment of approbation yet is it of a kind similar to that other sentiment which arises from views of a public or private utility The same social sympathy we may observe or fellow feeling with human happiness or misery gives rise to both and this analogy in all the parts of the present theory may justly be regarded as a confirmation of it SECTION VIII OF QUALITIES IMMEDIATELY AGREEABLE TO OTHERS Footnote It is the nature and indeed the definition of virtue that it is A QUALITY OF THE MIND AGREEABLE TO OR APPROVED OF BY EVERY ONE WHO CONSIDERS OR CONTEMPLATES IT But some qualities produce pleasure because they are useful to society or useful or agreeable to the person himself others produce it more immediately which is the case with the class of virtues here considered AS the mutual shocks in SOCIETY and the oppositions of interest and self love have constrained mankind to establish the laws of JUSTICE in order to preserve the advantages of mutual assistance and protection in like manner the eternal contrarieties in COMPANY of men s pride and self conceit have introduced the rules of Good Manners or Politeness in order to facilitate the intercourse of minds and an undisturbed commerce and conversation Among well bred people a mutual deference is affected contempt of others disguised authority concealed attention given to each in his turn and an easy stream of conversation maintained without vehemence without interruption without eagerness for victory and without any airs of superiority These attentions and regards are immediately AGREEABLE to others abstracted from any consideration of utility or beneficial tendencies they conciliate affection promote esteem and extremely enhance the merit of the person who regulates his behaviour by them Many of the forms of breeding are arbitrary and casual but the thing expressed by them is still the same A Spaniard goes out of his own house before his guest to signify that he leaves him master of all In other countries the landlord walks out last as a common mark of deference and regard But in order to render a man perfect GOOD COMPANY he must have Wit and Ingenuity as well as good manners What wit is it may not be easy to define but it is easy surely to determine that it is a quality immediately AGREEABLE to others and communicating on its first appearance a lively joy and satisfaction to every one who has any comprehension of it The most profound metaphysics indeed might be employed in explaining the various kinds and species of wit and many classes of it which are now received on the sole testimony of taste and sentiment might perhaps be resolved into more general principles But this is sufficient for our present purpose that it does affect taste and sentiment and bestowing an immediate enjoyment is a sure source of approbation and affection In countries where men pass most of their time in conversation and visits and assemblies these COMPANIONABLE qualities so to speak are of high estimation and form a chief part of personal merit In countries where men live a more domestic life and either are employed in business or amuse themselves in a narrower circle of acquaintance the more solid qualities are chiefly regarded Thus I have often observed that among the French the first questions with regard to a stranger are IS HE POLITE HAS HE WIT In our own country the chief praise bestowed is always that of a GOOD NATURED SENSIBLE FELLOW In conversation the lively spirit of dialogue is AGREEABLE even to those who desire not to have any share in the discourse hence the teller of long stories or the pompous declaimer is very little approved of But most men desire likewise their turn in the conversation and regard with a very evil eye that LOQUACITY which deprives them of a right they are naturally so jealous of There is a sort of harmless LIARS frequently to be met with in company who deal much in the marvellous Their usual intention is to please and entertain but as men are most delighted with what they conceive to be truth these people mistake extremely the means of pleasing and incur universal blame Some indulgence however to lying or fiction is given in HUMOROUS stories because it is there really agreeable and entertaining and truth is not of any importance Eloquence genius of all kinds even good sense and sound reasoning when it rises to an eminent degree and is employed upon subjects of any considerable dignity and nice discernment all these endowments seem immediately agreeable and have a merit distinct from their usefulness Rarity likewise which so much enhances the price of every thing must set an additional value on these noble talents of the human mind Modesty may be understood in different senses even abstracted from chastity which has been already treated of It sometimes means that tenderness and nicety of honour that apprehension of blame that dread of intrusion or injury towards others that Pudor which is the proper guardian of every kind of virtue and a sure preservative against vice and corruption But its most usual meaning is when it is opposed to IMPUDENCE and ARROGANCE and expresses a diffidence of our own judgement and a due attention and regard for others In young men chiefly this quality is a sure sign of good sense and is also the certain means of augmenting that endowment by preserving their ears open to instruction and making them still grasp after new attainments But it has a further charm to every spectator by flattering every man s vanity and presenting the appearance of a docile pupil who receives with proper attention and respect every word they utter Men have in general a much greater propensity to overvalue than undervalue themselves notwithstanding the opinion of Aristotle Footnote Ethic ad Nicomachum This makes us more jealous of the excess on the former side and causes us to regard with a peculiar indulgence all tendency to modesty and self diffidence as esteeming the danger less of falling into any vicious extreme of that nature It is thus in countries where men s bodies are apt to exceed in corpulency personal beauty is placed in a much greater degree of slenderness than in countries where that is the most usual defect Being so often struck with instances of one species of deformity men think they can never keep at too great a distance from it and wish always to have a leaning to the opposite side In like manner were the door opened to self praise and were Montaigne s maxim observed that one should say as frankly I HAVE SENSE I HAVE LEARNING I HAVE COURAGE BEAUTY OR WIT as it is sure we often think so were this the case I say every one is sensible that such a flood of impertinence would break in upon us as would render society wholly intolerable For this reason custom has established it as a rule in common societies that men should not indulge themselves in self praise or even speak much of themselves and it is only among intimate friends or people of very manly behaviour that one is allowed to do himself justice Nobody finds fault with Maurice Prince of Orange for his reply to one who asked him whom he esteemed the first general of the age THE MARQUIS OF SPINOLA said he IS THE SECOND Though it is observable that the self praise implied is here better implied than if it had been directly expressed without any cover or disguise He must be a very superficial thinker who imagines that all instances of mutual deference are to be understood in earnest and that a man would be more esteemable for being ignorant of his own merits and accomplishments A small bias towards modesty even in the internal sentiment is favourably regarded especially in young people and a strong bias is required in the outward behaviour but this excludes not a noble pride and spirit which may openly display itself in its full extent when one lies under calumny or oppression of any kind The generous contumacy of Socrates as Cicero calls it has been highly celebrated in all ages and when joined to the usual modesty of his behaviour forms a shining character Iphicrates the Athenian being accused of betraying the interests of his country asked his accuser WOULD YOU says he HAVE ON A LIKE OCCASION BEEN GUILTY OF THAT CRIME BY NO MEANS replied the other AND CAN YOU THEN IMAGINE cried the hero that Iphicrates WOULD BE GUILTY Footnote Quinctil lib v cap twelve In short a generous spirit and self value well founded decently disguised and courageously supported under distress and calumny is a great excellency and seems to derive its merit from the noble elevation of its sentiment or its immediate agreeableness to its possessor In ordinary characters we approve of a bias towards modesty which is a quality immediately agreeable to others the vicious excess of the former virtue namely insolence or haughtiness is immediately disagreeable to others the excess of the latter is so to the possessor Thus are the boundaries of these duties adjusted A desire of fame reputation or a character with others is so far from being blameable that it seems inseparable from virtue genius capacity and a generous or noble disposition An attention even to trivial matters in order to please is also expected and demanded by society and no one is surprised if he find a man in company to observe a greater elegance of dress and more pleasant flow of conversation than when he passes his time at home and with his own family Wherein then consists Vanity which is so justly regarded as a fault or imperfection It seems to consist chiefly in such an intemperate display of our advantages honours and accomplishments in such an importunate and open demand of praise and admiration as is offensive to others and encroaches too far on their secret vanity and ambition It is besides a sure symptom of the want of true dignity and elevation of mind which is so great an ornament in any character For why that impatient desire of applause as if you were not justly entitled to it and might not reasonably expect that it would for ever at tend you Why so anxious to inform us of the great company which you have kept the obliging things which were said to you the honours the distinctions which you met with as if these were not things of course and what we could readily of ourselves have imagined without being told of them Decency or a proper regard to age sex character and station in the world may be ranked among the qualities which are immediately agreeable to others and which by that means acquire praise and approbation An effeminate behaviour in a man a rough manner in a woman these are ugly because unsuitable to each character and different from the qualities which we expect in the sexes It is as if a tragedy abounded in comic beauties or a comedy in tragic The disproportions hurt the eye and convey a disagreeable sentiment to the spectators the source of blame and disapprobation This is that INDECORUM which is explained so much at large by Cicero in his Offices Among the other virtues we may also give Cleanliness a place since it naturally renders us agreeable to others and is no inconsiderable source of love and affection No one will deny that a negligence in this particular is a fault and as faults are nothing but smaller vices and this fault can have no other origin than the uneasy sensation which it excites in others we may in this instance seemingly so trivial clearly discover the origin of moral distinctions about which the learned have involved themselves in such mazes of perplexity and error But besides all the AGREEABLE qualities the origin of whose beauty we can in some degree explain and account for there still remains something mysterious and inexplicable which conveys an immediate satisfaction to the spectator but how or why or for what reason he cannot pretend to determine There is a manner a grace an ease a genteelness an I know not what which some men possess above others which is very different from external beauty and comeliness and which however catches our affection almost as suddenly and powerfully And though this MANNER be chiefly talked of in the passion between the sexes where the concealed magic is easily explained yet surely much of it prevails in all our estimation of characters and forms no inconsiderable part of personal merit This class of accomplishments therefore must be trusted entirely to the blind but sure testimony of taste and sentiment and must be considered as a part of ethics left by nature to baffle all the pride of philosophy and make her sensible of her narrow boundaries and slender acquisitions We approve of another because of his wit politeness modesty decency or any agreeable quality which he possesses although he be not of our acquaintance nor has ever given us any entertainment by means of these accomplishments The idea which we form of their effect on his acquaintance has an agreeable influence on our imagination and gives us the sentiment of approbation This principle enters into all the judgements which we form concerning manners and characters SECTION IX CONCLUSION PART I IT may justly appear surprising that any man in so late an age should find it requisite to prove by elaborate reasoning that Personal Merit consists altogether in the possession of mental qualities USEFUL or AGREEABLE to the PERSON HIMSELF or to OTHERS It might be expected that this principle would have occurred even to the first rude unpractised enquirers concerning morals and been received from its own evidence without any argument or disputation Whatever is valuable in any kind so naturally classes itself under the division of USEFUL or AGREEABLE the UTILE or the DULCE that it is not easy to imagine why we should ever seek further or consider the question as a matter of nice research or inquiry And as every thing useful or agreeable must possess these qualities with regard either to the PERSON HIMSELF or to OTHERS the complete delineation or description of merit seems to be performed as naturally as a shadow is cast by the sun or an image is reflected upon water If the ground on which the shadow is cast be not broken and uneven nor the surface from which the image is reflected disturbed and confused a just figure is immediately presented without any art or attention And it seems a reasonable presumption that systems and hypotheses have perverted our natural understanding when a theory so simple and obvious could so long have escaped the most elaborate examination But however the case may have fared with philosophy in common life these principles are still implicitly maintained nor is any other topic of praise or blame ever recurred to when we employ any panegyric or satire any applause or censure of human action and behaviour If we observe men in every intercourse of business or pleasure in every discourse and conversation we shall find them nowhere except the schools at any loss upon this subject What so natural for instance as the following dialogue You are very happy we shall suppose one to say addressing himself to another that you have given your daughter to Cleanthes He is a man of honour and humanity Every one who has any intercourse with him is sure of FAIR and KIND treatment Footnote Qualities useful to others I congratulate you too says another on the promising expectations of this son in law whose assiduous application to the study of the laws whose quick penetration and early knowledge both of men and business prognosticate the greatest honours and advancement Footnote Qualities useful to the person himself You surprise me replies a third when you talk of Cleanthes as a man of business and application I met him lately in a circle of the gayest company and he was the very life and soul of our conversation so much wit with good manners so much gallantry without affectation so much ingenious knowledge so genteelly delivered I have never before observed in any one Footnote Qualities immediately agreeable to others You would admire him still more says a fourth if you knew him more familiarly That cheerfulness which you might remark in him is not a sudden flash struck out by company it runs through the whole tenor of his life and preserves a perpetual serenity on his countenance and tranquillity in his soul He has met with severe trials misfortunes as well as dangers and by his greatness of mind was still superior to all of them Footnote Qualities immediately agreeable to the person himself The image gentlemen which you have here delineated of Cleanthes cried I is that of accomplished merit Each of you has given a stroke of the pencil to his figure and you have unawares exceeded all the pictures drawn by Gratian or Castiglione A philosopher might select this character as a model of perfect virtue And as every quality which is useful or agreeable to ourselves or others is in common life allowed to be a part of personal merit so no other will ever be received where men judge of things by their natural unprejudiced reason without the delusive glosses of superstition and false religion Celibacy fasting penance mortification self denial humility silence solitude and the whole train of monkish virtues for what reason are they everywhere rejected by men of sense but because they serve to no manner of purpose neither advance a man s fortune in the world nor render him a more valuable member of society neither qualify him for the entertainment of company nor increase his power of self enjoyment We observe on the contrary that they cross all these desirable ends stupify the understanding and harden the heart obscure the fancy and sour the temper We justly therefore transfer them to the opposite column and place them in the catalogue of vices nor has any superstition force sufficient among men of the world to pervert entirely these natural sentiments A gloomy hair brained enthusiast after his death may have a place in the calendar but will scarcely ever be admitted when alive into intimacy and society except by those who are as delirious and dismal as himself It seems a happiness in the present theory that it enters not into that vulgar dispute concerning the DEGREES of benevolence or self love which prevail in human nature a dispute which is never likely to have any issue both because men who have taken part are not easily convinced and because the phenomena which can be produced on either side are so dispersed so uncertain and subject to so many interpretations that it is scarcely possible accurately to compare them or draw from them any determinate inference or conclusion It is sufficient for our present purpose if it be allowed what surely without the greatest absurdity cannot be disputed that there is some benevolence however small infused into our bosom some spark of friendship for human kind some particle of the dove kneaded into our frame along with the elements of the wolf and serpent Let these generous sentiments be supposed ever so weak let them be insufficient to move even a hand or finger of our body they must still direct the determinations of our mind and where everything else is equal produce a cool preference of what is useful and serviceable to mankind above what is pernicious and dangerous A MORAL DISTINCTION therefore immediately arises a general sentiment of blame and approbation a tendency however faint to the objects of the one and a proportionable aversion to those of the other Nor will those reasoners who so earnestly maintain the predominant selfishness of human kind be any wise scandalized at hearing of the weak sentiments of virtue implanted in our nature On the contrary they are found as ready to maintain the one tenet as the other and their spirit of satire for such it appears rather than of corruption naturally gives rise to both opinions which have indeed a great and almost an indissoluble connexion together Avarice ambition vanity and all passions vulgarly though improperly comprised under the denomination of SELF LOVE are here excluded from our theory concerning the origin of morals not because they are too weak but because they have not a proper direction for that purpose The notion of morals implies some sentiment common to all mankind which recommends the same object to general approbation and makes every man or most men agree in the same opinion or decision concerning it It also implies some sentiment so universal and comprehensive as to extend to all mankind and render the actions and conduct even of the persons the most remote an object of applause or censure according as they agree or disagree with that rule of right which is established These two requisite circumstances belong alone to the sentiment of humanity here insisted on The other passions produce in every breast many strong sentiments of desire and aversion affection and hatred but these neither are felt so much in common nor are so comprehensive as to be the foundation of any general system and established theory of blame or approbation When a man denominates another his ENEMY his RIVAL his ANTAGONIST his ADVERSARY he is understood to speak the language of self love and to express sentiments peculiar to himself and arising from his particular circumstances and situation But when he bestows on any man the epithets of VICIOUS or ODIOUS or DEPRAVED he then speaks another language and expresses sentiments in which he expects all his audience are to concur with him He must here therefore depart from his private and particular situation and must choose a point of view common to him with others he must move some universal principle of the human frame and touch a string to which all mankind have an accord and symphony If he mean therefore to express that this man possesses qualities whose tendency is pernicious to society he has chosen this common point of view and has touched the principle of humanity in which every man in some degree concurs While the human heart is compounded of the same elements as at present it will never be wholly indifferent to public good nor entirely unaffected with the tendency of characters and manners And though this affection of humanity may not generally be esteemed so strong as vanity or ambition yet being common to all men it can alone be the foundation of morals or of any general system of blame or praise One man s ambition is not another s ambition nor will the same event or object satisfy both but the humanity of one man is the humanity of every one and the same object touches this passion in all human creatures But the sentiments which arise from humanity are not only the same in all human creatures and produce the same approbation or censure but they also comprehend all human creatures nor is there any one whose conduct or character is not by their means an object to every one of censure or approbation On the contrary those other passions commonly denominated selfish both produce different sentiments in each individual according to his particular situation and also contemplate the greater part of mankind with the utmost indifference and unconcern Whoever has a high regard and esteem for me flatters my vanity whoever expresses contempt mortifies and displeases me but as my name is known but to a small part of mankind there are few who come within the sphere of this passion or excite on its account either my affection or disgust But if you represent a tyrannical insolent or barbarous behaviour in any country or in any age of the world I soon carry my eye to the pernicious tendency of such a conduct and feel the sentiment of repugnance and displeasure towards it No character can be so remote as to be in this light wholly indifferent to me What is beneficial to society or to the person himself must still be preferred And every quality or action of every human being must by this means be ranked under some class or denomination expressive of general censure or applause What more therefore can we ask to distinguish the sentiments dependent on humanity from those connected with any other passion or to satisfy us why the former are the origin of morals not the latter Whatever conduct gains my approbation by touching my humanity procures also the applause of all mankind by affecting the same principle in them but what serves my avarice or ambition pleases these passions in me alone and affects not the avarice and ambition of the rest of mankind There is no circumstance of conduct in any man provided it have a beneficial tendency that is not agreeable to my humanity however remote the person but every man so far removed as neither to cross nor serve my avarice and ambition is regarded as wholly indifferent by those passions The distinction therefore between these species of sentiment being so great and evident language must soon be moulded upon it and must invent a peculiar set of terms in order to express those universal sentiments of censure or approbation which arise from humanity or from views of general usefulness and its contrary Virtue and Vice become then known morals are recognized certain general ideas are framed of human conduct and behaviour such measures are expected from men in such situations This action is determined to be conformable to our abstract rule that other contrary And by such universal principles are the particular sentiments of self love frequently controlled and limited Footnote It seems certain both from reason and experience that a rude untaught savage regulates chiefly his love and hatred by the ideas of private utility and injury and has but faint conceptions of a general rule or system of behaviour The man who stands opposite to him in battle he hates heartedly not only for the present moment which is almost unavoidable but for ever after nor is he satisfied without the most extreme punishment and vengeance But we accustomed to society and to more enlarged reflections consider that this man is serving his own country and community that any man in the same situation would do the same that we ourselves in like circumstances observe a like conduct that in general human society is best supported on such maxims and by these suppositions and views we correct in some measure our ruder and narrower positions And though much of our friendship and enemity be still regulated by private considerations of benefit and harm we pay at least this homage to general rules which we are accustomed to respect that we commonly perver our adversary s conduct by imputing malice or injustice to him in order to give vent to those passions which arise from self love and private interest When the heart is full of rage it never wants pretences of this nature though sometimes as frivolous as those from which Horace being almost crushed by the fall of a tree effects to accuse of parricide the first planter of it From instances of popular tumults seditions factions panics and of all passions which are shared with a multitude we may learn the influence of society in exciting and supporting any emotion while the most ungovernable disorders are raised we find by that means from the slightest and most frivolous occasions Solon was no very cruel though perhaps an unjust legislator who punished neuters in civil wars and few I believe would in such cases incur the penalty were their affection and discourse allowed sufficient to absolve them No selfishness and scarce any philosophy have there force sufficient to support a total coolness and indifference and he must be more or less than man who kindles not in the common blaze What wonder then that moral sentiments are found of such influence in life though springing from principles which may appear at first sight somewhat small and delicate But these principles we must remark are social and universal they form in a manner the PARTY of humankind against vice or disorder its common enemy And as the benevolent concern for others is diffused in a greater or less degree over all men and is the same in all it occurs more frequently in discourse is cherished by society and conversation and the blame and approbation consequent on it are thereby roused from that lethargy into which they are probably lulled in solitary and uncultivated nature Other passions though perhaps originally stronger yet being selfish and private are often overpowered by its force and yield the dominion of our breast to those social and public principles Another spring of our constitution that brings a great addition of force to moral sentiments is the love of fame which rules with such uncontrolled authority in all generous minds and is often the grand object of all their designs and undertakings By our continual and earnest pursuit of a character a name a reputation in the world we bring our own deportment and conduct frequently in review and consider how they appear in the eyes of those who approach and regard us This constant habit of surveying ourselves as it were in reflection keeps alive all the sentiments of right and wrong and begets in noble natures a certain reverence for themselves as well as others which is the surest guardian of every virtue The animal conveniencies and pleasures sink gradually in their value while every inward beauty and moral grace is studiously acquired and the mind is accomplished in every perfection which can adorn or embellish a rational creature Here is the most perfect morality with which we are acquainted here is displayed the force of many sympathies Our moral sentiment is itself a feeling chiefly of that nature and our regard to a character with others seems to arise only from a care of preserving a character with ourselves and in order to attain this end we find it necessary to prop our tottering judgement on the correspondent approbation of mankind But that we may accommodate matters and remove if possible every difficulty let us allow all these reasonings to be false Let us allow that when we resolve the pleasure which arises from views of utility into the sentiments of humanity and sympathy we have embraced a wrong hypothesis Let us confess it necessary to find some other explication of that applause which is paid to objects whether inanimate animate or rational if they have a tendency to promote the welfare and advantage of mankind However difficult it be to conceive that an object is approved of on account of its tendency to a certain end while the end itself is totally indifferent let us swallow this absurdity and consider what are the consequences The preceding delineation or definition of Personal Merit must still retain its evidence and authority it must still be allowed that every quality of the mind which is USEFUL or AGREEABLE to the PERSON HIMSELF or to OTHERS communicates a pleasure to the spectator engages his esteem and is admitted under the honourable denomination of virtue or merit Are not justice fidelity honour veracity allegiance chastity esteemed solely on account of their tendency to promote the good of society Is not that tendency inseparable from humanity benevolence lenity generosity gratitude moderation tenderness friendship and all the other social virtues Can it possibly be doubted that industry discretion frugality secrecy order perseverance forethought judgement and this whole class of virtues and accomplishments of which many pages would not contain the catalogue can it be doubted I say that the tendency of these qualities to promote the interest and happiness of their possessor is the sole foundation of their merit Who can dispute that a mind which supports a perpetual serenity and cheerfulness a noble dignity and undaunted spirit a tender affection and good will to all around as it has more enjoyment within itself is also a more animating and rejoicing spectacle than if dejected with melancholy tormented with anxiety irritated with rage or sunk into the most abject baseness and degeneracy And as to the qualities immediately AGREEABLE to OTHERS they speak sufficiently for themselves and he must be unhappy indeed either in his own temper or in his situation and company who has never perceived the charms of a facetious wit or flowing affability of a delicate modesty or decent genteelness of address and manner I am sensible that nothing can be more unphilosophical than to be positive or dogmatical on any subject and that even if excessive scepticism could be maintained it would not be more destructive to all just reasoning and inquiry I am convinced that where men are the most sure and arrogant they are commonly the most mistaken and have there given reins to passion without that proper deliberation and suspense which can alone secure them from the grossest absurdities Yet I must confess that this enumeration puts the matter in so strong a light that I cannot at PRESENT be more assured of any truth which I learn from reasoning and argument than that personal merit consists entirely in the usefulness or agreeableness of qualities to the person himself possessed of them or to others who have any intercourse with him But when I reflect that though the bulk and figure of the earth have been measured and delineated though the motions of the tides have been accounted for the order and economy of the heavenly bodies subjected to their proper laws and Infinite itself reduced to calculation yet men still dispute concerning the foundation of their moral duties When I reflect on this I say I fall back into diffidence and scepticism and suspect that an hypothesis so obvious had it been a true one would long ere now have been received by the unanimous suffrage and consent of mankind PART II Having explained the moral APPROBATION attending merit or virtue there remains nothing but briefly to consider our interested OBLIGATION to it and to inquire whether every man who has any regard to his own happiness and welfare will not best find his account in the practice of every moral duty If this can be clearly ascertained from the foregoing theory we shall have the satisfaction to reflect that we have advanced principles which not only it is hoped will stand the test of reasoning and inquiry but may contribute to the amendment of men s lives and their improvement in morality and social virtue And though the philosophical truth of any proposition by no means depends on its tendency to promote the interests of society yet a man has but a bad grace who delivers a theory however true which he must confess leads to a practice dangerous and pernicious Why rake into those corners of nature which spread a nuisance all around Why dig up the pestilence from the pit in which it is buried The ingenuity of your researches may be admired but your systems will be detested and mankind will agree if they cannot refute them to sink them at least in eternal silence and oblivion Truths which are pernicious to society if any such there be will yield to errors which are salutary and ADVANTAGEOUS But what philosophical truths can be more advantageous to society than those here delivered which represent virtue in all her genuine and most engaging charms and makes us approach her with ease familiarity and affection The dismal dress falls off with which many divines and some philosophers have covered her and nothing appears but gentleness humanity beneficence affability nay even at proper intervals play frolic and gaiety She talks not of useless austerities and rigours suffering and self denial She declares that her sole purpose is to make her votaries and all mankind during every instant of their existence if possible cheerful and happy nor does she ever willingly part with any pleasure but in hopes of ample compensation in some other period of their lives The sole trouble which she demands is that of just calculation and a steady preference of the greater happiness And if any austere pretenders approach her enemies to joy and pleasure she either rejects them as hypocrites and deceivers or if she admit them in her train they are ranked however among the least favoured of her votaries And indeed to drop all figurative expression what hopes can we ever have of engaging mankind to a practice which we confess full of austerity and rigour Or what theory of morals can ever serve any useful purpose unless it can show by a particular detail that all the duties which it recommends are also the true interest of each individual The peculiar advantage of the foregoing system seems to be that it furnishes proper mediums for that purpose That the virtues which are immediately USEFUL or AGREEABLE to the person possessed of them are desirable in a view to self interest it would surely be superfluous to prove Moralists indeed may spare themselves all the pains which they often take in recommending these duties To what purpose collect arguments to evince that temperance is advantageous and the excesses of pleasure hurtful when it appears that these excesses are only denominated such because they are hurtful and that if the unlimited use of strong liquors for instance no more impaired health or the faculties of mind and body than the use of air or water it would not be a whit more vicious or blameable It seems equally superfluous to prove that the COMPANIONABLE virtues of good manners and wit decency and genteelness are more desirable than the contrary qualities Vanity alone without any other consideration is a sufficient motive to make us wish for the possession of these accomplishments No man was ever willingly deficient in this particular All our failures here proceed from bad education want of capacity or a perverse and unpliable disposition Would you have your company coveted admired followed rather than hated despised avoided Can any one seriously deliberate in the case As no enjoyment is sincere without some reference to company and society so no society can be agreeable or even tolerable where a man feels his presence unwelcome and discovers all around him symptoms of disgust and aversion But why in the greater society or confederacy of mankind should not the case be the same as in particular clubs and companies Why is it more doubtful that the enlarged virtues of humanity generosity beneficence are desirable with a view of happiness and self interest than the limited endowments of ingenuity and politeness Are we apprehensive lest those social affections interfere in a greater and more immediate degree than any other pursuits with private utility and cannot be gratified without some important sacrifice of honour and advantage If so we are but ill instructed in the nature of the human passions and are more influenced by verbal distinctions than by real differences Whatever contradiction may vulgarly be supposed between the SELFISH and SOCIAL sentiments or dispositions they are really no more opposite than selfish and ambitious selfish and revengeful selfish and vain It is requisite that there be an original propensity of some kind in order to be a basis to self love by giving a relish to the objects of its pursuit and none more fit for this purpose than benevolence or humanity The goods of fortune are spent in one gratification or another the miser who accumulates his annual income and lends it out at interest has really spent it in the gratification of his avarice And it would be difficult to show why a man is more a loser by a generous action than by any other method of expense since the utmost which he can attain by the most elaborate selfishness is the indulgence of some affection Now if life without passion must be altogether insipid and tiresome let a man suppose that he has full power of modelling his own disposition and let him deliberate what appetite or desire he would choose for the foundation of his happiness and enjoyment Every affection he would observe when gratified by success gives a satisfaction proportioned to its force and violence but besides this advantage common to all the immediate feeling of benevolence and friendship humanity and kindness is sweet smooth tender and agreeable independent of all fortune and accidents These virtues are besides attended with a pleasing consciousness or remembrance and keep us in humour with ourselves as well as others while we retain the agreeable reflection of having done our part towards mankind and society And though all men show a jealousy of our success in the pursuits of avarice and ambition yet are we almost sure of their good will and good wishes so long as we persevere in the paths of virtue and employ ourselves in the execution of generous plans and purposes What other passion is there where we shall find so many advantages united an agreeable sentiment a pleasing consciousness a good reputation But of these truths we may observe men are of themselves pretty much convinced nor are they deficient in their duty to society because they would not wish to be generous friendly and humane but because they do not feel themselves such Treating vice with the greatest candour and making it all possible concessions we must acknowledge that there is not in any instance the smallest pretext for giving it the preference above virtue with a view of self interest except perhaps in the case of justice where a man taking things in a certain light may often seem to be a loser by his integrity And though it is allowed that without a regard to property no society could subsist yet according to the imperfect way in which human affairs are conducted a sensible knave in particular incidents may think that an act of iniquity or infidelity will make a considerable addition to his fortune without causing any considerable breach in the social union and confederacy That HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY may be a good general rule but is liable to many exceptions and he it may perhaps be thought conducts himself with most wisdom who observes the general rule and takes advantage of all the exceptions I must confess that if a man think that this reasoning much requires an answer it would be a little difficult to find any which will to him appear satisfactory and convincing If his heart rebel not against such pernicious maxims if he feel no reluctance to the thoughts of villainy or baseness he has indeed lost a considerable motive to virtue and we may expect that this practice will be answerable to his speculation But in all ingenuous natures the antipathy to treachery and roguery is too strong to be counter balanced by any views of profit or pecuniary advantage Inward peace of mind consciousness of integrity a satisfactory review of our own conduct these are circumstances very requisite to happiness and will be cherished and cultivated by every honest man who feels the importance of them Such a one has besides the frequent satisfaction of seeing knaves with all their pretended cunning and abilities betrayed by their own maxims and while they purpose to cheat with moderation and secrecy a tempting incident occurs nature is frail and they give into the snare whence they can never extricate themselves without a total loss of reputation and the forfeiture of all future trust and confidence with mankind But were they ever so secret and successful the honest man if he has any tincture of philosophy or even common observation and reflection will discover that they themselves are in the end the greatest dupes and have sacrificed the invaluable enjoyment of a character with themselves at least for the acquisition of worthless toys and gewgaws How little is requisite to supply the necessities of nature And in a view to pleasure what comparison between the unbought satisfaction of conversation society study even health and the common beauties of nature but above all the peaceful reflection on one s own conduct what comparison I say between these and the feverish empty amusements of luxury and expense These natural pleasures indeed are really without price both because they are below all price in their attainment and above it in their enjoyment APPENDIX I CONCERNING MORAL SENTIMENT IF the foregoing hypothesis be received it will now be easy for us to determine the question first started FOOTNOTE Sect one concerning the general principles of morals and though we postponed the decision of that question lest it should then involve us in intricate speculations which are unfit for moral discourses we may resume it at present and examine how far either REASON or SENTIMENT enters into all decisions of praise or censure One principal foundation of moral praise being supposed to lie in the usefulness of any quality or action it is evident that REASON must enter for a considerable share in all decisions of this kind since nothing but that faculty can instruct us in the tendency of qualities and actions and point out their beneficial consequences to society and to their possessor In many cases this is an affair liable to great controversy doubts may arise opposite interests may occur and a preference must be given to one side from very nice views and a small overbalance of utility This is particularly remarkable in questions with regard to justice as is indeed natural to suppose from that species of utility which attends this virtue Footnote See App II Were every single instance of justice like that of benevolence useful to society this would be a more simple state of the case and seldom liable to great controversy But as single instances of justice are often pernicious in their first and immediate tendency and as the advantage to society results only from the observance of the general rule and from the concurrence and combination of several persons in the same equitable conduct the case here becomes more intricate and involved The various circumstances of society the various consequences of any practice the various interests which may be proposed these on many occasions are doubtful and subject to great discussion and inquiry The object of municipal laws is to fix all the questions with regard to justice the debates of civilians the reflections of politicians the precedents of history and public records are all directed to the same purpose And a very accurate REASON or JUDGEMENT is often requisite to give the true determination amidst such intricate doubts arising from obscure or opposite utilities But though reason when fully assisted and improved be sufficient to instruct us in the pernicious or useful tendency of qualities and actions it is not alone sufficient to produce any moral blame or approbation Utility is only a tendency to a certain end and were the end totally indifferent to us we should feel the same indifference towards the means It is requisite a SENTIMENT should here display itself in order to give a preference to the useful above the pernicious tendencies This SENTIMENT can be no other than a feeling for the happiness of mankind and a resentment of their misery since these are the different ends which virtue and vice have a tendency to promote Here therefore REASON instructs us in the several tendencies of actions and HUMANITY makes a distinction in favour of those which are useful and beneficial This partition between the faculties of understanding and sentiment in all moral decisions seems clear from the preceding hypothesis But I shall suppose that hypothesis false it will then be requisite to look out for some other theory that may be satisfactory and I dare venture to affirm that none such will ever be found so long as we suppose reason to be the sole source of morals To prove this it will be proper t o weigh the five following considerations I It is easy for a false hypothesis to maintain some appearance of truth while it keeps wholly in generals makes use of undefined terms and employs comparisons instead of instances This is particularly remarkable in that philosophy which ascribes the discernment of all moral distinctions to reason alone without the concurrence of sentiment It is impossible that in any particular instance this hypothesis can so much as be rendered intelligible whatever specious figure it may make in general declamations and discourses Examine the crime of INGRATITUDE for instance which has place wherever we observe good will expressed and known together with good offices performed on the one side and a return of ill will or indifference with ill offices or neglect on the other anatomize all these circumstances and examine by your reason alone in what consists the demerit or blame You never will come to any issue or conclusion Reason judges either of MATTER OF FACT or of RELATIONS Enquire then first where is that matter of fact which we here call crime point it out determine the time of its existence describe its essence or nature explain the sense or faculty to which it discovers itself It resides in the mind of the person who is ungrateful He must therefore feel it and be conscious of it But nothing is there except the passion of ill will or absolute indifference You cannot say that these of themselves always and in all circumstances are crimes No they are only crimes when directed towards persons who have before expressed and displayed good will towards us Consequently we may infer that the crime of ingratitude is not any particular individual FACT but arises from a complication of circumstances which being presented to the spectator excites the SENTIMENT of blame by the particular structure and fabric of his mind This representation you say is false Crime indeed consists not in a particular FACT of whose reality we are assured by reason but it consists in certain MORAL RELATIONS discovered by reason in the same manner as we discover by reason the truths of geometry or algebra But what are the relations I ask of which you here talk In the case stated above I see first good will and good offices in one person then ill will and ill offices in the other Between these there is a relation of CONTARIETY Does the crime consist in that relation But suppose a person bore me ill will or did me ill offices and I in return were indifferent towards him or did him good offices Here is the same relation of CONTRARIETY and yet my conduct is often highly laudable Twist and turn this matter as much as you will you can never rest the morality on relation but must have recourse to the decisions of sentiment When it is affirmed that two and three are equal to the half of ten this relation of equality I understand perfectly I conceive that if ten be divided into two parts of which one has as many units as the other and if any of these parts be compared to two added to three it will contain as many units as that compound number But when you draw thence a comparison to moral relations I own that I am altogether at a loss to understand you A moral action a crime such as ingratitude is a complicated object Does the morality consist in the relation of its parts to each other How After what manner Specify the relation be more particular and explicit in your propositions and you will easily see their falsehood No say you the morality consists in the relation of actions to the rule of right and they are denominated good or ill according as they agree or disagree with it What then is this rule of right In what does it consist How is it determined By reason you say which examines the moral relations of actions So that moral relations are determined by the comparison of action to a rule And that rule is determined by considering the moral relations of objects Is not this fine reasoning All this is metaphysics you cry That is enough there needs nothing more to give a strong presumption of falsehood Yes reply I here are metaphysics surely but they are all on your side who advance an abstruse hypothesis which can never be made intelligible nor quadrate with any particular instance or illustration The hypothesis which we embrace is plain It maintains that morality is determined by sentiment It defines virtue to be WHATEVER MENTAL ACTION OR QUALITY GIVES TO A SPECTATOR THE PLEASING SENTIMENT OF APPROBATION and vice the contrary We then proceed to examine a plain matter of fact to wit what actions have this influence We consider all the circumstances in which these actions agree and thence endeavour to extract some general observations with regard to these sentiments If you call this metaphysics and find anything abstruse here you need only conclude that your turn of mind is not suited to the moral sciences II When a man at any time deliberates concerning his own conduct as whether he had better in a particular emergence assist a brother or a benefactor he must consider these separate relations with all the circumstances and situations of the persons in order to determine the superior duty and obligation and in order to determine the proportion of lines in any triangle it is necessary to examine the nature of that figure and the relation which its several parts bear to each other But notwithstanding this appearing similarity in the two cases there is at bottom an extreme difference between them A speculative reasoner concerning triangles or circles considers the several known and given relations of the parts of these figures and thence infers some unknown relation which is dependent on the former But in moral deliberations we must be acquainted beforehand with all the objects and all their relations to each other and from a comparison of the whole fix our choice or approbation No new fact to be ascertained no new relation to be discovered All the circumstances of the case are supposed to be laid before us ere we can fix any sentence of blame or approbation If any material circumstance be yet unknown or doubtful we must first employ our inquiry or intellectual faculties to assure us of it and must suspend for a time all moral decision or sentiment While we are ignorant whether a man were aggressor or not how can we determine whether the person who killed him be criminal or innocent But after every circumstance every relation is known the understanding has no further room to operate nor any object on which it could employ itself The approbation or blame which then ensues cannot be the work of the judgement but of the heart and is not a speculative proposition or affirmation but an active feeling or sentiment In the disquisitions of the understanding from known circumstances and relations we infer some new and unknown In moral decisions all the circumstances and relations must be previously known and the mind from the contemplation of the whole feels some new impression of affection or disgust esteem or contempt approbation or blame Hence the great difference between a mistake of FACT and one of RIGHT and hence the reason why the one is commonly criminal and not the other When Oedipus killed Laius he was ignorant of the relation and from circumstances innocent and involuntary formed erroneous opinions concerning the action which he committed But when Nero killed Agrippina all the relations between himself and the person and all the circumstances of the fact were previously known to him but the motive of revenge or fear or interest prevailed in his savage heart over the sentiments of duty and humanity And when we express that detestation against him to which he himself in a little time became insensible it is not that we see any relations of which he was ignorant but that for the rectitude of our disposition we feel sentiments against which he was hardened from flattery and a long perseverance in the most enormous crimes In these sentiments then not in a discovery of relations of any kind do all moral determinations consist Before we can pretend to form any decision of this kind everything must be known and ascertained on the side of the object or action Nothing remains but to feel on our part some sentiment of blame or approbation whence we pronounce the action criminal or virtuous III This doctrine will become still more evident if we compare moral beauty with natural to which in many particulars it bears so near a resemblance It is on the proportion relation and position of parts that all natural beauty depends but it would be absurd thence to infer that the perception of beauty like that of truth in geometrical problems consists wholly in the perception of relations and was performed entirely by the understanding or intellectual faculties In all the sciences our mind from the known relations investigates the unknown But in all decisions of taste or external beauty all the relations are beforehand obvious to the eye and we thence proceed to feel a sentiment of complacency or disgust according to the nature of the object and disposition of our organs Euclid has fully explained all the qualities of the circle but has not in any proposition said a word of its beauty The reason is evident The beauty is not a quality of the circle It lies not in any part of the line whose parts are equally distant from a common centre It is only the effect which that figure produces upon the mind whose peculiar fabric of structure renders it susceptible of such sentiments In vain would you look for it in the circle or seek it either by your senses or by mathematical reasoning in all the properties of that figure Attend to Palladio and Perrault while they explain all the parts and proportions of a pillar They talk of the cornice and frieze and base and entablature and shaft and architrave and give the description and position of each of these members But should you ask the description and position of its beauty they would readily reply that the beauty is not in any of the parts or members of a pillar but results from the whole when that complicated figure is presented to an intelligent mind susceptible to those finer sensations Till such a spectator appear there is nothing but a figure of such particular dimensions and proportions from his sentiments alone arise its elegance and beauty Again attend to Cicero while he paints the crimes of a Verres or a Catiline You must acknowledge that the moral turpitude results in the same manner from the contemplation of the whole when presented to a being whose organs have such a particular structure and formation The orator may paint rage insolence barbarity on the one side meekness suffering sorrow innocence on the other But if you feel no indignation or compassion arise in you from this complication of circumstances you would in vain ask him in what consists the crime or villainy which he so vehemently exclaims against At what time or on what subject it first began to exist And what has a few months afterwards become of it when every disposition and thought of all the actors is totally altered or annihilated No satisfactory answer can be given to any of these questions upon the abstract hypothesis of morals and we must at last acknowledge that the crime or immorality is no particular fact or relation which can be the object of the understanding but arises entirely from the sentiment of disapprobation which by the structure of human nature we unavoidably feel on the apprehension of barbarity or treachery IV Inanimate objects may bear to each other all the same relations which we observe in moral agents though the former can never be the object of love or hatred nor are consequently susceptible of merit or iniquity A young tree which over tops and destroys its parent stands in all the same relations with Nero when he murdered Agrippina and if morality consisted merely in relations would no doubt be equally criminal V It appears evident that the ultimate ends of human actions can never in any case be accounted for by reason but recommend themselves entirely to the sentiments and affections of mankind without any dependance on the intellectual faculties Ask a man WHY HE USES EXERCISE he will answer BECAUSE HE DESIRES TO KEEP HIS HEALTH If you then enquire WHY HE DESIRES HEALTH he will readily reply BECAUSE SICKNESS IS PAINFUL If you push your enquiries farther and desire a reason WHY HE HATES PAIN it is impossible he can ever give any This is an ultimate end and is never referred to any other object Perhaps to your second question WHY HE DESIRES HEALTH he may also reply that IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE EXERCISE OF HIS CALLING If you ask WHY HE IS ANXIOUS ON THAT HEAD he will answer BECAUSE HE DESIRES TO GET MONEY If you demand WHY IT IS THE INSTRUMENT OF PLEASURE says he And beyond this it is an absurdity to ask for a reason It is impossible there can be a progress IN INFINITUM and that one thing can always be a reason why another is desired Something must be desirable on its own account and because of its immediate accord or agreement with human sentiment and affection Now as virtue is an end and is desirable on its own account without fee and reward merely for the immediate satisfaction which it conveys it is requisite that there should be some sentiment which it touches some internal taste or feeling or whatever you may please to call it which distinguishes moral good and evil and which embraces the one and rejects the other Thus the distinct boundaries and offices of REASON and of TASTE are easily ascertained The former conveys the knowledge of truth and falsehood the latter gives the sentiment of beauty and deformity vice and virtue The one discovers objects as they really stand in nature without addition and diminution the other has a productive faculty and gilding or staining all natural objects with the colours borrowed from internal sentiment raises in a manner a new creation Reason being cool and disengaged is no motive to action and directs only the impulse received from appetite or inclination by showing us the means of attaining happiness or avoiding misery Taste as it gives pleasure or pain and thereby constitutes happiness or misery becomes a motive to action and is the first spring or impulse to desire and volition From circumstances and relations known or supposed the former leads us to the discovery of the concealed and unknown after all circumstances and relations are laid before us the latter makes us feel from the whole a new sentiment of blame or approbation The standard of the one being founded on the nature of things is eternal and inflexible even by the will of the Supreme Being the standard of the other arising from the eternal frame and constitution of animals is ultimately derived from that Supreme Will which bestowed on each being its peculiar nature and arranged the several classes and orders of existence APPENDIX II OF SELF LOVE THERE is a principle supposed to prevail among many which is utterly incompatible with all virtue or moral sentiment 
8444-283136-0001	train-other-500	and as it can proceed from nothing but the most depraved disposition so in its turn it tends still further to encourage that depravity This principle is that all
8444-283136-0002	train-other-500	BENEVOLENCE is mere hypocrisy friendship a cheat public spirit a farce fidelity a snare to procure trust and confidence and that while all of us
8444-283136-0003	train-other-500	at bottom pursue only our private interest we wear these fair disguises in order to put others off their guard and expose them the more to our wiles and machinations
8444-283136-0004	train-other-500	What heart one must be possessed of who possesses such principles and who feels no internal sentiment that belies so pernicious a theory it is easy to imagine
8444-283136-0005	train-other-500	and also what degree of affection and benevolence he can bear to a species whom he represents under such odious colours and supposes so little susceptible of gratitude or any return of affection
8444-283136-0006	train-other-500	Or if we should not ascribe these principles wholly to a corrupted heart we must at least account for them from the most careless and precipitate examination
8444-283136-0007	train-other-500	Superficial reasoners indeed observing many false pretences among mankind and feeling perhaps no very strong restraint in their own disposition
8444-283136-0008	train-other-500	might draw a general and a hasty conclusion that all is equally corrupted and that men different from all other animals and indeed from all other species of existence
none	none	 admit of no degrees of good or bad 
8444-283136-0009	train-other-500	but are in every instance the same creatures under different disguises and appearances There is another principle somewhat resembling the former
8444-283136-0010	train-other-500	which has been much insisted on by philosophers and has been the foundation of many a system that whatever affection one may feel or imagine he feels for others no passion is
8444-283136-0011	train-other-500	or can be disinterested that the most generous friendship however sincere is a modification of self love and that even unknown to ourselves
8444-283136-0012	train-other-500	we seek only our own gratification while we appear the most deeply engaged in schemes for the liberty and happiness of mankind By a turn of imagination
8444-283136-0013	train-other-500	by a refinement of reflection by an enthusiasm of passion we seem to take part in the interests of others and imagine ourselves divested of all selfish considerations but
8444-283136-0014	train-other-500	at bottom the most generous patriot and most niggardly miser the bravest hero and most abject coward have in every action an equal regard to their own happiness and welfare
8444-283136-0015	train-other-500	Whoever concludes from the seeming tendency of this opinion that those who make profession of it cannot possibly feel the true sentiments of benevolence
8444-283136-0016	train-other-500	or have any regard for genuine virtue will often find himself in practice very much mistaken Probity and honour were no strangers to Epicurus and his sect
8444-283136-0017	train-other-500	Atticus and Horace seem to have enjoyed from nature and cultivated by reflection as generous and friendly dispositions as any disciple of the austerer schools And among the modern

8444-283136-0018	train-other-500	who maintained the selfish system of morals lived irreproachable lives though the former lay not under any restraint of religion which might supply the defects of his philosophy
8444-283136-0019	train-other-500	An epicurean or a Hobbist readily allows that there is such a thing as a friendship in the world without hypocrisy or disguise though he may attempt

8444-283136-0020	train-other-500	to resolve the elements of this passion if I may so speak into those of another and explain every affection to be self love twisted and moulded by a particular turn of imagination
8444-283136-0021	train-other-500	into a variety of appearances But as the same turn of imagination prevails not in every man nor gives the same direction to the original passion
8444-283136-0022	train-other-500	this is sufficient even according to the selfish system to make the widest difference in human characters and denominate one man virtuous and humane another vicious and meanly interested
8444-283136-0023	train-other-500	I esteem the man whose self love by whatever means is so directed as to give him a concern for others and render him serviceable to society as I hate or despise him
8444-283136-0024	train-other-500	who has no regard to any thing beyond his own gratifications and enjoyments
none	none	 In vain would you suggest that these characters 
8444-283136-0025	train-other-500	though seemingly opposite are at bottom the same and that a very inconsiderable turn of thought forms the whole difference between them Each character
8444-283136-0026	train-other-500	notwithstanding these inconsiderable differences appears to me in practice pretty durable and untransmutable
none	none	 And I find not in this more than in other subjects 
8444-283136-0027	train-other-500	that the natural sentiments arising from the general appearances of things are easily destroyed by subtile reflections concerning the minute origin of these appearances
8444-283136-0028	train-other-500	Does not the lively cheerful colour of a countenance inspire me with complacency and pleasure even though I learn from philosophy that all difference of complexion
8444-283136-0029	train-other-500	arises from the most minute differences of thickness in the most minute parts of the skin
none	none	 by means of which a superficies is qualified 
8444-283136-0030	train-other-500	to reflect one of the original colours of light and absorb the others But though the question concerning the universal or partial selfishness of man be not so material
8444-283136-0031	train-other-500	as is usually imagined to morality and practice it is certainly of consequence in the speculative science of human nature and is a proper object of curiosity and enquiry
8444-283136-0032	train-other-500	It may not therefore be unsuitable in this place to bestow a few reflections upon it Footnote
8444-283136-0033	train-other-500	Benevolence naturally divides into two kinds the GENERAL and the PARTICULAR The first is where we have no friendship or connexion or esteem for the person
8444-283136-0034	train-other-500	but feel only a general sympathy with him or a compassion for his pains and a congratulation with his pleasures The other species of benevolence is founded on an opinion of virtue on services done us
8444-283136-0035	train-other-500	or on some particular connexions Both these sentiments must be allowed real in human nature but whether they will resolve into some nice considerations of self love
8444-283136-0036	train-other-500	is a question more curious than important The former sentiment to wit that of general benevolence or humanity or sympathy
none	none	 we shall have occasion frequently to treat of 
8444-283136-0037	train-other-500	in the course of this inquiry
none	none	 and I assume it as real from 
8444-283136-0038	train-other-500	general experience without any other proof The most obvious objection to the selfish hypothesis is that as it is contrary to common feeling
8444-283136-0039	train-other-500	and our most unprejudiced notions there is required the highest stretch of philosophy to establish so extraordinary a paradox
8444-283136-0040	train-other-500	To the most careless observer there appear to be such dispositions as benevolence and generosity such affections as love friendship compassion gratitude
8444-283136-0041	train-other-500	These sentiments have their causes effects objects and operations marked by common language and observation
8444-283136-0042	train-other-500	and plainly distinguished from those of the selfish passions And as this is the obvious appearance of things it must be admitted till some hypothesis be discovered
8444-283136-0043	train-other-500	which by penetrating deeper into human nature may prove the former affections to be nothing but modifications of the latter
none	none	 All attempts of this kind have hitherto proved fruitless 
8444-283136-0044	train-other-500	and seem to have proceeded entirely from that love of SIMPLICITY
none	none	 which has been the source of much false reasoning in philosophy 
8444-283136-0045	train-other-500	I shall not here enter into any detail on the present subject Many able philosophers have shown the insufficiency of these systems And I shall take for granted what
8444-283136-0046	train-other-500	I believe the smallest reflection will make evident to every impartial enquirer But the nature of the subject furnishes the strongest presumption that no better system will ever
8444-283136-0047	train-other-500	for the future be invented in order to account for the origin of the benevolent from the selfish affections
none	none	 and reduce all the various emotions of the human mind 
8444-283136-0048	train-other-500	to a perfect simplicity The case is not the same in this species of philosophy as in physics Many an hypothesis in nature contrary to first appearances
8444-283136-0049	train-other-500	has been found on more accurate scrutiny solid and satisfactory Instances of this kind are so frequent that a judicious
none	none	 as well as witty philosopher Footnote Mons Fontenelle has ventured to affirm 
8444-283136-0050	train-other-500	if there be more than one way in which any phenomenon may be produced that there is general presumption for its arising from the causes which are the least obvious and familiar
8444-283136-0051	train-other-500	But the presumption always lies on the other side in all enquiries concerning the origin of our passions and of the internal operations of the human mind
8444-283136-0052	train-other-500	The simplest and most obvious cause which can there be assigned for any phenomenon is probably the true one When a philosopher in the explication of his system
8444-283136-0053	train-other-500	is obliged to have recourse to some very intricate and refined reflections and to suppose them essential to the production of any passion or emotion
8444-283136-0054	train-other-500	we have reason to be extremely on our guard against so fallacious an hypothesis The affections are not susceptible of any impression from the refinements of reason or imagination
8444-283136-0055	train-other-500	and it is always found that a vigorous exertion of the latter faculties necessarily from the narrow capacity of the human mind destroys all activity in the former
8444-283136-0056	train-other-500	Our predominant motive or intention is indeed frequently concealed from ourselves when it is mingled and confounded with other motives which the mind
8444-283136-0057	train-other-500	from vanity or self conceit is desirous of supposing more prevalent but there is no instance that a concealment of this nature has ever arisen from the abstruseness
8444-283136-0058	train-other-500	and intricacy of the motive A man that has lost a friend and patron may flatter himself that all his grief arises from generous sentiments without any mixture of narrow
8444-283136-0059	train-other-500	or interested considerations but a man that grieves for a valuable friend who needed his patronage and protection
8444-283136-0060	train-other-500	how can we suppose that his passionate tenderness arises from some metaphysical regards to a self interest
none	none	 which has no foundation or reality 
8444-283136-0061	train-other-500	We may as well imagine that minute wheels and springs like those of a watch give motion to a loaded waggon as account for the origin of passion from such abstruse reflections
8444-283136-0062	train-other-500	Animals are found susceptible of kindness both to their own species and to ours nor is there in this case the least suspicion of disguise or artifice
8444-283136-0063	train-other-500	Shall we account for all THEIR sentiments too from refined deductions of self interest Or if we admit a disinterested benevolence in the inferior species
8444-283136-0064	train-other-500	by what rule of analogy can we refuse it in the superior Love between the sexes begets a complacency and good will

none	none	 is commonly able alone to counter balance the strongest motives of self love 
8444-283136-0066	train-other-500	and has no manner of dependance on that affection What interest can a fond mother have in view who loses her health by assiduous attendance on her sick child
8444-283136-0067	train-other-500	and afterwards languishes and dies of grief when freed by its death from the slavery of that attendance Is gratitude no affection of the human breast
8444-283136-0068	train-other-500	or is that a word merely without any meaning or reality Have we no satisfaction in one man s company above another s and no desire of the welfare of our friend
8444-283136-0069	train-other-500	even though absence or death should prevent us from all participation in it Or what is it commonly that gives us any participation in it even while alive and present
8444-283136-0070	train-other-500	but our affection and regard to him These and a thousand other instances are marks of a general benevolence in human nature where no REAL interest
8444-283136-0071	train-other-500	binds us to the object And how an IMAGINARY interest known and avowed for such can be the origin of any passion or emotion seems difficult to explain
8444-283136-0072	train-other-500	No satisfactory hypothesis of this kind has yet been discovered nor is there the smallest probability that the future industry of men will ever be attended with more favourable success
8444-283136-0073	train-other-500	But farther if we consider rightly of the matter we shall find that the hypothesis which allows of a disinterested benevolence distinct from self love
8444-283136-0074	train-other-500	has really more SIMPLICITY in it and is more conformable to the analogy of nature than that which pretends to resolve all friendship and humanity into this latter principle
none	none	 There are bodily wants or appetites acknowledged by every one 
8444-283136-0075	train-other-500	which necessarily precede all sensual enjoyment and carry us directly to seek possession of the object Thus hunger and thirst have eating and drinking for their end
8444-283136-0076	train-other-500	and from the gratification of these primary appetites arises a pleasure which may become the object of another species of desire or inclination that is secondary and interested
8444-283136-0077	train-other-500	In the same manner there are mental passions by which we are impelled immediately to seek particular objects such as fame or power or vengeance without any regard to interest
8444-283136-0078	train-other-500	and when these objects are attained a pleasing enjoyment ensues as the consequence of our indulged affections Nature must by the internal frame and constitution of the mind
8444-283136-0079	train-other-500	give an original propensity to fame
none	none	 ere we can reap any pleasure from that acquisition 
8444-283136-0080	train-other-500	or pursue it from motives of self love and desire of happiness If I have no vanity I take no delight in praise if I be void of ambition
8444-283136-0081	train-other-500	power gives me no enjoyment if I be not angry the punishment of an adversary is totally indifferent to me In all these cases
none	none	 there is a passion which points immediately to the object 
8444-283136-0082	train-other-500	and constitutes it our good or happiness as there are other secondary passions which afterwards arise and pursue it as a part of our happiness
8444-283136-0083	train-other-500	when once it is constituted such by our original affections Were there no appetite of any kind antecedent to self love
8444-283136-0084	train-other-500	that propensity could scarcely ever exert itself because we should in that case have felt few and slender pains or pleasures
8444-283136-0085	train-other-500	and have little misery or happiness to avoid or to pursue Now where is the difficulty in conceiving that this may likewise be the case with benevolence and friendship
8444-283136-0086	train-other-500	and that from the original frame of our temper we may feel a desire of another s happiness or good which by means of that affection becomes our own good and is afterwards pursued
8444-283136-0087	train-other-500	from the combined motives of benevolence and self enjoyments Who sees not that vengeance from the force alone of passion may be so eagerly pursued
8444-283136-0088	train-other-500	as to make us knowingly neglect every consideration of ease interest or safety
none	none	 and like some vindictive animals infuse our very souls into the wounds we give an enemy Footnote Animasque in vulnere ponunt VIRG Dum alteri noceat sui negligens says Seneca of Anger De Ira I i and what a malignant philosophy must it be that will not allow to humanity and friendship the same privileges which are undisputably granted to the darker passions of enmity and resentment such a philosophy is more like a satyr than a true delineation or description of human nature 
8444-283136-0089	train-other-500	and may be a good foundation for paradoxical wit and raillery
none	none	 but is a very bad one for any serious argument or reasoning APPENDIX III SOME FARTHER CONSIDERATIONS WITH REGARD TO JUSTICE The intention of this Appendix is to give some more particular explication of the origin and nature of Justice and to mark some differences between it and the other virtues The social virtues of humanity and benevolence exert their influence immediately by a direct tendency or instinct which chiefly keeps in view the simple object moving the affections and comprehends not any scheme or system nor the consequences resulting from the concurrence imitation or example of others A parent flies to the relief of his child transported by that natural sympathy which actuates him and which affords no leisure to reflect on the sentiments or conduct of the rest of mankind in like circumstances A generous man cheerfully embraces an opportunity of serving his friend because he then feels himself under the dominion of the beneficent affections nor is he concerned whether any other person in the universe were ever before actuated by such noble motives or will ever afterwards prove their influence In all these cases the social passions have in view a single individual object and pursue the safety or happiness alone of the person loved and esteemed With this they are satisfied in this they acquiesce And as the good resulting from their benign influence is in itself complete and entire it also excites the moral sentiment of approbation without any reflection on farther consequences and without any more enlarged views of the concurrence or imitation of the other members of society On the contrary were the generous friend or disinterested patriot to stand alone in the practice of beneficence this would rather enhance his value in our eyes and join the praise of rarity and novelty to his other more exalted merits The case is not the same with the social virtues of justice and fidelity They are highly useful or indeed absolutely necessary to the well being of mankind but the benefit resulting from them is not the consequence of every individual single act but arises from the whole scheme or system concurred in by the whole or the greater part of the society General peace and order are the attendants of justice or a general abstinence from the possessions of others but a particular regard to the particular right of one individual citizen may frequently considered in itself be productive of pernicious consequences The result of the individual acts is here in many instances directly opposite to that of the whole system of actions and the former may be extremely hurtful while the latter is to the highest degree advantageous Riches inherited from a parent are in a bad man s hand the instrument of mischief The right of succession may in one instance be hurtful Its benefit arises only from the observance of the general rule and it is sufficient if compensation be thereby made for all the ills and inconveniences which flow from particular characters and situations Cyrus young and unexperienced considered only the individual case before him and reflected on a limited fitness and convenience when he assigned the long coat to the tall boy and the short coat to the other of smaller size His governor instructed him better while he pointed out more enlarged views and consequences and informed his pupil of the general inflexible rules necessary to support general peace and order in society The happiness and prosperity of mankind arising from the social virtue of benevolence and its subdivisions may be compared to a wall built by many hands which still rises by each stone that is heaped upon it and receives increase proportional to the diligence and care of each workman The same happiness raised by the social virtue of justice and its subdivisions may be compared to the building of a vault where each individual stone would of itself fall to the ground nor is the whole fabric supported but by the mutual assistance and combination of its corresponding parts All the laws of nature which regulate property as well as all civil laws are general and regard alone some essential circumstances of the case without taking into consideration the characters situations and connexions of the person concerned or any particular consequences which may result from the determination of these laws in any particular case which offers They deprive without scruple a beneficent man of all his possessions if acquired by mistake without a good title in order to bestow them on a selfish miser who has already heaped up immense stores of superfluous riches Public utility requires that property should be regulated by general inflexible rules and though such rules are adopted as best serve the same end of public utility it is impossible for them to prevent all particular hardships or make beneficial consequences result from every individual case It is sufficient if the whole plan or scheme be necessary to the support of civil society and if the balance of good in the main do thereby preponderate much above that of evil Even the general laws of the universe though planned by infinite wisdom cannot exclude all evil or inconvenience in every particular operation It has been asserted by some that justice arises from Human Conventions and proceeds from the voluntary choice consent or combination of mankind If by CONVENTION be here meant a PROMISE which is the most usual sense of the word nothing can be more absurd than this position The observance of promises is itself one of the most considerable parts of justice and we are not surely bound to keep our word because we have given our word to keep it But if by convention be meant a sense of common interest which sense each man feels in his own breast which he remarks in his fellows and which carries him in concurrence with others into a general plan or system of actions which tends to public utility it must be owned that in this sense justice arises from human conventions For if it be allowed what is indeed evident that the particular consequences of a particular act of justice may be hurtful to the public as well as to individuals it follows that every man in embracing that virtue must have an eye to the whole plan or system and must expect the concurrence of his fellows in the same conduct and behaviour Did all his views terminate in the consequences of each act of his own his benevolence and humanity as well as his self love might often prescribe to him measures of conduct very different from those which are agreeable to the strict rules of right and justice Thus two men pull the oars of a boat by common convention for common interest without any promise or contract thus gold and silver are made the measures of exchange thus speech and words and language are fixed by human convention and agreement Whatever is advantageous to two or more persons if all perform their part but what loses all advantage if only one perform can arise from no other principle There would otherwise be no motive for any one of them to enter into that scheme of conduct Footnote This theory concerning the origin of property and consequently of justice is in the main the same with that hinted at and adopted by Grotius Hinc discimus quae fuerit causa ob quam a primaeva communione rerum primo mobilium deinde et immobilinm discessum est nimirum quod cum non contenti homines vesci sponte natis antra habitare corpore aut nudo agere aut corticibus arborum ferarumve pellibus vestito vitae

belli et pacis Lib ii cap two sec two art four and five The word NATURAL is commonly taken in so many senses and is of so loose a signification that it seems vain to dispute whether justice be natural or not If self love if benevolence be natural to man if reason and forethought be also natural then may the same epithet be applied to justice order fidelity property society Men s inclination their necessities lead them to combine their understanding and experience tell them that this combination is impossible where each governs himself by no rule and pays no regard to the possessions of others and from these passions and reflections conjoined as soon as we observe like passions and reflections in others the sentiment of justice throughout all ages has infallibly and certainly had place to some degree or other in every individual of the human species In so sagacious an animal what necessarily arises from the exertion of his intellectual faculties may justly be esteemed natural Footnote Natural may be opposed either to what is UNUSUAL MIRACULOUS or ARTIFICIAL In the two former senses justice and property are undoubtedly natural But as they suppose reason forethought design and a social union and confederacy among men perhaps that epithet cannot strictly in the last sense be applied to them Had men lived without society property had never been known and neither justice nor injustice had ever existed But society among human creatures had been impossible without reason and forethought Inferior animals that unite are guided by instinct which supplies the place for reason But all these disputes are merely verbal Among all civilized nations it has been the constant endeavour to remove everything arbitrary and partial from the decision of property and to fix the sentence of judges by such general views and considerations as may be equal to every member of society For besides that nothing could be more dangerous than to accustom the bench even in the smallest instance to regard private friendship or enmity it is certain that men where they imagine that there was no other reason for the preference of their adversary but personal favour are apt to entertain the strongest ill will against the magistrates and judges When natural reason therefore points out no fixed view of public utility by which a controversy of property can be decided positive laws are often framed to supply its place and direct the procedure of all courts of judicature Where these too fail as often happens precedents are called for and a former decision though given itself without any sufficient reason justly becomes a sufficient reason for a new decision If direct laws and precedents be wanting imperfect and indirect ones are brought in aid and the controverted case is ranged under them by analogical reasonings and comparisons and similitudes and correspondencies which are often more fanciful than real In general it may safely be affirmed that jurisprudence is in this respect different from all the sciences and that in many of its nicer questions there cannot properly be said to be truth or falsehood on either side If one pleader bring the case under any former law or precedent by a refined analogy or comparison the opposite pleader is not at a loss to find an opposite analogy or comparison and the preference given by the judge is often founded more on taste and imagination than on any solid argument Public utility is the general object of all courts of judicature and this utility too requires a stable rule in all controversies but where several rules nearly equal and indifferent present themselves it is a very slight turn of thought which fixes the decision in favour of either party Footnote That there be a separation or distinction of possessions and that this separation be steady and constant this is absolutely required by the interests of society and hence the origin of justice and property What possessions are assigned to particular persons this is generally speaking pretty indifferent and is often determined by very frivolous views and considerations We shall mention a few particulars Were a society formed among several independent members the most obvious rule which could be agreed on would be to annex property to PRESENT possession and leave every one a right to what he at present enjoys The relation of possession which takes place between the person and the object naturally draws on the relation of property For a like reason occupation or first possession becomes the foundation of property Where a man bestows labour and industry upon any object which before belonged to no body as in cutting down and shaping a tree in cultivating a field c the alterations which he produces causes a relation between him and the object and naturally engages us to annex it to him by the new relation of property This cause here concurs with the public utility which consists in the encouragement given to industry and labour Perhaps too private humanity towards the possessor concurs in this instance with the other motives and engages us to leave with him what he has acquired by his sweat and labour and what he has flattered himself in the constant enjoyment of For though private humanity can by no means be the origin of justice since the latter virtue so often contradicts the former yet when the rule of separate and constant possession is once formed by the indispensable necessities of society private humanity and an aversion to the doing a hardship to another may in a particular instance give rise to a particular rule of property I am much inclined to think that the right succession or inheritance much depends on those connexions of the imagination and that the relation to a former proprietor begetting a relation to the object is the cause why the property is transferred to a man after the death of his kinsman It is true industry is more encouraged by the transference of possession to children or near relations but this consideration will only have place in a cultivated society whereas the right of succession is regarded even among the greatest Barbarians Acquisition of property by accession can be explained no way but by having recourse to the relations and connexions of the imaginations The property of rivers by the laws of most nations and by the natural turn of our thoughts is attributed to the proprietors of their banks excepting such vast rivers as the Rhine or the Danube which seem too large to follow as an accession to the property of the neighbouring fields Yet even these rivers are considered as the property of that nation through whose dominions they run the idea of a nation being of a suitable bulk to correspond with them and bear them such a relation in the fancy The accessions which are made to land bordering upon rivers follow the land say the civilians provided it be made by what they call alluvion that is insensibly and imperceptibly which are circumstances that assist the imagination in the conjunction Where there is any considerable portion torn at once from one bank and added to another it becomes not his property whose land it falls on till it unite with the land and till the trees and plants have spread their roots into both Before that the thought does not sufficiently join them In short we must ever distinguish between the necessity of a separation and constancy in men s possession and the rules which assign particular objects to particular persons The first necessity is obvious strong and invincible the latter may depend on a public utility more light and frivolous on the sentiment of private humanity and aversion to private hardship on positive laws on precedents analogies and very fine connexions and turns of the imagination We may just observe before we conclude this subject that after the laws of justice are fixed by views of general utility the injury the hardship the harm which result to any individual from a violation of them enter very much into consideration and are a great source of that universal blame which attends every wrong or iniquity By the laws of society this coat this horse is mine and OUGHT to remain perpetually in my possession I reckon on the secure enjoyment of it by depriving me of it you disappoint my expectations and doubly displease me and offend every bystander It is a public wrong so far as the rules of equity are violated it is a private harm so far as an individual is injured And though the second consideration could have no place were not the former previously established for otherwise the distinction of MINE and THINE would be unknown in society yet there is no question but the regard to general good is much enforced by the respect to particular What injures the community without hurting any individual is often more lightly thought of But where the greatest public wrong is also conjoined with a considerable private one no wonder the highest disapprobation attends so iniquitous a behaviour APPENDIX IV OF SOME VERBAL DISPUTES Nothing is more usual than for philosophers to encroach upon the province of grammarians and to engage in disputes of words while they imagine that they are handling controversies of the deepest importance and concern It was in order to avoid altercations so frivolous and endless that I endeavoured to state with the utmost caution the object of our present enquiry and proposed simply to collect on the one hand a list of those mental qualities which are the object of love or esteem and form a part of personal merit and on the other hand a catalogue of those qualities which are the object of censure or reproach and which detract from the character of the person possessed of them subjoining some reflections concerning the origin of these sentiments of praise or blame On all occasions where there might arise the least hesitation I avoided the terms VIRTUE and VICE because some of those qualities which I classed among the objects of praise receive in the English language the appellation of TALENTS rather than of virtues as some of the blameable or censurable qualities are often called defects rather than vices It may now perhaps be expected that before we conclude this moral enquiry we should exactly separate the one from the other should mark the precise boundaries of virtues and talents vices and defects and should explain the reason and origin of that distinction But in order to excuse myself from this undertaking which would at last prove only a grammatical enquiry I shall subjoin the four following reflections which shall contain all that I intend to say on the present subject 
6620_283138_000002_000000	train-clean-360	First I do not find that in the English or any other modern tongue the boundaries are exactly fixed between virtues and talents vices and defects or that a precise definition can be given of the one as contradistinguished from the other 
none	none	Were we to say for instance that the esteemable qualities alone which are voluntary are entitled to the appellations of virtues we should soon recollect the qualities of courage equanimity patience self command with many others which almost every language classes under this appellation though they depend little or not at all on our choice 
6620_283138_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Should we affirm that the qualities alone which prompt us to act our part in society are entitled to that honourable distinction it must immediately occur that these are indeed the most valuable qualities and are commonly denominated the SOCIAL virtues but that this very epithet supposes that there are also virtues of another species 
none	none	Should we lay hold of the distinction between INTELLECTUAL and MORAL endowments and affirm the last alone to be the real and genuine virtues because they alone lead to action we should find that many of those qualities usually called intellectual virtues such as prudence penetration discernment discretion had also a considerable influence on conduct The distinction between the heart and the head may also be adopted the qualities of the first may be defined such as in their immediate exertion are accompanied with a feeling of sentiment and these alone may be called the genuine virtues but industry frugality temperance secrecy perseverance and many other laudable powers or habits generally stilled virtues are exerted without any immediate sentiment in the person possessed of them and are only known to him by their effects 
6620_283138_000002_000005	train-clean-360	It is fortunate amidst all this seeming perplexity that the question being merely verbal cannot possibly be of any importance 
6620_283138_000002_000006	train-clean-360	A moral philosophical discourse needs not enter into all these caprices of language which are so variable in different dialects and in different ages of the same dialect 
none	none	But on the whole it seems to me that though it is always allowed that there are virtues of many different kinds yet when a man is called virtuous or is denominated a man of virtue we chiefly regard his social qualities which are indeed the most valuable It is at the same time certain that any remarkable defect in courage temperance economy industry understanding dignity of mind would bereave even a very good natured honest man of this honourable appellation Who did ever say except by way of irony that such a one was a man of great virtue but an egregious blockhead But Secondly it is no wonder that languages should not be very precise in marking the boundaries between virtues and talents vices and defects since there is so little distinction made in our internal estimation of them It seems indeed certain that the SENTIMENT of conscious worth the self satisfaction proceeding from a review of a man s own conduct and character it seems certain I say that this sentiment which though the most common of all others has no proper name in our language Footnote The term pride is commonly taken in a bad sense but this sentiment seems indifferent and may be either good or bad according as it is well or ill founded and according to the other circumstances which accompany it The French express this sentiment by the term AMOUR PROPRE but as they also express self love as well as vanity by the same term there arises thence a great confusion in Rochefoucault and many of their moral writers arises from the endowments of courage and capacity industry and ingenuity as well as from any other mental excellencies Who on the other hand is not deeply mortified with reflecting on his own folly and dissoluteness and feels not a secret sting or compunction whenever his memory presents any past occurrence where he behaved with stupidity of ill manners 
6620_283138_000005_000002	train-clean-360	No time can efface the cruel ideas of a man s own foolish conduct or of affronts which cowardice or impudence has brought upon him 
6620_283138_000005_000003	train-clean-360	They still haunt his solitary hours damp his most aspiring thoughts and show him even to himself in the most contemptible and most odious colours imaginable 
none	none	What is there too we are more anxious to conceal from others than such blunders infirmities and meannesses or more dread to have exposed by raillery and satire And is not the chief object of vanity our bravery or learning our wit or breeding our eloquence or address our taste or abilities 
6620_283138_000006_000002	train-clean-360	These we display with care if not with ostentation and we commonly show more ambition of excelling in them than even in the social virtues themselves which are in reality of such superior excellence 
none	none	Good nature and honesty especially the latter are so indispensably required that though the greatest censure attends any violation of these duties no eminent praise follows such common instances of them as seem essential to the support of human society And hence the reason in my opinion why though men often extol so liberally the qualities of their heart they are shy in commending the endowments of their head because the latter virtues being supposed more rare and extraordinary are observed to be the more usual objects of pride and self conceit and when boasted of beget a strong suspicion of these sentiments 
6620_283138_000007_000000	train-clean-360	It is hard to tell whether you hurt a man s character most by calling him a knave or a coward and whether a beastly glutton or drunkard be not as odious and contemptible as a selfish ungenerous miser 
none	none	Give me my choice and I would rather for my own happiness and self enjoyment have a friendly humane heart than possess all the other virtues of Demosthenes and Philip united but I would rather pass with the world for one endowed with extensive genius and intrepid courage and should thence expect stronger instances of general applause and admiration 
6620_283138_000007_000002	train-clean-360	The figure which a man makes in life the reception which he meets with in company the esteem paid him by his acquaintance all these advantages depend as much upon his good sense and judgement as upon any other part of his character 
none	none	Had a man the best intentions in the world and were the farthest removed from all injustice and violence he would never be able to make himself be much regarded without a moderate share at least of parts and understanding 
6620_283138_000008_000000	train-clean-360	What is it then we can here dispute about 
none	none	If sense and courage temperance and industry wisdom and knowledge confessedly form a considerable part of PERSONAL MERIT if a man possessed of these qualities is both better satisfied with himself and better entitled to the good will esteem and services of others than one entirely destitute of them if in short the SENTIMENTS are similar which arise from these endowments and from the social virtues is there any reason for being so extremely scrupulous about a WORD or disputing whether they be entitled to the denomination of virtues It may indeed be pretended that the sentiment of approbation which those accomplishments produce besides its being INFERIOR is also somewhat DIFFERENT from that which attends the virtues of justice and humanity But this seems not a sufficient reason for ranking them entirely under different classes and appellations The character of Caesar and that of Cato as drawn by Sallust are both of them virtuous in the strictest and most limited sense of the word but in a different way nor are the sentiments entirely the same which arise from them 
6620_283138_000008_000004	train-clean-360	The one produces love the other esteem the one is amiable the other awful we should wish to meet the one character in a friend the other we should be ambitious of in ourselves 
none	none	In like manner the approbation which attends temperance or industry or frugality may be somewhat different from that which is paid to the social virtues without making them entirely of a different species And indeed we may observe that these endowments more than the other virtues produce not all of them the same kind of approbation Good sense and genius beget esteem and regard wit and humour excite love and affection Footnote Love and esteem are nearly the same passion and arise from similar causes 
6620_283138_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The qualities which produce both are such as communicate pleasures 
6620_283138_000009_000002	train-clean-360	But where this pleasure is severe and serious or where its object is great and makes a strong impression or where it produces any degree of humility and awe in all these cases the passion which arises from the pleasure is more properly denominated esteem than love 
6620_283138_000009_000003	train-clean-360	Benevolence attends both but is connected with love in a more eminent degree 
none	none	There seems to be still a stronger mixture of pride in contempt than of humility in esteem and the reason would not be difficulty to one who studied accurately the passions All these various mixtures and compositions and appearances of sentiment from a very curious subject of speculation but are wide for our present purpose Throughout this enquiry we always consider in general what qualities are a subject of praise or of censure without entering into all the minute differences of sentiment which they excite It is evident that whatever is contemned is also disliked as well as what is hated and we here endeavour to take objects according to their most simple views and appearances These sciences are but too apt to appear abstract to common readers even with all the precautions which we can take to clear them from superfluous speculations and bring them down to every capacity 
6620_283138_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Most people I believe will naturally without premeditation assent to the definition of the elegant and judicious poet 
6620_283138_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Virtue for mere good nature is a fool Is sense and spirit with humanity 
none	none	Footnote The Art of preserving Health Book four 
6620_283138_000013_000000	train-clean-360	What pretensions has a man to our generous assistance or good offices who has dissipated his wealth in profuse expenses idle vanities chimerical projects dissolute pleasures or extravagant gaming 
6620_283138_000013_000001	train-clean-360	These vices for we scruple not to call them such bring misery unpitied and contempt on every one addicted to them 
6620_283138_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Achaeus a wise and prudent prince fell into a fatal snare which cost him his crown and life after having used every reasonable precaution to guard himself against it 
none	none	On that account says the historian he is a just object of regard and compassion his betrayers alone of hatred and contempt Footnote Polybius lib iii cap two The precipitate flight and improvident negligence of Pompey at the beginning of the civil wars appeared such notorious blunders to Cicero as quite palled his friendship towards that great man 
6620_283138_000015_000001	train-clean-360	In the same manner says he as want of cleanliness decency or discretion in a mistress are found to alienate our affections 
none	none	For so he expresses himself where he talks not in the character of a philosopher but in that of a statesman and man of the world to his friend Atticus Lib ix epist ten But the same Cicero in imitation of all the ancient moralists when he reasons as a philosopher enlarges very much his ideas of virtue and comprehends every laudable quality or endowment of the mind under that honourable appellation This leads to the THIRD reflection which we proposed to make to wit that the ancient moralists the best models made no material distinction among the different species of mental endowments and defects but treated all alike under the appellation of virtues and vices and made them indiscriminately the object of their moral reasonings The prudence explained in Cicero s Offices Footnote Lib i cap six is that sagacity which leads to the discovery of truth and preserves us from error and mistake MAGNANIMITY TEMPERANCE DECENCY are there also at large discoursed of And as that eloquent moralist followed the common received division of the four cardinal virtues our social duties form but one head in the general distribution of his subject Footnote The following passage of Cicero is worth quoting as being the most clear and express to our purpose that any thing can be imagined and in a dispute which is chiefly verbal must on account of the author carry an authority from which there can be no appeal Virtus autem quae est per se ipsa laudabilis et sine qua nihil laudari potest tamen habet plures partes quarum alia est alia ad laudationem aptior Sunt enim aliae virtutes quae videntur in moribus hominum et quadam comitate ac beneficentia positae aliae quae in ingenii aliqua facultate aut animi magnitudine ac robore Nam clementia justitia benignitas fides fortitudo in periculis communibus jucunda est auditu in laudationibus Omnes enim hae virtutes non tam ipsis qui eas in se habent quam generi hominum fructuosae putantur Sapientia et magnitude animi qua omnes res humanae tenues et pro nihilo putantur et in cogitando vis quaedam ingenii et ipsa eloquentia admirationis habet non minus jucunditatis minus Ipsos enim magis videntur quos laudamus quam illos apud quos laudamus ornare ac tueri sed tamen in laudenda jungenda sunt eliam haec genera virtutum Ferunt enim aures bominum cum ilia quae jucunda et grata tum etiam ilia quae mirabilia sunt in virtute laudari De orat lib ii cap eighty four I suppose if Cicero were now alive it would be found difficult to fetter his moral sentiments by narrow systems or persuade him that no qualities were to be admitted as virtues or acknowledged to be a part of PERSONAL MERIT but what were recommended by The Whole Duty of Man 
6620_283138_000019_000000	train-clean-360	We need only peruse the titles of chapters in Aristotle s Ethics to be convinced that he ranks courage temperance magnificence magnanimity modesty prudence and a manly openness among the virtues as well as justice and friendship 
none	none	To SUSTAIN and to ABSTAIN that is to be patient and continent appeared to some of the ancients a summary comprehension of all morals 
6620_283138_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Epictetus has scarcely ever mentioned the sentiment of humanity and compassion but in order to put his disciples on their guard against it The virtue of the Stoics seems to consist chiefly in a firm temper and a sound understanding 
none	none	With them as with Solomon and the eastern moralists folly and wisdom are equivalent to vice and virtue Men will praise thee says David Footnote Psalm forty ninth when thou dost well unto thyself I hate a wise man says the Greek poet who is not wise to himself Footnote Here Hume quotes Euripedes in Greek Plutarch is no more cramped by systems in his philosophy than in his history 
6620_283138_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Where he compares the great men of Greece and Rome he fairly sets in opposition all their blemishes and accomplishments of whatever kind and omits nothing considerable which can either depress or exalt their characters 
none	none	His moral discourses contain the same free and natural censure of men and manners The character of Hannibal as drawn by Livy Footnote Lib xxi cap four is esteemed partial but allows him many eminent virtues Never was there a genius says the historian more equally fitted for those opposite offices of commanding and obeying and it were therefore difficult to determine whether he rendered himself DEARER to the general or to the army 
6620_283138_000023_000003	train-clean-360	To none would Hasdrubal entrust more willingly the conduct of any dangerous enterprize under none did the soldiers discover more courage and confidence 
6620_283138_000023_000004	train-clean-360	Great boldness in facing danger great prudence in the midst of it 
6620_283138_000023_000005	train-clean-360	No labour could fatigue his body or subdue his mind 
6620_283138_000023_000006	train-clean-360	Cold and heat were indifferent to him meat and drink he sought as supplies to the necessities of nature not as gratifications of his voluptuous appetites 
6620_283138_000023_000007	train-clean-360	Waking or rest he used indiscriminately by night or by day These great Virtues were balanced by great Vices inhuman cruelty perfidy more than punic no truth no faith no regard to oaths promises or religion 
none	none	The character of Alexander the Sixth to be found in Guicciardin Footnote Lib i is pretty similar but juster and is a proof that even the moderns where they speak naturally hold the same language with the ancients 
6620_283138_000024_000001	train-clean-360	In this pope says he there was a singular capacity and judgement admirable prudence a wonderful talent of persuasion and in all momentous enterprizes a diligence and dexterity incredible 
6620_283138_000024_000002	train-clean-360	But these VIRTUES were infinitely overbalanced by his VICES no faith no religion insatiable avarice exorbitant ambition and a more than barbarous cruelty 
none	none	Polybius Footnote Lib xii reprehending Timaeus for his partiality against Agathocles whom he himself allows to be the most cruel and impious of all tyrants says if he took refuge in Syracuse as asserted by that historian flying the dirt and smoke and toil of his former profession of a potter and if proceeding from such slender beginnings he became master in a little time of all Sicily brought the Carthaginian state into the utmost danger and at last died in old age and in possession of sovereign dignity must he not be allowed something prodigious and extraordinary and to have possessed great talents and capacity for business and action His historian therefore ought not to have alone related what tended to his reproach and infamy but also what might redound to his Praise and Honour In general we may observe that the distinction of voluntary or involuntary was little regarded by the ancients in their moral reasonings where they frequently treated the question as very doubtful WHETHER VIRTUE COULD BE TAUGHT OR NOT Vid Plato in Menone Seneca de otio sap cap thirty one So also Horace Virtutem doctrina paret naturane donet Epist lib I ep eighteen Aeschines Socraticus Dial I 
6620_283138_000026_000007	train-clean-360	They justly considered that cowardice meanness levity anxiety impatience folly and many other qualities of the mind might appear ridiculous and deformed contemptible and odious though independent of the will 
6620_283138_000026_000008	train-clean-360	Nor could it be supposed at all times in every man s power to attain every kind of mental more than of exterior beauty 
none	none	And here there occurs the FOURTH reflection which I purposed to make in suggesting the reason why modern philosophers have often followed a course in their moral enquiries so different from that of the ancients In later times philosophy of all kinds especially ethics have been more closely united with theology than ever they were observed to be among the heathens and as this latter science admits of no terms of composition but bends every branch of knowledge to its own purpose without much regard to the phenomena of nature or to the unbiassed sentiments of the mind hence reasoning and even language have been warped from their natural course and distinctions have been endeavoured to be established where the difference of the objects was in a manner imperceptible Philosophers or rather divines under that disguise treating all morals as on a like footing with civil laws guarded by the sanctions of reward and punishment were necessarily led to render this circumstance of VOLUNTARY or INVOLUNTARY the foundation of their whole theory 
6620_283138_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Every one may employ TERMS in what sense he pleases but this in the mean time must be allowed that SENTIMENTS are every day experienced of blame and praise which have objects beyond the dominion of the will or choice and of which it behoves us if not as moralists as speculative philosophers at least to give some satisfactory theory and explication 
none	none	A blemish a fault a vice a crime these expressions seem to denote different degrees of censure and disapprobation which are however all of them at the bottom pretty nearly all the same kind of species 
6620_283138_000028_000001	train-clean-360	The explication of one will easily lead us into a just conception of the others and it is of greater consequence to attend to things than to verbal appellations 
6620_283138_000028_000002	train-clean-360	That we owe a duty to ourselves is confessed even in the most vulgar system of morals and it must be of consequence to examine that duty in order to see whether it bears any affinity to that which we owe to society 
none	none	It is probable that the approbation attending the observance of both is of a similar nature and arises from similar principles whatever appellation we may give to either of these excellencies End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals by David Hume END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRINCIPLES OF MORALS This file should be named four
