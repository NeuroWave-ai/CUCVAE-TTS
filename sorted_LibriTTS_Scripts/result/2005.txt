none	none	the Sabbath calm which was upon the house had not communicated itself to him There was a look of exasperation on his usually patient face and a muttered oath picked up no doubt on the godless Stock Exchange escaped his lips Darn it He was afflicted by a sense of the pathos of his position It was not as if he demanded much from life He asked but little here below At that moment all that he wanted was a quiet spot where he might read his Sunday paper in solitary peace and he could not find one Intruders lurked behind every door The place was congested This sort of thing had been growing worse and worse ever since his marriage two years previously There was a strong literary virus in missus Pett s system She not only wrote voluminously herself the name Nesta Ford Pett is familiar to all lovers of sensational fiction but aimed at maintaining a salon Starting in pursuance of this aim with a single specimen her nephew Willie Partridge who was working on a new explosive which would eventually revolutionise war she had gradually added to her collections until now she gave shelter beneath her terra cotta roof to no fewer than six young and unrecognised geniuses Six brilliant youths mostly novelists who had not yet started and poets who were about to begin cluttered up mister Pett s rooms on this fair June morning while he clutching his Sunday paper wandered about finding like the dove in Genesis no rest It was at such times that he was almost inclined to envy his wife s first husband a business friend of his named Elmer Ford who had perished suddenly of an apoplectic seizure and the pity which he generally felt for the deceased tended to shift its focus Marriage had certainly complicated life for mister Pett as it frequently does for the man who waits fifty years before trying it In addition to the geniuses missus Pett had brought with her to her new home her only son Ogden a fourteen year old boy of a singularly unloveable type Years of grown up society and the absence of anything approaching discipline had given him a precocity on which the earnest efforts of a series of private tutors had expended themselves in vain They came full of optimism and self confidence to retire after a brief interval shattered by the boy s stodgy resistance to education in any form or shape To mister Pett

none	none	another man would have handled this situation The ridiculous inconsistency of the human character infuriated him Why should he be a totally different man on Riverside Drive from the person he was in Pine Street Why should he be able to hold his own in Pine Street with grown men whiskered square jawed financiers and yet be unable on Riverside Drive to eject a fourteen year old boy from an easy chair It seemed to him sometimes that a curious paralysis of the will came over him out of business hours Meanwhile he had still to find a place where he could read his Sunday paper He stood for a while in thought Then his brow cleared and he began to mount the stairs Reaching the top floor he walked along the passage and knocked on a door at the end of it From behind this door as from behind those below sounds proceeded but this time they did not seem to discourage mister Pett It was the tapping of a typewriter that he heard and he listened to it with an air of benevolent approval He loved to hear the sound of a typewriter it made home so like the office Come in called a girl s voice The room in which mister Pett found himself was small but cosy and its cosiness oddly considering the sex of its owner had that peculiar quality which belongs as a rule to the dens of men A large bookcase almost covered one side of it its reds and blues and browns smiling cheerfully at whoever entered The walls were hung with prints judiciously chosen and arranged Through a window to the left healthfully open at the bottom the sun streamed in bringing with it the pleasantly subdued whirring of automobiles out on the Drive At a desk at right angles to this window her vivid red gold hair rippling in the breeze from the river sat the girl who had been working at the typewriter She turned as mister Pett entered and smiled over her shoulder Ann Chester mister Pett s niece looked her best when she smiled Although her hair was the most obviously striking feature of her appearance her mouth was really the most individual thing about her It was a mouth that suggested adventurous possibilities In repose it had a look of having just finished saying something humorous a kind of demure appreciation of itself When it smiled a row of white teeth flashed out or if the lips did not part a dimple appeared on the right cheek giving the whole face an air of mischievous geniality It was an enterpri

none	none	but I know he had been I don t know what to do with that boy It s no good my talking to him He he patronises me concluded mister Pett indignantly Sits there on his shoulder blades with his feet on the table and talks to me with his mouth full of candy as if I were his grandson Little brute Ann was sorry for mister Pett For many years now ever since the death of her mother they had been inseparable Her father who was a traveller explorer big game hunter and general sojourner in the lonelier and wilder spots of the world and paid only infrequent visits to New York had left her almost entirely in mister Pett s care and all her pleasantest memories were associated with him mister Chester s was in many ways an admirable character but not a domestic one and his relations with his daughter were confined for the most part to letters and presents In the past few years she had come almost to regard mister Pett in the light of a father Hers was a nature swiftly responsive to kindness and because mister Pett besides being kind was also pathetic she pitied as well as loved him There was a lingering boyishness in the financier the boyishness of the boy who muddles along in an unsympathetic world and can never do anything right and this quality called aloud to the youth in her She was at the valiant age when we burn to right wrongs and succour the oppressed and wild rebel schemes for the reformation of her small world came readily to her From the first she had been a smouldering spectator of the trials of her uncle s married life and if mister Pett had ever asked her advice and bound himself to act on it he would have solved his domestic troubles in explosive fashion For Ann in her moments of maiden meditation had frequently devised schemes to that end which would have made his grey hair stand erect with horror I ve seen a good many boys she said but Ogden is in a class by himself He ought to be sent to a strict boarding school of course He ought to be sent to Sing Sing amended mister Pett Why don t you send him to school Your aunt wouldn t hear of it She s afraid of his being kidnapped It happened last time he went to school You can t blame her for wanting to keep her eye on him after that Ann ran her fingers meditatively over the keys I ve sometimes thought Yes

none	none	nothing I must get on with this thing for aunt Nesta mister Pett placed the bulk of the Sunday paper on the floor beside him and began to run an appreciative eye over the comic supplement That lingering boyishness in him which endeared him to Ann always led him to open his Sabbath reading in this fashion Grey headed though he was he still retained both in art and in real life a taste for the slapstick No one had ever known the pure pleasure it had given him when Raymond Green his wife s novelist protege had tripped over a loose stair rod one morning and fallen an entire flight From some point farther down the corridor came a muffled thudding Ann stopped her work to listen There s Jerry Mitchell punching the bag Eh said mister Pett I only said I could hear Jerry Mitchell in the gymnasium Yes he s there Ann looked out of the window thoughtfully for a moment Then she swung round in her swivel chair Uncle Peter mister Pett emerged slowly from the comic supplement Eh Did Jerry Mitchell ever tell you about that friend of his who keeps a dogs hospital down on Long Island somewhere I forget his name Smithers or Smethurst or something People old ladies you know and people bring him their dogs to be cured when they get sick He has an infallible remedy Jerry tells me He makes a lot of money at it Money Pett the student became Pett the financier at the magic word There might be something in that if one got behind it Dogs are fashionable There would be a market for a really good medicine I m afraid you couldn t put mister Smethurst s remedy on the market It only works when the dog has been overeating himself and not taking any exercise Well that s all these fancy dogs ever have the matter with them It looks to me as if I might do business with this man I ll get his address from Mitchell It s no use thinking of it uncle Peter You couldn t do business with him in that way All mister Smethurst does when any one brings him a fat unhealthy dog is to feed it next to nothing just the simplest kind of food you know and make it run about a lot And in about a week the dog s as well and happy and nice as he can possibly be Oh said mister Pett disappointed Ann touched the keys of her machine softly Why I mentioned mister Smethurst she said it was because we had been talking of Ogden Don t you think his treatment would be just what Ogden needs mister Pett s eyes gleamed It s a shame he can t have a week or two of it Ann played a little tune with her finger tips on the desk It would do him good wouldn t it Silence fell upon the room broken only by the tapping of the typewriter mister Pett having finished the comic supplement turned to the sporting section for he was a baseball fan of no lukewarm order The claims of business did not permit him to see as many games as he could wish but he followed the national pastime closely on the printed page and had an admiration for the Napoleonic gifts of mister McGraw which would have gratified that gentleman had he known of it Uncle Peter said Ann turning round again Eh It s funny you should have been talking about Ogden getting kidnapped This story of aunt Nesta s is all about an angel child I suppose it s meant to be Ogden being stolen and hidden and all that It s odd that she should write stories like this You wouldn t expect it of her Your aunt said mister Pett lets her mind run on that sort of thing a good deal She tells me there was a time not so long ago when half the kidnappers in America were after him She sent him to school in England or rather her husband did They were separated then and as far as I can follow the story they all took the next boat and besieged the place It s a pity somebody doesn t smuggle him away now and keep him till he s a better boy Ah said mister Pett wistfully Ann looked at him fixedly but his eyes were once more on his paper She gave a little sigh and turned to her work again It s quite demoralising typing aunt Nesta s stories she said They put ideas into one s head mister Pett said nothing He was reading an article of medical interest in the magazine section for he was a man who ploughed steadily through his Sunday paper omitting nothing The typewriter began tapping again Great Godfrey Ann swung round and gazed at her uncle in concern He was staring blankly at the paper What s the matter The page on which mister Pett s attention was concentrated was decorated with a fanciful picture in bold lines of a young man in evening dress pursuing a young woman similarly clad along what appeared to be a restaurant supper table An enjoyable time was apparently being had by both Across the page this legend ran PICCADILLY JIM ONCE MORE The Recent Adventures of Young mister Crocker of New York and London It was not upon the title however nor upon the illustration that mister Pett s fascinated eye rested What he was looking at was a small reproduction of a photograph which had been inserted in the body of the article It was the photograph of a woman in the early forties rather formidably handsome beneath which were printed the words missus Nesta Ford Pett Well Known Society Leader and Authoress Ann had risen and was peering over his shoulder She frowned as she caught sight of the heading of the page Then her eye fell upon the photograph Good gracious Why have they got aunt Nesta s picture there mister Pett breathed a deep and gloomy breath They ve found out she s his aunt I was afraid they would I don t know what she will say when she sees this Don t let her see it She has the paper downstairs She s probably reading it now Ann was glancing through the article It seems to be much the same sort of thing that they have published before I can t understand why the Chronicle takes such an interest in Jimmy Crocker Well you see he used to be a newspaper man and the Chronicle was the paper he worked for Ann flushed I know she said shortly Something in her tone arrested mister Pett s attention Yes yes of course he said hastily I was forgetting There was an awkward silence mister Pett coughed The matter of young mister Crocker s erstwhile connection with the New York Chronicle was one which they had tacitly decided to refrain from mentioning I didn t know he was your nephew uncle Peter Nephew by marriage corrected mister Pett a little hurriedly Nesta s sister Eugenia married his father I suppose that makes me a sort of cousin A distant cousin It can t be too distant for me There was a sound of hurried footsteps outside the door missus Pett entered holding a paper in her hand She waved it before mister Pett s sympathetic face I know my dear he said backing Ann and I were just talking about it The little photograph had not done missus Pett justice Seen life size she was both handsomer and more formidable than she appeared in reproduction She was a large woman with a fine figure and bold and compelling eyes and her personality crashed disturbingly into the quiet atmosphere of the room She was the type of woman whom small diffident men seem to marry instinctively as unable to help themselves as cockleshell boats sucked into a maelstrom What are you going to do about it she demanded sinking heavily into the chair which her husband had vacated This was an aspect of the matter which had not occurred to mister Pett He had not contemplated the possibility of actually doing anything Nature had made him out of office hours essentially a passive organism and it was his tendency when he found himself in a sea of troubles to float plaintively not to take arms against it To pick up the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and fling them back was not a habit of his He scratched his chin and said nothing He went on saying nothing If Eugenia had had any sense she would have foreseen what would happen if she took the boy away from New York where he was working too hard to get into mischief and let him run loose in London with too much money and nothing to do But if she had had any sense she would never have married that impossible Crocker man As I told her missus Pett paused and her eyes glowed with reminiscent fire She was recalling the scene which had taken place three years ago between her sister and herself when Eugenia had told her of her intention to marry an obscure and middle aged actor named Bingley Crocker missus Pett had never seen Bingley Crocker but she had condemned the proposed match in terms which had ended definitely and forever her relations with her sister Eugenia was not a woman who welcomed criticism of her actions She was cast in the same formidable mould as missus Pett and resembled her strikingly both in appearance and character missus Pett returned to the present The past could look after itself The present demanded surgery One would have thought it would have been obvious even to Eugenia that a boy of twenty one needed regular work mister Pett was glad to come out of his shell here He was the Apostle of Work and this sentiment pleased him That s right he said Every boy ought to have work Look at this young Crocker s record since he went to live in London He is always doing something to make himself notorious There was that breach of promise case and that fight at the political meeting and his escapades at Monte Carlo and and everything And he must be drinking himself to death I think Eugenia s insane She seems to have no influence over him at all mister Pett moaned sympathetically And now the papers have found out that I am his aunt and I suppose they will print my photograph whenever they publish an article about him She ceased and sat rigid with just wrath mister Pett who always felt his responsibilities as chorus keenly during these wifely monologues surmised that a remark from him was indicated It s tough he said missus Pett turned on him like a wounded tigress What is the use of saying that It s no use saying anything No no said mister Pett prudently refraining from pointing out that she had already said a good deal You must do something Ann entered the conversation for the first time She was not very fond of her aunt and liked her least when she was bullying mister Pett There was something in missus Pett s character with which the imperiousness which lay beneath Ann s cheerful attitude towards the world was ever at war What can uncle Peter possibly do she inquired Why get the boy back to America and make him work It s the only possible thing But is it possible Of course it is Assuming that Jimmy Crocker would accept an invitation to come over to America what sort of work could he do here He couldn t get his place on the Chronicle back again after dropping out for all these years and making a public pest of himself all that while And outside of newspaper work what is he fit for My dear child don t make difficulties I m not These are ready made mister Pett interposed He was always nervously apprehensive of a clash between these two Ann had red hair and the nature which generally goes with red hair She was impulsive and quick of tongue and as he remembered her father had always been a little too ready for combat She was usually as quickly remorseful as she was quickly pugnacious like most persons of her colour Her offer to type the story which now lay on her desk had been the amende honourable following on just such a scene with her aunt as this promised to be mister Pett had no wish to see the truce thus consummated broken almost before it had had time to operate I could give the boy a job in my office he suggested Giving young men jobs in his office was what mister Pett liked doing best There were six brilliant youths living in his house and bursting with his food at that very moment whom he would have been delighted to start addressing envelopes down town Notably his wife s nephew Willie Partridge whom he looked on as a specious loafer He had a stubborn disbelief in the explosive that was to revolutionise war He knew as all the world did that Willie s late father had been a great inventor but he did not accept the fact that Willie had inherited the dead man s genius He regarded the experiments on Partridgite as it was to be called with the profoundest scepticism and considered that the only thing Willie had ever invented or was likely to invent was a series of ingenious schemes for living in fatted idleness on other people s money

none	none	said missus Pett delighted at the suggestion The very thing Will you write and suggest it said mister Pett basking in the sunshine of unwonted commendation What would be the use of writing Eugenia would pay no attention Besides I could not say all I wished to in a letter No the only thing is to go over to England and see her I shall speak very plainly to her I shall point out what an advantage it will be to the boy to be in your office and to live here Ann started You don t mean live here in this house Of course There would be no sense in bringing the boy all the way over from England if he was to be allowed to run loose when he got here mister Pett coughed deprecatingly I don t think that would be very pleasant for Ann dear Why in the name of goodness should Ann object Ann moved towards the door Thank you for thinking of it uncle Peter You re always a dear But don t worry about me Do just as you want to In any case I m quite certain that you won t be able to get him to come over here You can see by the paper he s having far too good a time in London You can call Jimmy Crockers from the vasty deep but will they come when you call for them missus Pett looked at the door as it closed behind her then at her husband What do you mean Peter about Ann Why wouldn t it be pleasant for her if this Crocker boy came to live with us mister Pett hesitated Well it s like this Nesta I hope you won t tell her I told you She s sensitive about it poor girl It all happened before you and I were married Ann was much younger then You know what schoolgirls are kind of foolish and sentimental It was my fault really I ought to have Good Heavens Peter What are you trying to tell me She was only a child missus Pett rose in slow horror Peter Tell me Don t try to break it gently Ann wrote a book of poetry and I had it published for her missus Pett sank back in her chair Oh she said it would have been hard to say whether with relief or disappointment Whatever did you make such a fuss for Why did you want to be so mysterious It was all my fault really proceeded mister Pett I ought to have known better All I thought of at the time was that it would please the child to see the poems in print and be able to give the book to her friends She did give it to her friends he went on ruefully and ever since she s been trying to live it down I ve seen her bite a young fellow s head off when he tried to make a grand stand play with her by quoting her poems which he d found in his sister s book shelf But in the name of goodness what has all this to do with young Crocker Why it was this way Most of the papers just gave Ann s book a mention among Volumes Received or a couple of lines that didn t amount to anything but the Chronicle saw a Sunday feature in it as Ann was going about a lot then and was a well known society girl They sent this Crocker boy to get an interview from her all about her methods of work and inspirations and what not We never suspected it wasn t the straight goods Why that very evening I mailed an order for a hundred copies to be sent to me when the thing appeared And pinkness came upon mister Pett at the recollection it was just a josh from start to finish The young hound made a joke of the poems and what Ann had told him about her inspirations and quoted bits of the poems just to kid the life out of them I thought Ann would never get over it Well it doesn t worry her any more she s grown out of the school girl stage but you can bet she isn t going to get up and give three cheers and a tiger if you bring young Crocker to live in the same house Utterly ridiculous said missus Pett I certainly do not intend to alter my plans because of a trivial incident that happened years ago We will sail on Wednesday Very well my dear said mister Pett resignedly Just as you say Er just you and I And Ogden of course mister Pett controlled a facial spasm with a powerful effort of the will He had feared this I wouldn t dream of leaving him here while I went away after what happened when poor dear Elmer sent him to school in England that time The late mister Ford had spent most of his married life either quarrelling with or separated from his wife but since death he had been canonised as poor dear Elmer Besides the sea voyage will do the poor darling good He has not been looking at all well lately If Ogden s coming I d like to take Ann Why She can he sought for a euphemism Keep in order was the expression he wished to avoid To his mind Ann was the only known antidote for Ogden but he felt it would be impolitic to say so look after him on the boat he concluded You know you are a bad sailor Very well Bring Ann Oh Peter that reminds me of what I wanted to say to you which this dreadful thing in the paper drove completely out of my mind Lord Wisbeach has asked Ann to marry him mister Pett looked a little hurt She didn t tell me Ann usually confided in him She didn t tell me either Lord Wisbeach told me He said Ann had promised to think it over and give him his answer later Meanwhile he had come to me to assure himself that I approved I thought that so charming of him mister Pett was frowning She hasn t accepted him Not definitely I hope she doesn t Don t be foolish Peter It would be an excellent match mister Pett shuffled his feet I don t like him There s something too darned smooth about that fellow If you mean that his manners are perfect I agree with you I shall do all in my power to induce Ann to accept him I shouldn t said mister Pett with more decision than was his wont You know what Ann is if you try to force her to do anything She gets her ears back and won t budge Her father is just the same When we were boys together sometimes Don t be absurd Peter As if I should dream of trying to force Ann to do anything We don t know anything of this fellow Two weeks ago we didn t know he was on the earth What do we need to know beyond his name mister Pett said nothing but he was not convinced The Lord Wisbeach under discussion was a pleasant spoken and presentable young man who had called at mister Pett s office a short while before to consult him about investing some money He had brought a letter of introduction from Hammond Chester Ann s father whom he had met in Canada where the latter was at present engaged in the comparatively mild occupation of bass fishing With their business talk the acquaintance would have begun and finished if mister Pett had been able to please himself for he had not taken a fancy to Lord Wisbeach But he was an American with an American s sense of hospitality and the young man being a friend of Hammond Chester he had felt bound to invite him to Riverside Drive with misgivings which were now he felt completely justified Ann ought to marry said missus Pett She gets her own way too much now However it is entirely her own affair and there is nothing that we can do She rose I only hope she will be sensible She went out leaving mister Pett gloomier than she had found him He hated the idea of Ann marrying Lord Wisbeach who even if he had had no faults at all would be objectionable in that he would probably take her to live three thousand miles away in his own country The thought of losing Ann oppressed mister Pett sorely Ann meanwhile had made her way down the passage to the gymnasium which mister Pett in the interests of his health had caused to be constructed in a large room at the end of the house a room designed by the original owner who had had artistic leanings for a studio The tap tap tap of the leather bag had ceased but voices from within told her that Jerry Mitchell mister Pett s private physical instructor was still there She wondered who was his companion and found on opening the door that it was Ogden The boy was leaning against the wall and regarding Jerry with a dull and supercilious gaze which the latter was plainly finding it hard to bear Yes sir Ogden was saying as Ann entered I heard Biggs asking her to come for a joyride I bet she turned him down said Jerry Mitchell sullenly I bet she didn t Why should she Biggs is an awful good looking fellow What are you talking about Ogden said Ann I was telling him that Biggs asked Celestine to go for a ride in the car with him I ll knock his block off muttered the incensed Jerry Ogden laughed derisively Yes you will Mother would fire you if you touched him She wouldn t stand for having her chauffeur beaten up Jerry Mitchell turned an appealing face to Ann Ogden s revelations and especially his eulogy of Biggs personal appearance had tormented him He knew that in his wooing of missus Pett s maid Celestine he was handicapped by his looks concerning which he had no illusions No Adonis to begin with he had been so edited and re edited during a long and prosperous ring career by the gloved fists of a hundred foes that in affairs of the heart he was obliged to rely exclusively on moral worth and charm of manner He belonged to the old school of fighters who looked the part and in these days of pugilists who resemble matinee idols he had the appearance of an anachronism He was a stocky man with a round solid head small eyes an undershot jaw and a nose which ill treatment had reduced to a mere scenario A narrow strip of forehead acted as a kind of buffer state separating his front hair from his eyebrows and he bore beyond hope of concealment the badge of his late employment the cauliflower ear Yet was he a man of worth and a good citizen and Ann had liked him from their first meeting As for Jerry he worshipped Ann and would have done anything she asked him Ever since he had discovered that Ann was willing to listen to and sympathise with his outpourings on the subject of his troubled wooing he had been her slave Ann came to the rescue in characteristically direct fashion Get out Ogden she said Ogden tried to meet her eye mutinously but failed Why he should be afraid of Ann he had never been able to understand but it was a fact that she was the only person of his acquaintance whom he respected She had a bright eye and a calm imperious stare which never failed to tame him Why he muttered You re not my boss Be quick Ogden What s the big idea ordering a fellow And close the door gently behind you said Ann She turned to Jerry as the order was obeyed Has he been bothering you Jerry Jerry Mitchell wiped his forehead Say if that kid don t quit butting in when I m working in the gym You heard what he was saying about Maggie Miss Ann Celestine had been born Maggie O Toole a name which missus Pett stoutly refused to countenance in any maid of hers Why on earth do you pay any attention to him Jerry You must have seen that he was making it all up He spends his whole time wandering about till he finds some one he can torment and then he enjoys himself Maggie would never dream of going out in the car with Biggs Jerry Mitchell sighed a sigh of relief It s great for a fellow to have you in his corner Miss Ann Ann went to the door and opened it She looked down the passage then satisfied as to its emptiness returned to her seat Jerry I want to talk to you I have an idea Something I want you to do for me Yes Miss Ann We ve got to do something about that child Ogden He s been worrying uncle Peter again and I m not going to have it I warned him once that if he did it again awful things would happen to him but he didn t believe me I suppose Jerry what sort of a man is your friend mister Smethurst Do you mean Smithers Miss Ann I knew it was either Smithers or Smethurst The dog man I mean Is he a man you can trust With my last buck I ve known him since we were kids I don t mean as regards money I am going to send Ogden to him for treatment and I want to know if I can rely on him to help me For the love of Mike Jerry Mitchell after an instant of stunned bewilderment was looking at her with worshipping admiration He had always known that Miss Ann possessed a mind of no common order but this he felt was genius For a moment the magnificence of the idea took his breath away Do you mean that you re going to kidnap him Miss Ann Yes That is to say you are if I can persuade you to do it for me Sneak him away and send him to Bud Smithers dog hospital For treatment I like mister Smithers methods I think they would do Ogden all the good in the world Jerry was enthusiastic Why Bud would make him part human But say isn t it taking big chances Kidnapping s a penitentiary offence This isn t that sort of kidnapping Well it s mighty like it I don t think you need be afraid of the penitentiary I can t see aunt Nesta prosecuting when it would mean that she would have to charge us with having sent Ogden to a dogs hospital She likes publicity but it has to be the right kind of publicity No we do run a risk but it isn t that one You run the risk of losing your job here and I should certainly be sent to my grandmother for an indefinite sentence You ve never seen my grandmother have you Jerry She s the only person in the world I m afraid of She lives miles from anywhere and has family prayers at seven thirty sharp every morning Well I m ready to risk her if you re ready to risk your job in such a good cause You know you re just as fond of uncle Peter as I am and Ogden is worrying him into a breakdown Surely you won t refuse to help me Jerry Jerry rose and extended a calloused hand When do we start Ann shook the hand warmly Thank you Jerry You re a jewel I envy Maggie Well I don t think we can do anything till they come back from England as aunt Nesta is

none	none	to take Ogden with her Who s going to England Uncle Peter and aunt Nesta were talking just now of sailing to try and persuade a young man named Crocker to come back here Crocker Jimmy Crocker Piccadilly Jim Yes Why do you know him I used to meet him sometimes when he was working on the Chronicle here Looks as if he was cutting a wide swathe in dear old London Did you see the paper to day Yes that s what made aunt Nesta want to bring him over Of course there isn t the remotest chance that she will be able to make him come Why should he come Last time I saw Jimmy Crocker said Jerry it was a couple of years ago when I went over to train Eddie Flynn for his go with Porky Jones at the National I bumped into him at the N S C He was a good deal tanked He s always drinking I believe He took me to supper at some swell joint where they all had the soup and fish on but me I felt like a dirty deuce in a clean deck He used to be a regular fellow Jimmy Crocker but from what you read in the papers it begins to look as if he was hitting it up too swift It s always the way with those boys when you take them off a steady job and let them run around loose with their jeans full of mazuma That s exactly why I want to do something about Ogden If he s allowed to go on as he is at present he will grow up exactly like Jimmy Crocker Aw Jimmy Crocker ain t in Ogden s class protested Jerry Yes he is There s absolutely no difference between them Say You ve got it in for Jim haven t you Miss Ann Jerry looked at her wonderingly What s your kick against him Ann bit her lip I object to him on principle she said I don t like his type Well I m glad we ve settled this about Ogden Jerry I knew I could rely on you But I won t let you do it for nothing Uncle Peter shall give you something for it enough to start that health farm you talk about so much Then you can marry Maggie and live happily ever afterwards Gee Is the boss in on this too Not yet I m going to tell him now Hush There s some one coming mister Pett wandered in He was still looking troubled Oh Ann good morning Mitchell your aunt has decided to go to England I want you to come too You want me To help interview Jimmy Crocker No no Just to come along and be company on the voyage You ll be such a help with Ogden Ann You can keep him in order How you do it I don t know You seem to make another boy of him Ann stole a glance at Jerry who answered with an encouraging grin Ann was constrained to make her meaning plainer than by the language of the eye Would you mind just running away for half a moment Jerry she said winningly I want to say something to uncle Peter Sure Sure Ann turned to mister Pett as the door closed You d like somebody to make Ogden a different boy wouldn t you uncle Peter I wish it was possible He s been worrying you a lot lately hasn t he asked Ann sympathetically Yes sighed mister Pett Then that s all right said Ann briskly I was afraid that you might not approve But if you do I ll go right ahead mister Pett started violently There was something in Ann s voice and as he looked at her something in her face which made him fear the worst Her eyes were flashing with an inspired light of a highly belligerent nature and the sun turned the red hair to which she owed her deplorable want of balance to a mass of flame There was something in the air mister Pett sensed it with every nerve of his apprehensive person He gazed at Ann and as he did so the years seemed to slip from him and he was a boy again about to be urged to lawless courses by the superior will of his boyhood s hero Hammond Chester In the boyhood of nearly every man there is a single outstanding figure some one youthful hypnotic Napoleon whose will was law and at whose bidding his better judgment curled up and died In mister Pett s life Ann s father had filled this role He had dominated mister Pett at an age when the mind is most malleable And now so true is it that though Time may blunt our boyish memories the traditions of boyhood live on in us and an emotional crisis will bring them to the surface as an explosion brings up the fish that lurk in the nethermost mud it was as if he were facing the youthful Hammond Chester again and being irresistibly impelled to some course of which he entirely disapproved but which he knew that he was destined to undertake He watched Ann as a trapped man might watch a ticking bomb bracing himself for the explosion and knowing that he is helpless She was Hammond Chester s daughter and she spoke to him with the voice of Hammond Chester She was her father s child and she was going to start something I ve arranged it all with Jerry said Ann He s going to help me smuggle Ogden away to that friend of his I told you about who keeps the dog hospital and the friend is going to keep him until he reforms Isn t it a perfectly splendid idea mister Pett blanched The frightfulness of reality had exceeded anticipation But Ann The words came from him in a strangled bleat His whole being was paralysed by a clammy horror This was beyond the uttermost limit of his fears And to complete the terror of the moment he knew even while he rebelled against the insane lawlessness of her scheme that he was going to agree to it and worst of all that deep deep down in him there was a feeling toward it which did not dare to come to the surface but which he knew to be approval Of course Jerry would do it for nothing said Ann but I promised him that you would give him something for his trouble You can arrange all that yourselves later But Ann But Ann Suppose your aunt finds out who did it Well there will be a tremendous row said Ann composedly And you will have to assert yourself It will be a splendid thing for you You know you are much too kind to every one uncle Peter I don t think there s any one who would put up with what you do Father told me in one of his letters that he used to call you Patient Pete as a boy mister Pett started Not for many a day had a nickname which he considered the most distasteful of all possible nicknames risen up from its grave to haunt him Patient Pete He had thought the repulsive title buried forever in the same tomb as his dead youth Patient Pete The first faint glimmer of the flame of rebellion began to burn in his bosom Patient Pete Patient Pete said Ann inexorably But Ann there was pathos in mister Pett s voice I like a peaceful life You ll never have one if you don t stand up for yourself You know quite well that father is right You do let every one trample on you Do you think father would let Ogden worry him and have his house filled with affected imitation geniuses so that he couldn t find a room to be alone in But Ann your father is different He likes fusses I ve known your father contradict a man weighing two hundred pounds out of sheer exuberance There s a lot of your father in you Ann I ve often noticed it There is That s why I m going to make you put your foot down sooner or later You re going to turn all these loafers out of the house And first of all you re going to help us send Ogden away to mister Smithers There was a long silence It s your red hair said mister Pett at length with the air of a man who has been solving a problem It s your red hair that makes you like this Ann Your father has red hair too Ann laughed It s not my fault that I have red hair uncle Peter It s my misfortune mister Pett shook his head Other people s misfortune too he said CHAPTER II THE EXILED FAN London brooded under a grey sky There had been rain in the night and the trees were still dripping Presently however there appeared in the laden haze a watery patch of blue and through this crevice in the clouds the sun diffidently at first but with gradually increasing confidence peeped down on the fashionable and exclusive turf of Grosvenor Square Stealing across the square its rays reached the massive stone walls of Drexdale House until recently the London residence of the earl of that name then passing through the window of the breakfast room played lightly on the partially bald head of mister Bingley Crocker late of New York in the United States of America as he bent over his morning paper missus Bingley Crocker busy across the table reading her mail the rays did not touch Had they done so she would have rung for Bayliss the butler to come and lower the shade for she endured liberties neither from Man nor from Nature mister Crocker was about fifty years of age clean shaven and of a comfortable stoutness He was frowning as he read His smooth good humoured face wore an expression which might have been disgust perplexity or a blend of both His wife on the other hand was looking happy She extracted the substance from her correspondence with swift glances of her compelling eyes just as she would have extracted guilty secrets from Bingley if he had had any This was a woman who like her sister Nesta had been able all her life to accomplish more with a glance than other women with recrimination and threat It had been a popular belief among his friends that her late husband the well known Pittsburg millionaire G G van Brunt had been in the habit of automatically confessing all if he merely caught the eye of her photograph on his dressing table From the growing pile of opened envelopes missus Crocker looked up a smile softening the firm line of her lips A card from Lady Corstorphine Bingley for her at home on the twenty ninth mister Crocker still absorbed snorted absently One of the most exclusive hostesses in England She has influence with the right sort of people Her brother the Duke of Devizes is the Premier s oldest friend Uh The Duchess of Axminster has written to ask me to look after a stall at her bazaar for the Indigent Daughters of the Clergy Huh Bingley You aren t listening What is that you are reading mister Crocker tore himself from the paper This Oh I was looking at a report of that cricket game you made me go and see yesterday Oh I am glad you have begun to take an interest in cricket It is simply a social necessity in England Why you ever made such a fuss about taking it up I can t think You used to be so fond of watching baseball and cricket is just the same thing A close observer would have marked a deepening of the look of pain on mister Crocker s face Women say this sort of thing carelessly with no wish to wound but that makes it none the less hard to bear From the hall outside came faintly the sound of the telephone then the measured tones of Bayliss answering it mister Crocker returned to his paper Bayliss entered Lady Corstorphine desires to speak to you on the telephone madam Half way to the door missus Crocker paused as if recalling something that had slipped her memory Is mister James getting up Bayliss I believe not madam I am informed by one of the house maids who passed his door a short time back that there were no sounds missus Crocker left the room Bayliss preparing to follow her example was arrested by an exclamation from the table Say His master s voice Say Bayliss come here a minute Want to ask you something The butler approached the table It seemed to him that his employer was not looking quite himself this morning There was something a trifle wild a little haggard about his expression He had remarked on it earlier in the morning in the Servants Hall As a matter of fact mister Crocker s ailment was a perfectly simple one He was suffering from one of those acute spasms of home sickness which invariably racked him in the earlier Summer months Ever since his marriage five years previously and his simultaneous removal from his native land he had been a chronic victim to the complaint The symptoms grew less acute in Winter and Spring but from May onward he suffered severely Poets have dealt feelingly with the emotions of practically every variety except one They have sung of Ruth of Israel in bondage of slaves pining for their native Africa and of the miner s dream of home But the sorrows of the baseball bug compelled by fate to live three thousand miles away from the Polo Grounds have been neglected in song Bingley Crocker was such a one and in Summer his agonies were awful He pined away in a country where they said Well played sir when they meant at a boy Bayliss do you play cricket I am a little past the age sir In my younger days Do you understand it Yes sir I frequently spend an afternoon at Lord s or the Oval when there is a good match Many who enjoyed a merely casual acquaintance with the butler would have looked on this as an astonishingly unexpected revelation of humanity in Bayliss but mister Crocker was not surprised To him from the very beginning Bayliss had been a man and a brother who was always willing to suspend his duties in order to answer questions dealing with the thousand and one problems which the social life of England presented mister Crocker s mind had adjusted itself with difficulty to the niceties of class distinction and while he had cured himself of his early tendency to address the butler as Bill he never failed to consult him as man to man in his moments of perplexity Bayliss was always eager to be of assistance He liked mister Crocker True his manner might have struck a more sensitive man than his employer as a shade too closely resembling that of an indulgent father towards a son who was not quite right in the head but it had genuine affection in it mister Crocker picked up his paper and folded it back at the sporting page pointing with a stubby forefinger Well what does all this mean I ve kept out of watching cricket since I landed in England but yesterday they got the poison needle to work and took me off to see Surrey play Kent at that place Lord s where you say you go sometimes I was there yesterday sir A very exciting game Exciting How do you make that out I sat in the bleachers all afternoon waiting for something to break loose Doesn t anything ever happen at cricket The butler winced a little but managed to smile a tolerant smile This man he reflected was but an American and as such more to be pitied than censured He endeavoured to explain It was a sticky wicket yesterday sir owing to the rain Eh The wicket was sticky sir Come again I mean that the reason why the game yesterday struck you as slow was that the wicket I should say the turf was sticky that is to say wet Sticky is the technical term sir When the wicket is sticky the batsmen are obliged to exercise a great deal of caution as the stickiness of the wicket enables the bowlers to make the ball turn more sharply in either direction as it strikes the turf than when the wicket is not sticky That s it is it Yes sir Thanks for telling me Not at all sir mister Crocker pointed to the paper Well now this seems to be the box score of the game we saw yesterday If you can make sense out of that go to it The passage on which his finger rested was headed Final Score and ran as follows SURREY First Innings Hayward c Wooley b Carr sixty seven Hobbs run out zero Hayes saint Huish b Fielder twelve Ducat b Fielder thirty three Harrison not out eleven Sandham not out six Extras ten Total for four wickets one hundred thirty nine Bayliss inspected the cipher gravely What is it you wish me to explain sir Why the whole thing What s it all about It s perfectly simple sir Surrey won the toss and took first knock Hayward and Hobbs were the opening pair Hayward called Hobbs for a short run but the latter was unable to get across and was thrown out by mid on Hayes was the next man in He went out of his ground and was stumped Ducat and Hayward made a capital stand considering the stickiness of the wicket until Ducat was bowled by a good length off break and Hayward caught at second slip off a googly Then Harrison and Sandham played out time mister Crocker breathed heavily through his nose Yes he said Yes I had an idea that was it But I think I d like to have it once again slowly Start with these figures What does that sixty seven mean opposite Hayward s name He made sixty seven runs sir Sixty seven In one game Yes sir Why Home Run Baker couldn t do it I am not familiar with mister Baker sir I suppose you ve never seen a ball game Ball game sir A baseball game Never sir Then Bill said mister Crocker reverting in his emotion to the bad habit of his early London days you haven t lived See here Whatever vestige of respect for class distinctions mister Crocker had managed to preserve during the opening stages of the interview now definitely disappeared His eyes shone wildly and he snorted like a war horse He clutched the butler by the sleeve and drew him closer to the table then began to move forks spoons cups and even the contents of his plate about the cloth with an energy little short of feverish Bayliss Sir Watch said mister Crocker with the air of an excitable high priest about to initiate a novice into the Mysteries He removed a roll from the basket You see this roll That s the home plate This spoon is first base Where I m putting this cup is second This piece of bacon is third There s your diamond for you Very well then These lumps of sugar are the infielders and the outfielders Now we re ready Batter up He stands here Catcher behind him Umps behind catcher Umps I take it sir is what we would call the umpire Call him anything you like It s part of the game Now here s the box where I ve put this dab of marmalade and here s the pitcher winding up The pitcher would be equivalent to our bowler I guess so though why you should call him a bowler gets past me The box then is the bowler s wicket Have it your own way Now pay attention Play ball Pitcher s winding up Put it over Mike put it over Some speed kid Here it comes right in the groove Bing Batter slams it and streaks for first Outfielder this lump of sugar boots it Bonehead Batter touches second Third No Get back Can t be done Play it safe Stick around the sack old pal Second batter up Pitcher getting something on the ball now besides the cover Whiffs him Back to the bench Cyril Third batter up See him rub his hands in the dirt Watch this kid He s good He lets two alone then slams the next right on the nose Whizzes around to second First guy the one we left on second comes home for one run That s a game Take it from me Bill that s a game Somewhat overcome with the energy with which he had flung himself into his lecture mister Crocker sat down and refreshed himself with cold coffee Quite an interesting game said Bayliss But I find now that you have explained it sir that it is familiar to me though I have always known it under another name It is played a great deal in this country mister Crocker started to his feet It is And I ve been five years here without finding it out When s the next game scheduled It is known in England as Rounders sir Children play it with a soft ball and a racquet and derive considerable enjoyment from it I had never heard of it before as a pastime for adults Two shocked eyes stared into the butler s face Children The word came in a whisper A racquet Yes sir You you didn t say a soft ball Yes sir A sort of spasm seemed to convulse mister Crocker He had lived five years in England but not till this moment had he realised to the full how utterly alone he was in an alien land Fate had placed him bound and helpless in a country where they called baseball Rounders and played it with a soft ball He sank back into his chair staring before him And as he sat the wall seemed to melt and he was gazing upon a green field in the centre of which a man in a grey uniform was beginning a Salome dance Watching this person with a cold and suspicious eye stood another uniformed man holding poised above his shoulder a sturdy club Two Masked Marvels crouched behind him in attitudes of watchful waiting On wooden seats all around sat a vast multitude of shirt sleeved spectators and the air was full of voices One voice detached itself from the din Pea nuts Get y r pea nuts Something that was almost a sob shook Bingley Crocker s ample frame Bayliss the butler gazed down upon him with concern He was sure the master was unwell The case of mister Bingley Crocker was one that would have provided an admirable instance for a preacher seeking to instil into an impecunious and sceptical flock the lesson that money does not of necessity bring with it happiness And poetry has crystallised his position in the following stanza An exile from home splendour dazzles in vain Oh give me my lowly thatched cottage again The birds singing gaily that came at my call Give me them and that peace of mind dearer than all mister Crocker had never lived in a thatched cottage nor had his relations with the birds of his native land ever reached the stage of intimacy indicated by the poet but substitute Lambs Club for the former and members for the latter and the parallel becomes complete Until the time of his second marriage Bingley Crocker had been an actor a snapper up of whatever small character parts the gods provided He had an excellent disposition no money and one son a young man of twenty one For forty five years he had lived a hand to mouth existence in which his next meal had generally come as a pleasant surprise and then on an Atlantic liner he met the widow of G G van Brunt the sole heiress to that magnate s immense fortune What missus van Brunt could have seen in Bingley Crocker to cause her to single him out from all the world passes comprehension but the eccentricities of Cupid are commonplace It were best to shun examination into first causes and stick to results The swift romance began and reached its climax in the ten days which it took one of the smaller Atlantic liners to sail from Liverpool to New York mister Crocker was on board because he was returning with a theatrical company from a failure in London missus van Brunt because she had been told that the slow boats were the steadiest They began the voyage as strangers and ended it as an engaged couple the affair being expedited no doubt by the fact that even if it ever occurred to Bingley to resist the onslaught on his bachelor peace he soon realised the futility of doing so for the cramped conditions of ship board intensified the always overwhelming effects of his future bride s determined nature The engagement was received in a widely differing spirit by the only surviving blood relations of the two principals Jimmy mister Crocker s son on being informed that his father had plighted his troth to the widow of a prominent millionaire displayed the utmost gratification and enthusiasm and at a little supper which he gave by way of farewell to a few of his newspaper comrades and which lasted till six in the morning when it was broken up by the flying wedge of waiters for which the selected restaurant is justly famous joyfully announced that work and he would from then on be total strangers He alluded in feeling terms to the Providence which watches over good young men and saves them from the blighting necessity of offering themselves in the flower of their golden youth as human sacrifices to the Moloch of capitalistic greed and having commiserated with his guests in that a similar stroke of luck had not happened to each of them advised them to drown their sorrows in drink Which they did Far different was the attitude of missus Crocker s sister Nesta Pett She entirely disapproved of the proposed match At least the fact that in her final interview with her sister she described the bridegroom to be as a wretched mummer a despicable fortune hunter a broken down tramp and a sneaking grafting confidence trickster lends colour to the supposition that she was not a warm supporter of it She agreed wholeheartedly with missus Crocker s suggestion that they should never speak to each other again as long as they lived and it was immediately after this that the latter removed husband Bingley step son Jimmy and all her other goods and chattels to London where they had remained ever since Whenever missus Crocker spoke of America now it was in tones of the deepest dislike and contempt Her friends were English and every year more exclusively of England s aristocracy She intended to become a leading figure in London Society and already her progress had been astonishing She knew the right people lived in the right square said the right things and thought the right thoughts and in the Spring of her third year had succeeded in curing Bingley of his habit of beginning his remarks with the words Say lemme tell ya something Her progress in short was beginning to assume the aspect of a walk over Against her complete contentment and satisfaction only one thing militated That was the behaviour of her step son Jimmy It was of Jimmy that she spoke when having hung the receiver on its hook she returned to the breakfast room Bayliss had silently withdrawn and mister Crocker was sitting in sombre silence at the table A most fortunate thing has happened Bingley she said It was most kind of dear Lady Corstorphine to ring me up It seems that her nephew Lord Percy Whipple is back in England He has been in Ireland for the past three years on the staff of the Lord Lieutenant and only arrived in London yesterday afternoon Lady Corstorphine has promised to arrange a meeting between him and James I particularly want them to be friends Eugenia said mister Crocker in a hollow voice do you know they call baseball Rounders over here and children play it with a soft ball James is becoming a serious problem It is absolutely necessary that he should make friends with the right kind of young men And a racquet said mister Crocker Please listen to what I am saying Bingley I am talking about James There is a crude American strain in him which seems to grow worse instead of better I was lunching with the Delafields at the Carlton yesterday and there only a few tables away was James with an impossible young man in appalling clothes It was outrageous that James should have been seen in public at all with such a person The man had a broken nose and talked through it He was saying in a loud voice that made everybody turn round something about his left scissors hook whatever that may have been I discovered later that he was a low professional pugilist from New York a man named Spike Dillon I think Captain Wroxton said And Jimmy was giving him lunch at the Carlton mister Crocker said nothing Constant practice had made him an adept at saying nothing when his wife was talking James must be made to realise his responsibilities I shall have to speak to him I was hearing only the other day of a most deserving man extremely rich and lavishly generous in his contributions to the party funds who was only given a knighthood simply because he had a son who had behaved in a manner that could not possibly be overlooked The present Court is extraordinarily strict in its views James cannot be too careful A certain amount of wildness in a young man is quite proper in the best set provided that he is wild in the right company Every one knows that young Lord Datchet was ejected from the Empire Music Hall on Boat Race night every year during his residence at Oxford University but nobody minds The family treats it as a joke But James has such low tastes Professional pugilists I believe that many years ago it was not unfashionable for young men in Society to be seen about with such persons but those days are over I shall certainly speak to James He cannot afford to call attention to himself in any way That breach of promise case of his three years ago is I hope and trust forgotten but the slightest slip on his part might start the papers talking about it again and that would be fatal The eventual successor to a title must be quite as careful as It was not as has been hinted above the usual practice of mister Crocker to interrupt his wife when she was speaking but he did it now Say missus Crocker frowned I wish Bingley and I have told you so often that you would not begin your sentences with the word Say It is such a revolting Americanism Suppose some day when you are addressing the House of Lords you should make a slip like that The papers would never let you hear the end of it mister Crocker was swallowing convulsively as if testing his larynx with a view to speech Like Saul of Tarsus he had been stricken dumb by the sudden bright light which his wife s words had caused to flash upon him Frequently during his sojourn in London he had wondered just why Eugenia had settled there in preference to her own country It was not her wont to do things without an object yet until this moment he had been unable to fathom her motives Even now it seemed almost incredible And yet what meaning would her words have other than the monstrous one which had smitten him as a blackjack Say I mean Eugenia you don t want you aren t trying you aren t working to you haven t any idea of trying to get them to make me a Lord have you It is what I have been working for all these years But but why Why That s what I want to know Why missus Crocker s fine eyes glittered I will tell you why Bingley Just before we were married I had a talk with my sister Nesta She was insufferably offensive She referred to you in terms which I shall never forgive She affected to look down on you to think that I was marrying beneath me So I am going to make you an English peer and send Nesta a newspaper clipping of the Birthday Honours with your name in it if I have to keep working till I die Now you know Silence fell mister Crocker drank cold coffee His wife stared with gleaming eyes into the glorious future Do you mean that I shall have to stop on here till they make me a lord said mister Crocker limply Yes Never go back to America Not till we have succeeded Oh Gee Oh Gosh Oh Hell said mister Crocker bursting the bonds of years missus Crocker though resolute was not unkindly She made allowances for her husband s state of mind She was willing to permit even American expletives during the sinking in process of her great idea much as a broad minded cowboy might listen indulgently to the squealing of a mustang during the branding process Docility and obedience would be demanded of him later but not till the first agony had abated She spoke soothingly to him I am glad we have had this talk Bingley It is best that you should know It will help you to realise your responsibilities And that brings me back to James Thank goodness Lord Percy Whipple is in town He is about James age and from what Lady Corstorphine tells me will be an ideal friend for him You understand who he is of course The second son of the Duke of Devizes the Premier s closest friend the man who can practically dictate the Birthday Honours If James and Lord Percy can only form a close friendship our battle will be as good as won It will mean everything Lady Corstorphine has promised to arrange a meeting In the meantime I will speak to James and warn him to be more careful mister Crocker had produced a stump of pencil from his pocket and was writing on the table cloth Lord Crocker Lord Bingley Crocker Lord Crocker of Crocker The Marquis of Crocker Baron Crocker Bingley first Viscount Crocker He blanched as he read the frightful words A sudden thought stung him Eugenia Well What will the boys at the Lambs say I am not interested replied his wife in the boys at the Lambs I thought you wouldn t be said the future baron gloomily CHAPTER III FAMILY JARS It is a peculiarity of the human mind that with whatever apprehension it may be regarding the distant future it must return after a while to face the minor troubles of the future that is immediate The prospect of a visit to the dentist this afternoon causes us to forget for the moment the prospect of total ruin next year mister Crocker therefore having tortured himself for about a quarter of an hour with his meditations on the subject of titles was jerked back to a more imminent calamity than the appearance of his name in the Birthday Honours the fact that in all probability he would be taken again this morning to watch the continuation of that infernal cricket match and would be compelled to spend the greater part of to day as he had spent the greater part of yesterday bored to the verge of dissolution in the pavilion at Lord s One gleam of hope alone presented itself Like baseball this pastime of cricket was apparently affected by rain if there had been enough of it He had an idea that there had been a good deal of rain in the night but had there been sufficient to cause the teams of Surrey and Kent to postpone the second instalment of their serial struggle He rose from the table and went out into the hall It was his purpose to sally out into Grosvenor Square and examine the turf in its centre with the heel of his shoe in order to determine the stickiness or non stickiness of the wicket He moved towards the front door hoping for the best and just as he reached it the bell rang One of the bad habits of which his wife had cured mister Crocker in the course of the years was the habit of going and answering doors He had been brought up in surroundings where every man was his own door keeper and it had been among his hardest tasks to learn the lesson that the perfect gentleman does not open doors but waits for the appropriate menial to come along and do it for him He had succeeded at length in mastering this great truth and nowadays seldom offended But this morning his mind was clouded by his troubles and instinct allaying itself with opportunity was too much for him His fingers had been on the handle when the ring came so he turned it At the top of the steps which connect the main entrance of Drexdale House with the sidewalk three persons were standing One was a tall and formidably handsome woman in the early forties whose appearance seemed somehow oddly familiar The second was a small fat blobby bulging boy who was chewing something The third lurking diffidently in the rear was a little man of about mister Crocker s own age grey haired and thin with brown eyes that gazed meekly through rimless glasses Nobody could have been less obtrusive than this person yet it was he who gripped mister Crocker s attention and caused that home sick sufferer s heart to give an almost painful leap For he was clothed in one of those roomy suits with square shoulders which to the seeing eye are as republican as the Stars and Stripes His blunt toed yellow shoes sang gaily of home And his hat was not so much a hat as an effusive greeting from Gotham A long time had passed since mister Crocker had set eyes upon a biped so exhilaratingly American and rapture held him speechless as one who after long exile beholds some landmark of his childhood The female member of the party took advantage of his dumbness which as she had not unnaturally mistaken him for the butler she took for a silent and respectful query as to her business and wishes to open the conversation Is missus Crocker at home Please tell her that missus Pett wishes to see her There was a rush and scurry in the corridors of mister Crocker s brain as about six different thoughts tried to squash simultaneously into that main chamber where there is room for only one at a time He understood now why this woman s appearance had seemed familiar She was his wife s sister and that same Nesta who was some day to be pulverised by the sight of his name in the Birthday Honours He was profoundly thankful that she had mistaken him for the butler A chill passed through him as he pictured what would have been Eugenia s reception of the information that he had committed such a bourgeois solecism as opening the front door to missus Pett of all people who already despised him as a low vulgarian There had been trouble enough when she had found him opening it a few weeks before to a mere collector of subscriptions for a charity He perceived with a clarity remarkable in view of the fact that the discovery of her identity had given him a feeling of physical dizziness that at all costs he must foster this misapprehension on his sister in law s part Fortunately he was in a position to do so He knew all about what butlers did and what they said on these occasions for in his innocently curious way he had often pumped Bayliss on the subject He bowed silently and led the way to the morning room followed by the drove of Petts then opening the door stood aside to allow the procession to march past the given point I will inform missus Crocker that you are here madam missus Pett shepherding the chewing child before her passed into the room In the light of her outspoken sentiments regarding her brother in law it is curious to reflect that his manner at this their first meeting had deeply impressed her After many months of smouldering revolt she had dismissed her own butler a day or so before sailing for England and for the first time envy of her sister Eugenia gripped her She did not covet Eugenia s other worldly possessions but she did grudge her this supreme butler mister Pett meanwhile had been trailing in the rear with a hunted expression on his face He wore the unmistakable look of a man about to be present at a row between women and only a wet cat in a strange back yard bears itself with less jauntiness than a man faced by such a prospect A millionaire several times over mister Pett would cheerfully have given much of his wealth to have been elsewhere at that moment Such was the agitated state of his mind that when a hand was laid lightly upon his arm as he was about to follow his wife into the room he started so violently that his hat flew out of his hand He turned to meet the eyes of the butler who had admitted him to the house fixed on his in an appealing stare Who s leading in the pennant race said this strange butler in a feverish whisper It was a question coming from such a source which in another than mister Pett might well have provoked a blank stare of amazement Such however is the almost superhuman intelligence and quickness of mind engendered by the study of America s national game that he answered without the slightest hesitation Giants Wow said the butler No sense of anything strange or untoward about the situation came to mar the perfect joy of mister Pett the overmastering joy of the baseball fan who in a strange land unexpectedly encounters a brother He thrilled with a happiness which he had never hoped to feel that morning No signs of them slumping enquired the butler No But you never can tell It s early yet I ve seen those boys lead the league till the end of August and then be nosed out True enough said the butler sadly Matty s in shape He is The old souper working well Like a machine He shut out the Cubs the day before I sailed Fine At this point an appreciation of the unusualness of the proceedings began to steal upon mister Pett He gaped at this surprising servitor How on earth do you know anything about baseball he demanded The other seemed to stiffen A change came over his whole appearance He had the air of an actor who has remembered his part I beg your pardon sir I trust I have not taken a liberty I was at one time in the employment of a gentleman in New York and during my stay I became extremely interested in the national game I picked up a few of the American idioms while in the country He smiled apologetically They sometimes slip out Let em slip said mister Pett with enthusiasm You re the first thing that s reminded me of home since I left Say Sir Got a good place here Er oh yes sir Well here s my card If you ever feel like making a change there s a job waiting for you at that address Thank you sir mister Crocker stooped Your hat sir He held it out gazing fondly at it the while It was like being home again to see a hat like that He followed mister Pett as he went into the morning room with an affectionate eye Bayliss was coming along the hall hurrying more than his wont The ring at the front door had found him deep in an extremely interesting piece of news in his halfpenny morning paper and he was guiltily aware of having delayed in answering it Bayliss said mister Crocker in a cautious undertone go and tell missus Crocker that missus Pett is waiting to see her She s in the morning room If you re asked say you let her in Get me Yes sir said Bayliss grateful for this happy solution Oh Bayliss Sir Is the wicket at Lord s likely to be too sticky for them to go on with that game to day I hardly think it probable that there will be play sir There was a great deal of rain in the night mister Crocker passed on to his den with a lighter heart It was missus Crocker s habit acquired after years of practice and a sedulous study of the best models to conceal beneath a mask of well bred indifference any emotion which she might chance to feel Her dealings with the aristocracy of England had shown her that while the men occasionally permitted themselves an outburst the women never did and she had schooled herself so rigorously that nowadays she seldom even raised her voice Her bearing as she approached the morning room was calm and serene but inwardly curiosity consumed her It was unbelievable that Nesta could have come to try to effect a reconciliation yet she could think of no other reason for her visit She was surprised to find three persons in the morning room Bayliss delivering his message had mentioned only missus Pett To missus Crocker the assemblage had the appearance of being a sort of Old Home Week of Petts a kind of Pett family mob scene Her sister s second marriage having taken place after their quarrel she had never seen her new brother in law but she assumed that the little man lurking in the background was mister Pett The guess was confirmed Good morning Eugenia said missus Pett Peter this is my sister Eugenia My husband missus Crocker bowed stiffly She was thinking how hopelessly American mister Pett was how baggy his clothes looked what absurdly shaped shoes he wore how appalling his hat was how little hair he had and how deplorably he lacked all those graces of repose culture physical beauty refinement dignity and mental alertness which raise men above the level of the common cock roach mister Pett on his side receiving her cold glance squarely between the eyes felt as if he were being disembowelled by a clumsy amateur He could not help wondering what sort of a man this fellow Crocker was whom this sister in law of his had married He pictured him as a handsome powerful robust individual with a strong jaw and a loud voice for he could imagine no lesser type of man consenting to link his lot with such a woman He sidled in a circuitous manner towards a distant chair and having lowered himself into it kept perfectly still pretending to be dead like an opossum He wished to take no part whatever in the coming interview Ogden of course you know said missus Pett She was sitting so stiffly upright on a hard chair and had so much the appearance of having been hewn from the living rock that every time she opened her mouth it was as if a statue had spoken I know Ogden said missus Crocker shortly Will you please stop him fidgeting with that vase It is valuable She directed at little Ogden who was juggling aimlessly with a handsome objet d art of the early Chinese school a glance similar to that which had just disposed of his step father But Ogden required more than a glance to divert him from any pursuit in which he was interested He shifted a deposit of candy from his right cheek to his left cheek inspected missus Crocker for a moment with a pale eye and resumed his juggling missus Crocker meant nothing in his young life Ogden come and sit down said missus Pett Don t want to sit down Are you making a long stay in England Nesta asked missus Crocker coldly I don t know We have made no plans Indeed She broke off Ogden who had possessed himself of a bronze paper knife had begun to tap the vase with it The ringing note thus produced appeared to please his young mind If Ogden really wishes to break that vase said missus Crocker in a detached voice let me ring for the butler to bring him a hammer Ogden said missus Pett Oh Gee A fellow can t do a thing muttered Ogden and walked to the window He stood looking out into the square a slight twitching of the ears indicating that he still made progress with the candy Still the same engaging child murmured missus Crocker I did not come here to discuss Ogden said missus Pett missus Crocker raised her eyebrows Not even missus Otho Lanners from whom she had learned the art could do it more effectively I am still waiting to find out why you did come Nesta I came here to talk to you about your step son James Crocker The discipline to which missus Crocker had subjected herself in the matter of the display of emotion saved her from the humiliation of showing surprise She waved her hand graciously in the manner of the Duchess of Axminster a supreme hand waver to indicate that she was all attention Your step son James Crocker repeated missus Pett What is it the New York papers call him Peter mister Pett the human opossum came to life He had contrived to create about himself such a defensive atmosphere of non existence that now that he re entered the conversation it was as if a corpse had popped out of its tomb like a jack in the box Obeying the voice of authority he pushed the tombstone to one side and poked his head out of the sepulchre Piccadilly Jim he murmured apologetically Piccadilly Jim said missus Crocker It is extremely impertinent of them In spite of his misery a wan smile appeared on mister Pett s death mask at this remark They should worry about Peter mister Pett died again greatly respected Why should the New York papers refer to James at all said missus Crocker Explain Peter mister Pett emerged reluctantly from the cerements He had supposed that Nesta would do the talking Well he s a news item Why Well here s a boy that s been a regular fellow raised in America done work on a newspaper suddenly taken off to England to become a London dude mixing with all the dukes playing pinochle with the King naturally they re interested in him A more agreeable expression came over missus Crocker s face Of course that is quite true One cannot prevent the papers from printing what they wish So they have published articles about James doings in English Society Doings said mister Pett is right Something has got to be done about it said missus Pett mister Pett endorsed this Nesta s going to lose her health if these stories go on he said missus Crocker raised her eyebrows but she had hard work to keep a contented smile off her face If you are not above petty jealousy Nesta missus Pett laughed a sharp metallic laugh It is the disgrace I object to The disgrace What else would you call it Eugenia Wouldn t you be ashamed if you opened your Sunday paper and came upon a full page article about your nephew having got intoxicated at the races and fought a book maker having broken up a political meeting having been sued for breach of promise by a barmaid missus Crocker preserved her well bred calm but she was shaken The episodes to which her sister had alluded were ancient history horrors of the long dead past but it seemed that they still lived in print There and then she registered the resolve to talk to her step son James when she got hold of him in such a manner as would scourge the offending Adam out of him for once and for all And not only that continued missus Pett That would be bad enough in itself but somehow the papers have discovered that I am the boy s aunt Two weeks ago they printed my photograph with one of these articles I suppose they will always do it now That is why I have come to you It must stop And the only way it can be made to stop is by taking your step son away from London where he is running wild Peter has most kindly consented to give the boy a position in his office It is very good of him for the boy cannot in the nature of things be of any use for a very long time but we have talked it over and it seems the only course I have come this morning to ask you to let us take James Crocker back to America with us and keep him out of mischief by giving him honest work What do you say missus Crocker raised her eyebrows What do you expect me to say It is utterly preposterous I have never heard anything so supremely absurd in my life You refuse Of course I refuse I think you are extremely foolish Indeed mister Pett cowed in his chair He was feeling rather like a nervous and peace loving patron of a wild western saloon who observes two cowboys reach for their hip pockets Neither his wife nor his sister in law paid any attention to him The concluding exercises of a duel of the eyes was in progress between them After some silent age long moments missus Crocker laughed a light laugh Most extraordinary she murmured missus Pett was in no mood for Anglicisms You know perfectly well Eugenia she said heatedly that James Crocker is being ruined here For his sake if not for mine missus Crocker laughed another light laugh one of those offensive rippling things which cause so much annoyance Don t be so ridiculous Nesta Ruined Really It is quite true that a long while ago when he was much younger and not quite used to the ways of London Society James was a little wild but all that sort of thing is over now He knows she paused setting herself as it were for the punch he knows that at any moment the government may decide to give his father a Peerage The blow went home A quite audible gasp escaped her stricken sister What missus Crocker placed two ringed fingers before her mouth in order not to hide a languid yawn Yes Didn t you know But of course you live so out of the world Oh yes it is extremely probable that mister Crocker s name will appear in the next Honours List He is very highly thought of by the Powers So naturally James is quite aware that he must behave in a suitable manner He is a dear boy He was handicapped at first by getting into the wrong set but now his closest friend is Lord Percy Whipple the second son of the Duke of Devizes who is one of the most eminent men in the kingdom and a personal friend of the Premier missus Pett was in bad shape under this rain of titles but she rallied herself to reply in kind Indeed she said I should like to meet him I have no doubt he knows our great friend Lord Wisbeach missus Crocker was a little taken aback She had not supposed that her sister had even this small shot in her locker Do you know Lord Wisbeach she said Oh yes replied missus Pett beginning to feel a little better We have been seeing him every day He always says that he looks on my house as quite a home He knows so few people in New York It has been a great comfort to him I think knowing us missus Crocker had had time now to recover her poise Poor dear Wizzy she said languidly 
4108_2772_000030_000000	train-clean-360	missus Pett started 
none	none	What I suppose he is still the same dear stupid shiftless fellow He left here with the intention of travelling round the world and he has stopped in New York How like him Do you know Lord Wisbeach demanded missus Pett missus Crocker raised her eyebrows Know him Why I suppose after Lord Percy Whipple he is James most intimate friend missus Pett rose She was dignified even in defeat She collected Ogden and mister Pett with an eye which even Ogden could see was not to be trifled with She uttered no word Must you really go said missus Crocker It was sweet of you to bother to come all the way from America like this So strange to meet any one from America nowadays Most extraordinary The cortege left the room in silence missus Crocker had touched the bell but the mourners did not wait for the arrival of Bayliss They were in no mood for the formalities of polite Society They wanted to be elsewhere and they wanted to be there quick The front door had closed behind them before the butler reached the morning room Bayliss said missus Crocker with happy shining face send for the car to come round at once Very good madam Is mister James up yet I believe not madam missus Crocker went upstairs to her room If Bayliss had not been within earshot she would probably have sung a bar or two Her amiability extended even to her step son though she had not altered her intention of speaking eloquently to him on certain matters when she could get hold of him That however could wait For the moment she felt in vein for a gentle drive in the Park A few minutes after she had disappeared there was a sound of slow footsteps on the stairs and a young man came down into the hall Bayliss who had finished telephoning to the garage for missus Crocker s limousine and was about to descend to those lower depths where he had his being turned and a grave smile of welcome played over his face Good morning mister James he said CHAPTER IV JIMMY S DISTURBING NEWS Jimmy Crocker was a tall and well knit young man who later on in the day would no doubt be at least passably good looking At the moment an unbecoming pallor marred his face and beneath his eyes were marks that suggested that he had slept little and ill He stood at the foot of the stairs yawning cavernously Bayliss he said have you been painting yourself yellow No sir Strange Your face looks a bright gamboge to me and your outlines wobble Bayliss never mix your drinks I say this to you as a friend Is there any one in the morning room No mister James Speak softly Bayliss for I am not well I am conscious of a strange weakness Lead me to the morning room then and lay me gently on a sofa These are the times that try men s souls The sun was now shining strongly through the windows of the morning room Bayliss lowered the shades Jimmy Crocker sank onto the sofa and closed his eyes Bayliss Sir A conviction is stealing over me that I am about to expire Shall I bring you a little breakfast mister James A strong shudder shook Jimmy Don t be flippant Bayliss he protested Try to cure yourself of this passion for being funny at the wrong time Your comedy is good but tact is a finer quality than humour Perhaps you think I have forgotten that morning when I was feeling just as I do to day and you came to my bedside and asked me if I would like a nice rasher of ham I haven t and I never shall You may bring me a brandy and soda Not a large one A couple of bath tubs full will be enough Very good mister James And now leave me Bayliss for I would be alone I have to make a series of difficult and exhaustive tests to ascertain whether I am still alive When the butler had gone Jimmy adjusted the cushions closed his eyes and remained for a space in a state of coma He was trying as well as an exceedingly severe headache would permit to recall the salient events of the previous night At present his memories refused to solidify They poured about in his brain in a fluid and formless condition exasperating to one who sought for hard facts It seemed strange to Jimmy that the shadowy and inchoate vision of a combat a fight a brawl of some kind persisted in flitting about in the recesses of his mind always just far enough away to elude capture The absurdity of the thing annoyed him A man has either indulged in a fight overnight or he has not indulged in a fight overnight There can be no middle course That he should be uncertain on the point was ridiculous Yet try as he would he could not be sure There were moments when he seemed on the very verge of settling the matter and then some invisible person would meanly insert a red hot corkscrew in the top of his head and begin to twist it and this would interfere with calm thought He was still in a state of uncertainty when Bayliss returned bearing healing liquids on a tray Shall I set it beside you sir Jimmy opened one eye Indubitably No mean word that Bayliss for the morning after Try it yourself next time Bayliss who let me in this morning Let you in sir Precisely I was out and now I am in Obviously I must have passed the front door somehow This is logic I fancy you let yourself in mister James with your key That would seem to indicate that I was in a state of icy sobriety Yet if such is the case how is it that I can t remember whether I murdered somebody or not last night It isn t the sort of thing your sober man would lightly forget Have you ever murdered anybody Bayliss No sir Well if you had you would remember it next morning I imagine so mister James Well it s a funny thing but I can t get rid of the impression that at some point in my researches into the night life of London yestreen I fell upon some person to whom I had never been introduced and committed mayhem upon his person It seemed to Bayliss that the time had come to impart to mister James a piece of news which he had supposed would require no imparting He looked down upon his young master s recumbent form with a grave commiseration It was true that he had never been able to tell with any certainty whether mister James intended the statements he made to be taken literally or not but on the present occasion he seemed to have spoken seriously and to be genuinely at a loss to recall an episode over the printed report of which the entire domestic staff had been gloating ever since the arrival of the halfpenny morning paper to which they subscribed Do you really mean it mister James he enquired cautiously Mean what You have really forgotten that you were engaged in a fracas last night at the Six Hundred Club Jimmy sat up with a jerk staring at this omniscient man Then the movement having caused a renewal of the operations of the red hot corkscrew he fell back again with a groan Was I How on earth did you know Why should you know all about it when I can t remember a thing It was my fault not yours There is quite a long report of it in to day s Daily Sun mister James A report In the Sun Half a column mister James Would you like me to fetch the paper I have it in my pantry I should say so Trot a quick heat back with it This wants looking into Bayliss retired to return immediately with the paper Jimmy took it gazed at it and handed it back I overestimated my powers It can t be done Have you any important duties at the moment Bayliss No sir Perhaps you wouldn t mind reading me the bright little excerpt then Certainly sir It will be good practice for you I am convinced I am going to be a confirmed invalid for the rest of my life and it will be part of your job to sit at my bedside and read to me By the way does the paper say who the party of the second part was Who was the citizen with whom I went to the mat Lord Percy Whipple mister James Lord who Lord Percy Whipple Never heard of him Carry on Bayliss Jimmy composed himself to listen yawning CHAPTER V THE MORNING AFTER Bayliss took a spectacle case from the recesses of his costume opened it took out a pair of gold rimmed glasses dived into the jungle again came out with a handkerchief polished the spectacles put them on his nose closed the case restored it to its original position replaced the handkerchief and took up the paper Why the hesitation Bayliss Why the coyness enquired Jimmy lying with closed eyes Begin I was adjusting my glasses sir All set now Yes sir Shall I read the headlines first Read everything The butler cleared his throat Good Heavens Bayliss moaned Jimmy starting don t gargle Have a heart Go on Bayliss began to read FRACAS IN FASHIONABLE NIGHT CLUB SPRIGS OF NOBILITY BRAWL Jimmy opened his eyes interested Am I a sprig of nobility It is what the paper says sir We live and learn Carry on The butler started to clear his throat but checked himself SENSATIONAL INTERNATIONAL CONTEST BATTLING PERCY England v CYCLONE JIM America FULL DESCRIPTION BY OUR EXPERT Jimmy sat up Bayliss you re indulging that distorted sense of humour of yours again That isn t in the paper Yes sir Very large headlines Jimmy groaned Bayliss I ll give you a piece of advice which may be useful to you when you grow up Never go about with newspaper men It all comes back to me Out of pure kindness of heart I took young Bill Blake of the Sun to supper at the Six Hundred last night This is my reward I suppose he thinks it funny Newspaper men are a low lot Bayliss Shall I go on sir Most doubtless Let me hear all Bayliss resumed He was one of those readers who whether their subject be a murder case or a funny anecdote adopt a measured and sepulchral delivery which gives a suggestion of tragedy and horror to whatever they read At the church which he attended on Sundays of which he was one of the most influential and respected members children would turn pale and snuggle up to their mothers when Bayliss read the lessons Young mister Blake s account of the overnight proceedings at the Six Hundred Club he rendered with a gloomy gusto more marked even than his wont It had a topical interest for him which urged him to extend himself At an early hour this morning when our myriad readers were enjoying that refreshing and brain restoring sleep so necessary to the proper appreciation of the Daily Sun at the breakfast table one of the most interesting sporting events of the season was being pulled off at the Six Hundred Club in Regent Street where after three rounds of fast exchanges James B Crocker the well known American welter weight scrapper succeeded in stopping Lord Percy Whipple second son of the Duke of Devizes better known as the Pride of Old England Once again the superiority of the American over the English style of boxing was demonstrated Battling Percy has a kind heart but Cyclone Jim packs the punch The immediate cause of the encounter had to do with a disputed table which each gladiator claimed to have engaged in advance over the telephone I begin to remember said Jimmy meditatively A pill with butter coloured hair tried to jump my claim Honeyed words proving fruitless I soaked him on the jaw It may be that I was not wholly myself I seem to remember an animated session at the Empire earlier in the evening which may have impaired my self control Proceed One word leading to others which in their turn led to several more Cyclone Jim struck Battling Percy on what our rude forefathers were accustomed to describe as the mazzard and the gong sounded for ROUND ONE Both men came up fresh and eager to mix things though it seems only too probable that they had already been mixing more things than was good for them Battling Percy tried a right swing which got home on a waiter Cyclone Jim put in a rapid one two punch which opened a large gash in the atmosphere Both men sparred cautiously being hampered in their movements by the fact which neither had at this stage of the proceedings perceived that they were on opposite sides of the disputed table A clever Fitzsimmons shift on the part of the Battler removed this obstacle and some brisk work ensued in neutral territory Percy landed twice without a return The Battler s round by a shade ROUND TWO The Cyclone came out of his corner with a rush getting home on the Battler s shirt front and following it up with a right to the chin Percy swung wildly and upset a bottle of champagne on a neighbouring table A good rally followed both men doing impressive in fighting The Cyclone landed three without a return The Cyclone s round ROUND THREE Percy came up weak seeming to be overtrained The Cyclone waded in using both hands effectively The Battler fell into a clinch but the Cyclone broke away and measuring his distance picked up a haymaker from the floor and put it over Percy down and out Interviewed by our representative after the fight Cyclone Jim said The issue was never in doubt I was handicapped at the outset by the fact that I was under the impression that I was fighting three twin brothers and I missed several opportunities of putting over the winning wallop by attacking the outside ones It was only in the second round that I decided to concentrate my assault on the one in the middle when the affair speedily came to a conclusion I shall not adopt pugilism as a profession The prizes are attractive but it is too much like work Bayliss ceased and silence fell upon the room Is that all That is all sir And about enough Very true sir You know Bayliss said Jimmy thoughtfully rolling over on the couch life is peculiar not to say odd You never know what is waiting for you round the corner You start the day with the fairest prospects and before nightfall everything is as rocky and ding basted as stig tossed full of doodlegammon Why is this Bayliss I couldn t say sir Look at me I go out to spend a happy evening meaning no harm to any one and I come back all blue with the blood of the aristocracy We now come to a serious point Do you think my lady stepmother has read that sporting chronicle I fancy not mister James On what do you base these words of comfort missus Crocker does not read the halfpenny papers sir True She does not I had forgotten On the other hand the probability that she will learn about the little incident from other sources is great I think the merest prudence suggests that I keep out of the way for the time being lest I be fallen upon and questioned I am not equal to being questioned this morning I have a headache which starts at the soles of my feet and gets worse all the way up Where is my stepmother missus Crocker is in her room mister James She ordered the car to be brought round at once It should be here at any moment now sir I think missus Crocker intends to visit the Park before luncheon Is she lunching out Yes sir Then if I pursue the excellent common sense tactics of the lesser sand eel which as you doubtless know buries itself tail upwards in the mud on hearing the baying of the eel hounds and remains in that position till the danger is past I shall be able to postpone an interview Should you be questioned as to my whereabouts inflate your chest and reply in a clear and manly voice that I have gone out you know not where May I rely on your benevolent neutrality Bayliss Very good mister James I think I will go and sit in my father s den A man may lie hid there with some success as a rule Jimmy heaved himself painfully off the sofa blinked and set out for the den where his father in a deep arm chair was smoking a restful pipe and reading the portions of the daily papers which did not deal with the game of cricket mister Crocker s den was a small room at the back of the house It was not luxurious and it looked out onto a blank wall but it was the spot he liked best in all that vast pile which had once echoed to the tread of titled shoes for as he sometimes observed to his son it had the distinction of being the only room on the ground floor where a fellow could move without stubbing his toe on a countess or an honourable In this peaceful backwater he could smoke a pipe put his feet up take off his coat and generally indulge in that liberty and pursuit of happiness to which the Constitution entitles a free born American Nobody ever came there except Jimmy and himself He did not suspend his reading at his son s entrance He muttered a welcome through the clouds but he did not raise his eyes Jimmy took the other arm chair and began to smoke silently It was the unwritten law of the den that soothing silence rather than aimless chatter should prevail It was not until a quarter of an hour had passed that mister Crocker dropped his paper and spoke Say Jimmy I want to talk to you Say on You have our ear Seriously Continue always however keeping before you the fact that I am a sick man Last night was a wild night on the moors dad It s about your stepmother She was talking at breakfast about you She s sore at you for giving Spike Dillon lunch at the Carlton You oughtn t to have taken him there Jimmy That s what got her goat She was there with a bunch of swells and they had to sit and listen to Spike talking about his half scissors hook What s their kick against Spike s half scissors hook It s a darned good one She said she was going to speak to you about it I thought I d let you know Thanks dad But was that all All All that she was going to speak to me about Sure there was nothing else She didn t say anything about anything else Then she doesn t know Fine mister Crocker s feet came down from the mantelpiece with a crash Jimmy You haven t been raising Cain again No no dad Nothing serious High spirited Young Patrician stuff the sort of thing that s expected of a fellow in my position mister Crocker was not to be comforted Jimmy you ve got to pull up Honest you have I don t care for myself I like to see a boy having a good time But your stepmother says you re apt to queer us with the people up top the way you re going on Lord knows I wouldn t care if things were different but I ll tell you exactly how I stand I didn t get wise till this morning Your stepmother sprang it on me suddenly I ve often wondered what all this stuff was about this living in London and trailing the swells I couldn t think what was your stepmother s idea Now I know Jimmy she s trying to get them to make me a peer What Just that And she says But dad this is rich This is comedy of a high order A peer Good Heavens if it comes off what shall I be This title business is all so complicated I know I should have to change my name to honorable Rollo Cholmondeley or the honorable Aubrey Marjoribanks but what I want to know is which I want to be prepared for the worst And you see Jimmy these people up top the guys who arrange the giving of titles are keeping an eye on you because you would have the title after me and naturally they don t want to get stung I gathered all that from your stepmother Say Jimmy I m not asking a lot of you but there is just one thing you can do for me without putting yourself out too much I ll do it dad if it kills me Slip me the info Your stepmother s friend Lady Corstorphine s nephew It s not the sort of story to ask a man with a headache to follow I hope it gets simpler as it goes along Your stepmother wants you to be a good fellow and make friends with this boy You see his father is in right with the Premier and has the biggest kind of a pull when it comes to handing out titles Is that all you want Leave it to me Inside of a week I ll be playing kiss in the ring with him The whole force of my sunny personality shall be directed towards making him love me What s his name Lord Percy Whipple Jimmy s pipe fell with a clatter Dad pull yourself together Reflect You know you don t seriously mean Lord Percy Whipple Eh Jimmy laid a soothing hand on his father s shoulder Dad prepare yourself for the big laugh This is where you throw your head back and roar with honest mirth I met Lord Percy Whipple last night at the Six Hundred Club Words ensued I fell upon Percy and beat his block off How it started except that we both wanted the same table I couldn t say Why that I cannot tell said he but twas a famous victory If I had known dad nothing would have induced me to lay a hand upon Perce save in the way of kindness but not even knowing who he was it would appear from contemporary accounts of the affair that I just naturally sailed in and expunged the poor dear boy The stunning nature of this information had much the same effect on mister Crocker as the announcement of his ruin has upon the Good Old Man in melodrama He sat clutching the arms of his chair and staring into space saying nothing Dismay was written upon his anguished countenance His collapse sobered Jimmy For the first time he perceived that the situation had another side than the humorous one which had appealed to him He had anticipated that mister Crocker who as a general thing shared his notions of what was funny and could be relied on to laugh in the right place would have been struck like himself by the odd and pleasing coincidence of his having picked on for purposes of assault and battery the one young man with whom his stepmother wished him to form a firm and lasting friendship He perceived now that his father was seriously upset Neither Jimmy nor mister Crocker possessed a demonstrative nature but there had always existed between them the deepest affection Jimmy loved his father as he loved nobody else in the world and the thought of having hurt him was like a physical pain His laughter died away and he set himself with a sinking heart to try to undo the effect of his words I m awfully sorry dad I had no idea you would care I wouldn t have done a fool thing like that for a million dollars if I d known Isn t there anything I can do Gee whiz I ll go right round to Percy now and apologise I ll lick his boots Don t you worry dad I ll make it all right The whirl of words roused mister Crocker from his thoughts It doesn t matter Jimmy Don t worry yourself It s only a little unfortunate because your stepmother says she won t think of our going back to America till these people here have given me a title She wants to put one over on her sister That s all that s troubling me the thought that this affair will set us back this Lord Percy being in so strong with the guys who give the titles I guess it will mean my staying on here for a while longer and I d liked to have seen another ball game Jimmy do you know they call baseball Rounders in this country and children play it with a soft ball Jimmy was striding up and down the little room Remorse had him in its grip What a damned fool I am Never mind Jimmy It s unfortunate but it wasn t your fault You couldn t know It was my fault Nobody but a fool like me would go about beating people up But don t worry dad It s going to be all right I ll fix it I m going right round to this fellow Percy now to make things all right I won t come back till I ve squared him Don t you bother yourself about it any longer dad It s going to be all right CHAPTER VI JIMMY ABANDONS PICCADILLY Jimmy removed himself sorrowfully from the doorstep of the Duke of Devizes house in Cleveland Row His mission had been a failure In answer to his request to be permitted to see Lord Percy Whipple the butler had replied that Lord Percy was confined to his bed and was seeing nobody He eyed Jimmy on receiving his name with an interest which he failed to conceal for he too like Bayliss had read and heartily enjoyed Bill Blake s spirited version of the affair of last night which had appeared in the Daily Sun Indeed he had clipped the report out and had been engaged in pasting it in an album when the bell rang In face of this repulse Jimmy s campaign broke down He was at a loss to know what to do next He ebbed away from the Duke s front door like an army that has made an unsuccessful frontal attack on an impregnable fortress He could hardly force his way in and search for Lord Percy He walked along Pall Mall deep in thought It was a beautiful day The rain which had fallen in the night and relieved mister Crocker from the necessity of watching cricket had freshened London up The sun was shining now from a turquoise sky A gentle breeze blew from the south Jimmy made his way into Piccadilly and found that thoroughfare a roar with happy automobilists and cheery pedestrians Their gaiety irritated him He resented their apparent enjoyment of life Jimmy s was not a nature that lent itself readily to introspection but he was putting himself now through a searching self examination which was revealing all kinds of unsuspected flaws in his character He had been having too good a time for years past to have leisure to realise that he possessed any responsibilities He had lived each day as it came in the spirit of the Monks of Thelema But his father s reception of the news of last night s escapade and the few words he had said had given him pause Life had taken on of a sudden a less simple aspect Dimly for he was not accustomed to thinking along these lines he perceived the numbing truth that we human beings are merely as many pieces in a jig saw puzzle and that our every movement affects the fortunes of some other piece

none	none	faintly at first and taking shape by degrees must the germ of civic spirit have come to Prehistoric Man We are all individualists till we wake up The thought of having done anything to make his father unhappy was bitter to Jimmy Crocker They had always been more like brothers than father and son Hard thoughts about himself surged through Jimmy s mind With a dejectedness to which it is possible that his headache contributed he put the matter squarely to himself His father was longing to return to America he Jimmy by his idiotic behaviour was putting obstacles in the way of that return what was the answer The answer to Jimmy s way of thinking was that all was not well with James Crocker that when all the evidence was weighed James Crocker would appear to be a fool a worm a selfish waster and a hopeless low down skunk Having come to this conclusion Jimmy found himself so low in spirit that the cheerful bustle of Piccadilly was too much for him He turned and began to retrace his steps Arriving in due course at the top of the Haymarket he hesitated then turned down it till he reached Cockspur Street Here the Trans Atlantic steamship companies have their offices and so it came about that Jimmy chancing to look up as he walked perceived before him riding gallantly on a cardboard ocean behind a plate glass window the model of a noble vessel He stopped conscious of a curious thrill There is a superstition in all of us When an accidental happening chances to fit smoothly in with a mood seeming to come as a direct commentary on that mood we are apt to accept it in defiance of our pure reason as an omen Jimmy strode to the window and inspected the model narrowly The sight of it had started a new train of thought His heart began to race Hypnotic influences were at work on him

none	none	Could there be a simpler solution of the whole trouble Inside the office he would see a man with whiskers buying a ticket for New York The simplicity of the process fascinated him All you had to do was to walk in bend over the counter while the clerk behind it made dabs with a pencil at the illustrated plate of the ship s interior organs and hand over your money A child could do it if in funds At this thought his hand strayed to his trouser pocket A musical crackling of bank notes proceeded from the depths His quarterly allowance had been paid to him only a short while before and though a willing spender he still retained a goodly portion of it He rustled the notes again There was enough in that pocket to buy three tickets to New York Should he Or on the other hand always look on both sides of the question should he not It would certainly seem to be the best thing for all parties if he did follow the impulse By remaining in London he was injuring everybody himself included Well there was no harm in making enquiries Probably the boat was full up anyway He walked into the office Have you anything left on the Atlantic this trip The clerk behind the counter was quite the wrong sort of person for Jimmy to have had dealings with in his present mood What Jimmy needed was a grave sensible man who would have laid a hand on his shoulder and said Do nothing rash my boy The clerk fell short of this ideal in practically every particular He was about twenty two and he seemed perfectly enthusiastic about the idea of Jimmy going to America He beamed at Jimmy Plenty of room he said Very few people crossing Give you excellent accommodation When does the boat sail Eight to morrow morning from Liverpool Boat train leaves Paddington six to night Prudence came at the eleventh hour to check Jimmy This was not a matter he perceived to be decided recklessly on the spur of a sudden impulse Above all it was not a matter to be decided before lunch An empty stomach breeds imagination He had ascertained that he could sail on the Atlantic if he wished to The sensible thing to do now was to go and lunch and see how he felt about it after that He thanked the clerk and started to walk up the Haymarket feeling hard headed and practical yet with a strong premonition that he was going to make a fool of himself just the same It was half way up the Haymarket that he first became conscious of the girl with the red hair Plunged in thought he had not noticed her before And yet she had been walking a few paces in front of him most of the way She had come out of Panton Street walking briskly as one going to keep a pleasant appointment She carried herself admirably with a jaunty swing Having become conscious of this girl Jimmy ever a warm admirer of the sex began to feel a certain interest stealing over him With interest came speculation He wondered who she was He wondered where she had bought that excellently fitting suit of tailor made grey He admired her back and wondered whether her face if seen would prove a disappointment Thus musing he drew near to the top of the Haymarket where it ceases to be a street and becomes a whirlpool of rushing traffic And here the girl having paused and looked over her shoulder stepped off the sidewalk As she did so a taxi cab rounded the corner quickly from the direction of Coventry Street The agreeable surprise of finding the girl s face fully as attractive as her back had stimulated Jimmy so that he was keyed up for the exhibition of swift presence of mind He jumped forward and caught her arm and swung her to one side as the cab rattled past its driver thinking hard thoughts to himself The whole episode was an affair of seconds Thank you said the girl She rubbed the arm which he had seized with rather a rueful expression She was a little white and her breath came quickly I hope I didn t hurt you said Jimmy You did Very much But the taxi would have hurt me more She laughed She looked very attractive when she laughed She had a small piquant vivacious face Jimmy as he looked at it had an odd feeling that he had seen her before when and where he did not know That mass of red gold hair seemed curiously familiar Somewhere in the hinterland of his mind there lurked a memory but he could not bring it into the open As for the girl if she had ever met him before she showed no signs of recollecting it Jimmy decided that if he had seen her it must have been in his reporter days She was plainly an American and he occasionally had the feeling that he had seen every one in America when he had worked for the Chronicle That s right he said approvingly Always look on the bright side I only arrived in London yesterday said the girl and I haven t got used to your keeping to the left rules I don t suppose I shall ever get back to New York alive Perhaps as you have saved my life you wouldn t mind doing me another service Can you tell me which is the nearest and safest way to a restaurant called the Regent Grill It s just over there at the corner of Regent Street As to the safest way if I were you I should cross over at the top of the street there and then work round westward Otherwise you will have to cross Piccadilly Circus I absolutely refuse even to try to cross Piccadilly Circus Thank you very much I will follow your advice I hope I shall get there It doesn t seem at all likely She gave him a little nod and moved away Jimmy turned into that drug store at the top of the Haymarket at which so many Londoners have found healing and comfort on the morning after and bought the pink drink for which his system had been craving since he rose from bed He wondered why as he drained it he should feel ashamed and guilty A few minutes later he found himself with mild surprise going down the steps of the Regent Grill It was the last place he had had in his mind when he had left the steamship company s offices in quest of lunch He had intended to seek out some quiet restful nook where he could be alone with his thoughts If anybody had told him then that five minutes later he would be placing himself of his own free will within the range of a restaurant orchestra playing My Little Grey Home in the West and the orchestra at the Regent played little else he would not have believed him Restaurants in all large cities have their ups and downs At this time the Regent Grill was enjoying one of those bursts of popularity for which restaurateurs pray to whatever strange gods they worship The more prosperous section of London s Bohemia flocked to it daily When Jimmy had deposited his hat with the robber band who had their cave just inside the main entrance and had entered the grill room he found it congested There did not appear to be a single unoccupied table From where he stood he could see the girl of the red gold hair Her back was towards him and she was sitting at a table against one of the pillars with a little man with eye glasses a handsome woman in the forties and a small stout boy who was skirmishing with the olives As Jimmy hesitated the vigilant head waiter who knew him well perceived him and hurried up In one moment Mister Crockaire he said and began to scatter commands among the underlings I will place a table for you in the aisle Next to that pillar please said Jimmy The underlings had produced a small table apparently from up their sleeves and were draping it in a cloth Jimmy sat down and gave his order Ordering was going on at the other table The little man seemed depressed at the discovery that corn on the cob and soft shelled crabs were not to be obtained and his wife s reception of the news that clams were not included in the Regent s bill of fare was so indignant that one would have said that she regarded the fact as evidence that Great Britain was going to pieces and would shortly lose her place as a world power A selection having finally been agreed upon the orchestra struck up My Little Grey Home in the West and no attempt was made to compete with it When the last lingering strains had died away and the violinist leader having straightened out the kinks in his person which the rendition of the melody never failed to produce had bowed for the last time a clear musical voice spoke from the other side of the pillar Jimmy Crocker is a WORM Jimmy spilled his cocktail It might have been the voice of Conscience I despise him more than any one on earth I hate to think that he s an American Jimmy drank the few drops that remained in his glass partly to make sure of them partly as a restorative It is an unnerving thing to be despised by a red haired girl whose life you have just saved To Jimmy it was not only unnerving it was uncanny This girl had not known him when they met on the street a few moments before How then was she able to display such intimate acquaintance with his character now as to describe him justly enough as a worm Mingled with the mystery of the thing was its pathos The thought that a girl could be as pretty as this one and yet dislike him so much was one of the saddest things Jimmy had ever come across It was like one of those Things Which Make Me Weep In This Great City so dear to the hearts of the sob writers of his late newspaper A waiter bustled up with a high ball Jimmy thanked him with his eyes He needed it He raised it to his lips He s always drinking He set it down hurriedly and making a disgraceful exhibition of himself in public I always think Jimmy Crocker Jimmy began to wish that somebody would stop this girl Why couldn t the little man change the subject to the weather or that stout child start prattling about some general topic Surely a boy of that age newly arrived in London must have all sorts of things to prattle about But the little man was dealing strenuously with a breaded cutlet while the stout boy grimly silent surrounded fish pie in the forthright manner of a starving python As for the elder woman she seemed to be wrestling with unpleasant thoughts beyond speech I always think that Jimmy Crocker is the worst case I know of the kind of American young man who spends all his time in Europe and tries to become an imitation Englishman Most of them are the sort any country would be glad to get rid of but he used to work once so you can t excuse him on the ground that he hasn t the sense to know what he s doing He s deliberately chosen to loaf about London and make a pest of himself He went to pieces with his eyes open He s a perfect utter hopeless WORM Jimmy had never been very fond of the orchestra at the Regent Grill holding the view that it interfered with conversation and made for an unhygienic rapidity of mastication but he was profoundly grateful to it now for bursting suddenly into La Boheme the loudest item in its repertory Under cover of that protective din he was able to toy with a steaming dish which his waiter had brought Probably that girl was saying all sorts of things about him still but he could not hear them The music died away For a moment the tortured air quivered in comparative silence then the girl s voice spoke again She had however selected another topic of conversation I ve seen all I want to of England she said I ve seen Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament and His Majesty s Theatre and the Savoy and the Cheshire Cheese and I ve developed a frightful home sickness Why shouldn t we go back to morrow For the first time in the proceedings the elder woman spoke She cast aside her mantle of gloom long enough to say Yes then wrapped it round her again The little man who had apparently been waiting for her vote before giving his own said that the sooner he was on board a New York bound boat the better he would be pleased The stout boy said nothing He had finished his fish pie and was now attacking jam roll with a sort of morose resolution There s certain to be a boat said the girl There always is You ve got to say that for England it s an easy place to get back to America from She paused What I can t understand is how after having been in America and knowing what it was like Jimmy Crocker could stand living The waiter had come to Jimmy s side bearing cheese but Jimmy looked at it with dislike and shook his head in silent negation He was about to depart from this place His capacity for absorbing home truths about himself was exhausted He placed a noiseless sovereign on the table caught the waiter s eye registered renunciation and departed soft footed down the aisle The waiter a man who had never been able to bring himself to believe in miracles revised the views of a life time He looked at the sovereign then at Jimmy then at the sovereign again Then he took up the coin and bit it furtively A few minutes later a hat check boy untipped for the first time in his predatory career was staring at Jimmy with equal intensity but with far different feelings Speechless concern was limned on his young face The commissionaire at the Piccadilly entrance of the restaurant touched his hat ingratiatingly with the smug confidence of a man who is accustomed to getting sixpence a time for doing it Taxi mister Crocker A worm said Jimmy Beg pardon sir Always drinking explained Jimmy and making a pest of himself He passed on The commissionaire stared after him as intently as the waiter and the hat check boy He had sometimes known mister Crocker like this after supper but never before during the luncheon hour Jimmy made his way to his club in Northumberland Avenue For perhaps half an hour he sat in a condition of coma in the smoking room then his mind made up he went to one of the writing tables He sat awaiting inspiration for some minutes then began to write The letter he wrote was to his father Dear Dad I have been thinking over what we talked about this morning and it seems to me the best thing I can do is to drop out of sight for a brief space If I stay on in London I am likely at any moment to pull some boner like last night s which will spill the beans for you once more The least I can do for you is to give you a clear field and not interfere so I am off to New York by to night s boat I went round to Percy s to try to grovel in the dust before him but he wouldn t see me It s no good grovelling in the dust of the front steps for the benefit of a man who s in bed on the second floor so I withdrew in more or less good order I then got the present idea Mark how all things work together for good When they come to you and say No title for you Your son slugged our pal Percy all you have to do is to come back at them with I know my son slugged Percy and believe me I didn t do a thing to him I packed him off to America within twenty four hours Get me right boys I m anti Jimmy and pro Percy To which their reply will be Oh well in that case arise Lord Crocker or whatever they say when slipping a title to a deserving guy So you will see that by making this getaway I am doing the best I can to put things straight I shall give this to Bayliss to give to you I am going to call him up on the phone in a minute to have him pack a few simple tooth brushes and so on for me On landing in New York I shall instantly proceed to the Polo Grounds to watch a game of Rounders and will cable you the full score Well I think that s about all So good bye or even farewell for the present J P S I know you ll understand dad I m doing what seems to me the only possible thing Don t worry about me I shall be all right I ll get back my old job and be a terrific success all round You go ahead and get that title and then meet me at the entrance of the Polo Grounds I ll be looking for you P P S I m a worm The young clerk at the steamship offices appeared rejoiced to see Jimmy once more With a sunny smile he snatched a pencil from his ear and plunged it into the vitals of the Atlantic How about E a hundred and eight Suits me You re too late to go in the passenger list of course Jimmy did not reply He was gazing rigidly at a girl who had just come in a girl with red hair and a friendly smile So you re sailing on the Atlantic too she said with a glance at the chart on the counter How odd We have just decided to go back on her too There s nothing to keep us here and we re all homesick Well you see I wasn t run over after I left you A delicious understanding relieved Jimmy s swimming brain as thunder relieves the tense and straining air The feeling that he was going mad left him as the simple solution of his mystery came to him This girl must have heard of him in New York perhaps she knew people whom he knew and it was on hearsay not on personal acquaintance that she based that dislike of him which she had expressed with such freedom and conviction so short a while before at the Regent Grill She did not know who he was Into this soothing stream of thought cut the voice of the clerk What name please Jimmy s mind rocked again Why were these things happening to him to day of all days when he needed the tenderest treatment when he had a headache already The clerk was eyeing him expectantly He had laid down his pencil and was holding aloft a pen Jimmy gulped Every name in the English language had passed from his mind And then from out of the dark came inspiration Bayliss he croaked The girl held out her hand Then we can introduce ourselves at last My name is Ann Chester How do you do mister Bayliss How do you do Miss Chester The clerk had finished writing the ticket and was pressing labels and a pink paper on him The paper he gathered dully was a form and had to be filled up He examined it and found it to be a searching document Some of its questions could be answered off hand others required thought Height Simple Five foot eleven Hair Simple Brown Eyes Simple again Blue Next queries of a more offensive kind Are you a polygamist He could answer that Decidedly no One wife would be ample provided she had red gold hair brown gold eyes the right kind of mouth and a dimple Whatever doubts there might be in his mind on other points on that one he had none whatever Have you ever been in prison Not yet And then a very difficult one Are you a lunatic Jimmy hesitated The ink dried on his pen He was wondering In the dim cavern of Paddington Station the boat train snorted impatiently varying the process with an occasional sharp shriek The hands of the station clock pointed to ten minutes to six The platform was a confused mass of travellers porters baggage trucks boys with buns and fruits boys with magazines friends relatives and Bayliss the butler standing like a faithful watchdog beside a large suitcase To the human surf that broke and swirled about him he paid no attention He was looking for the young master Jimmy clove the crowd like a one man flying wedge Two fruit and bun boys who impeded his passage drifted away like leaves on an Autumn gale Good man He possessed himself of the suitcase I was afraid you might not be able to get here The mistress is dining out mister James I was able to leave the house Have you packed everything I shall want Within the scope of a suitcase yes sir Splendid Oh by the way give this letter to my father will you Very good sir I m glad you were able to manage I thought your voice sounded doubtful over the phone I was a good deal taken aback mister James Your decision to leave was so extremely sudden So was Columbus You know about him He saw an egg standing on its head and whizzed off like a jack rabbit If you will pardon the liberty mister James is it not a little rash Don t take the joy out of life Bayliss I may be a chump but try to forget it Use your willpower Good evening mister Bayliss said a voice behind them They both turned The butler was gazing rather coyly at a vision in a grey tailor made suit Good evening miss he said doubtfully Ann looked at him in astonishment then broke into a smile How stupid of me I meant this mister Bayliss Your son We met at the steamship offices And before that he saved my life So we are old friends Bayliss gaping perplexedly and feeling unequal to the intellectual pressure of the conversation was surprised further to perceive a warning scowl on the face of his mister James Jimmy had not foreseen this thing but he had a quick mind and was equal to it How are you Miss Chester My father has come down to see me off This is Miss Chester dad A British butler is not easily robbed of his poise but Bayliss was frankly unequal to the sudden demand on his presence of mind He lowered his jaw an inch or two but spoke no word Dad s a little upset at my going whispered Jimmy confidentially He s not quite himself Ann was a girl possessed not only of ready tact but of a kind heart She had summed up mister Bayliss at a glance Every line of him proclaimed him a respectable upper servant No girl on earth could have been freer than she of snobbish prejudice but she could not check a slight thrill of surprise and disappointment at the discovery of Jimmy s humble origin She understood everything and there were tears in her eyes as she turned away to avoid intruding on the last moments of the parting of father and son I ll see you on the boat mister Bayliss she said Eh said Bayliss Yes yes said Jimmy Good bye till then Ann walked on to her compartment She felt as if she had just read a whole long novel one of those chunky younger English novelist things She knew the whole story as well as if it had been told to her in detail She could see the father the honest steady butler living his life with but one aim to make a gentleman of his beloved only son Year by year he had saved Probably he had sent the son to college And now with a father s blessing and the remains of a father s savings the boy was setting out for the New World where dollar bills grew on trees and no one asked or cared who any one else s father might be There was a lump in her throat Bayliss would have been amazed if he could have known what a figure of pathetic fineness he seemed to her And then her thoughts turned to Jimmy and she was aware of a glow of kindliness towards him His father had succeeded in his life s ambition He had produced a gentleman How easily and simply without a trace of snobbish shame the young man had introduced his father There was the right stuff in him He was not ashamed of the humble man who had given him his chance in life She found herself liking Jimmy amazingly The hands of the clock pointed to three minutes to the hour Porters skimmed to and fro like water beetles I can t explain said Jimmy It wasn t temporary insanity it was necessity Very good mister James I think you had better be taking your seat now Quite right I had It would spoil the whole thing if they left me behind Bayliss did you ever see such eyes Such hair Look after my father while I am away Don t let the dukes worry him Oh and Bayliss Jimmy drew his hand from his pocket as one pal to another Bayliss looked at the crackling piece of paper I couldn t mister James I really couldn t A five pound note I couldn t Nonsense Be a sport Begging your pardon mister James I really couldn t You cannot afford to throw away your money like this You cannot have a great deal of it if you will excuse me for saying so I won t do anything of the sort Grab it Oh Lord the train s starting Good bye Bayliss The engine gave a final shriek of farewell The train began to slide along the platform pursued to the last by optimistic boys offering buns for sale It gathered speed Jimmy leaning out the window was amazed at a spectacle so unusual as practically to amount to a modern miracle the spectacled Bayliss running The butler was not in the pink of condition but he was striding out gallantly He reached the door of Jimmy s compartment and raised his hand Begging your pardon mister James he panted for taking the liberty but I really couldn t He reached up and thrust something into Jimmy s hand something crisp and crackling Then his mission performed fell back and stood waving a snowy handkerchief The train plunged into the tunnel Jimmy stared at the five pound note He was aware like Ann farther along the train of a lump in his throat He put the note slowly into his pocket The train moved on CHAPTER VII ON THE BOAT DECK Rising waters and a fine flying scud that whipped stingingly over the side had driven most of the passengers on the Atlantic to the shelter of their staterooms or to the warm stuffiness of the library It was the fifth evening of the voyage For five days and four nights the ship had been racing through a placid ocean on her way to Sandy Hook but in the early hours of this afternoon the wind had shifted to the north bringing heavy seas Darkness had begun to fall now The sky was a sullen black The white crests of the rollers gleamed faintly in the dusk and the wind sang in the ropes Jimmy and Ann had had the boat deck to themselves for half an hour Jimmy was a good sailor it exhilarated him to fight the wind and to walk a deck that heaved and dipped and shuddered beneath his feet but he had not expected to have Ann s company on such an evening But she had come out of the saloon entrance her small face framed in a hood and her slim body shapeless beneath a great cloak and joined him in his walk Jimmy was in a mood of exaltation He had passed the last few days in a condition of intermittent melancholy consequent on the discovery that he was not the only man on board the Atlantic who desired the society of Ann as an alleviation of the tedium of an ocean voyage The world when he embarked on this venture had consisted so exclusively of Ann and himself that until the ship was well on its way to Queenstown he had not conceived the possibility of intrusive males forcing their unwelcome attentions on her And it had added bitterness to the bitter awakening that their attentions did not appear to be at all unwelcome Almost immediately after breakfast on the very first day a creature with a small black moustache and shining teeth had descended upon Ann and vocal with surprise and pleasure at meeting her again he claimed damn him to have met her before at Palm Beach Bar Harbor and a dozen other places had carried her off to play an idiotic game known as shuffle board Nor was this an isolated case It began to be borne in upon Jimmy that Ann whom he had looked upon purely in the light of an Eve playing opposite his Adam in an exclusive Garden of Eden was an extremely well known and popular character The clerk at the shipping office had lied absurdly when he had said that very few people were crossing on the Atlantic this voyage The vessel was crammed till its sides bulged it was loaded down in utter defiance of the Plimsoll law with Rollos and Clarences and Dwights and Twombleys who had known and golfed and ridden and driven and motored and swum and danced with Ann for years A ghastly being entitled Edgar Something or Teddy Something had beaten Jimmy by a short head in the race for the deck steward the prize of which was the placing of his deck chair next to Ann s Jimmy had been driven from the promenade deck by the spectacle of this beastly creature lying swathed in rugs reading best sellers to her He had scarcely seen her to speak to since the beginning of the voyage When she was not walking with Rolly or playing shuffle board with Twombley she was down below ministering to the comfort of a chronically sea sick aunt referred to in conversation as poor aunt Nesta Sometimes Jimmy saw the little man presumably her uncle in the smoking room and once he came upon the stout boy recovering from the effects of a cigar in a quiet corner of the boat deck but apart from these meetings the family was as distant from him as if he had never seen Ann at all let alone saved her life And now she had dropped down on him from heaven They were alone together with the good clean wind and the bracing scud Rollo Clarence Dwight and Twombley not to mention Edgar or possibly Teddy were down below he hoped dying They had the world to themselves I love rough weather said Ann lifting her face to the wind Her eyes were very bright She was beyond any doubt or question the only girl on earth Poor aunt Nesta doesn t She was bad enough when it was quite calm but this storm has finished her I ve just been down below trying to cheer her up Jimmy thrilled at the picture Always fascinating Ann seemed to him at her best in the role of ministering angel He longed to tell her so but found no words They reached the end of the deck and turned Ann looked up at him I ve hardly seen anything of you since we sailed she said She spoke almost reproachfully Tell me all about yourself mister Bayliss Why are you going to America Jimmy had had an impassioned indictment of the Rollos on his tongue but she had closed the opening for it as quickly as she had made it In face of her direct demand for information he could not hark back to it now After all what did the Rollos matter They had no part in this little wind swept world they were where they belonged in some nether hell on the C or D deck moaning for death To make a fortune I hope he said Ann was pleased at this confirmation of her diagnosis She had deduced this from the evidence at Paddington Station How pleased your father will be if you do The slight complexity of Jimmy s affairs caused him to pause for a moment to sort out his fathers but an instant s reflection told him that she must be referring to Bayliss the butler Yes He s a dear old man said Ann I suppose he s very proud of you I hope so You must do tremendously well in America so as not to disappoint him What are you thinking of doing Jimmy considered for a moment Newspaper work I think Oh Why have you had any experience A little Ann seemed to grow a little aloof as if her enthusiasm had been damped Oh well I suppose it s a good enough profession I m not very fond of it myself I ve only met one newspaper man in my life and I dislike him very much so I suppose that has prejudiced me Who was that You wouldn t have met him He was on an American paper A man named Crocker A sudden gust of wind drove them back a step rendering talk impossible It covered a gap when Jimmy could not have spoken The shock of the information that Ann had met him before made him dumb This thing was beyond him It baffled him Her next words supplied a solution They were under shelter of one of the boats now and she could make herself heard It was five years ago and I only met him for a very short while but the prejudice has lasted Jimmy began to understand Five years ago It was not so strange then that they should not recognise each other now He stirred up his memory Nothing came to the surface Not a gleam of recollection of that early meeting rewarded him And yet something of importance must have happened then for her to remember it Surely his mere personality could not have been so unpleasant as to have made such a lasting impression on her I wish you could do something better than newspaper work said Ann I always think the splendid part about America is that it is such a land of adventure There are such millions of chances It s a place where anything may happen Haven t you an adventurous soul mister Bayliss No man lightly submits to a charge even a hinted charge of being deficient in the capacity for adventure Of course I have said Jimmy indignantly I m game to tackle anything that comes along I m glad of that Her feeling of comradeship towards this young man deepened She loved adventure and based her estimate of any member of the opposite sex largely on his capacity for it She moved in a set when at home which was more polite than adventurous and had frequently found the atmosphere enervating Adventure said Jimmy is everything He paused Or a good deal he concluded weakly Why qualify it like that It sounds so tame Adventure is the biggest thing in life It seemed to Jimmy that he had received an excuse for a remark of a kind that had been waiting for utterance ever since he had met her Often and often in the watches of the night smoking endless pipes and thinking of her he had conjured up just such a vision as this they two walking the deserted deck alone and she innocently giving him an opening for some low voiced tender speech at which she would start look at him quickly and then ask him haltingly if the words had any particular application And after that oh well all sorts of things might happen And now the moment had come It was true that he had always pictured the scene as taking place by moonlight and at present there was a half gale blowing out of an inky sky also on the present occasion anything in the nature of a low voiced speech was absolutely out of the question owing to the uproar of the elements Still taking these drawbacks into consideration the chance was far too good to miss Such an opening might never happen again He waited till the ship had steadied herself after an apparently suicidal dive into an enormous roller then staggering back to her side spoke Love is the biggest thing in life he roared What is shrieked Ann Love bellowed Jimmy He wished a moment later that he had postponed this statement of faith for their next steps took them into a haven of comparative calm where some dimly seen portion of the vessel s anatomy jutted out and formed a kind of nook where it was possible to hear the ordinary tones of the human voice He halted here and Ann did the same though unwillingly She was conscious of a feeling of disappointment and of a modification of her mood of comradeship towards her companion She held strong views which she believed to be unalterable on the subject under discussion Love she said It was too dark to see her face but her voice sounded unpleasantly scornful I shouldn t have thought that you would have been so conventional as that You seemed different Eh said Jimmy blankly I hate all this talk about Love as if it were something wonderful that was worth everything else in life put together Every book you read and every song that you see in the shop windows is all about Love It s as if the whole world were in a conspiracy to persuade themselves that there s a wonderful something just round the corner which they can get if they try hard enough And they hypnotise themselves into thinking of nothing else and miss all the splendid things of life That s Shaw isn t it said Jimmy What is Shaw What you were saying It s out of one of Bernard Shaw s things isn t it It is not A note of acidity had crept into Ann s voice It is perfectly original I m certain I ve heard it before somewhere If you have that simply means that you must have associated with some sensible person Jimmy was puzzled But why the grouch he asked I don t understand you I mean why do you feel that way about it Ann was quite certain now that she did not like this young man nearly as well as she had supposed It is trying for a strong minded clear thinking girl to have her philosophy described as a grouch Because I ve had the courage to think about it for myself and not let myself be blinded by popular superstition The whole world has united in making itself imagine that there is something called love which is the most wonderful happening in life The poets and novelists have simply hounded them on to believe it It s a gigantic swindle A wave of tender compassion swept over Jimmy He understood it all now Naturally a girl who had associated all her life with the Rollos Clarences Dwights and Twombleys would come to despair of the possibility of falling in love with any one You haven t met the right man he said She had of course but only recently and anyway he could point that out later There is no such thing as the right man said Ann resolutely if you are suggesting that there is a type of man in existence who is capable of inspiring what is called romantic love I believe in marriage Good work said Jimmy well satisfied But not as the result of a sort of delirium I believe in it as a sensible partnership between two friends who know each other well and trust each other The right way of looking at marriage is to realise first of all that there are no thrills no romances and then to pick out some one who is nice and kind and amusing and full of life and willing to do things to make you happy Ah said Jimmy straightening his tie Well that s something How do you mean that s something Are you shocked at my views I don t believe they are your views You ve been reading one of these stern soured fellows who analyse things Ann stamped The sound was inaudible but Jimmy noticed the movement Cold he said Let s walk on Ann s sense of humour reasserted itself It was not often that it remained dormant for so long She laughed I know exactly what you are thinking she said You believe that I am posing that those aren t my real opinions They can t be But I don t think you are posing It s getting on for dinner time and you ve got that wan sinking feeling that makes you look upon the world and find it a hollow fraud The bugle will be blowing in a few minutes and half an hour after that you will be yourself again I m myself now I suppose you can t realise that a pretty girl can hold such views Jimmy took her arm Let me help you he said There s a knothole in the deck Watch your step Now listen to me I m glad you ve brought up this subject I mean the subject of your being the prettiest girl in the known world I never said that Your modesty prevented you But it s a fact nevertheless I m glad I say because I have been thinking a lot along those lines myself and I have been anxious to discuss the point with you You have the most glorious hair I have ever seen Do you like red hair Red gold It is nice of you to put it like that When I was a child all except a few of the other children called me Carrots They have undoubtedly come to a bad end by this time If bears were sent to attend to the children who criticised Elijah your little friends were in line for a troupe of tigers But there were some of a finer fibre There were a few who didn t call you Carrots One or two They called me Brick Top They have probably been electrocuted since Your eyes are perfectly wonderful Ann withdrew her arm An extensive acquaintance of young men told her that the topic of conversation was now due to be changed You will like America she said We are not discussing America I am It is a wonderful country for a man who wants to succeed If I were you I should go out West Do you live out West No Then why suggest my going there Where do you live I live in New York I shall stay in New York then Ann was wary but amused Proposals of marriage and Jimmy seemed to be moving swiftly towards one were no novelty in her life In the course of several seasons at Bar Harbor Tuxedo Palm Beach and in New York itself she had spent much of her time foiling and discouraging the ardour of a series of sentimental youths who had laid their unwelcome hearts at her feet New York is open for staying in about this time I believe Jimmy was silent He had done his best to fight a tendency to become depressed and had striven by means of a light tone to keep himself resolutely cheerful but the girl s apparently total indifference to him was too much for his spirits One of the young men who had had to pick up the heart he had flung at Ann s feet and carry it away for repairs had once confided to an intimate friend after the sting had to some extent passed that the feelings of a man who made love to Ann might be likened to the emotions which hot chocolate might be supposed to entertain on contact with vanilla ice cream Jimmy had the comparison been presented to him would have endorsed its perfect accuracy The wind from the sea until now keen and bracing had become merely infernally cold The song of the wind in the rigging erstwhile melodious had turned into a damned depressing howling I used to be as sentimental as any one a few years ago said Ann returning to the dropped subject Just after I left college I was quite maudlin I dreamed of moons and Junes and loves and doves all the time Then something happened which made me see what a little fool I was It wasn t pleasant at the time but it had a very bracing effect I have been quite different ever since It was a man of course who did it His method was quite simple He just made fun of me and Nature did the rest Jimmy scowled in the darkness Murderous thoughts towards the unknown brute flooded his mind I wish I could meet him he growled You aren t likely to said Ann He lives in England His name is Crocker Jimmy Crocker I spoke about him just now Through the howling of the wind cut the sharp notes of a bugle Ann turned to the saloon entrance Dinner she said brightly How hungry one gets on board ship She stopped Aren t you coming down mister Bayliss Not just yet said Jimmy thickly CHAPTER VIII PAINFUL SCENE IN A CAFE The noonday sun beat down on Park Row Hurrying mortals released from a thousand offices congested the sidewalks their thoughts busy with the vision of lunch Up and down the canyon of Nassau Street the crowds moved more slowly Candy selling aliens jostled newsboys and huge dray horses endeavoured to the best of their ability not to grind the citizenry beneath their hooves Eastward pressing on to the City Hall surged the usual dense army of happy lovers on their way to buy marriage licenses Men popped in and out of the subway entrances like rabbits It was a stirring bustling scene typical of this nerve centre of New York s vast body Jimmy Crocker standing in the doorway watched the throngs enviously There were men in that crowd who chewed gum there were men who wore white satin ties with imitation diamond stick pins there were men who having smoked seven tenths of a cigar were eating the remainder but there was not one with whom he would not at that moment willingly have exchanged identities For these men had jobs And in his present frame of mind it seemed to him that no further ingredient was needed for the recipe of the ultimate human bliss The poet has said some very searching and unpleasant things about the man whose heart has ne er within him burned as home his footsteps he has turned from wandering on some foreign strand but he might have excused Jimmy for feeling just then not so much a warmth of heart as a cold and clammy sensation of dismay He would have had to admit that the words High though his titles proud his name boundless his wealth as wish can claim did not apply to Jimmy Crocker The latter may have been concentred all on self but his wealth consisted of one hundred and thirty three dollars and forty cents and his name was so far from being proud that the mere sight of it in the files of the New York Sunday Chronicle the record room of which he had just been visiting had made him consider the fact that he had changed it to Bayliss the most sensible act of his career The reason for Jimmy s lack of enthusiasm as he surveyed the portion of his native land visible from his doorway is not far to seek The Atlantic had docked on Saturday night and Jimmy having driven to an excellent hotel and engaged an expensive room therein had left instructions at the desk that breakfast should be served to him at ten o clock and with it the Sunday issue of the Chronicle Five years had passed since he had seen the dear old rag for which he had reported so many fires murders street accidents and weddings and he looked forward to its perusal as a formal taking seisin of his long neglected country Nothing could be more fitting and symbolic than that the first morning of his return to America should find him propped up in bed reading the good old Chronicle Among his final meditations as he dropped off to sleep was a gentle speculation as to who was City editor now and whether the comic supplement was still featuring the sprightly adventures of the Doughnut family A wave of not unmanly sentiment passed over him on the following morning as he reached out for the paper The sky line of New York seen as the boat comes up the bay has its points and the rattle of the Elevated trains and the quaint odour of the Subway extend a kindly welcome but the thing that really convinces the returned traveller that he is back on Manhattan Island is the first Sunday paper Jimmy like every one else began by opening the comic supplement and as he scanned it a chilly discomfort almost a premonition of evil came upon him The Doughnut Family was no more He knew that it was unreasonable of him to feel as if he had just been informed of the death of a dear friend for Pa Doughnut and his associates had been having their adventures five years before he had left the country and even the toughest comic supplementary hero rarely endures for a decade but nevertheless the shadow did fall upon his morning optimism and he derived no pleasure whatever from the artificial rollickings of a degraded creature called Old Pop Dill Pickle who was offered as a substitute But this he was to discover almost immediately was a trifling disaster It distressed him but it did not affect his material welfare Tragedy really began when he turned to the magazine section Scarcely had he started to glance at it when this headline struck him like a bullet PICCADILLY JIM AT IT AGAIN And beneath it his own name Nothing is so capable of diversity as the emotion we feel on seeing our name unexpectedly in print We may soar to the heights or we may sink to the depths Jimmy did the latter A mere cursory first inspection of the article revealed the fact that it was no eulogy With an unsparing hand the writer had muck raked his eventful past the text on which he hung his remarks being that ill fated encounter with Lord Percy Whipple at the Six Hundred Club This the scribe had recounted at a length and with a boisterous vim which outdid even Bill Blake s effort in the London Daily Sun Bill Blake had been handicapped by consideration of space and the fact that he had turned in his copy at an advanced hour when the paper was almost made up The present writer was shackled by no restrictions He had plenty of room to spread himself in and he had spread himself So liberal had been the editor s views in the respect that in addition to the letter press the pages contained an unspeakably offensive picture of a burly young man in an obviously advanced condition of alcoholism raising his fist to strike a monocled youth in evening dress who had so little chin that Jimmy was surprised that he had ever been able to hit it The only gleam of consolation that he could discover in this repellent drawing was the fact that the artist had treated Lord Percy even more scurvily than himself Among other things the second son of the Duke of Devizes was depicted as wearing a coronet a thing which would have excited remark even in a London night club Jimmy read the thing through in its entirety three times before he appreciated a nuance which his disordered mind had at first failed to grasp to wit that this character sketch of himself was no mere isolated outburst but apparently one of a series In several places the writer alluded unmistakeably to other theses on the same subject Jimmy s breakfast congealed on its tray untouched That boon which the gods so seldom bestow of seeing ourselves as others see us had been accorded to him in full measure By the time he had completed his third reading he was regarding himself in a purely objective fashion not unlike the attitude of a naturalist towards some strange and loathesome manifestation of insect life So this was the sort of fellow he was He wondered they had let him in at a reputable hotel The rest of the day he passed in a state of such humility that he could have wept when the waiters were civil to him On the Monday morning he made his way to Park Row to read the files of the Chronicle a morbid enterprise akin to the eccentric behaviour of those priests of Baal who gashed themselves with knives or of authors who subscribe to press clipping agencies He came upon another of the articles almost at once in an issue not a month old Then there was a gap of several weeks and hope revived that things might not be as bad as he had feared only to be crushed by another trenchant screed After that he set about his excavations methodically resolved to know the worst He knew it in just under two hours There it all was his row with the bookie his bad behaviour at the political meeting his breach of promise case It was a complete biography And the name they called him Piccadilly Jim Ugh He went out into Park Row and sought a quiet doorway where he could brood upon these matters It was not immediately that the practical or financial aspect of the affair came to scourge him For an appreciable time he suffered in his self esteem alone It seemed to him that all these bustling persons who passed knew him that they were casting sidelong glances at him and laughing derisively that those who chewed gum chewed it sneeringly and that those who ate their cigars ate them with thinly veiled disapproval and scorn Then the passage of time blunting sensitiveness he found that there were other and weightier things to consider As far as he had had any connected plan of action in his sudden casting off of the flesh pots of London he had determined as soon as possible after landing to report at the office of his old paper and apply for his ancient position So little thought had he given to the minutiae of his future plans that it had not occurred to him that he had anything to do but walk in slap the gang on the back and announce that he was ready to work Work on the staff of a paper whose chief diversion appeared to be the satirising of his escapades Even had he possessed the moral courage or gall to make the application what good would it be He was a by word in a world where he had once been a worthy citizen What paper would trust Piccadilly Jim with an assignment What paper would consider Piccadilly Jim even on space rates A chill dismay crept over him He seemed to hear the grave voice of Bayliss the butler speaking in his car as he had spoken so short a while before at Paddington Station Is it not a little rash mister James Rash was the word Here he stood in a country that had no possible use for him a country where competition was keen and jobs for the unskilled infrequent What on earth was there that he could do Well he could go home No he couldn t His pride revolted at that solution Prodigal Son stuff was all very well in its way but it lost its impressiveness if you turned up again at home two weeks after you had left A decent interval among the husks and swine was essential Besides there was his father to consider He might be a poor specimen of a fellow as witness the Sunday Chronicle passim but he was not so poor as to come slinking back to upset things for his father just when he had done the only decent thing by removing himself No that was out of the question What remained The air of New York is bracing and healthy but a man cannot live on it Obviously he must find a job But what job What could he do A gnawing sensation in the region of the waistcoat answered the question The solution which it put forward was it was true but a temporary one yet it appealed strongly to Jimmy He had found it admirable at many crises He would go and lunch and it might be that food would bring inspiration He moved from his doorway and crossed to the entrance of the subway He caught a timely express and a few minutes later emerged into the sunlight again at Grand Central He made his way westward along Forty second Street to the hotel which he thought would meet his needs He had scarcely entered it when in a chair by the door he perceived Ann Chester and at the sight of her all his depression vanished and he was himself again Why how do you do mister Bayliss Are you lunching here Unless there is some other place that you would prefer said Jimmy I hope I haven t kept you waiting Ann laughed She was looking very delightful in something soft and green I m not going to lunch with you I m waiting for mister Ralstone and his sister Do you remember him He crossed over with us His chair was next to mine on the promenade deck Jimmy was shocked When he thought how narrowly she had escaped poor girl from lunching with that insufferable pill Teddy or was it Edgar he felt quite weak Recovering himself he spoke firmly When were they to have met you At one o clock It is now five past You are certainly not going to wait any longer Come with me and we will whistle for cabs Don t be absurd Come along I want to talk to you about my future I shall certainly do nothing of the kind said Ann rising She went with him to the door Teddy would never forgive me She got into the cab It s only because you have appealed to me to help you discuss your future she said as they drove off Nothing else would have induced me I know said Jimmy I felt that I could rely on your womanly sympathy Where shall we go Where do you want to go Oh I forget that you have never been in New York before By the way what are your impressions of our glorious country Most gratifying if only I could get a job Tell him to drive to Delmonico s It s just around the corner on Forty fourth Street There are some things round the corner then That sounds cryptic What do you mean You ve forgotten our conversation that night on the ship You refused to admit the existence of wonderful things just round the corner You said some very regrettable things that night About love if you remember You can t be going to talk about love at one o clock in the afternoon Talk about your future Love is inextricably mixed up with my future Not with your immediate future I thought you said that you were trying to get a job Have you given up the idea of newspaper work then Absolutely Well I m rather glad The cab drew up at the restaurant door and the conversation was interrupted When they were seated at their table and Jimmy had given an order to the waiter of absolutely inexcusable extravagance Ann returned to the topic Well now the thing is to find something for you to do Jimmy looked round the restaurant with appreciative eyes The summer exodus from New York was still several weeks distant and the place was full of prosperous looking lunchers not one of whom appeared to have a care or an unpaid bill in the world The atmosphere was redolent of substantial bank balances Solvency shone from the closely shaven faces of the men and reflected itself in the dresses of the women Jimmy sighed I suppose so he said Though for choice I d like to be one of the Idle Rich To my mind the ideal profession is strolling into the office and touching the old dad for another thousand Ann was severe You revolt me she said I never heard anything so thoroughly disgraceful You need work One of these days said Jimmy plaintively I shall be sitting by the roadside with my dinner pail and you will come by in your limousine and I shall look up at you and say You hounded me into this How will you feel then Very proud of myself In that case there is no more to be said I d much rather hang about and try to get adopted by a millionaire but if you insist on my working Waiter What do you want asked Ann Will you get me a Classified Telephone Directory said Jimmy What for asked Ann To look for a profession There is nothing like being methodical The waiter returned bearing a red book Jimmy thanked him and opened it at the A s The boy what will he become he said He turned the pages How about an Auditor What do you think of that Do you think you could audit That I could not say till I had tried I might turn out to be very good at it How about an Adjuster An adjuster of what The book doesn t say It just remarks broadly in a sort of spacious way Adjuster I take it that having decided to become an adjuster you then sit down and decide what you wish to adjust One might for example become an Asparagus Adjuster A what Surely you know Asparagus Adjusters are the fellows who sell those rope and pulley affairs by means of which the Smart Set lower asparagus into their mouths or rather Francis the footman does it for them of course The diner leans back in his chair and the menial works the apparatus in the background It is entirely superseding the old fashioned method of picking the vegetable up and taking a snap at it But I suspect that to be a successful Asparagus Adjuster requires capital We now come to Awning Crank and Spring Rollers I don t think I should like that Rolling awning cranks seems to me a sorry way of spending life s springtime Let s try the B s Let s try this omelette It looks delicious Jimmy shook his head I will toy with it but absently and in a distrait manner as becomes a man of affairs There s nothing in the B s I might devote my ardent youth to Bar Room Glassware and Bottlers Supplies On the other hand I might not Similarly while there is no doubt a bright future for somebody in Celluloid Fiberloid and Other Factitious Goods instinct tells me that there is none for he pulled up on the verge of saying James Braithwaite Crocker and shuddered at the nearness of the pitfall for he hesitated again for Algernon Bayliss he concluded Ann smiled delightedly It was so typical that his father should have called him something like that Time had not dimmed her regard for the old man she had seen for that brief moment at Paddington Station He was an old dear and she thoroughly approved of this latest manifestation of his supposed pride in his offspring Is that really your name Algernon I cannot deny it I think your father is a darling said Ann inconsequently Jimmy had buried himself in the directory again The D s he said Is it possible that posterity will know me as Bayliss the Dermatologist Or as Bayliss the Drop Forger I don t quite like that last one It may be a respectable occupation but it sounds rather criminal to me The sentence for forging drops is probably about twenty years with hard labour I wish you would put that book away and go on with your lunch said Ann Perhaps said Jimmy my grandchildren will cluster round my knee some day and say in their piping childish voices Tell us how you became the Elastic Stocking King grandpa What do you think I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself You are wasting your time when you ought to be either talking to me or else thinking very seriously about what you mean to do Jimmy was turning the pages rapidly I will be with you in a moment he said Try to amuse yourself somehow till I am at leisure Ask yourself a riddle Tell yourself an anecdote Think of life No it s no good I don t see myself as a Fan Importer a Glass Beveller a Hotel Broker an Insect Exterminator a Junk Dealer a Kalsomine Manufacturer a Laundryman a Mausoleum Architect a Nurse an Oculist a Paper Hanger a Quilt Designer a Roofer a Ship Plumber a Tinsmith an Undertaker a Veterinarian a Wig Maker an X ray apparatus manufacturer a Yeast producer or a Zinc Spelter He closed the book There is only one thing to do I must starve in the gutter Tell me you know New York better than I do where is there a good gutter At this moment there entered the restaurant an Immaculate Person He was a young man attired in faultlessly fitting clothes with shoes of flawless polish and a perfectly proportioned floweret in his buttonhole He surveyed the room through a monocle He was a pleasure to look upon but Jimmy catching sight of him started violently and felt no joy at all for he had recognised him It was a man he knew well and who knew him well a man whom he had last seen a bare two weeks ago at the Bachelors Club in London Few things are certain in this world but one was that if Bartling such was the Vision s name should see him he would come over and address him as Crocker He braced himself to the task of being Bayliss the whole Bayliss and nothing but Bayliss It might be that stout denial would carry him through After all Reggie Bartling was a man of notoriously feeble intellect who could believe in anything The monocle continued its sweep It rested on Jimmy s profile By Gad said the Vision Reginald Bartling had landed in New York that morning and already the loneliness of a strange city had begun to oppress him He had come over on a visit of pleasure his suit case stuffed with letters of introduction but these he had not yet used There was a feeling of home sickness upon him and he ached for a pal And there before him sat Jimmy Crocker one of the best He hastened to the table I say Crocker old chap I didn t know you were over here When did you arrive Jimmy was profoundly thankful that he had seen this pest in time to be prepared for him Suddenly assailed in this fashion he would undoubtedly have incriminated himself by recognition of his name But having anticipated the visitation he was able to say a whole sentence to Ann before showing himself aware that it was he who was addressed I say Jimmy Crocker Jimmy achieved one of the blankest stares of modern times He looked at Ann Then he looked at Bartling again I think there s some mistake he said My name is Bayliss Before his stony eye the immaculate Bartling wilted It was a perfectly astounding likeness but it was apparent to him when what he had ever heard and read about doubles came to him He was confused He blushed It was deuced bad form going up to a perfect stranger like this and pretending you knew him Probably the chappie thought he was some kind of a confidence johnnie or something It was absolutely rotten He continued to blush till one could have fancied him scarlet to the ankles He backed away apologising in ragged mutters Jimmy was not insensible to the pathos of his suffering acquaintance s position he knew Reggie and his devotion to good form sufficiently well to enable him to appreciate the other s horror at having spoken to a fellow to whom he had never been introduced but necessity forbade any other course However Reggie s soul might writhe and however sleepless Reggie s nights might become as a result of this encounter he was prepared to fight it out on those lines if it took all summer And anyway it was darned good for Reggie to get a jolt like that every once in a while Kept him bright and lively So thinking he turned to Ann again while the crimson Bartling tottered off to restore his nerve centres to their normal tone at some other hostelry He found Ann staring amazedly at him eyes wide and lips parted Odd that he observed with a light carelessness which he admired extremely and of which he would not have believed himself capable I suppose I must be somebody s double What was the name he said Jimmy Crocker cried Ann Jimmy raised his glass sipped and put it down Oh yes I remember So it was It s a curious thing too that it sounds familiar I ve heard the name before somewhere I was talking about Jimmy Crocker on the ship That evening on deck Jimmy looked at her doubtfully Were you Oh yes of course I ve got it now He is the man you dislike so Ann was still looking at him as if he had undergone a change into something new and strange I hope you aren t going to let the resemblance prejudice you against me said Jimmy Some are born Jimmy Crockers others have Jimmy Crockers thrust upon them I hope you ll bear in mind that I belong to the latter class It s such an extraordinary thing Oh I don t know You often hear of doubles There was a man in England a few years ago who kept getting sent to prison for things some genial stranger who happened to look like him had done I don t mean that Of course there are doubles But it is curious that you should have come over here and that we should have met like this at just this time You see the reason I went over to England at all was to try to get Jimmy Crocker to come back here What I don t mean that I did I mean that I went with my uncle and aunt who wanted to persuade him to come and live with them Jimmy was now feeling completely out of his depth Your uncle and aunt Why I ought to have explained that they are his uncle and aunt too My aunt s sister married his father But It s quite simple though it doesn t sound so Perhaps you haven t read the Sunday Chronicle lately It has been publishing articles about Jimmy Crocker s disgusting behaviour in London they call him Piccadilly Jim you know In print that name had shocked Jimmy Spoken and by Ann it was loathly Remorse for his painful past tore at him There was another one printed yesterday I saw it said Jimmy to avert description Oh did you Well just to show you what sort of a man Jimmy Crocker is the Lord Percy Whipple whom he attacked in the club was his very best friend His step mother told my aunt so He seems to be absolutely hopeless She smiled You re looking quite sad mister Bayliss Cheer up You may look like him but you aren t him he him no he is right The soul is what counts If you ve got a good virtuous Algernonish soul it doesn t matter if you re so like Jimmy Crocker that his friends come up and talk to you in restaurants In fact it s rather an advantage really I m sure that if you were to go to my aunt and pretend to be Jimmy Crocker who had come over after all in a fit of repentance she would be so pleased that there would be nothing she wouldn t do for you You might realise your ambition of being adopted by a millionaire Why don t you try it I won t give you away Before they found me out and hauled me off to prison I should have been near you for a time I should have lived in the same house with you spoken to you Jimmy s voice shook Ann turned her head to address an imaginary companion You must listen to this my dear she said in an undertone He speaks wonderfully They used to call him the Boy Orator in his home town Sometimes that and sometimes Eloquent Algernon Jimmy eyed her fixedly He disapproved of this frivolity One of these days you will try me too high Oh you didn t hear what I was saying to my friend did you she said in concern But I meant it every word I love to hear you talk You have such feeling Jimmy attuned himself to the key of the conversation Have you no sentiment in you he demanded I was just warming up too In another minute you would have heard something worth while You ve damped me now Let s talk about my lifework again Have you thought of anything I d like to be one of those fellows who sit in offices and sign checks and tell the office boy to tell mister Rockerfeller they can give him five minutes But of course I should need a check book and I haven t got one Oh well I shall find something to do all right Now tell me something about yourself Let s drop the future for awhile An hour later Jimmy turned into Broadway He walked pensively for he had much to occupy his mind How strange that the Petts should have come over to England to try to induce him to return to New York and how galling that now that he was in New York this avenue to a prosperous future was closed by the fact that something which he had done five years ago that he could remember nothing about it was quite maddening had caused Ann to nurse this abiding hatred of him He began to dream tenderly of Ann bumping from pedestrian to pedestrian in a gentle trance From this trance the seventh pedestrian aroused him by uttering his name the name which circumstances had compelled him to abandon Jimmy Crocker Surprise brought Jimmy back from his dreams to the hard world surprise and a certain exasperation It was ridiculous to be incognito in a city which he had not visited in five years and to be instantly recognised in this way by every second man he met He looked sourly at the man The other was a sturdy square shouldered battered young man who wore on his homely face a grin of recognition and regard Jimmy was not particularly good at remembering faces but this person s was of a kind which the poorest memory might have recalled It was as the advertisements say distinctively individual The broken nose the exiguous forehead and the enlarged ears all clamoured for recognition The last time Jimmy had seen Jerry Mitchell had been two years before at the National Sporting Club in London and placing him at once he braced himself as a short while ago he had braced himself to confound immaculate Reggie Hello said the battered one Hello indeed said Jimmy courteously In what way can I brighten your life The grin faded from the other s face He looked puzzled You re Jimmy Crocker ain t you No My name chances to be Algernon Bayliss Jerry Mitchell reddened Scuse me My mistake He was moving off but Jimmy stopped him Parting from Ann had left a large gap in his life and he craved human society I know you now he said You re Jerry Mitchell I saw you fight Kid Burke four years ago in London The grin returned to the pugilist s face wider than ever He beamed with gratification Gee Think of that I ve quit since then I m working for an old guy named Pett Funny thing he s Jimmy Crocker s uncle that I mistook you for Say you re a dead ringer for that guy I could have sworn it was him when you bumped into me Say are you doing anything Nothing in particular Come and have a yarn There s a place I know just round by here Delighted They made their way to the place What s yours said Jerry Mitchell I m on the wagon myself he said apologetically So am I said Jimmy It s the only way No sense in always drinking and making a disgraceful exhibition of yourself in public Jerry Mitchell received this homily in silence It disposed definitely of the lurking doubt in his mind as to the possibility of this man really being Jimmy Crocker Though outwardly convinced by the other s denial he had not been able to rid himself till now of a nebulous suspicion But this convinced him Jimmy Crocker would never have said a thing like that nor would have refused the offer of alcohol He fell into pleasant conversation with him His mind eased CHAPTER IX missus PETT IS SHOCKED At five o clock in the afternoon some ten days after her return to America missus Pett was at home to her friends in the house on Riverside Drive The proceedings were on a scale that amounted to a reception for they were not only a sort of official notification to New York that one of its most prominent hostesses was once more in its midst but were also designed to entertain and impress mister Hammond Chester Ann s father who had been spending a couple of days in the metropolis preparatory to departing for South America on one of his frequent trips He was very fond of Ann in his curious detached way though he never ceased in his private heart to consider it injudicious of her not to have been born a boy and he always took in New York for a day or two on his way from one wild and lonely spot to another if he could manage it The large drawing room overlooking the Hudson was filled almost to capacity with that strange mixture of humanity which missus Pett chiefly affected She prided herself on the Bohemian element in her parties and had become during the past two years a human drag net scooping Genius from its hiding place and bringing it into the open At different spots in the room stood the six resident geniuses to whose presence in the home mister Pett had such strong objections and in addition to these she had collected so many more of a like breed from the environs of Washington Square that the air was clamorous with the hoarse cries of futurist painters esoteric Buddhists vers libre poets interior decorators and stage reformers sifted in among the more conventional members of society who had come to listen to them Men with new religions drank tea with women with new hats Apostles of Free Love expounded their doctrines to persons who had been practising them for years without realising it All over the room throats were being strained and minds broadened mister Chester standing near the door with Ann eyed the assemblage with the genial contempt of a large dog for a voluble pack of small ones He was a massive weather beaten man who looked very like Ann in some ways and would have looked more like her but for the misfortune of having had some of his face clawed away by an irritable jaguar with whom he had had a difference some years back in the jungles of Peru Do you like this sort of thing he asked I don t mind it said Ann Well I shall be very sorry to leave you Ann but I m glad I m pulling out of here this evening Who are all these people Ann surveyed the gathering That s Ernest Wisden the playwright over there talking to Lora Delane Porter the feminist writer That s Clara What s her name the sculptor with the bobbed hair Next to her mister Chester cut short the catalogue with a stifled yawn Where s old Pete Doesn t he come to these jamborees Ann laughed Poor uncle Peter If he gets back from the office before these people leave he will sneak up to his room and stay there till it s safe to come out The last time I made him come to one of these parties he was pounced on by a woman who talked to him for an hour about the morality of Finance and seemed to think that millionaires were the scum of the earth He never would stand up for himself mister Chester s gaze hovered about the room and paused Who s that fellow I believe I ve seen him before somewhere A constant eddying swirl was animating the multitude Whenever the mass tended to congeal something always seemed to stir it up again This was due to the restless activity of missus Pett who held it to be the duty of a good hostess to keep her guests moving From the moment when the room began to fill till the moment when it began to empty she did not cease to plough her way to and fro in a manner equally reminiscent of a hawk swooping on chickens and an earnest collegian bucking the line Her guests were as a result perpetually forming new ententes and combinations finding themselves bumped about like those little moving figures which one sees in shop windows on Broadway which revolve on a metal disc until urged by impact with another little figure they scatter to regroup themselves elsewhere It was a fascinating feature of missus Pett s at homes and one which assisted that mental broadening process already alluded to that one never knew when listening to a discussion on the sincerity of Oscar Wilde whether it would not suddenly change in the middle of a sentence to an argument on the inner meaning of the Russian Ballet Plunging now into a group dominated for the moment by an angular woman who was saying loud and penetrating things about the suffrage missus Pett had seized and removed a tall blonde young man with a mild vacuous face For the past few minutes this young man had been sitting bolt upright on a chair with his hands on his knees so exactly in the manner of an end man at a minstrel show that one would hardly have been surprised had he burst into song or asked a conundrum Ann followed her father s gaze Do you mean the man talking to aunt Nesta There they ve gone over to speak to Willie Partridge Do you mean that one Yes Who is he Well I like that said Ann Considering that you introduced him to us That s Lord Wisbeach who came to uncle Peter with a letter of introduction from you You met him in Canada I remember now I ran across him in British Columbia We camped together one night I d never seen him before and I didn t see him again He said he wanted a letter to old Pete for some reason so I scribbled him one in pencil on the back of an envelope I ve never met any one who played a better game of draw poker He cleaned me out There s a lot in that fellow in spite of his looking like a musical comedy dude He s clever Ann looked at him meditatively It s odd that you should be discovering hidden virtues in Lord Wisbeach father I ve been trying to make up my mind about him He wants me to marry him He does I suppose a good many of these young fellows here want the same thing don t they Ann mister Chester looked at his daughter with interest Her growing up and becoming a beauty had always been a perplexity to him He could never rid himself of the impression of her as a long legged child in short skirts I suppose you re refusing them all the time Every day from ten to four with an hour off for lunch I keep regular office hours Admission on presentation of visiting card And how do you feel about this Lord Wisbeach I don t know said Ann frankly He s very nice And what is more important he s different Most of the men I know are all turned out of the same mould Lord Wisbeach and one other man are the only two I ve met who might not be the brothers of all the rest Who s the other A man I hardly know I met him on board ship mister Chester looked at his watch It s up to you Ann he said There s one comfort in being your father I don t mean that exactly I mean that it is a comfort to me AS your father to know that I need feel no paternal anxiety about you I don t have to give you advice You ve not only got three times the sense that I have but you re not the sort of girl who would take advice You ve always known just what you wanted ever since you were a kid Well if you re going to take me down to the boat we d better be starting Where s the car Waiting outside Aren t you going to say good bye to aunt Nesta Good God no exclaimed mister Chester in honest concern What Plunge into that pack of coyotes and fight my way through to her I d be torn to pieces by wild poets Besides it seems silly to make a fuss saying good bye when I m only going to be away a short time I shan t go any further than Colombia this trip You ll be able to run back for week ends said Ann She paused at the door to cast a fleeting glance over her shoulder at the fair haired Lord Wisbeach who was now in animated conversation with her aunt and Willie Partridge then she followed her father down the stairs She was a little thoughtful as she took her place at the wheel of her automobile It was not often that her independent nature craved outside support but she was half conscious of wishing at the present juncture that she possessed a somewhat less casual father She would have liked to ask him to help her decide a problem which had been vexing her for nearly three weeks now ever since Lord Wisbeach had asked her to marry him and she had promised to give him his answer on her return from England She had been back in New York several days now but she had not been able to make up her mind This annoyed her for she was a girl who liked swift decisiveness of thought and action both in others and in herself She was fond of mister Chester in much the same unemotional detached way that he was fond of her but she was perfectly well aware of the futility of expecting counsel from him She said good bye to him at the boat fussed over his comfort for awhile in a motherly way and then drove slowly back For the first time in her life she was feeling uncertain of herself When she had left for England she had practically made up her mind to accept Lord Wisbeach and had only deferred actual acceptance of him because in her cool way she wished to re examine the position at her leisure Second thoughts had brought no revulsion of feeling She had not wavered until her arrival in New York Then for some reason which baffled her the idea of marrying Lord Wisbeach had become vaguely distasteful And now she found herself fluctuating between this mood and her former one She reached the house on Riverside Drive but did not slacken the speed of the machine She knew that Lord Wisbeach would be waiting for her there and she did not wish to meet him just yet She wanted to be alone She was feeling depressed She wondered if this was because she had just departed from her father and decided that it was His swift entrances into and exits from her life always left her temporarily restless She drove on up the river She meant to decide her problem one way or the other before she returned home Lord Wisbeach meanwhile was talking to missus Pett and Willie its inventor about Partridgite Willie on hearing himself addressed had turned slowly with an air of absent self importance the air of a great thinker disturbed in mid thought He always looked like that when spoken to and there were those mister Pett belonged to this school of thought who held that there was nothing to him beyond that look and that he had built up his reputation as a budding mastermind on a foundation that consisted entirely of a vacant eye a mop of hair through which he could run his fingers and the fame of his late father Willie Partridge was the son of the great inventor Dwight Partridge and it was generally understood that the explosive Partridgite was to be the result of a continuation of experiments which his father had been working upon at the time of his death That Dwight Partridge had been trying experiments in the direction of a new and powerful explosive during the last year of his life was common knowledge in those circles which are interested in such things Foreign governments were understood to have made tentative overtures to him But a sudden illness ending fatally had finished the budding career of Partridgite abruptly and the world had thought no more of it until an interview in the Sunday Chronicle that store house of information about interesting people announced that Willie was carrying on his father s experiments at the point where he had left off Since then there had been vague rumours of possible sensational developments which Willie had neither denied nor confirmed He preserved the mysterious silence which went so well with his appearance Having turned slowly so that his eyes rested on Lord Wisbeach s ingenuous countenance Willie paused and his face assumed the expression of his photograph in the Chronicle Ah Wisbeach he said Lord Wisbeach did not appear to resent the patronage of his manner He plunged cheerily into talk He had a pleasant simple way of comporting himself which made people like him I was just telling missus Pett he said that I shouldn t be surprised if you were to get an offer for your stuff from our fellows at home before long I saw a lot of our War Office men when I was in England don t you know Several of them mentioned the stuff Willie resented Partridgite as being referred to as the stuff but he made allowance All Englishmen talked that way he supposed Indeed he said Of course said missus Pett Willie is a patriot and would have to give our own authorities the first chance Rather But you know what officials are all over the world They are so sceptical and they move so slowly I know Our men at home are just the same as a rule I ve got a pal who invented something or other I forget what but it was a most decent little contrivance and very useful and all that and he simply can t get them to say Yes or No about it But all the same I wonder you didn t have some of them trying to put out feelers to you when you were in London Oh we were only in London a few hours By the way Lord Wisbeach my sister missus Pett paused she disliked to have to mention her sister or to refer to this subject at all but curiosity impelled her my sister said that you are a great friend of her step son James Crocker I didn t know that you knew him Lord Wisbeach seemed to hesitate for a moment He s not coming over is he Pity It would have done him a world of good Yes Jimmy Crocker and I have always been great pals He s a bit of a nut of course I beg your pardon I mean He broke off confusedly and turned to Willie again to cover himself How are you getting on with the jolly old stuff he asked If Willie had objected to Partridgite being called the stuff he was still less in favour of its being termed the jolly old stuff He replied coldly I have ceased to get along with the jolly old stuff Struck a snag enquired Lord Wisbeach sympathetically On the contrary my experiments have been entirely successful I have enough Partridgite in my laboratory to blow New York to bits Willie exclaimed missus Pett Why didn t you tell me before You know I am so interested I only completed my work last night He moved off with an important nod He was tired of Lord Wisbeach s society There was something about the young man which he did not like He went to find more congenial company in a group by the window Lord Wisbeach turned to his hostess The vacuous expression had dropped from his face like a mask A pair of keen and intelligent eyes met missus Pett s missus Pett may I speak to you seriously missus Pett s surprise at the alteration in the man prevented her from replying Much as she liked Lord Wisbeach she had never given him credit for brains and it was a man with brains and keen ones who was looking at her now She nodded If your nephew has really succeeded in his experiments you should be awfully careful That stuff ought not to lie about in his laboratory though no doubt he has hidden it as carefully as possible It ought to be in a safe somewhere In that safe in your library News of this kind moves like lightning At this very moment there may be people watching for a chance of getting at the stuff Every nerve in missus Pett s body every cell of a brain which had for years been absorbing and giving out sensational fiction quivered irrepressibly at these words spoken in a low tense voice which gave them additional emphasis Never had she misjudged a man as she had misjudged Lord Wisbeach Spies she quavered They wouldn t call themselves that said Lord Wisbeach Secret Service agents Every country has its men whose only duty it is to handle this sort of work They would try to steal Willie s missus Pett s voice failed They would not look on it as stealing Their motives would be patriotic I tell you missus Pett I have heard stories from friends of mine in the English Secret Service which would amaze you Perfectly straight men in private life but absolutely unscrupulous when at work They stick at nothing nothing If I were you I should suspect every one especially every stranger He smiled engagingly You are thinking that that is odd advice from one who is practically a stranger like myself Never mind Suspect me too if you like Be on the safe side I would not dream of doing such a thing Lord Wisbeach said missus Pett horrified I trust you implicitly Even supposing such a thing were possible would you have warned me like this if you had been That s true said Lord Wisbeach I never thought of that Well let me say suspect everybody but me He stopped abruptly missus Pett he whispered don t look round for a moment Wait The words were almost inaudible Who is that man behind you He has been listening to us Turn slowly With elaborate carelessness missus Pett turned her head At first she thought her companion must have alluded to one of a small group of young men who very improperly in such surroundings were discussing with raised voices the prospects of the clubs competing for the National League Baseball Pennant Then extending the sweep of her gaze she saw that she had been mistaken Midway between her and this group stood a single figure the figure of a stout man in a swallow tail suit who bore before him a tray with cups on it As she turned this man caught her eye gave a guilty start and hurried across the room You saw said Lord Wisbeach He was listening Who is that man Your butler apparently What do you know of him He is my new butler His name is Skinner Ah your new butler He hasn t been with you long then He only arrived from England three days ago From England How did he get in here I mean on whose recommendation mister Pett offered him the place when we met him at my sister s in London We went over there to see my sister Eugenia missus Crocker This man was the butler who admitted us He asked mister Pett something about baseball and mister Pett was so pleased that he offered him a place here if he wanted to come over The man did not give any definite answer then but apparently he sailed on the next boat and came to the house a few days after we had returned Lord Wisbeach laughed softly Very smart Of course they had him planted there for the purpose What ought I to do asked missus Pett agitatedly Do nothing There is nothing that you can do for the present except keep your eyes open Watch this man Skinner See if he has any accomplices It is hardly likely that he is working alone Suspect everybody Believe me At this moment apparently from some upper region there burst forth an uproar so sudden and overwhelming that it might well have been taken for a premature testing of a large sample of Partridgite until a moment later it began to resemble more nearly the shrieks of some partially destroyed victim of that death dealing invention It was a bellow of anguish and it poured through the house in a cascade of sound advertising to all beneath the roof the twin facts that some person unknown was suffering and that whoever the sufferer might be he had excellent lungs The effect on the gathering in the drawing room was immediate and impressive Conversation ceased as if it had been turned off with a tap Twelve separate and distinct discussions on twelve highly intellectual topics died instantaneously It was as if the last trump had sounded Futurist painters stared pallidly at vers libre poets speech smitten from their lips and stage performers looked at esoteric Buddhists with a wild surmise The sudden silence had the effect of emphasising the strange noise and rendering it more distinct thus enabling it to carry its message to one at least of the listeners missus Pett after a moment of strained attention in which time seemed to her to stand still uttered a wailing cry and leaped for the door Ogden she shrilled and passed up the stairs two at a time gathering speed as she went A boy s best friend is his mother CHAPTER X INSTRUCTION IN DEPORTMENT While the feast of reason and flow of soul had been in progress in the drawing room in the gymnasium on the top floor Jerry Mitchell awaiting the coming of mister Pett had been passing the time in improving with strenuous exercise his already impressive physique If missus Pett s guests had been less noisily concentrated on their conversation they might have heard the muffled tap tap tap that proclaimed that Jerry Mitchell was punching the bag upstairs It was not until he had punched it for perhaps five minutes that desisting from his labours he perceived that he had the pleasure of the company of little Ogden Ford The stout boy was standing in the doorway observing him with an attentive eye What are you doing enquired Ogden Jerry passed a gloved fist over his damp brow Punchin the bag He began to remove his gloves eyeing Ogden the while with a disapproval which he made no attempt to conceal An extremist on the subject of keeping in condition the spectacle of the bulbous stripling was a constant offence to him Ogden in pursuance of his invariable custom on the days when missus Pett entertained had been lurking on the stairs outside the drawing room for the past hour levying toll on the food stuffs that passed his way He wore a congested look and there was jam about his mouth Why he said retrieving a morsel of jam from his right cheek with the tip of his tongue To keep in condition Why do you want to keep in condition Jerry flung the gloves into their locker Fade he said wearily Fade Huh Beat it Huh Much pastry seemed to have clouded the boy s mind Run away Don t want to run away The annoyed pugilist sat down and scrutinised his visitor critically You never do anything you don t want to I guess No said Ogden simply You ve got a funny nose he added dispassionately What did you do to it to make it like that mister Mitchell shifted restlessly on his chair He was not a vain man but he was a little sensitive about that particular item in his make up Lizzie says it s the funniest nose she ever saw She says it s something out of a comic supplement A dull flush such as five minutes with the bag had been unable to produce appeared on Jerry Mitchell s peculiar countenance It was not that he looked on Lizzie Murphy herself no Lillian Russell as an accepted authority on the subject of facial beauty but he was aware that in this instance she spoke not without reason and he was vexed moreover as many another had been before him by the note of indulgent patronage in Ogden s voice His fingers twitched a little eagerly and he looked sullenly at his tactless junior Get out Huh Get outa here Don t want to get out of here said Ogden with finality He put his hand in his trouser pocket and pulled out a sticky mass which looked as if it might once have been a cream puff or a meringue He swallowed it contentedly I d forgotten I had that he explained Mary gave it to me on the stairs Mary thinks you ve a funny nose too he proceeded as one relating agreeable gossip Can it Can it exclaimed the exasperated pugilist I m only telling you what I heard her say mister Mitchell rose convulsively and took a step towards his persecutor breathing noisily through the criticised organ He was a chivalrous man a warm admirer of the sex but he was conscious of a wish that it was in his power to give Mary what he would have described as hers She was one of the parlour maids a homely woman with a hard eye and it was part of his grievance against her that his Maggie alias Celestine missus Pett s maid had formed an enthusiastic friendship with her He had no evidence to go on but he suspected Mary of using her influence with Celestine to urge the suit of his leading rival for the latter s hand Biggs the chauffeur He disliked Mary intensely even on general grounds Ogden s revelation added fuel to his aversion For a moment he toyed with the fascinating thought of relieving his feelings by spanking the boy but restrained himself reluctantly at the thought of the inevitable ruin which would ensue He had been an inmate of the house long enough to know with a completeness which would have embarrassed that gentleman what a cipher mister Pett was in the home and how little his championship would avail in the event of a clash with missus Pett And to give Ogden that physical treatment which should long since have formed the main plank in the platform of his education would be to invite her wrath as nothing else could He checked himself and reached out for the skipping rope hoping to ease his mind by further exercise Ogden chewing the remains of the cream puff eyed him with languid curiosity What are you doing that for mister Mitchell skipped grimly on What are you doing that for I thought only girls skipped mister Mitchell paid no heed Ogden after a moment s silent contemplation returned to his original train of thought I saw an advertisement in a magazine the other day of a sort of machine for altering the shape of noses You strap it on when you go to bed You ought to get pop to blow you to one Jerry Mitchell breathed in a laboured way You want to look nice about the place don t you Well then there s no sense in going around looking like that if you don t have to is there I heard Mary talking about your nose to Biggs and Celestine She said she had to laugh every time she saw it The skipping rope faltered in its sweep caught in the skipper s legs and sent him staggering across the room Ogden threw back his head and laughed merrily He liked free entertainments and this struck him as a particularly enjoyable one There are moments in the life of every man when the impulse attacks him to sacrifice his future to the alluring gratification of the present The strong man resists such impulses Jerry Mitchell was not a weak man but he had been sorely tried The annoyance of Ogden s presence and conversation had sapped his self restraint as dripping water will wear away a rock A short while before he had fought down the urgent temptation to massacre this exasperating child but now despised love adding its sting to that of injured vanity he forgot the consequences Bounding across the room he seized Ogden in a powerful grip and the next instant the latter s education in the true sense of the word so long postponed had begun and with it that avalanche of sound which rolling down into the drawing room hurled missus Pett so violently and with such abruptness from the society of her guests Disposing of the last flight of stairs with the agility of the chamois which leaps from crag to crag of the snow topped Alps missus Pett finished with a fine burst of speed along the passage on the top floor and rushed into the gymnasium just as Jerry s avenging hand was descending for the eleventh time CHAPTER XI JIMMY DECIDES TO BE HIMSELF It was less than a quarter of an hour later such was the speed with which Nemesis usually slow had overtaken him that Jerry Mitchell carrying a grip and walking dejectedly emerged from the back premises of the Pett home and started down Riverside Drive in the direction of his boarding house a cheap clean and respectable establishment situated on Ninety seventh Street between the Drive and Broadway His usually placid nervous system was ruffled and a quiver from the events of the afternoon and his cauliflower ears still burned reminiscently at the recollection of the uncomplimentary words shot at them by missus Pett before she expelled him from the house Moreover he was in a mild panic at the thought of having to see Ann later on and try to explain the disaster to her He knew how the news would affect her She had set her heart on removing Ogden to more disciplinary surroundings and she could not possibly do it now that her ally was no longer an inmate of the house He was an essential factor in the scheme and now to gratify the desire of the moment he had eliminated himself Long before he reached the brown stone house which looked exactly like all the other brown stone houses in all the other side streets of uptown New York the first fine careless rapture of his mad outbreak had passed from Jerry Mitchell leaving nervous apprehension in its place Ann was a girl whom he worshipped respectfully but he feared her in her wrath Having entered the boarding house Jerry seeking company in his hour of sorrow climbed the stairs till he reached a door on the second floor Sniffing and detecting the odour of tobacco he knocked and was hidden to enter Hello Bayliss he said sadly having obeyed the call He sat down on the end of the bed and heaved a deep sigh The room which he had entered was airy but small so small indeed that the presence of any furniture in it at all was almost miraculous for at first sight it seemed incredible that the bed did not fill it from side to side There were however a few vacant spots and in these had been placed a wash stand a chest of drawers and a midget rocking chair The window which the thoughtful architect had designed at least three sizes too large for the room and which admitted the evening air in pleasing profusion looked out onto a series of forlorn back yards In boarding houses it is only the windows of the rich and haughty that face the street On the bed a corn cob pipe between his teeth lay Jimmy Crocker He was shoeless and in his shirt sleeves There was a crumpled evening paper on the floor beside the bed He seemed to be taking his rest after the labours of a trying day At the sound of Jerry s sigh he raised his head but finding the attitude too severe a strain on the muscles of the neck restored it to the pillow What s the matter Jerry You seem perturbed You have the aspect of one whom Fate has smitten in the spiritual solar plexus or of one who has been searching for the leak in Life s gaspipe with a lighted candle What s wrong Curtains Jimmy through long absence from his native land was not always able to follow Jerry s thoughts when concealed in the wrappings of the peculiar dialect which he affected I get you not friend Supply a few footnotes I ve been fired Jimmy sat up This was no imaginary trouble no mere malaise of the temperament It was concrete and called for sympathy I m awfully sorry he said No wonder you aren t rollicking How did it happen That half portion Bill Taft came joshing me about my beezer till it got something fierce explained Jerry William J Bryan couldn t have stood for it Once again Jimmy lost the thread The wealth of political allusion baffled him What s Taft been doing to you It wasn t Taft He only looks like him It was that kid Ogden up where I work He came butting into the gym joshing me about makin pers nal remarks till I kind of lost my goat and the next thing I knew I was giving him his A faint gleam of pleasure lightened the gloom of his face I cert nly give him his The gleam faded And after that well here I am Jimmy understood now He had come to the boarding house the night of his meeting with Jerry Mitchell on Broadway and had been there ever since and frequent conversations with the pugilist had put him abreast of affairs at the Pett home He was familiar with the personnel of the establishment on Riverside Drive and knew precisely how great was the crime of administering correction to Ogden Ford no matter what the cause Nor did he require explanation of the phenomenon of missus Pett dismissing one who was in her husband s private employment Jerry had his sympathy freely You appear he said to have acted in a thoroughly capable and praiseworthy manner The only point in your conduct which I would permit myself to criticise is your omission to slay the kid That however was due I take it to the fact that you were interrupted We will now proceed to examine the future I cannot see that it is altogether murky You have lost a good job but there are others equally good for a man of your calibre New York is crammed with dyspeptic millionaires who need an efficient physical instructor to look after them Cheer up Cuthbert for the sun is still shining Jerry Mitchell shook his head He refused to be comforted It s Miss Ann he said What am I going to say to her What has she got to do with it asked Jimmy interested For a moment Jerry hesitated but the desire for sympathy and advice was too strong for him And after all there was no harm in confiding in a good comrade like Jimmy It s like this he said Miss Ann and me had got it all fixed up to kidnap the kid What Say I don t mean ordinary kidnapping It s this way Miss Ann come to me and we agree that the kid s a pest that had ought to have some strong arm keep him in order so we decide to get him away to a friend of mine who keeps a dogs hospital down on Long Island Bud Smithers is the guy to handle that kid You ought to see him take hold of a dog that s all grouch and ugliness and make it over into a dog that it s a pleasure to have around I thought a few weeks with Bud was what the doctor ordered for Ogden and Miss Ann guessed I was right so we had it all framed And now this happens and balls everything up She can t do nothing with a husky kid like that without me to help her And how am I going to help her if I m not allowed in the house Jimmy was conscious of a renewed admiration for a girl whom he had always considered a queen among women How rarely in this world did one find a girl who combined every feminine charm of mind and body with a resolute determination to raise Cain at the slightest provocation What an absolutely corking idea Jerry smirked modestly at the approbation but returned instantly to his gloom You get me now What am I to say to her She ll be sore The problem Jimmy had begun is one which as you suggest presents certain when there was a knock at the door and the head of the boarding house s maid of all work popped in mister Bayliss is mister Mitchell Oh say mister Mitchell there s a lady down below wants to see you Says her name s Chester Jerry looked at Jimmy appealingly What ll I do Do nothing said Jimmy rising and reaching for his shoes I ll go down and see her I can explain for you It s mighty good of you

none	none	Rely on me Ann who had returned from her drive shortly after the Ogden disaster and had instantly proceeded to the boarding house had been shown into the parlour Jimmy found her staring in a rapt way at a statuette of the Infant Samuel which stood near a bowl of wax fruit on the mantelpiece She was feeling aggrieved with Fate and extremely angry with Jerry Mitchell and she turned at the sound of the opening door with a militant expression in her eyes which changed to one of astonishment on perceiving who it was that had come in mister Bayliss Good evening Miss Chester We so to speak meet again I have come as an intermediary To be brief Jerry Mitchell daren t face you so I offered to come down instead But how but why are you here I live here He followed her gaze It rested on a picture of cows in a field Late American school he said Attributed to the landlady s niece a graduate of the Wissahickon Pa Correspondence School of Pictorial Art Said to be genuine You live here repeated Ann She had been brought up all her life among the carefully thought out effects of eminent interior decorators and the room seemed more dreadful to her than it actually was What an awful room Awful You must be overlooking the piano Can t you see the handsome plush cover from where you are standing Move a little to the southeast and shade your eyes We get music here of an evening when we don t see it coming and sidestep Why in the name of goodness do you live here mister Bayliss Because Miss Chester I am infernally hard up Because the Bayliss bank roll has been stricken with a wasting sickness Ann was looking at him incredulously But but then did you really mean all that at lunch the other day I thought you were joking I took it for granted that you could get work whenever you wanted to or you wouldn t have made fun of it like that Can t you really find anything to do Plenty to do But I m not paid for it I walk a great number of blocks and jump into a great number of cars and dive into elevators and dive out again and open doors and say Good morning when people tell me they haven t a job for me My days are quite full but my pocket book isn t Ann had forgotten all about her errand in her sympathy I m so sorry Why it s terrible I should have thought you could have found something I thought the same till the employers of New York in a body told me I couldn t Men of widely differing views on religion politics and a hundred other points they were unanimous on that The nearest I came to being a financial Titan was when I landed a job in a store on Broadway demonstrating a patent collar clip at ten dollars a week For awhile all Nature seemed to be shouting Ten per Ten per than which there are few sweeter words in the language But I was fired half way through the second day and Nature changed her act But why It wasn t my fault Just Fate This contrivance was called Klipstone s Kute Kollar Klip and it was supposed to make it easy for you to fasten your tie My job was to stand in the window in my shirt sleeves gnashing my teeth and registering baffled rage when I tried the old obsolete method and beaming on the multitude when I used the Klip Unfortunately I got the cards mixed I beamed when I tried the old obsolete method and nearly burst myself with baffled fury just after I had exhibited the card bearing the words I will now try Klipstone s Kute Klip I couldn t think what the vast crowd outside the window was laughing at till the boss who chanced to pause on the outskirts of the gathering on his way back from lunch was good enough to tell me Nothing that I could say would convince him that I was not being intentionally humorous I was sorry to lose the job though it did make me feel like a goldfish But talking of being fired brings us back to Jerry Mitchell Oh never mind Jerry Mitchell now On the contrary let us discuss his case and the points arising from it with care and concentration Jerry Mitchell has told me all Ann was startled What do you mean The word all said Jimmy is slang for everything You see in me a confidant In a word I am hep You know Everything A colloquialism explained Jimmy for all About Ogden you know The scheme The plot The enterprise Ann found nothing to say I am thoroughly in favour of the plan So much so that I propose to assist you by taking Jerry s place I don t understand Do you remember at lunch that day after that remarkable person had mistaken me for Jimmy Crocker you suggested in a light casual way that if I were to walk into your uncle s office and claim to be Jimmy Crocker I should be welcomed without a question I m going to do it Then once aboard the lugger once in the house I am at your orders Use me exactly as you would have used Jerry Mitchell But but Jerry said Jimmy scornfully Can t I do everything that he could have done And more A bonehead like Jerry would have been certain to have bungled the thing somehow I know him well A good fellow but in matters requiring intellect and swift thought dead from the neck up It s a very lucky thing he is out of the running I love him like a brother but his dome is of ivory This job requires a man of tact sense shrewdness initiative esprit and verve He paused Me he concluded But it s ridiculous It s out of the question Not at all I must be extraordinarily like Jimmy Crocker or that fellow at the restaurant wouldn t have taken me for him Leave this in my hands I can get away with it I shan t dream of allowing you At nine o clock to morrow morning said Jimmy firmly I present myself at mister Pett s office It s all settled Ann was silent She was endeavouring to adjust her mind to the idea Her first startled revulsion from it had begun to wane It was an idea peculiarly suited to her temperament an idea that she might have suggested herself if she had thought of it Soon from being disapproving she found herself glowing with admiration for its author He was a young man of her own sort You asked me on the boat if you remember said Jimmy if I had an adventurous soul I am now submitting my proofs You also spoke highly of America as a land where there were adventures to be had I now see that you were right Ann thought for a moment If I consent to your doing this insane thing mister Bayliss will you promise me something Anything Well in the first place I absolutely refuse to let you risk all sorts of frightful things by coming into this kidnapping plot She waved him down and went on But I see where you can help me very much As I told you at lunch my aunt would do anything for Jimmy Crocker if he were to appear in New York now I want you to promise that you will confine your activities to asking her to let Jerry Mitchell come back Never You said you would promise me anything Anything but that Then it is all off Jimmy pondered It s terribly tame that way Never mind It s the only way I will consider Very well I protest though Ann sat down I think you re splendid mister Bayliss I m much obliged Not at all It will be such a splendid thing for Ogden won t it Admirable Now the only thing to do is just to see that we have got everything straight How about this for instance They will ask you when you arrived in New York How are you going to account for your delay in coming to see them I ve thought of that There s a boat that docks to morrow the Caronia I think I ve got a paper upstairs I ll look it up I can say I came by her That seems all right It s lucky you and uncle Peter never met on the Atlantic And now as to my demeanour on entering the home How should I behave Should I be jaunty or humble What would a long lost nephew naturally do A long lost nephew with a record like Jimmy Crocker s would crawl in with a white flag I should think A bell clanged in the hall Supper said Jimmy To go into painful details New England boiled dinner or my senses deceive me and prunes I must be going We shall meet at Philippi He saw her to the door and stood at the top of the steps watching her trim figure vanish into the dusk She passed from his sight Jimmy drew a deep breath and thinking hard went down the passage to fortify himself with supper CHAPTER XII JIMMY CATCHES THE BOSS S EYE When Jimmy arrived at mister Pett s office on Pine Street at ten thirty the next morning his expressed intention of getting up early enough to be there by nine having proved an empty boast he was in a high state of preparedness He had made ready for what might be a trying interview by substituting a combination of well chosen dishes at an expensive hotel for the less imaginative boarding house breakfast with which he had of late been insulting his interior His suit was pressed his shoes gleamed brightly and his chin was smoothly shaven These things combined with the perfection of the morning and that vague exhilaration which a fine day in down town New York brings to the man who has not got to work increased his natural optimism Something seemed to tell him that all would be well He would have been the last person to deny that his position was a little complicated he had to use a pencil and a sheet of paper to show himself just where he stood but what of that A few complications in life are an excellent tonic for the brain It was with a sunny geniality which startled that unaccustomed stripling considerably and indeed caused him to swallow his chewing gum that he handed in his card to mister Pett s watchfully waiting office boy This to the boss my open faced lad he said Get swiftly off the mark The boy departed dumbly From where he stood outside the barrier which separated visitors to the office from the workers within Jimmy could see a vista of efficient looking young men with paper protectors round their cuffs working away at mysterious jobs which seemed to involve the use of a great deal of paper One in particular was so surrounded by it that he had the appearance of a bather in surf Jimmy eyed these toilers with a comfortable and kindly eye All this industry made him feel happy He liked to think of this sort of thing going on all round him The office boy returned This way please The respectfulness of the lad s manner had increased noticeably mister Pett s reception of the visitor s name had impressed him It was an odd fact that the financier a cipher in his own home could impress all sorts of people at the office To mister Pett the announcement that mister James Crocker was waiting to see him had come like the announcement of a miracle Not a day had passed since their return to America without lamentations from missus Pett on the subject of their failure to secure the young man s person The occasion of missus Pett s reading of the article in the Sunday Chronicle descriptive of the Lord Percy Whipple affair had been unique in the little man s domestic history For the first time since he had known her the indomitable woman had completely broken down Of all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these It might have been and the thought that if she had only happened to know it she had had in her hands during that interview with her sister in London a weapon which would have turned defeat into triumph was more than even missus Pett s strong spirit could endure When she looked back on that scene and recalled the airy way in which missus Crocker had spoken of her step son s best friend Lord Percy Whipple and realised that at that very moment Lord Percy had been recovering in bed from the effects of his first meeting with Jimmy Crocker the iron entered into her soul and she refused to be comforted In the first instant of realisation she thought of six separate and distinct things she could have said to her sister each more crushing than the last things which now she would never be able to say And now suddenly and unaccountably the means was at hand for restoring her to her tranquil self esteem Jimmy Crocker despite what his stepmother had said probably in active defiance of her commands had come to America after all mister Pett s first thought was that his wife would as he expressed it to himself be tickled to death about this Scarcely waiting for the office boy to retire he leaped towards Jimmy like a gambolling lamb and slapped him on the back with every evidence of joy and friendliness My dear boy he cried My dear boy I m delighted to see you Jimmy was surprised relieved and pleased He had not expected this warmth A civil coldness had been the best he had looked for He had been given to understand that in the Pett home he was regarded as the black sheep and while one may admit a black sheep into the fold it does not follow that one must of necessity fawn upon him You re very kind he said rather startled They inspected each other for a brief moment mister Pett was thinking that Jimmy was a great improvement on the picture his imagination had drawn of him He had looked for something tougher something flashy and bloated Jimmy for his part had taken an instant liking to the financier He too had been misled by imagination He had always supposed that these millionaires down Wall Street way were keen aggressive fellows with gimlet eyes and sharp tongues On the boat he had only seen mister Pett from afar and had had no means of estimating his character He found him an agreeable little man We had given up all hope of your coming said mister Pett A little manly penitence seemed to Jimmy to be in order I never expected you would receive me like this I thought I must have made myself rather unpopular mister Pett buried the past with a gesture When did you land he asked This morning On the Caronia Good passage Excellent There was a silence It seemed to Jimmy that mister Pett was looking at him rather more closely than was necessary for the actual enjoyment of his style of beauty He was just about to throw out some light remark about the health of missus Pett or something about porpoises on the voyage to add local colour and verisimilitude when his heart missed a beat as he perceived that he had made a blunder Like many other amateur plotters Ann and he had made the mistake of being too elaborate It had struck them as an ingenious idea for Jimmy to pretend that he had arrived that morning and superficially it was a good idea but he now remembered for the first time that if he had seen mister Pett on the Atlantic the probability was that mister Pett had seen him The next moment the other had confirmed this suspicion I ve an idea I ve seen you before Can t think where Everybody well at home said Jimmy I m sure of it I m looking forward to seeing them all I ve seen you some place I m often there Eh mister Pett seemed to be turning this remark over in his mind a trifle suspiciously Jimmy changed the subject To a young man like myself he said with life opening out before him there is something singularly stimulating in the sight of a modern office How busy those fellows seem Yes said mister Pett Yes He was glad that this conversational note had been struck He was anxious to discuss the future with this young man Everybody works but father said Jimmy mister Pett started Eh Nothing mister Pett was vaguely ruffled He suspected insult but could not pin it down He abandoned his cheeriness however and became the man of business I hope you intend to settle down now that you are here and work hard he said in the voice which he vainly tried to use on Ogden at home Work said Jimmy blankly I shall be able to make a place for you in my office That was my promise to your step mother and I shall fulfil it But wait a minute I don t get this Do you mean to put me to work Of course I take it that that was why you came over here because you realised how you were wasting your life and wanted a chance of making good in my office A hot denial trembled on Jimmy s tongue Never had he been so misjudged And then the thought of Ann checked him He must do nothing that would interfere with Ann s plans Whatever the cost he must conciliate this little man For a moment he mused sentimentally on Ann He hoped she would understand what he was going through for her sake To a man with his ingrained distaste for work in any shape the sight of those wage slaves outside there in the outer office had as he had told mister Pett been stimulating but only because it filled him with a sort of spiritual uplift to think that he had not got to do that sort of thing Consider them in the light of fellow workers and the spectacle ceased to stimulate and became nauseating And for her sake he was about to become one of them Had any knight of old ever done anything as big as that for his lady He very much doubted it
4108_2772_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 All right he said 
none	none	Count me in I take it that I shall have a job like one of those out there Yes Not presuming to dictate I suggest that you give me something that will take some of the work off that fellow who s swimming in paper Only the tip of his nose was above the surface as I passed through I never saw so many fellows working so hard at the same time in my life All trying to catch the boss s eye too I suppose It must make you feel like a snipe mister Pett replied stiffly He disliked this levity on the sacred subject of office work He considered that Jimmy was not approaching his new life in the proper spirit Many young men had discussed with him in that room the subject of working in his employment but none in quite the same manner You are at a serious point in your career he said You will have every opportunity of rising Yes At seven in the morning I suppose A spirit of levity began mister Pett I laugh that I may not weep explained Jimmy Try to think what this means to a bright young man who loathes work Be kind to me Instruct your floor walkers to speak gently to me at first It may be a far far better thing that I do than I have ever done but don t ask me to enjoy it It s all right for you You re the boss Any time you want to call it a day and go off and watch a ball game all you have to do is to leave word that you have an urgent date to see mister Rockerfeller Whereas I shall have to submerge myself in paper and only come up for air when the danger of suffocation becomes too great It may have been the mention of his favourite game that softened mister Pett The frostiness which had crept into his manner thawed It beats me he said why you ever came over at all if you feel like that Duty said Jimmy Duty There comes a time in the life of every man when he must choose between what is pleasant and what is right And that last fool game of yours that Lord Percy Whipple business must have made London pretty hot for you suggested mister Pett Your explanation is less romantic than mine but there is something in what you say Had it occurred to you young man that I am taking a chance putting a fellow like you to work in my office Have no fear The little bit of work I shall do won t make any difference I ve half a mind to send you straight back to London Couldn t we compromise How Well haven t you some snug secretarial job you could put me into I have an idea that I should make an ideal secretary My secretaries work I get you Cancel the suggestion mister Pett rubbed his chin thoughtfully You puzzle me And that s the truth Always speak the truth said Jimmy approvingly I m darned if I know what to do with you Well you d better come home with me now anyway and meet your aunt and then we can talk things over After all the main thing is to keep you out of mischief You put things crudely but no doubt you are right You ll live with us of course Thank you very much This is the right spirit I ll have to talk to Nesta about you There may be something you can do I shouldn t mind being a partner suggested Jimmy helpfully Why don t you get work on a paper again You used to do that well I don t think my old paper would welcome me now They regard me rather as an entertaining news item than a worker That s true Say why on earth did you make such a fool of yourself over on the other side That breach of promise case with the barmaid said mister Pett reproachfully Let bygones be bygones said Jimmy I was more sinned against than sinning You know how it is uncle Pete mister Pett started violently but said nothing You try out of pure goodness of heart to scatter light and sweetness and protect the poor working girl like Heaven and brighten up her lot and so on and she turns right around and soaks it to you good And anyway she wasn t a barmaid She worked in a florist s shop I don t see that that makes any difference All the difference in the world all the difference between the sordid and the poetical I don t know if you have ever experienced the hypnotic intoxication of a florist s shop Take it from me uncle Pete any girl can look an angel as long as she is surrounded by choice blooms I couldn t help myself I wasn t responsible I only woke up when I met her outside But all that sort of thing is different now I am another man Sober steady serious minded mister Pett had taken the receiver from the telephone and was talking to some one The buzzing of a feminine voice came to Jimmy s ears mister Pett hung up the receiver Your aunt says we are to come up at once I m ready And it will be a good excuse for you to knock off work I bet you re glad I came Does the carriage await or shall we take the subway I guess it will be quicker to take the subway Your aunt s very surprised that you are here and very pleased I m making everybody happy to day mister Pett was looking at him in a meditative way Jimmy caught his eye You re registering something uncle Pete and I don t know what it is Why the glance I was just thinking of something Jimmy prompted his nephew Eh Add the word Jimmy to your remarks It will help me to feel at home and enable me to overcome my shyness mister Pett chuckled Shyness If I had your nerve He broke off with a sigh and looked at Jimmy affectionately What I was thinking was that you re a good boy At least you re not but you re different from that gang of of that crowd up town What crowd Your aunt is literary you know She s filled the house with poets and that sort of thing It will be a treat having you around You re human I don t see that we re going to make much of you now that you re here but I m darned glad you ve come Jimmy Put it there uncle Pete said Jimmy 
4108_2777_000016_000001	train-clean-360	You re all right 
none	none	You re the finest Captain of Industry I ever met CHAPTER XIII SLIGHT COMPLICATIONS They left the subway at Ninety sixth Street and walked up the Drive Jimmy like every one else who saw it for the first time experienced a slight shock at the sight of the Pett mansion but rallying followed his uncle up the flagged path to the front door Your aunt will be in the drawing room I guess said mister Pett opening the door with his key Jimmy was looking round him appreciatively mister Pett s house might be an eyesore from without but inside it had had the benefit of the skill of the best interior decorator in New York A man could be very happy in a house like this if he didn t have to poison his days with work said Jimmy mister Pett looked alarmed Don t go saying anything like that to your aunt he urged She thinks you have come to settle down So I have I m going to settle down like a limpet I hope I shall be living in luxury on you twenty years from now Is this the room mister Pett opened the drawing room door A small hairy object sprang from a basket and stood yapping in the middle of the room This was Aida missus Pett s Pomeranian mister Pett avoiding the animal coldly for he disliked it ushered Jimmy into the room Here s Jimmy Crocker Nesta Jimmy was aware of a handsome woman of middle age so like his step mother that for an instant his self possession left him and he stammered How how do you do His demeanour made a favourable impression on missus Pett She took it for the decent confusion of remorse I was very surprised when your uncle telephoned me she said I had not the slightest idea that you were coming over I am very glad to see you Thank you This is your cousin Ogden Jimmy perceived a fat boy lying on a settee He had not risen on Jimmy s entrance and he did not rise now He did not even lower the book he was reading Hello he said Jimmy crossed over to the settee and looked down on him He had got over his momentary embarrassment and as usual with him the reaction led to a fatal breeziness He prodded Ogden in his well covered ribs producing a yelp of protest from that astounded youth So this is Ogden Well well well You don t grow up Ogden but you do grow out What are you a perfect sixty six The favourable impression which missus Pett had formed of her nephew waned She was shocked by this disrespectful attitude towards the child she worshipped Please do not disturb Ogden James she said stiffly He is not feeling very well to day His stomach is weak Been eating too much said Jimmy cheerfully I was just the same at his age What he wants is half rations and plenty of exercise Say protested Ogden Just look at this proceeded Jimmy grasping a handful of superfluous tissue around the boy s ribs All that ought to come off I ll tell you what I ll do I ll buy a pair of flannel trousers and a sweater and some sneakers and I ll take him for a run up Riverside Drive this evening Do him no end of good And a good skipping rope too Nothing like it In a couple of weeks I ll have him as fit as a Ogden s case said missus Pett coldly which is very complicated is in the hands of Doctor Briginshaw in whom we have every confidence There was a silence the paralysing effects of which mister Pett vainly tried to mitigate by shuffling his feet and coughing missus Pett spoke I hope that now that you are here James you intend to settle down and work hard Indubitably Like a beaver said Jimmy mindful of mister Pett s recent warning The only trouble is that there seems to be a little uncertainty as to what I am best fitted for We talked it over in uncle Pete s office and arrived at no conclusion Can t you think of anything said mister Pett I looked right through the telephone classified directory the other day The other day But you only landed this morning I mean this morning When I was looking up your address so that I could go and see you said Jimmy glibly It seems a long time ago I think the sight of all those fellows in your office has aged me I think the best plan would be for me to settle down here and learn how to be an electrical engineer or something by mail I was reading an advertisement in a magazine as we came up on the subway I see they guarantee to teach you anything from sheet metal working to poultry raising The thing began You are standing still because you lack training It seemed to me to apply to my case exactly I had better drop them a line to night asking for a few simple facts about chickens Whatever comment missus Pett might have made on this suggestion was checked by the entrance of Ann From the window of her room Ann had observed the arrival of Jimmy and her uncle and now having allowed sufficient time to elapse for the former to make missus Pett s acquaintance she came down to see how things were going She was well satisfied with what she saw A slight strain which she perceived in the atmosphere she attributed to embarrassment natural to the situation She looked at Jimmy enquiringly missus Pett had not informed her of mister Pett s telephone call so Jimmy she realised had to be explained to her She waited for some one to say something mister Pett undertook the introduction Jimmy this is my niece Ann Chester This is Jimmy Crocker Ann Jimmy could not admire sufficiently the start of surprise which she gave It was artistic and convincing Jimmy Crocker mister Pett was on the point of mentioning that this was not the first time Ann had met Jimmy but refrained After all that interview had happened five years ago Jimmy had almost certainly forgotten all about it There was no use in making him feel unnecessarily awkward It was up to Ann If she wanted to disinter the ancient grievance let her It was no business of his I thought you weren t coming over said Ann I changed my mind mister Pett who had been gazing attentively at them uttered an exclamation I ve got it I ve been trying all this while to think where it was that I saw you before It was on the Atlantic Ann caught Jimmy s eye She was relieved to see that he was not disturbed by this sudden development Did you come over on the Atlantic mister Crocker she said Surely not We crossed on her ourselves We should have met Don t call me mister Crocker said Jimmy Call me Jimmy Your mother s brother s wife s sister s second husband is my father Blood is thicker than water No I came over on the Caronia We docked this morning Well there was a fellow just like you on the Atlantic persisted mister Pett missus Pett said nothing She was watching Jimmy with a keen and suspicious eye I suppose I m a common type said Jimmy You remember the man I mean said mister Pett innocently unconscious of the unfriendly thoughts he was encouraging in two of his hearers He sat two tables away from us at meals You remember him Nesta As I was too unwell to come to meals I do not Why I thought I saw you once talking to him on deck Ann Really said Ann I don t remember any one who looked at all like Jimmy Well said mister Pett puzzled It s very strange I guess I m wrong He looked at his watch Well I ll have to be getting back to the office I ll come with you part of the way uncle Pete said Jimmy I have to go and arrange for my things to be expressed here Why not phone to the hotel said mister Pett It seemed to Jimmy and Ann that he was doing this sort of thing on purpose Which hotel did you leave them at No I shall have to go there I have some packing to do You will be back to lunch said Ann Thanks I shan t be gone more than half an hour For a moment after they had gone Ann relaxed happy and relieved Everything had gone splendidly Then a shock ran through her whole system as missus Pett spoke She spoke excitedly in a lowered voice leaning over to Ann Ann Did you notice anything Did you suspect anything Ann mastered her emotion with an effort Whatever do you mean aunt Nesta About that young man who calls himself Jimmy Crocker Ann clutched the side of the chair Who calls himself Jimmy Crocker I don t understand Ann tried to laugh It seemed to her an age before she produced any sound at all and when it came it was quite unlike a laugh What put that idea into your head Surely if he says he is Jimmy Crocker it s rather absurd to doubt him isn t it How could anybody except Jimmy Crocker know that you were anxious to get Jimmy Crocker over here You didn t tell any one did you This reasoning shook missus Pett a little but she did not intend to abandon a perfectly good suspicion merely because it began to seem unreasonable They have their spies everywhere she said doggedly Who have The Secret Service people from other countries Lord Wisbeach was telling me about it yesterday He said that I ought to suspect everybody He said that an attempt might be made on Willie s invention at any moment now He was joking He was not I have never seen any one so serious He said that I ought to regard every fresh person who came into the house as a possible criminal Well that guy s fresh enough muttered Ogden from the settee missus Pett started Ogden I had forgotten that you were there She uttered a cry of horror as the fact of his presence started a new train of thought Why this man may have come to kidnap you I never thought of that Ann felt it time to intervene missus Pett was hovering much too near the truth for comfort You mustn t imagine things aunt Nesta I believe it comes from writing the sort of stories you do Surely it is impossible for this man to be an impostor How would he dare take such a risk He must know that you could detect him at any moment by cabling over to missus Crocker to ask if her step son was really in America It was a bold stroke for it suggested a plan of action which if followed would mean ruin for her schemes but Ann could not refrain from chancing it She wanted to know whether her aunt had any intention of asking missus Crocker for information or whether the feud was too bitter for her pride to allow her to communicate with her sister in any way She breathed again as missus Pett stiffened grimly in her chair I should not dream of cabling to Eugenia I quite understand that said Ann But an impostor would not know that you felt like that would he I see what you mean Ann relaxed again The relief was however only momentary I cannot understand though said missus Pett why your uncle should have been so positive that he saw this young man on the Atlantic Just a chance resemblance I suppose Why uncle Peter said he saw the man whom he imagined was like Jimmy Crocker talking to me If there had been any real resemblance shouldn t I have seen it before uncle Peter Assistance came from an unexpected quarter I know the chap uncle Peter meant said Ogden He wasn t like this guy at all Ann was too grateful for the help to feel astonished at it Her mind dwelling for a mere instant on the matter decided that Ogden must have seen her on deck with somebody else than Jimmy She had certainly not lacked during the voyage for those who sought her society missus Pett seemed to be impressed I may be letting my imagination run away with me she said Of course you are aunt Nesta said Ann thankfully You don t realise what a vivid imagination you have got When I was typing that last story of yours I was simply astounded at the ideas you had thought of I remember saying so to uncle Peter You can t expect to have a wonderful imagination like yours and not imagine things can you missus Pett smiled demurely She looked hopefully at her niece waiting for more but Ann had said her say You are perfectly right my dear child she said when she was quite sure the eulogy was not to be resumed No doubt I have been foolish to suspect this young man But Lord Wisbeach s words naturally acted more strongly on a mind like mine than they would have done in the case of another woman Of course said Ann She was feeling quite happy now It had been tense while it had lasted but everything was all right now And fortunately said missus Pett there is a way by which we can find out for certain if the young man is really James Crocker Ann became rigid again A way What way Why don t you remember my dear that Skinner has known James Crocker for years Skinner The name sounded familiar but in the stress of the moment Ann could not identify it My new butler He came to me straight from Eugenia It was he who let us in when we called at her house Nobody could know better than he whether this person is really James Crocker or not Ann felt as if she had struggled to the limit of her endurance She was not prepared to cope with this unexpected blow She had not the strength to rally under it Dully she perceived that her schemes must be dismissed as a failure before they had had a chance of success Her accomplice must not return to the house to be exposed She saw that clearly enough If he came back he would walk straight into a trap She rose quickly She must warn him She must intercept him before he arrived and he might arrive at any moment now Of course she said steadying herself with an effort I never thought of that That makes it all simple I hope lunch won t be late I m hungry She sauntered to the door but directly she had closed it behind her ran to her room snatched up a hat and rushed downstairs and out into Riverside Drive Just as she reached the street Jimmy turned the corner She ran towards him holding up her hands CHAPTER XIV LORD WISBEACH Jimmy halted in his tracks The apparition had startled him He had been thinking of Ann but he had not expected her to bound out at him waving her arms What s the matter he enquired Ann pulled him towards a side street You mustn t go to the house Everything has gone wrong Everything gone wrong I thought I had made a hit I have with your uncle anyway We parted on the friendliest terms We have arranged to go to the ball game together to morrow He is going to tell them at the office that Carnegie wants to see him It isn t uncle Peter It s aunt Nesta Ah there you touch my conscience I was a little tactless I m afraid with Ogden It happened before you came into the room I suppose that is the trouble It has nothing do with that said Ann impatiently It s much worse Aunt Nesta is suspicious She has guessed that you aren t really Jimmy Crocker Great Scott How I tried to calm her down but she still suspects So now she has decided to wait and see if Skinner the butler knows you If he doesn t she will know that she was right Jimmy was frankly puzzled I don t quite follow the reasoning Surely it s a peculiar kind of test Why should she think a man cannot be honest and true unless her butler knows him There must be hundreds of worthy citizens whom he does not know Skinner arrived from England a few days ago Until then he was employed by missus Crocker Now do you understand Jimmy stopped She had spoken slowly and distinctly and there could be no possibility that he had misunderstood her yet he scarcely believed that he had heard her aright How could a man named Skinner have been his step mother s butler Bayliss had been with the family ever since they had arrived in London Are you sure Of course of course I m sure Aunt Nesta told me herself There can t possibly be a mistake because it was Skinner who let her in when she called on missus Crocker Uncle Peter told me about it He had a talk with the man in the hall and found that he was a baseball enthusiast A wild impossible idea flashed upon Jimmy It was so absurd that he felt ashamed of entertaining it even for a moment But strange things were happening these times and it might be What sort of looking man is Skinner Oh stout clean shaven I like him He s much more human than I thought butlers ever were Why Oh nothing Of course you can t go back to the house You see that He would say that you aren t Jimmy Crocker and then you would be arrested I don t see that If I am sufficiently like Crocker for his friends to mistake me for him in restaurants why shouldn t this butler mistake me too But And consider In any case there s no harm done If he fails to recognise me when he opens the door to us we shall know that the game is up and I shall have plenty of time to disappear If the likeness deceives him all will be well I propose that we go to the house ring the bell and when he appears I will say Ah Skinner Honest fellow or words to that effect He will either stare blankly at me or fawn on me like a faithful watchdog We will base our further actions on which way the butler jumps The sound of the bell died away Footsteps were heard Ann reached for Jimmy s arm and clutched it Now she whispered The door opened Next moment Jimmy s suspicion was confirmed Gaping at them from the open doorway wonderfully respectable and butlerlike in swallow tails stood his father How he came to be there and why he was there Jimmy did not know But there he was Jimmy had little faith in his father s talents as a man of discretion The elder Crocker was one of those simple straight forward people who when surprised do not conceal their surprise and who not understanding any situation in which they find themselves demand explanation on the spot Swift and immediate action was indicated on his part before his amazed parent finding him on the steps of the one house in New York where he was least likely to be should utter words that would undo everything He could see the name Jimmy trembling on mister Crocker s lips He waved his hand cheerily Ah Skinner there you are he said breezily Miss Chester was telling me that you had left my step mother I suppose you sailed on the boat before mine I came over on the Caronia I suppose you didn t expect to see me again so soon eh A spasm seemed to pass over mister Crocker s face leaving it calm and serene He had been thrown his cue and like the old actor he was he took it easily and without confusion He smiled a respectful smile No indeed sir He stepped aside to allow them to enter Jimmy caught Ann s eye as she passed him It shone with relief and admiration and it exhilarated Jimmy like wine As she moved towards the stairs he gave expression to his satisfaction by slapping his father on the back with a report that rang out like a pistol shot What was that said Ann turning Something out on the Drive I think said Jimmy A car back firing I fancy Skinner Very probably sir He followed Ann to the stairs As he started to mount them a faint whisper reached his ears At a boy It was mister Crocker s way of bestowing a father s blessing Ann walked into the drawing room her head high triumph in the glance which she cast upon her unconscious aunt Quite an interesting little scene downstairs aunt Nesta she said The meeting of the faithful old retainer and the young master Skinner was almost overcome with surprise and joy when he saw Jimmy missus Pett could not check an incautious exclamation Did Skinner recognise she began then stopped herself abruptly Ann laughed Did he recognise Jimmy Of course He was hardly likely to have forgotten him surely It isn t much more than a week since he was waiting on him in London It was a very impressive meeting said Jimmy Rather like the reunion of Ulysses and the hound Argos of which this bright eyed child here he patted Ogden on the head a proceeding violently resented by that youth has no doubt read in the course of his researches into the Classics I was Ulysses Skinner enacted the role of the exuberant dog missus Pett was not sure whether she was relieved or disappointed at this evidence that her suspicions had been without foundation On the whole relief may be said to have preponderated I have no doubt he was pleased to see you again He must have been very much astonished He was You will be meeting another old friend in a minute or two said missus Pett Jimmy had been sinking into a chair This remark stopped him in mid descent Another missus Pett glanced at the clock Lord Wisbeach is coming to lunch Lord Wisbeach cried Ann He doesn t know Jimmy Eugenia informed me in London that he was one of your best friends James Ann looked helplessly at Jimmy She was conscious again of that feeling of not being able to cope with Fate s blows of not having the strength to go on climbing over the barriers which Fate placed in her path Jimmy for his part was cursing the ill fortune that had brought Lord Wisbeach across his path He saw clearly that it only needed recognition by one or two more intimates of Jimmy Crocker to make Ann suspect his real identity The fact that she had seen him with Bayliss in Paddington Station and had fallen into the error of supposing Bayliss to be his father had kept her from suspecting until now but this could not last forever He remembered Lord Wisbeach well as a garrulous irrepressible chatterer who would probably talk about old times to such an extent as to cause Ann to realise the truth in the first five minutes The door opened Lord Wisbeach announced mister Crocker I m afraid I m late missus Pett said his lordship No You re quite punctual Lord Wisbeach here is an old friend of yours James Crocker There was an almost imperceptible pause Then Jimmy stepped forward and held out his hand Hello Wizzy old man H hello Jimmy Their eyes met In his lordship s there was an expression of unmistakable relief mingled with astonishment His face which had turned a sickly white flushed as the blood poured back into it He had the appearance of a man who had had a bad shock and is just getting over it Jimmy eyeing him curiously was not surprised at his emotion What the man s game might be he could not say but of one thing he was sure which was that this was not Lord Wisbeach but on the contrary some one he had never seen before in his life Luncheon is served madam said mister Crocker sonorously from the doorway CHAPTER XV A LITTLE BUSINESS CHAT It was not often that Ann found occasion to rejoice at the presence in her uncle s house of the six geniuses whom missus Pett had installed therein As a rule she disliked them individually and collectively But to day their company was extraordinarily welcome to her They might have their faults but at least their presence tended to keep the conversation general and prevent it becoming a duologue between Lord Wisbeach and Jimmy on the subject of old times She was still feeling weak from the reaction consequent upon the slackening of the tension of her emotions on seeing Lord Wisbeach greet Jimmy as an old acquaintance She had never hoped that that barrier would be surmounted She had pictured Lord Wisbeach drawing back with a puzzled frown on his face and an astonished But this is not Jimmy Crocker The strain had left her relieved but in no mood for conversation and she replied absently to the remarks of Howard Bemis the poet who sat on her left She looked round the table Willie Partridge was talking to missus Pett about the difference between picric acid and trinitrotoluene than which a pleasanter topic for the luncheon table could hardly be selected and the voice of Clarence Renshaw rose above all other competing noises as he spoke of the functions of the trochaic spondee There was nothing outwardly to distinguish this meal from any other which she had shared of late in that house The only thing that prevented her relief being unmixed was the fact that she could see Lord Wisbeach casting furtive glances at Jimmy who was eating with the quiet concentration of one who after days of boarding house fare finds himself in the presence of the masterpieces of a chef In the past few days Jimmy had consumed too much hash to worry now about anything like a furtive glance He had perceived Lord Wisbeach s roving eye and had no doubt that at the conclusion of the meal he would find occasion for a little chat Meanwhile however his duty was towards his tissues and their restoration He helped himself liberally from a dish which his father offered him He became aware that missus Pett was addressing him I beg your pardon Quite like old times said missus Pett genially Her suspicions had vanished completely since Lord Wisbeach s recognition of the visitor and remorse that she should have suspected him made her unwontedly amiable Being with Skinner again she explained It must remind you of London Jimmy caught his father s expressionless eye Skinner s he said handsomely is a character one cannot help but respect His nature expands before one like some beautiful flower The dish rocked in mister Crocker s hand but his face remained impassive There is no vice in Skinner proceeded Jimmy His heart is the heart of a little child missus Pett looked at this paragon of the virtues in rather a startled way She had an uncomfortable feeling that she was being laughed at She began to dislike Jimmy again For many years Skinner has been a father to me said Jimmy Who ran to help me when I fell And would some pretty story tell Or kiss the place to make it well Skinner For all her suspense Ann could not help warming towards an accomplice who carried off an unnerving situation with such a flourish She had always regarded herself with a fair degree of complacency as possessed of no mean stock of courage and resource but she could not have spoken then without betraying her anxiety She thought highly of Jimmy but all the same she could not help wishing that he would not make himself quite so conspicuous Perhaps the thought chilled her perhaps he was creating quite a new Jimmy Crocker a character which would cause Skinner and Lord Wisbeach to doubt the evidence of their eyes and begin to suspect the truth She wished she could warn him to simmer down but the table was a large one and he and she were at opposite ends of it Jimmy meanwhile was thoroughly enjoying himself He felt that he was being the little ray of sunshine about the home and making a good impression He was completely happy He liked the food he liked seeing his father buttle and he liked these amazing freaks who were it appeared fellow inmates with him of this highly desirable residence He wished that old mister Pett could have been present He had conceived a great affection for mister Pett and registered a mental resolve to lose no time in weaning him from his distressing habit of allowing the office to interfere with his pleasures He was planning a little trip to the Polo Grounds in which mister Pett his father and a number of pop bottles were to be his companions when his reverie was interrupted by a sudden cessation of the buzz of talk He looked up from his plate to find the entire company regarding Willie Partridge open mouthed Willie with gleaming eyes was gazing at a small test tube which he had produced from his pocket and placed beside his plate I have enough in this test tube said Willie airily to blow half New York to bits The silence was broken by a crash in the background mister Crocker had dropped a chafing dish If I were to drop this little tube like that said Willie using the occurrence as a topical illustration we shouldn t be here Don t drop it advised Jimmy What is it Partridgite missus Pett had risen from the table with blanched face Willie how can you bring that stuff here What are you thinking of Willie smiles a patronising smile There is not the slightest danger aunt Nesta It cannot explode without concussion I have been carrying it about with me all the morning He bestowed on the test tube the look a fond parent might give his favourite child missus Pett was not reassured Go and put it in your uncle s safe at once Put it away I haven t the combination Call your uncle up at once at the office and ask him Very well If you wish it aunt Nesta But there is no danger Don t take that thing with you screamed missus Pett as he rose You might drop it Come back for it Very well Conversation flagged after Willie s departure The presence of the test tube seemed to act on the spirits of the company after the fashion of the corpse at the Egyptian banquet Howard Bemis who was sitting next to it edged away imperceptibly till he nearly crowded Ann off her chair Presently Willie returned He picked up the test tube put it in his pocket with a certain jauntiness and left the room again Now if you hear a sudden bang and find yourself disappearing through the roof said Jimmy that will be it Willie returned and took his place at the table again But the spirit had gone out of the gathering The voice of Clarence Renshaw was hushed and Howard Bemis spoke no more of the influence of Edgar Lee Masters on modern literature missus Pett left the room followed by Ann The geniuses drifted away one by one Jimmy having lighted a cigarette and finished his coffee perceived that he was alone with his old friend Lord Wisbeach and that his old friend Lord Wisbeach was about to become confidential The fair haired young man opened the proceedings by going to the door and looking out This done he returned to his seat and gazed fixedly at Jimmy What s your game he asked Jimmy returned his gaze blandly My game he said What do you mean Can the coy stuff urged his lordship brusquely Talk sense and talk it quick We may be interrupted at any moment What s your game What are you here for Jimmy raised his eyebrows I am a prodigal nephew returned to the fold Oh quit your kidding Are you one of Potter s lot Who is Potter You know who Potter is On the contrary My life has never been brightened by so much as a sight of Potter Is that true Absolutely Are you working on your own then I am not working at all at present There is some talk of my learning to be an Asparagus Adjuster by mail later on You make me sick said Lord Wisbeach Where s the sense of trying to pull this line of talk Why not put your cards on the table We ve both got in here on the same lay and there s no use fighting and balling the thing up Do you wish me to understand said Jimmy that you are not my old friend Lord Wisbeach No And you re not my old friend Jimmy Crocker What makes you think that If you had been would you have pretended to recognise me upstairs just now I tell you pal I was all in for a second till you gave me the high sign Jimmy laughed It would have been awkward for you if I really had been Jimmy Crocker wouldn t it And it would have been awkward for you if I had really been Lord Wisbeach Who are you by the way The boys call me Gentleman Jack Why asked Jimmy surprised Lord Wisbeach ignored the question I m working with Burke s lot just now Say let s be sensible about this I ll be straight with you straight as a string Did you say string or spring And I ll expect you to be straight with me Are we to breathe confidences into each other s ears Lord Wisbeach went to the door again and submitted the passage to a second examination You seem nervous said Jimmy I don t like that butler He s up to something Do you think he s one of Potter s lot Shouldn t wonder He isn t on the level anyway or why did he pretend to recognise you as Jimmy Crocker Recognition of me as Jimmy Crocker seems to be the acid test of honesty He was in a tight place same as I was said Lord Wisbeach He couldn t know that you weren t really Jimmy Crocker until you put him wise same as you did me by pretending to know him He looked at Jimmy with grudging admiration You d got your nerve with you pal coming in here like this You were taking big chances You couldn t have known you wouldn t run up against some one who really knew Jimmy Crocker What would you have done if this butler guy had really been on the level The risks of the profession When I think of the work I had to put in said Lord Wisbeach it makes me tired to think of some one else just walking in here as you did What made you choose Lord Wisbeach as your alias I knew that I could get away with it I came over on the boat with him and I knew he was travelling round the world and wasn t going to stay more than a day in New York Even then I had to go some to get into this place Burke told me to get hold of old Chester and get a letter of introduction from him And here you come along and just stroll in and tell them you have come to stay He brooded for a moment on the injustice of things Well what are you going to do about it Pal About what About us both being here Are you going to be sensible and work in with me and divvy up later on or are you going to risk spoiling everything by trying to hog the whole thing I ll be square with you It isn t as if there was any use in trying to bluff each other We re both here for the same thing You want to get hold of that powder stuff that Partridgite and so do I You believe in Partridgite then Oh can it said Lord Wisbeach disgustedly What s the use Of course I believe in it Burke s had his eye on the thing for a year You ve heard of Dwight Partridge haven t you Well this guy s his son Every one knows that Dwight Partridge was working on an explosive when he died and here s his son comes along with a test tube full of stuff which he says could blow this city to bits What s the answer The boy s been working on the old man s dope From what I ve seen of him I guess there wasn t much more to be done on it or he wouldn t have done it He s pretty well dead from the neck up as far as I can see But that doesn t alter the fact that he s got the stuff and that you and I have got to get together and make a deal If we don t I m not saying you mightn t gum my game just as I might gum yours but where s the sense in that It only means taking extra chances Whereas if we sit in together there s enough in it for both of us You know as well as I do that there s a dozen markets which ll bid against each other for stuff like that Partridgite If you re worrying about Burke giving you a square deal forget it I ll fix Burke He ll treat you nice all right Jimmy ground the butt of his cigarette against his plate I m no orator as Brutus is but as you know me all a plain blunt man And speaking in the capacity of a plain blunt man I rise to reply Nothing doing What You won t come in Jimmy shook his head I m sorry to disappoint you Wizzy if I may still call you that but your offer fails to attract I will not get together or sit in or anything else On the contrary I am about to go to missus Pett and inform her that there is a snake in her Eden You re not going to squeal on me At the top of my voice Lord Wisbeach laughed unpleasantly Yes you will he said How are you going to explain why you recognised me as an old pal before lunch if I m a crook after lunch You can t give me away without giving yourself away If I m not Lord Wisbeach then you re not Jimmy Crocker Jimmy sighed I get you Life is very complex isn t it Lord Wisbeach rose You d better think it over son he said You aren t going to get anywhere by acting like a fool You can t stop me going after this stuff and if you won t come in and go fifty fifty you ll find yourself left I ll beat you to it He left the room and Jimmy lighting a fresh cigarette addressed himself to the contemplation of this new complication in his affairs It was quite true what Gentleman Jack or Joe or whatever the boys called him had said To denounce him meant denouncing himself Jimmy smoked thoughtfully Not for the first time he wished that his record during the past few years had been of a snowier character He began to appreciate what must have been the feelings of doctor Jekyll under the handicap of his disreputable second self mister Hyde CHAPTER XVI missus PETT TAKES PRECAUTIONS missus Pett on leaving the luncheon table had returned to the drawing room to sit beside the sick settee of her stricken child She was troubled about Ogden The poor lamb was not at all himself to day A bowl of clear soup the midday meal prescribed by Doctor Briginshaw lay untasted at his side She crossed the room softly and placed a cool hand on her son s aching brow
4108_2772_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Gee said Ogden wearily 
none	none	Are you feeling a little better Oggie darling No said Ogden firmly
4108_2772_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 I m feeling a lot worse 
4108_2772_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 You haven t drunk your nice soup 
4108_2772_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Feed it to the cat 
4108_2772_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Could you eat a nice bowl of bread and milk precious 
4108_2772_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Have a heart replied the sufferer 
none	none	missus Pett returned to her seat sorrowfully It struck her as an odd coincidence that the poor child was nearly always like this on the morning after she had been entertaining guests she put it down to the reaction from the excitement working on a highly strung temperament To his present collapse the brutal behaviour of Jerry Mitchell had of course contributed Every drop of her maternal blood boiled with rage and horror whenever she permitted herself to contemplate the excesses of the late Jerry 
4108_2772_000011_000004	train-clean-360	She had always mistrusted the man 
none	none	She had never liked his face not merely on aesthetic grounds but because she had seemed to detect in it a lurking savagery 
4108_2772_000011_000006	train-clean-360	How right events had proved this instinctive feeling 
none	none	missus Pett was not vulgar enough to describe the feeling even to herself as a hunch but a hunch it had been and like every one whose hunches have proved correct she was conscious in the midst of her grief of a certain complacency It seemed to her that hers must be an intelligence and insight above the ordinary The peace of the early afternoon settled upon the drawing room missus Pett had taken up a book Ogden on the settee breathed stentorously Faint snores proceeded from the basket in the corner where Aida the Pomeranian lay curled in refreshing sleep 
4108_2772_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Through the open window floated sounds of warmth and Summer 
none	none	Yielding to the drowsy calm missus Pett was just nodding into a pleasant nap when the door opened and Lord Wisbeach came in Lord Wisbeach had been doing some rapid thinking Rapid thought is one of the essentials in the composition of men who are known as Gentleman Jack to the boys and whose livelihood is won only by a series of arduous struggles against the forces of Society and the machinations of Potter and his gang Condensed into capsule form his lordship s meditations during the minutes after he had left Jimmy in the dining room amounted to the realisation that the best mode of defence is attack It is your man who knows how to play the bold game on occasion who wins A duller schemer than Lord Wisbeach might have been content to be inactive after such a conversation as had just taken place between himself and Jimmy His lordship giving the matter the concentrated attention of his trained mind had hit on a better plan and he had come to the drawing room now to put it into effect His entrance shattered the peaceful atmosphere Aida who had been gurgling apoplectically sprang snarling from the basket and made for the intruder open mouthed Her shrill barking rang through the room 
4108_2772_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Lord Wisbeach hated little dogs 
none	none	He hated and feared them Many men of action have these idiosyncrasies He got behind a chair and said There there Aida whose outburst was mere sound and fury and who had no intention whatever of coming to blows continued the demonstration from a safe distance till missus Pett swooping down picked her up and held her in her lap where she consented to remain growling subdued defiance Lord Wisbeach came out from behind his chair and sat down warily
4108_2772_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Can I have a word with you missus Pett 
4108_2772_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly Lord Wisbeach 
none	none	His lordship looked meaningly at Ogden
4108_2772_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 In private you know 
4108_2772_000021_000000	train-clean-360	He then looked meaningly at missus Pett 
none	none	Ogden darling said missus Pett I think you had better go to your room and undress and get into bed A little nice sleep might do you all the good in the world With surprising docility the boy rose All right he said
4108_2772_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Poor Oggie is not at all well to day said missus Pett when he was gone 
4108_2772_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 He is very subject to these attacks 
4108_2772_000025_000002	train-clean-360	What do you want to tell me Lord Wisbeach 
none	none	His lordship drew his chair a little closer
4108_2772_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 missus Pett you remember what I told you yesterday 
none	none	Of course Might I ask what you know of this man who has come here calling himself Jimmy Crocker missus Pett started She remembered that she had used almost that very expression to Ann Her suspicions which had been lulled by the prompt recognition of the visitor by Skinner and Lord Wisbeach returned 
4108_2772_000030_000003	train-clean-360	It is one of the effects of a successful hunch that it breeds other hunches 
4108_2772_000030_000004	train-clean-360	She had been right about Jerry Mitchell was she to be proved right about the self styled Jimmy Crocker 
none	none	You have seen your nephew I believe Never But
4108_2772_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 That man said Lord Wisbeach impassively is not your nephew 
none	none	missus Pett thrilled all down her spine She had been right But you But I pretended to recognise him Just so 
4108_2772_000036_000002	train-clean-360	For a purpose 
4108_2772_000036_000003	train-clean-360	I wanted to make him think that I suspected nothing 
4108_2772_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Then you think 
4108_2772_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Remember what I said to you yesterday 
4108_2772_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 But Skinner the butler recognised him 
none	none	Exactly It goes to prove that what I said about Skinner was correct 
4108_2772_000040_000002	train-clean-360	They are working together 
4108_2772_000040_000003	train-clean-360	The thing is self evident Look at it from your point of view 
4108_2772_000040_000004	train-clean-360	How simple it is 
none	none	This man pretends to an intimate acquaintance with Skinner You take that as evidence of Skinner s honesty Skinner recognises this man You take that as proof that this man is really your nephew The fact that Skinner recognised as Jimmy Crocker a man who is not Jimmy Crocker condemns him But why did you I told you that I pretended to accept this man as the real Jimmy Crocker for a purpose At present there is nothing that you can do Mere impersonation is not a crime If I had exposed him when we met you would have gained nothing beyond driving him from the house Whereas if we wait if we pretend to suspect nothing we shall undoubtedly catch him red handed in an attempt on your nephew s invention You are sure that that is why he has come What other reason could he have I thought he might be trying to kidnap Ogden Lord Wisbeach frowned thoughtfully He had not taken this consideration into account It is possible he said There have been several attempts made have there not to kidnap your son At one time said missus Pett proudly there was not a child in America who had to be more closely guarded Why the kidnappers had a special nick name for Oggie They called him the Little Nugget Of course then it is quite possible that that may be the man s object In any case our course must be the same We must watch every move he makes He paused I could help pardon my suggesting it I could help a great deal more if you were to invite me to live in the house You were kind enough to ask me to visit you in the country but it will be two weeks before you go to the Country and in those two weeks
4108_2772_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 You must come here at once Lord Wisbeach 
none	none	To night To day I think that would be the best plan I cannot tell you how grateful I am for all you are doing You have been so kind to me missus Pett said Lord Wisbeach with feeling that it is surely only right that I should try to make some return 
4108_2772_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Let us leave it at this then 
4108_2772_000053_000002	train-clean-360	I will come here to night and will make it my business to watch these two men 
none	none	I will go and pack my things and have them sent here
4108_2772_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 It is wonderful of you Lord Wisbeach 
4108_2772_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Not at all replied his lordship 
none	none	It will be a pleasure He held out his hand drawing it back rapidly as the dog Aida made a snap at it Substituting a long range leave taking for the more intimate farewell he left the room 
4108_2772_000057_000000	train-clean-360	When he had gone missus Pett remained for some minutes thinking She was aflame with excitement 
none	none	She had a sensational mind and it had absorbed Lord Wisbeach s revelations eagerly Her admiration for his lordship was intense and she trusted him utterly The only doubt that occurred to her was whether with the best intentions in the world he would be able unassisted to foil a pair of schemers so distant from each other geographically as the man who called himself Jimmy Crocker and the man who had called himself Skinner That was a point on which they had not touched the fact that one impostor was above stairs the other below It seemed to missus Pett impossible that Lord Wisbeach for all his zeal could watch Skinner without neglecting Jimmy or foil Jimmy without taking his attention off Skinner It was manifestly a situation that called for allies 
4108_2772_000057_000007	train-clean-360	She felt that she must have further assistance 
none	none	To missus Pett doubtless owing to her hobby of writing sensational fiction there was a magic in the word detective which was shared by no other word in the language She loved detectives their keen eyes their quiet smiles their Derby hats When they came on the stage she leaned forward in her orchestra chair when they entered her own stories she always wrote with a greater zest It is not too much to say that she had an almost spiritual attachment for detectives and the idea of neglecting to employ one in real life now that circumstances had combined to render his advent so necessary struck her as both rash and inartistic In the old days when Ogden had been kidnapped the only thing which had brought her balm had been the daily interviews with the detectives She ached to telephone for one now The only consideration that kept her back was a regard for Lord Wisbeach s feelings He had been so kind and so shrewd that to suggest reinforcing him with outside assistance must infallibly wound him deeply And yet the situation demanded the services of a trained specialist Lord Wisbeach had borne himself during their recent conversation in such a manner as to leave no doubt that he considered himself adequate to deal with the matter single handed but admirable though he was he was not a professional exponent of the art of espionage 
4108_2772_000059_000004	train-clean-360	He needed to be helped in spite of himself 
4108_2772_000060_000000	train-clean-360	A happy solution struck missus Pett 
none	none	There was no need to tell him She could combine the installation of a detective with the nicest respect for her ally s feelings by the simple process of engaging one without telling Lord Wisbeach anything about it The telephone stood at her elbow concealed at the express request of the interior decorator who had designed the room in the interior of what looked to the casual eye like a stuffed owl On a table near at hand handsomely bound in morocco to resemble a complete works of Shakespeare was the telephone book missus Pett hesitated no longer She had forgotten the address of the detective agency which she had employed on the occasion of the kidnapping of Ogden but she remembered the name and also the name of the delightfully sympathetic manager or proprietor or whatever he was who had listened to her troubles then 
4108_2772_000062_000000	train-clean-360	She unhooked the receiver and gave a number 
4108_2772_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 I want to speak to mister Sturgis she said 
4108_2772_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh mister Sturgis said missus Pett 
none	none	I wonder if you could possibly run up here yes now This is missus Peter Pett speaking You remember we met some years ago when I was missus Ford 
4108_2772_000064_000003	train-clean-360	Yes the mother of Ogden Ford 
4108_2772_000064_000004	train-clean-360	I want to consult You will come up at once 
4108_2772_000064_000005	train-clean-360	Thank you so much 
none	none	Good bye missus Pett hung up the receiver CHAPTER XVII MISS TRIMBLE DETECTIVE Downstairs in the dining room Jimmy was smoking cigarettes and reviewing in his mind the peculiarities of the situation when Ann came in Oh there you are said Ann I thought you must have gone upstairs I have been having a delightful and entertaining conversation with my old chum Lord Wisbeach Good gracious What about Oh this and that Not about old times No we did not touch upon old times Does he still believe that you are Jimmy Crocker I m so nervous said Ann that I can hardly speak I shouldn t be nervous said Jimmy encouragingly I don t see how things could be going better That s what makes me nervous Our luck is too good to last We are taking such risks It would have been bad enough without Skinner and Lord Wisbeach At any moment you may make some fatal slip Thank goodness aunt Nesta s suspicions have been squashed for the time being now that Skinner and Lord Wisbeach have accepted you as genuine But then you have only seen them for a few minutes When they have been with you a little longer they may get suspicious themselves I can t imagine how you managed to keep it up with Lord Wisbeach I should have thought he would be certain to say something about the time when you were supposed to be friends in London We simply mustn t strain our luck I want you to go straight to aunt Nesta now and ask her to let Jerry come back You still refuse to let me take Jerry s place Of course I do You ll find aunt Nesta upstairs Very well But suppose I can t persuade her to forgive Jerry I think she is certain to do anything you ask You saw how friendly she was to you at lunch I don t see how anything can have happened since lunch to change her Very well I ll go to her now And when you have seen her go to the library and wait for me It s the second room along the passage outside here I have promised to drive Lord Wisbeach down to his hotel in my car I met him outside just now and he tells me aunt Nesta has invited him to stay here so he wants to go and get his things ready I shan t be twenty minutes I shall come straight back Jimmy found himself vaguely disquieted by this piece of information Lord Wisbeach is coming to stay here Yes Why Oh nothing Well I ll go and see missus Pett No traces of the disturbance which had temporarily ruffled the peace of the drawing room were to be observed when Jimmy reached it The receiver of the telephone was back on its hook missus Pett back in her chair the dog Aida back in her basket missus Pett her mind at ease now that she had taken the step of summoning mister Sturgis was reading a book one of her own and was absorbed in it The dog Aida slumbered noisily The sight of Jimmy however roused missus Pett from her literary calm To her eye after what Lord Wisbeach had revealed there was something sinister in the very way in which he walked into the room He made her flesh creep In A Society Thug Mobbs and Stifien one dollar thirty five cents net all rights of translation reserved including the Scandinavian she had portrayed just such a man smooth specious and formidable Instinctively as she watched Jimmy her mind went back to the perfectly rotten behaviour of her own Marsden Tuke it was only in the last chapter but one that they managed to foil his outrageous machinations and it seemed to her that here was Tuke in the flesh She had pictured him she remembered as a man of agreeable exterior the better calculated to deceive and undo the virtuous and the fact that Jimmy was a presentable looking young man only made him appear viler in her eyes In a word she could hardly have been in less suitable frame of mind to receive graciously any kind of a request from him She would have suspected ulterior motives if he had asked her the time Jimmy did not know this He thought that she eyed him a trifle frostily but he did not attribute this to any suspicion of him He tried to ingratiate himself by smiling pleasantly He could not have made a worse move Marsden Tuke s pleasant smile had been his deadliest weapon Under its influence deluded people had trusted him alone with their jewellery and what not Aunt Nesta said Jimmy I wonder if I might ask you a personal favour missus Pett shuddered at the glibness with which he brought out the familiar name This was superTuke Marsden himself scoundrel as he was could not have called her Aunt Nesta as smoothly as that Yes she said at last She found it difficult to speak I happened to meet an old friend of mine this morning He was very sorry for himself It appears that for excellent reasons of course you had dismissed him I mean Jerry Mitchell missus Pett was now absolutely appalled The conspiracy seemed to grow more complicated every moment Already its ramifications embraced this man before her a trusted butler and her husband s late physical instructor Who could say where it would end She had never liked Jerry Mitchell but she had never suspected him of being a conspirator Yet if this man who called himself Jimmy Crocker was an old friend of his how could he be anything else Mitchell Jimmy went on unconscious of the emotions which his every word was arousing in his hearer s bosom told me about what happened yesterday He is very depressed He said he could not think how he happened to behave in such an abominable way He entreated me to put in a word for him with you He begged me to tell you how he regretted the brutal assault and asked me to mention the fact that his record had hitherto been blameless Jimmy paused He was getting no encouragement and seemed to be making no impression whatever missus Pett was sitting bolt upright in her chair in a stiffly defensive sort of way She had the appearance of being absolutely untouched by his eloquence In fact he concluded lamely he is very sorry There was silence for a moment How do you come to know Mitchell asked missus Pett We knew each other when I was over here working on the Chronicle I saw him fight once or twice He is an excellent fellow and used to have a right swing that was a pippin I should say extremely excellent Brought it up from the floor you know I strongly object to prize fighters said missus Pett and I was opposed to Mitchell coming into the house from the first You wouldn t let him come back I suppose queried Jimmy tentatively I would not I would not dream of such a thing He s full of remorse you know If he has a spark of humanity I have no doubt of it Jimmy paused This thing was not coming out as well as it might have done He feared that for once in her life Ann was about to be denied something on which she had set her heart The reflection that this would be extremely good for her competed for precedence in his mind with the reflection that she would probably blame him for the failure which would be unpleasant He is very fond of Ogden really H m said missus Pett I think the heat must have made him irritable In his normal state he would not strike a lamb I ve known him to do it Do what Not strike lambs Isch said missus Pett the first time Jimmy had ever heard that remarkable monosyllable proceed from human lips He took it rightly to be intended to convey disapproval scepticism and annoyance He was convinced that this mission was going to be one of his failures Then I may tell him he said that it s all right That what is all right That he may come back here Certainly not missus Pett was not a timid woman but she could not restrain a shudder as she watched the plot unfold before her eyes Her gratitude towards Lord Wisbeach at this point in the proceedings almost became hero worship If it had not been for him and his revelations concerning this man before her she would certainly have yielded to the request that Jerry Mitchell be allowed to return to the house Much as she disliked Jerry she had been feeling so triumphant at the thought of Jimmy Crocker coming to her in spite of his step mother s wishes and so pleased at having unexpectedly got her own way that she could have denied him nothing that he might have cared to ask But now it was as if herself unseen she were looking on at a gang of conspirators hatching some plot She was in the strong strategic position of the person who is apparently deceived but who in reality knows all For a moment she considered the question of admitting Jerry to the house Evidently his presence was necessary to the consummation of the plot whatever it might be and it occurred to her that it might be as well on the principle of giving the schemers enough rope to hang themselves with to let him come back and play his part Then she reflected that with the self styled Jimmy Crocker as well as the fraudulent Skinner in the house Lord Wisbeach and the detective would have their hands quite full enough It would be foolish to complicate matters She glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece mister Sturgis would be arriving soon if he had really started at once from his office as he had promised She drew comfort from the imminence of his coming It would be pleasant to put herself in the hands of an expert Jimmy had paused mid way to the door and was standing there as if reluctant to accept her answer to his plea It would never occur again What happened yesterday I mean You need not be afraid of that I am not afraid of that responded missus Pett tartly If you had seen him when I did When did you You landed from the boat this morning you went to mister Pett s office and then came straight up here with him I am interested to know when you did see Mitchell She regretted this thrust a little for she felt it might put the man on his guard by showing that she suspected something but she could not resist it and it pleased her to see that her companion was momentarily confused I met him when I was going for my luggage said Jimmy It was just the way Marsden Tuke would have got out of it Tuke was always wriggling out of corners like that missus Pett s horror of Jimmy grew I told him of course said Jimmy that you had very kindly invited me to stay with you and he told me all about his trouble and implored me to plead for him If you had seen him when I did all gloom and repentance you would have been sorry for him Your woman s heart Whatever Jimmy was about to say regarding missus Pett s woman s heart was interrupted by the opening of the door and the deep respectful voice of mister Crocker mister Sturgis The detective entered briskly as if time were money with him as indeed it was for the International Detective Agency of which he was the proprietor did a thriving business He was a gaunt hungry looking man of about fifty with sunken eyes and thin lips It was his habit to dress in the height of fashion for one of his favourite axioms was that a man might be a detective and still look a gentleman and his appearance was that of the individual usually described as a popular clubman That is to say he looked like a floorwalker taking a Sunday stroll His prosperous exterior deceived Jimmy satisfactorily and the latter left the room little thinking that the visitor was anything but an ordinary caller The detective glanced keenly at him as he passed He made a practice of glancing keenly at nearly everything It cost nothing and impressed clients I am so glad you have come mister Sturgis said missus Pett Won t you sit down mister Sturgis sat down pulled up the knees of his trousers that half inch which keeps them from bagging and so preserves the gentlemanliness of the appearance and glanced keenly at missus Pett Who was that young man who just went out It is about him that I wished to consult you mister Sturgis mister Sturgis leaned back and placed the tips of his fingers together Tell me how he comes to be here He pretends that he is my nephew James Crocker Your nephew Have you never seen your nephew Never I ought to tell you that a few years ago my sister married for the second time I disapproved of the marriage and refused to see her husband or his son he was a widower A few weeks ago for private reasons I went over to England where they are living and asked my sister to let the boy come here to work in my husband s office She refused and my husband and I returned to New York This morning I was astonished to get a telephone call from mister Pett from his office to say that James Crocker had unexpectedly arrived after all and was then at the office They came up here and the young man seemed quite genuine Indeed he had an offensive jocularity which would be quite in keeping with the character of the real James Crocker from what I have heard of him mister Sturgis nodded Know what you mean Saw that thing in the paper he said briefly Yes Now it is very curious but almost from the start I was uneasy When I say that the young man seemed genuine I mean that he completely deceived my husband and my niece who lives with us But I had reasons which I need not go into now for being on my guard and I was suspicious What aroused my suspicion was the fact that my husband thought that he remembered this young man as a fellow traveller of ours on the Atlantic on our return voyage while he claimed to have landed that morning on the Caronia You are certain of that missus Pett He stated positively that he had landed this morning Yes Quite positively Unfortunately I myself had no chance of judging the truth of what he said as I am such a bad sailor that I was seldom out of my stateroom from beginning to end of the voyage However as I say I was suspicious I did not see how I could confirm my suspicions until I remembered that my new butler Skinner had come straight from my sister s house That is the man who just admitted me Exactly He entered my employment only a few days ago having come direct from London I decided to wait until Skinner should meet this young man Of course when he first came into the house he was with my husband who opened the door with his key so that they did not meet then I understand said mister Sturgis glancing keenly at the dog Aida who had risen and was sniffing at his ankles You thought that if Skinner recognised this young man it would be proof of his identity Exactly Did he recognise him Yes But wait I have not finished He recognised him and for the moment I was satisfied But I had had my suspicions of Skinner too I ought to tell you that I had been warned against him by a great friend of mine Lord Wisbeach an English peer whom we have known intimately for a very long time He is one of the Shropshire Wisbeaches you know No doubt said mister Sturgis Lord Wisbeach used to be intimate with the real Jimmy Crocker He came to lunch to day and met this impostor He pretended to recognise him in order to put him off his guard but after lunch he came to me here and told me that in reality he had never seen him before in his life and that whoever else he might be he was certainly not James Crocker my nephew She broke off and looked at mister Sturgis expectantly The detective smiled a quiet smile And even that is not all There is another thing mister Pett used to employ as a physical instructor a man named Jerry Mitchell Yesterday I dismissed him for reasons it is not necessary to go into To day just as you arrived in fact the man who calls himself Jimmy Crocker was begging me to allow Mitchell to return to the house and resume his work here Does that not strike you as suspicious mister Sturgis The detective closed his eyes and smiled his quiet smile again He opened his eyes and fixed them on missus Pett As pretty a case as I have come across in years he said missus Pett let me tell you something It is one of my peculiarities that I never forget a face You say that this young man pretends to have landed this morning from the Caronia Well I saw him myself more than a week ago in a Broadway cafe You did Talking to Jerry Mitchell I know Mitchell well by sight missus Pett uttered an exclamation And this butler of yours Skinner Shall I tell you something about him You perhaps know that when the big detective agencies Anderson s and the others are approached in the matter of tracing a man who is wanted for anything they sometimes ask the smaller agencies like my own to work in with them It saves time and widens the field of operations We are very glad to do Anderson s service and Anderson s are big enough to be able to afford to let us do it Now a few days ago a friend of mine in Anderson s came to me with a sheaf of photographs which had been sent to them from London Whether some private client in London or from Scotland Yard I do not know Nor do I know why the original of the photograph was wanted But Anderson s had been asked to trace him and make a report My peculiar gift for remembering faces has enabled me to oblige the Anderson people once or twice before in this way I studied the photographs very carefully and kept two of them for reference I have one with me now He felt in his pockets Do you recognise it missus Pett stared at the photograph It was the presentment of a stout good humoured man of middle age whose solemn gaze dwelt on the middle distance in that fixed way which a man achieves only in photographs Skinner Exactly said mister Sturgis taking the photograph from her and putting it back in his pocket I recognised him directly he opened the door to me But but I am almost certain that Skinner is the man who let me in when I called on my sister in London Almost repeated the detective Did you observe him very closely No I suppose I did not The type is a very common one It would be very easy indeed for a clever crook to make himself up as your sister s butler closely enough to deceive any one who had only seen the original once and for a short time then What their game is I could not say at present but taking everything into consideration there can be no doubt whatever that the man who calls himself your nephew and the man who calls himself your sister s butler are working together and that Jerry Mitchell is working in with them As I say I cannot tell you what they are after at present but there is no doubt that your unexpected dismissal of Mitchell must have upset their plans That would account for the eagerness to get him back into the house again Lord Wisbeach thought that they were trying to steal my nephew s explosive Perhaps you have read in the papers that my nephew Willie Partridge has completed an explosive which is more powerful than any at present known His father you have heard of him of course Dwight Partridge mister Sturgis nodded His father was working on it at the time of his death and Willie has gone on with his experiments where he left off To day at lunch he showed us a test tube full of the explosive He put it in my husband s safe in the library Lord Wisbeach is convinced that these scoundrels are trying to steal this but I cannot help feeling that this is another of those attempts to kidnap my son Ogden What do you think It is impossible to say at this stage of the proceedings All we can tell is that there is some plot going on You refused of course to allow Mitchell to come back to the house Yes You think that was wise Undoubtedly If his absence did not handicap them they would not be so anxious to have him on the spot What shall we do You wish me to undertake the case Of course mister Sturgis frowned thoughtfully It would be useless for me to come here myself By bad luck the man who pretends to be your nephew has seen me If I were to come to stay here he would suspect something He would be on his guard He pondered with closed eyes Miss Trimble he exclaimed I beg your pardon You want Miss Trimble She is the smartest worker in my office This is precisely the type of case she could handle to perfection A woman said missus Pett doubtfully A woman in a thousand said mister Sturgis A woman in a million But physically would a woman be Miss Trimble knows more about jiu jitsu than the Japanese professor who taught her At one time she was a Strong Woman in small time vaudeville She is an expert revolver shot I am not worrying about Miss Trimble s capacity to do the work I am only wondering in what capacity it would be best for her to enter the house Have you a vacancy for a parlour maid I could make one Do so at once Miss Trimble is at her best as a parlour maid She handled the Marling divorce case in that capacity Have you a telephone in the room missus Pett opened the stuffed owl The detective got in touch with his office mister Sturgis speaking Tell Miss Trimble to come to the phone Miss Trimble I am speaking from missus Pett s on Riverside Drive You know the house I want you to come up at once Take a taxi Go to the back door and ask to see missus Pett Say you have come about getting a place here as a maid Understand Right

none	none	Miss Trimble Hello Yes don t hang up for a moment Do you remember those photographs I showed you yesterday Yes the photographs from Anderson s I ve found the man He s the butler here Take a look at him when you get to the house Now go and get a taxi missus Pett will explain everything when you arrive He hung up the receiver I think I had better go now missus Pett It would not do for me to be here while these fellows are on their guard I can safely leave the matter to Miss Trimble I wish you good afternoon After he had gone missus Pett vainly endeavoured to interest herself again in her book but in competition with the sensations of life fiction even though she had written it herself had lost its power and grip It seemed to her that Miss Trimble must be walking to the house instead of journeying thither in a taxi cab But a glance at the clock assured her that only five minutes had elapsed since the detective s departure She went to the window and looked out She was hopelessly restless At last a taxi cab stopped at the corner and a young woman got out and walked towards the house If this were Miss Trimble she certainly looked capable She was a stumpy square shouldered person and even at that distance it was possible to perceive that she had a face of no common shrewdness and determination The next moment she had turned down the side street in the direction of the back premises of missus Pett s house and a few minutes later mister Crocker presented himself A young person wishes to see you madam A young person of the name of Trimble A pang passed through missus Pett as she listened to his measured tones It was tragic that so perfect a butler should be a scoundrel She says that you desired her to call in connection with a situation Show her up here Skinner She is the new parlour maid I will send her down to you when I have finished speaking to her Very good madam There seemed to missus Pett to be a faint touch of defiance in Miss Trimble s manner as she entered the room The fact was that Miss Trimble held strong views on the equal distribution of property and rich people s houses always affected her adversely mister Crocker retired closing the door gently behind him A meaning sniff proceeded from missus Pett s visitor as she looked round at the achievements of the interior decorator who had lavished his art unsparingly in this particular room At this close range she more than fulfilled the promise of that distant view which missus Pett had had of her from the window Her face was not only shrewd and determined it was menacing She had thick eyebrows from beneath which small glittering eyes looked out like dangerous beasts in undergrowth and the impressive effect of these was accentuated by the fact that while the left eye looked straight out at its object the right eye had a sort of roving commission and was now while its colleague fixed missus Pett with a gimlet stare examining the ceiling As to the rest of the appearance of this remarkable woman her nose was stubby and aggressive and her mouth had the coldly forbidding look of the closed door of a subway express when you have just missed the train It bade you keep your distance on pain of injury missus Pett though herself a strong woman was conscious of a curious weakness as she looked at a female of the species so much deadlier than any male whom she had ever encountered and came near feeling a half pity for the unhappy wretches on whom this dynamic maiden was to be unleashed She hardly knew how to open the conversation Miss Trimble however was equal to the occasion She always preferred to open conversations herself Her lips parted and words flew out as if shot from a machine gun As far as missus Pett could observe she considered it unnecessary to part her teeth preferring to speak with them clenched This gave an additional touch of menace to her speech Dafternoon said Miss Trimble and missus Pett backed convulsively into the padded recesses of her chair feeling as if somebody had thrown a brick at her Good afternoon she said faintly Gladda meecher siz Pett mister Sturge semme up Said y ad job f r me Came here squick scould I beg your pardon Squick scould Got slow taxi Oh yes Miss Trimble s right eye flashed about the room like a searchlight but she kept the other hypnotically on her companion s face Whass trouble The right eye rested for a moment on a magnificent Corot over the mantelpiece and she snifted again Not s prised y have trouble All rich people ve trouble Noth t do with their time cept get nto trouble She frowned disapprovingly at a Canaletto You ah appear to dislike the rich said missus Pett as nearly in her grand manner as she could contrive Miss Trimble bowled over the grand manner as if it had been a small fowl and she an automobile She rolled over it and squashed it flat Hate em Sogelist I beg your pardon said missus Pett humbly This woman was beginning to oppress her to an almost unbelievable extent Sogelist No use f r idle rich Ev read B nard Shaw Huh Or Upton Sinclair Uh Read m Make y think a bit Well y haven t told me whasser trouble missus Pett was by this time heartily regretting the impulse which had caused her to telephone to mister Sturgis In a career which had had more than its share of detectives both real and fictitious she had never been confronted with a detective like this The galling thing was that she was helpless After all one engaged a detective for his or her shrewdness and efficiency not for suavity and polish A detective who hurls speech at you through clenched teeth and yet detects is better value for the money than one who though an ideal companion for the drawing room is incompetent and missus Pett like most other people subconsciously held the view that the ruder a person is the more efficient he must be It is but rarely that any one is found who is not dazzled by the glamour of incivility She crushed down her resentment at her visitor s tone and tried to concentrate her mind on the fact that this was a business matter and that what she wanted was results rather than fair words She found it easier to do this when looking at the other s face It was a capable face Not beautiful perhaps but full of promise of action Miss Trimble having ceased temporarily to speak her mouth was in repose and when her mouth was in repose it looked more efficient than anything else of its size in existence I want you said missus Pett to come here and watch some men Men Thought so Wh there s trouble always men t bottom f it You do not like men Hate em Suff gist She looked penetratingly at missus Pett Her left eye seemed to pounce out from under its tangled brow You S porter of th Cause missus Pett was an anti Suffragist but though she held strong opinions nothing would have induced her to air them at that moment Her whole being quailed at the prospect of arguing with this woman She returned hurriedly to the main theme A young man arrived here this morning pretending to be my nephew James Crocker He is an impostor I want you to watch him very carefully Whassiz game I do not know Personally I think he is here to kidnap my son Ogden I ll fix m said the fair Trimble confidently Say that butler f yours He s a crook missus Pett opened her eyes This woman was manifestly competent at her work Have you found that out already D rectly saw him Miss Trimble opened her purse Go one f his photographs here Brought it from office He s th man that s wanted ll right mister Sturgis and I both think he is working with the other man the one who pretends to be my nephew Sure I ll fix m She returned the photograph to her purse and snapped the catch with vicious emphasis There is another possibility said missus Pett My nephew mister William Partridge had invented a wonderful explosive and it is quite likely that these men are here to try to steal it Sure Men ll do anything If y put all the men in th world in th cooler wouldn t be ny more crime She glowered at the dog Aida who had risen from the basket and removing the last remains of sleep from her system by a series of calisthenics of her own invention as if she suspected her of masculinity missus Pett could not help wondering what tragedy in the dim past had caused this hatred of males on the part of her visitor Miss Trimble had not the appearance of one who would lightly be deceived by Man still less the appearance of one whom Man unless short sighted and extraordinarily susceptible would go out of his way to deceive She was still turning this mystery over in her mind when her visitor spoke Well gimme th rest of th dope said Miss Trimble I beg your pardon More facts Spill m Oh I understand said missus Pett hastily and embarked on a brief narrative of the suspicious circumstances which had caused her to desire skilled assistance Lor W sbeach said Miss Trimble breaking the story Who s he A very great friend of ours You vouch f r him pers n lly He s all right uh Not a crook huh Of course he is not said missus Pett indignantly He s a great friend of mine All right Well I guess thass bout all huh I ll be going downstairs an starting in You can come here immediately Sure Got parlour maid rig round at m boarding house round corner Come back with it n ten minutes Same dress I used when I w s working on th Marling D vorce case D jer know th Marlings Idle rich Bound t get nto trouble I fixed m Well g bye Mus be going No time t waste missus Pett leaned back faintly in her chair She felt overcome Downstairs on her way out Miss Trimble had paused in the hall to inspect a fine statue which stood at the foot of the stairs It was a noble work of art but it seemed to displease her She snorted Idle rich she muttered scornfully Brrh The portly form of mister Crocker loomed up from the direction of the back stairs She fixed her left eye on him piercingly mister Crocker met it and quailed He had that consciousness of guilt which philosophers tell is the worst drawback to crime Why this woman s gaze should disturb him so thoroughly he could not have said She was a perfect stranger to him She could know nothing about him Yet he quailed Say said Miss Trimble I m c ming here s parlour maid Oh ah said mister Crocker feebly Grrrh observed Miss Trimble and departed CHAPTER XVIII THE VOICE PROM THE PAST The library whither Jimmy had made his way after leaving missus Pett was a large room on the ground floor looking out on the street which ran parallel to the south side of the house It had French windows opening onto a strip of lawn which ended in a high stone wall with a small gate in it the general effect of these things being to create a resemblance to a country house rather than to one in the centre of the city mister Pett s town residence was full of these surprises In one corner of the room a massive safe had been let into the wall striking a note of incongruity for the remainder of the wall space was completely covered with volumes of all sorts and sizes which filled the shelves and overflowed into a small gallery reached by a short flight of stairs and running along the north side of the room over the door Jimmy cast a glance at the safe behind the steel doors of which he presumed the test tube of Partridgite which Willie had carried from the luncheon table lay hid then transferred his attention to the shelves A cursory inspection of these revealed nothing which gave promise of whiling away entertainingly the moments which must elapse before the return of Ann Jimmy s tastes in literature lay in the direction of the lighter kind of modern fiction and mister Pett did not appear to possess a single volume that had been written later than the eighteenth century and mostly poetry at that He turned to the writing desk near the window on which he had caught sight of a standing shelf full of books of a more modern aspect He picked one up at random and opened it He threw it down disgustedly It was poetry This man Pett appeared to have a perfect obsession for poetry One would never have suspected it to look at him Jimmy had just resigned himself after another glance at the shelf to a bookless vigil when his eye was caught by a name on the cover of the last in the row so unexpected that he had to look again to verify the discovery He had been perfectly right There it was in gold letters THE LONELY HEART BY ANN CHESTER He extracted the volume from the shelf in a sort of stupor Even now he was inclined to give his goddess of the red hair the benefit of the doubt and assume that some one else of the same name had written it For it was a defect in Jimmy s character one of his many defects that he loathed and scorned minor poetry and considered minor poets especially when feminine an unnecessary affliction He declined to believe that Ann his Ann a girl full of the finest traits of character the girl who had been capable of encouraging a comparative stranger to break the law by impersonating her cousin Jimmy Crocker could also be capable of writing The Lonely Heart and other poems He skimmed through the first one he came across and shuddered It was pure slush It was the sort of stuff they filled up pages with in the magazines when the detective story did not run long enough It was the sort of stuff which long haired blighters read alone to other long haired blighters in English suburban drawing rooms It was the sort of stuff which to be brief gave him the Willies No it could not be Ann who had written it The next moment the horrid truth was thrust upon him There was an inscription on the title page To my dearest uncle Peter with love from the author Ann Chester The room seemed to reel before Jimmy s eyes He felt as if a friend had wounded him in his tenderest feelings He felt as if some loved one had smitten him over the back of the head with a sandbag For one moment in which time stood still his devotion to Ann wobbled It was as if he had found her out in some terrible crime that revealed unsuspected flaws in her hitherto ideal character Then his eye fell upon the date on the title page and a strong spasm of relief shook him The clouds rolled away and he loved her still This frightful volume had been published five years ago A wave of pity swept over Jimmy He did not blame her now She had been a mere child five years ago scarcely old enough to distinguish right from wrong You couldn t blame her for writing sentimental verse at that age Why at a similar stage in his own career he had wanted to be a vaudeville singer Everything must be excused to Youth It was with a tender glow of affectionate forgiveness that he turned the pages As he did so a curious thing happened to him He began to have that feeling which every one has experienced at some time or other that he had done this very thing before He was almost convinced that this was not the first time he had seen that poem on page twenty seven entitled A Lament Why some of the lines seemed extraordinarily familiar The people who understood these things explained this phenomenon he believed by some stuff about the cells of the brain working simultaneously or something Something about cells anyway He supposed that that must be it But that was not it The feeling that he had read all this before grew instead of vanishing as is generally the way on these occasions He had read this stuff before He was certain of it But when And where And above all why Surely he had not done it from choice It was the total impossibility of his having done it from choice that led his memory in the right direction There had only been a year or so in his life when he had been obliged to read things which he would not have read of his own free will and that had been when he worked on the Chronicle Could it have been that they had given him this book of poems to review Or And then memory in its usual eccentric way having taken all this time to make the first part of the journey finished the rest of it with one lightning swoop and he knew And with the illumination came dismay Worse than dismay Horror Gosh said Jimmy He knew now why he had thought on the occasion of their first meeting in London that he had seen hair like Ann s before The mists rolled away and he saw everything clear and stark He knew what had happened at that meeting five years before to which she had so mysteriously alluded He knew what she had meant that evening on the boat when she had charged one Jimmy Crocker with having cured her of sentiment A cold sweat sprang into being about his temples He could remember that interview now as clearly as if it had happened five minutes ago instead of five years He could recall the article for the Sunday Chronicle which he had written from the interview and the ghoulish gusto with which he had written it He had had a boy s undisciplined sense of humour in those days the sense of humour which riots like a young colt careless of what it bruises and crushes He shuddered at the recollection of the things he had hammered out so gleefully on his typewriter down at the Chronicle office He found himself recoiling in disgust from the man he had been the man who could have done a wanton thing like that without compunction or ruth He had read extracts from the article to an appreciative colleague A great sympathy for Ann welled up in him No wonder she hated the memory of Jimmy Crocker It is probable that remorse would have tortured him even further had he not chanced to turn absently to page forty six and read a poem entitled Love s Funeral It was not a long poem and he had finished it inside of two minutes but by that time a change had come upon his mood of self loathing He no longer felt like a particularly mean murderer Love s Funeral was like a tonic It braced and invigourated him It was so unspeakably absurd so poor in every respect All things he now perceived had worked together for good Ann had admitted on the boat that it was his satire that had crushed out of her the fondness for this sort of thing If that was so then the part he had played in her life had been that of a rescuer He thought of her as she was now and as she must have been then to have written stuff like this and he rejoiced at what he had done In a manner of speaking the Ann of to day the glorious creature who went about the place kidnapping Ogdens was his handiwork It was he who had destroyed the minor poetry virus in her The refrain of an old song came to him You made me what I am to day I hope you re satisfied He was more than satisfied He was proud of himself He rejoiced however after the first flush of enthusiasm somewhat moderately There was no disguising the penalty of his deed of kindness To Ann Jimmy Crocker was no rescuer but a sort of blend of ogre and vampire She must never learn his real identity or not until he had succeeded by assiduous toil as he hoped he would in neutralising that prejudice of the distant past A footstep outside broke in on his thoughts He thrust the book quickly back into its place Ann came in and shut the door behind her Well she said eagerly Jimmy did not reply for a moment He was looking at her and thinking how perfect in every way she was now as she stood there purged of sentimentality all aglow with curiosity to know how her nefarious plans had succeeded It was his Ann who stood there not the author of The Lonely Heart Did you ask her Yes But Ann s face fell Oh She won t let him come back She absolutely refused I did my best I know you did There was a silence Well this settles it said Jimmy Now you will have to let me help you Ann looked troubled But it s such a risk Something terrible might happen to you Isn t impersonation a criminal offence What does it matter They tell me prisons are excellent places nowadays Concerts picnics all that sort of thing I shan t mind going there I have a nice singing voice I think I will try to make the glee club I suppose we are breaking the law said Ann seriously I told Jerry that nothing could happen to us except the loss of his place to him and being sent to my grandmother to me but I m bound to say I said that just to encourage him Don t you think we ought to know what the penalty is in case we are caught It would enable us to make our plans If it s a life sentence I shouldn t worry about selecting my future career You see explained Ann I suppose they would hardly send me to prison as I m a relation though I would far rather go there than to grandmother s She lives all alone miles away in the country and is strong on discipline but they might do all sorts of things to you in spite of my pleadings I really think you had better give up the idea I m afraid my enthusiasm carried me away I didn t think of all this before Never This thing goes through or fails over my dead body What are you looking for Ann was deep in a bulky volume which stood on a lectern by the window Catalogue she said briefly turning the pages Uncle Peter has heaps of law books I ll look up kidnapping Here we are Law Encyclopedia Shelf X Oh that s upstairs I shan t be a minute She ran to the little staircase and disappeared Her voice came from the gallery Here we are I ve got it Shoot said Jimmy There s such a lot of it called the voice from above Pages and pages I m just skimming Wait a moment A rustling followed from the gallery then a sneeze This is the dustiest place I was ever in said the voice It s inches deep everywhere It s full of cigarette ends too I must tell uncle Oh here it is Kidnapping penalties Hush called Jimmy There s some one coming The door opened Hello said Ogden strolling in I was looking for you Didn t think you would be here Come right in my little man and make yourself at home said Jimmy Ogden eyed him with disfavour You re pretty fresh aren t you This is praise from Sir Hubert Stanley Eh Who s he Oh a gentleman who knew what was what Ogden closed the door Well I know what s what too I know what you are for one thing He chuckled I ve got your number all right In what respect Another chuckle proceeded from the bulbous boy You think you re smooth don t you But I m onto you Jimmy Crocker A lot of Jimmy Crocker you are You re a crook Get me And I know what you re after at that You re going to try to kidnap me From the corner of his eye Jimmy was aware of Ann s startled face looking over the gallery rail and withdrawn hastily No sound came from the heights but he knew that she was listening intently What makes you think that Ogden lowered himself into the depths of his favourite easy chair and putting his feet restfully on the writing desk met Jimmy s gaze with a glassy but knowing eye Got a cigarette he said I have not said Jimmy I m sorry So am I Returning with your permission to our original subject said Jimmy what makes you think that I have come here to kidnap you Ogden yawned I was in the drawing room after lunch and that guy Lord Wisbeach came in and said he wanted to talk to mother privately Mother sent me out of the room so of course I listened at the door Do you know where little boys go who listen to private conversations said Jimmy severely To the witness stand generally I guess Well I listened and I heard this Lord Wisbeach tell mother that he had only pretended to recognise you as Jimmy Crocker and that really he had never seen you before in his life He said you were a crook and that they had got to watch you Well I knew then why you had come here It was pretty smooth getting in the way you did I ve got to hand it to you Jimmy did not reply His mind was occupied with the contemplation of this dashing counter stroke on the part of Gentleman Jack He could hardly refrain from admiring the simple strategy with which the latter had circumvented him There was an artistry about the move which compelled respect Well now see here said Ogden you and I have got to get together on this proposition I ve been kidnapped twice before and the only guys that made anything out of it were the kidnappers It s pretty soft for them They couldn t have got a cent without me and they never dreamed of giving me a rake off I m getting good and tired of being kidnapped for other people s benefit and I ve made up my mind that the next guy that wants me has got to come across See My proposition is fifty fifty If you like it I m game to let you go ahead If you don t like it then the deal s off and you ll find that you ve a darned poor chance of getting me When I was kidnapped before I was just a kid but I can look after myself now Well what do you say Jimmy found it hard at first to say anything He had never properly understood the possibilities of Ogden s character before The longer he contemplated him the more admirable Ann s scheme appeared It seemed to him that only a resolute keeper of a home for dogs would be adequately equipped for dealing with this remarkable youth This is a commercial age he said You bet it is said Ogden My middle name is business Say are you working this on your own or are you in with Buck Maginnis and his crowd I don t think I know mister Maginnis He s the guy who kidnapped me the first time He s a rough neck Smooth Sam Fisher got away with me the second time Maybe you re in with Sam No No I guess not I heard that he had married and retired from business I rather wish you were one of Buck s lot I like Buck When he kidnapped me I lived with him and he gave me a swell time When I left him a woman came and interviewed me about it for one of the Sunday papers Sob stuff Called the piece Even Kidnappers Have Tender Hearts Beneath A Rough Exterior I ve got it upstairs in my press clipping album It was pretty bad slush Buck Maginnis hasn t got any tender heart beneath his rough exterior but he s a good sort and I liked him We used to shoot craps And he taught me to chew I d be tickled to death to have Buck get me again But if you re working on your own all right It s all the same to me provided you meet me on the terms You certainly are a fascinating child Less of it less of it I ve troubles enough to bear without having you getting fresh Well what about it Talk figures If I let you take me away do we divvy up or don t we That s all you ve got to say That s easily settled I ll certainly give you half of whatever I get Ogden looked wistfully at the writing desk I wish I could have that in writing But I guess it wouldn t stand in law I suppose I shall have to trust you Honour among thieves Less of the thieves This is just a straight business proposition I ve got something valuable to sell and I m darned if I m going to keep giving it away I ve been too easy I ought to have thought of this before
4108_2777_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 All right then 
none	none	that s settled Now it s up to you You can think out the rest of it yourself He heaved himself out of the chair and left the room Ann coming down from the gallery found Jimmy meditating He looked up at the sound of her step Well that seems to make it pretty easy for us doesn t it he said It solves the problem of ways and means But this is awful This alters everything It isn t safe for you to stay here You must go away at once They ve found you out You may be arrested at any moment That s a side issue The main point is to put this thing through Then we can think about what is going to happen to me But can t you see the risk you re running I don t mind I want to help you I won t let you You must But do be sensible What would you think of me if I allowed you to face this danger I wouldn t think any differently of you My opinion of you is a fixed thing Nothing can alter it I tried to tell you on the boat but you wouldn t let me I think you re the most perfect wonderful girl in all the world I ve loved you since the first moment I saw you I knew who you were when we met for half a minute that day in London We were utter strangers but I knew you You were the girl I had been looking for all my life Good Heavens you talk of risks Can t you understand that just being with you and speaking to you and knowing that we share this thing together is enough to wipe out any thought of risk I d do anything for you And you expect me to back out of this thing because there is a certain amount of danger Ann had retreated to the door and was looking at him with wide eyes With other young men and there had been many who had said much the same sort of thing to her since her debutante days she had been cool and composed a little sorry perhaps but in no doubt as to her own feelings and her ability to resist their pleadings But now her heart was racing and the conviction had begun to steal over her that the cool and composed Ann Chester was in imminent danger of making a fool of herself Quite suddenly without any sort of warning she realised that there was some quality in Jimmy which called aloud to some corresponding quality in herself a nebulous something that made her know that he and she were mates She knew herself hard to please where men were concerned She could not have described what it was in her that all the men she had met the men with whom she had golfed and ridden and yachted had failed to satisfy but ever since she had acquired the power of self analysis she had known that it was something which was a solid and indestructible part of her composition She could not have put into words what quality she demanded in man but she had always known that she would recognise it when she found it and she recognised it now in Jimmy It was a recklessness an irresponsibility a cheerful dare devilry the complement to her own gay lawlessness Ann said Jimmy It s too late She had not meant to say that She had meant to say that it was impossible out of the question But her heart was running away with her goaded on by the irony of it all A veil seemed to have fallen from before her eyes and she knew now why she had been drawn to Jimmy from the very first They were mates and she had thrown away her happiness I ve promised to marry Lord Wisbeach Jimmy stopped dead as if the blow had been a physical one You ve promised to marry Lord Wisbeach Yes But but when Just now Only a few minutes ago When I was driving him to his hotel He had asked me to marry him before I left for England and I had promised to give him his answer when I got back But when I got back somehow I couldn t make up my mind The days slipped by Something seemed to be holding me back He pressed me to say that I would marry him and it seemed absurd to go on refusing to be definite so I said I would You can t love him Surely you don t Ann met his gaze frankly Something seems to have happened to me in the last few minutes she said and I can t think clearly A little while ago it didn t seem to matter much I liked him He was good looking and good tempered I felt that we should get along quite well and be as happy as most people are That seemed as near perfection as one could expect to get nowadays so well that s how it was But you can t marry him It s out of the question I ve promised You must break your promise I can t do that You must I can t One must play the game Jimmy groped for words But in this case you mustn t it s awful in this special case He broke off He saw the trap he was in He could not denounce that crook without exposing himself And from that he still shrank Ann s prejudice against Jimmy Crocker might have its root in a trivial and absurd grievance but it had been growing through the years and who could say how strong it was now Ann came a step towards him then paused doubtfully Then as if making up her mind she drew near and touched his sleeve I m sorry she said There was a silence I m sorry She moved away The door closed softly behind her Jimmy scarcely knew that she had gone He sat down in that deep chair which was mister Pett s favourite and stared sightlessly at the ceiling And then how many minutes or hours later he did not know the sharp click of the door handle roused him He sprang from the chair Was it Ann come back It was not Ann Round the edge of the door came inquiringly the fair head of Lord Wisbeach Oh said his lordship sighting Jimmy The head withdrew itself Come here shouted Jimmy The head appeared again Talking to me Yes I was talking to you Lord Wisbeach followed his superstructure into the room He was outwardly all that was bland and unperturbed but there was a wary look in the eye that cocked itself at Jimmy and he did not move far from the door His fingers rested easily on the handle behind him He did not think it probable that Jimmy could have heard of his visit to missus Pett but there had been something menacing in the latter s voice and he believed in safety first They told me Miss Chester was here he said by way of relaxing any possible strain there might be in the situation And what the devil do you want with Miss Chester you slimy crawling second story worker you damned oily yegg enquired Jimmy The sunniest optimist could not have deluded himself into the belief that the words were spoken in a friendly and genial spirit Lord Wisbeach s fingers tightened on the door handle and he grew a little flushed about the cheek bones What s all this about he said You infernal crook Lord Wisbeach looked anxious Don t shout like that Are you crazy Do you want people to hear Jimmy drew a deep breath I shall have to get further away from you he said more quietly There s no knowing what may happen if I don t I don t want to kill you At least I do but I had better not He retired slowly until brought to a halt by the writing desk To this he anchored himself with a firm grip He was extremely anxious to do nothing rash and the spectacle of Gentleman Jack invited rashness He leaned against the desk clutching its solidity with both hands Lord Wisbeach held steadfastly to the door handle And in this tense fashion the interview proceeded Miss Chester said Jimmy forcing himself to speak calmly has just been telling me that she has promised to marry you Quite true said Lord Wisbeach It will be announced to morrow A remark trembled on his lips to the effect that he relied on Jimmy for a fish slice but prudence kept it unspoken He was unable at present to understand Jimmy s emotion Why Jimmy should object to his being engaged to Ann he could not imagine But it was plain that for some reason he had taken the thing to heart and dearly as he loved a bit of quiet fun Lord Wisbeach decided that the other was at least six inches too tall and fifty pounds too heavy to be bantered in his present mood by one of his own physique Why not It won t be announced to morrow said Jimmy Because by to morrow you will be as far away from here as you can get if you have any sense What do you mean Just this If you haven t left this house by breakfast time to morrow I shall expose you Lord Wisbeach was not feeling particularly happy but he laughed at this You That s what I said Who do you think you are to go about exposing people I happen to be missus Pett s nephew Jimmy Crocker Lord Wisbeach laughed again Is that the line you are going to take It is You are going to missus Pett to tell her that you are Jimmy Crocker and that I am a crook and that you only pretended to recognise me for reasons of your own Just that Forget it Lord Wisbeach had forgotten to be alarmed in his amusement He smiled broadly I m not saying it s not good stuff to pull but it s old stuff now I m sorry for you but I thought of it before you did I went to missus Pett directly after lunch and sprang that line of talk myself Do you think she ll believe you after that I tell you I m ace high with that dame You can t queer me with her I think I can For the simple reason that I really am Jimmy Crocker Yes you are Exactly Yes I am Lord Wisbeach smiled tolerantly It was worth trying the bluff I guess but it won t work I know you d be glad to get me out of this house but you ve got to make a better play than that to do it Don t deceive yourself with the idea that I m bluffing Look here He suddenly removed his coat and threw it to Lord Wisbeach Read the tailor s label inside the pocket See the name Also the address J Crocker Drexdale House Grosvenor Square London Lord Wisbeach picked up the garment and looked as directed His face turned a little sallower but he still fought against his growing conviction That s no proof Perhaps not But when you consider the reputation of the tailor whose name is on the label it s hardly likely that he would be standing in with an impostor is it If you want real proof I have no doubt that there are half a dozen men working on the Chronicle who can identify me Or are you convinced already Lord Wisbeach capitulated I don t know what fool game you think you re playing but I can t see why you couldn t have told me this when we were talking after lunch Never mind I had my reasons They don t matter What matters is that you are going to get out of here to morrow Do you understand that I get you Then that s about all I think Don t let me keep you Say listen Gentleman Jack s voice was plaintive I think you might give a fellow a chance to get out good Give me time to have a guy in Montreal send me a telegram telling me to go up there right away Otherwise you might just as well put the cops on me at once The old lady knows I ve got business in Canada You don t need to be rough on a fellow Jimmy pondered this point All right I don t object to that Thanks Don t start anything though I don t know what you mean Jimmy pointed to the safe Come come friend of my youth We have no secrets from each other I know you re after what s in there and you know that I know I don t want to harp on it but you ll be spending to night in the house and I think you had better make up your mind to spend it in your room getting a nice sleep to prepare you for your journey Do you follow me old friend I get you That will be all then I think Wind a smile around your neck and recede The door slammed Lord Wisbeach had restrained his feelings successfully during the interview but he could not deny himself that slight expression of them Jimmy crossed the room and took his coat from the chair where the other had dropped it As he did so a voice spoke Say Jimmy spun round The room was apparently empty The thing was beginning to assume an uncanny aspect when the voice spoke again You think you re darned funny don t you It came from above Jimmy had forgotten the gallery He directed his gaze thither and perceived the heavy face of Ogden hanging over the rail like a gargoyle What are you doing there he demanded Listening How did you get there There s a door back here that you get to from the stairs I often come here for a quiet cigarette Say you think yourself some josher don t you telling me you were a kidnapper You strung me like an onion So you re really Jimmy Crocker after all Where was the sense in pulling all that stuff about taking me away and divvying up the ransom Aw you make me tired The head was withdrawn and Jimmy heard heavy steps followed by the banging of a door Peace reigned in the library Jimmy sat down in the chair which was mister Pett s favourite and which Ogden was accustomed to occupy to that gentleman s displeasure The swiftness of recent events had left him a little dizzy and he desired to think matters over and find out exactly what had happened The only point which appeared absolutely clear to him in a welter of confusing occurrences was the fact that he had lost the chance of kidnapping Ogden Everything had arranged itself so beautifully simply and conveniently as regarded that venture until a moment ago but now that the boy had discovered his identity it was impossible for him to attempt it He was loth to accept this fact Surely even now there was a way Quite suddenly an admirable plan occurred to him It involved the company operation of his father And at that thought he realised with a start that life had been moving so rapidly for him since his return to the house that he had not paid any attention at all to what was really as amazing a mystery as any He had been too busy to wonder why his father was there He debated the best method of getting in touch with him It was out of the question to descend to the pantry or wherever it was that his father lived in this new incarnation of his Then the happy thought struck him that results might be obtained by the simple process of ringing the bell It might produce some other unit of the domestic staff However it was worth trying He rang the bell A few moments later the door opened Jimmy looked up It was not his father It was a dangerous looking female of uncertain age dressed as a parlour maid who eyed him with what seemed to his conscience stricken soul dislike and suspicion She had a tight lipped mouth and beady eyes beneath heavy brows Jimmy had seldom seen a woman who attracted him less at first sight Jer ring S Jimmy blinked and almost ducked The words had come at him like a projectile Oh ah yes J want anything s With an effort Jimmy induced his mind to resume its interrupted equilibrium Oh ah yes Would you mind sending Skinner the butler to me Y s r The apparition vanished Jimmy drew out his handkerchief and dabbed at his forehead He felt weak and guilty He felt as if he had just been accused of nameless crimes and had been unable to deny the charge Such was the magic of Miss Trimble s eye the left one which looked directly at its object Conjecture pauses baffled at the thought of the effect which her gaze might have created in the breasts of the sex she despised had it been double instead of single barrelled But half of it had wasted itself on a spot some few feet to his right Presently the door opened again and mister Crocker appeared looking like a benevolent priest CHAPTER XIX BETWEEN FATHER AND SON Well Skinner my man said Jimmy how goes it mister Crocker looked about him cautiously Then his priestly manner fell from him like a robe and he bounded forward Jimmy he exclaimed seizing his son s hand and shaking it violently Say it s great seeing you again Jim Jimmy drew himself up haughtily Skinner my good menial you forget yourself strangely You will be getting fired if you mitt the handsome guest in this chummy fashion He slapped his father on the back Dad this is great How on earth do you come to be here What s the idea Why the buttling When did you come over Tell me all mister Crocker hoisted himself nimbly onto the writing desk and sat there beaming with dangling legs It was your letter that did it Jimmy Say Jim there wasn t any need for you to do a thing like that just for me Well I thought you would have a better chance of being a peer without me around By the way dad how did my step mother take the Lord Percy episode A shadow fell upon mister Crocker s happy face I don t like to do much thinking about your step mother he said She was pretty sore about Percy And she was pretty sore about your lighting out for America But gee what she must be feeling like now that I ve come over I daren t let myself think You haven t explained that yet Why did you come over Well I d been feeling homesick I always do over there in the baseball season and then talking with Pett made it worse Talking with Pett Did you see him then when he was in London See him I let him in How Into the house I mean I had just gone to the front door to see what sort of a day it was I wanted to know if there had been enough rain in the night to stop my having to watch that cricket game and just as I got there the bell rang I opened the door A revoltingly plebeian thing to do I m ashamed of you dad They won t stand for that sort of thing in the House of Lords Well before I knew what was happening they had taken me for the butler I didn t want your step mother to know I d been opening doors you remember how touchy she was always about it so I just let it go at that and jollied them along But I just couldn t help asking the old man how the pennant race was making out and that tickled him so much that he offered me a job here as butler if I ever wanted to make a change And then your note came saying that you were going to New York and well I couldn t help myself You couldn t have kept me in London with ropes I sneaked out next day and bought a passage on the Carmantic she sailed the Wednesday after you left and came straight here They gave me this job right away mister Crocker paused and a holy light of enthusiasm made his homely features almost beautiful Say Jim I ve seen a ball game every darned day since I landed Say two days running Larry Doyle made home runs But gosh that guy Klem is one swell robber See here mister Crocker sprang down from the desk and snatched up a handful of books which he proceeded to distribute about the floor There were two men on bases in the sixth and What s his name came to bat He lined one out to centre field where this book is and Pull yourself together Skinner You can t monkey about with the employer s library like that Jimmy restored the books to their places Simmer down and tell me more Postpone the gossip from the diamond What plans have you made Have you considered the future at all You aren t going to hold down this buttling job forever are you When do you go back to London The light died out of mister Crocker s face I guess I shall have to go back some time But how can I yet with the Giants leading the league like this But did you just light out without saying anything I left a note for your step mother telling her I had gone to America for a vacation Jimmy I hate to think what she s going to do to me when she gets me back Assert yourself dad Tell her that woman s place is the home and man s the ball park Be firm mister Crocker shook his head dubiously It s all very well to talk that way when you re three thousand miles from home but you know as well as I do Jim that your step mother though she s a delightful woman isn t the sort you can assert yourself with Look at this sister of hers here I guess you haven t been in the house long enough to have noticed but she s very like Eugenia in some ways She s the boss all right and old Pett does just what he s told to I guess it s the same with me Jim There s a certain type of man that s just born to have it put over on him by a certain type of woman I m that sort of man and your stepmother s that sort of woman No I guess I m going to get mine all right and the only thing to do is to keep it from stopping me having a good time now There was truth in what he said and Jimmy recognised it He changed the subject Well never mind that There s no sense in worrying oneself about the future Tell me dad where did you get all the dinner is served madam stuff How did you ever learn to be a butler Bayliss taught me back in London And of course I ve played butlers when I was on the stage Jimmy did not speak for a moment Did you ever play a kidnapper dad he asked at length Sure I was 
4108_2777_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Chicago Ed 
none	none	in a crook play called This Way Out Why surely you saw me in that I got some good notices Jimmy nodded Of course I knew I d seen you play that sort of part some time You came on during the dark scene and switched on the lights and covered the bunch with your gun while they were still blinking You were great in that part dad It was a good part said mister Crocker modestly It had fat I d like to have a chance to play a kidnapper again There s a lot of pep to kidnappers You shall play one again said Jimmy I am putting on a little sketch with a kidnapper as the star part Eh A sketch You Jim Where Here In this house It is entitled Kidnapping Ogden and opens to night mister Crocker looked at his only son in concern Jimmy appeared to him to be rambling Amateur theatricals he hazarded In the sense that there is no pay for performing yes Dad you know that kid Ogden upstairs Well it s quite simple I want you to kidnap him for me mister Crocker sat down heavily He shook his head I don t follow all this Of course not I haven t begun to explain Dad in your rambles through this joint you ve noticed a girl with glorious red gold hair I imagine Ann Chester Ann Chester I m going to marry her Jimmy But she doesn t know it yet Now follow me carefully dad Five years ago Ann Chester wrote a book of poems It s on that desk there You were using it a moment back as second base or something Now I was working at that time on the Chronicle I wrote a skit on those poems for the Sunday paper Do you begin to follow the plot She s got it in for you She s sore Exactly Get that firmly fixed in your mind because it s the source from which all the rest of the story springs mister Crocker interrupted But I don t understand You say she s sore at you Well how is it that you came in together looking as if you were good friends when I let you in this morning I was waiting for you to ask that The explanation is that she doesn t know that I am Jimmy Crocker But you came here saying that you were Jimmy Crocker Quite right And that is where the plot thickens I made Ann s acquaintance first in London and then on the boat I had found out that Jimmy Crocker was the man she hated most in the world so I took another name I called myself Bayliss Bayliss I had to think of something quick because the clerk at the shipping office was waiting to fill in my ticket I had just been talking to Bayliss on the phone and his was the only name that came into my mind You know how it is when you try to think of a name suddenly Now mark the sequel Old Bayliss came to see me off at Paddington Ann was there and saw me She said Good evening mister Bayliss or something and naturally old Bayliss replied What ho or words to that effect The only way to handle the situation was to introduce him as my father I did so Ann therefore thinks that I am a young man named Bayliss who has come over to America to make his fortune We now come to the third reel I met Ann by chance at the Knickerbocker and took her to lunch While we were lunching that confirmed congenital idiot Reggie Bartling who happened to have come over to America as well came up and called me by my name I knew that if Ann discovered who I really was she would have nothing more to do with me so I gave Reggie the haughty stare and told him that he had made a mistake He ambled away and possibly committed suicide in his anguish at having made such a bloomer leaving Ann discussing with me the extraordinary coincidence of my being Jimmy Crocker s double Do you follow the story of my life so far mister Crocker who had been listening with wrinkled brow and other signs of rapt attention nodded I understand all that But how did you come to get into this house That is reel four I am getting to that It seems that Ann who is the sweetest girl on earth and always on the lookout to do some one a kindness had decided in the interests of the boy s future to remove young Ogden Ford from his present sphere where he is being spoiled and ruined and send him down to a man on Long Island who would keep him for awhile and instil the first principles of decency into him Her accomplice in this admirable scheme was Jerry Mitchell Jerry Mitchell Who as you know got fired yesterday Jerry was to have done the rough work of the job But being fired he was no longer available I therefore offered to take his place So here I am You re going to kidnap that boy No You are Me Precisely You are going to play a benefit performance of your world famed success Chicago Ed Let me explain further Owing to circumstances which I need not go into Ogden has found out that I am really Jimmy Crocker so he refuses to have anything more to do with me I had deceived him into believing that I was a professional kidnapper and he came to me and offered to let me kidnap him if I would go fifty fifty with him in the ransom Gosh Yes he s an intelligent child full of that sort of bright ideas Well now he has found that I am not all his fancy painted me he wouldn t come away with me and I want you to understudy me while the going is good In the fifth reel which will be released to night after the household has retired to rest you will be featured It s got to be tonight because it has just occurred to me that Ogden knowing that Lord Wisbeach is a crook may go to him with the same proposal that he made to me Lord Wisbeach a crook Of the worst description He is here to steal that explosive stuff of Willie Partridge s But as I have blocked that play he may turn his attention to Ogden But Jimmy if that fellow is a crook how do you know he is He told me so himself Well then why don t you expose him Because in order to do so Skinner my man I should have to explain that I was really Jimmy Crocker and the time is not yet ripe for that To my thinking the time will not be ripe till you have got safely away with Ogden Ford I can then go to Ann and say I may have played you a rotten trick in the past but I have done you a good turn now so let s forget the past So you see that everything now depends on you dad I m not asking you to do anything difficult I ll go round to the boarding house now and tell Jerry Mitchell about what we have arranged and have him waiting outside here in a car Then all you will have to do is to go to Ogden play a short scene as Chicago Ed escort him to the car and then go back to bed and have a good sleep Once Ogden thinks you are a professional kidnapper you won t have any difficulty at all Get it into your head that he wants to be kidnapped Surely you can tackle this light and attractive job Why it will be a treat for you to do a bit of character acting once more Jimmy had struck the right note His father s eyes began to gleam with excitement The scent of the footlights seemed to dilate his nostrils I was always good at that rough neck stuff he murmured meditatively I used to eat it Exactly said Jimmy Look at it in the right way and I am doing you a kindness in giving you this chance mister Crocker rubbed his cheek with his forefinger You d want me to make up for the part he asked wistfully Of course You want me to do it to night At about two in the morning I thought I ll do it Jim Jimmy grasped his hand I knew I could rely on you dad mister Crocker was following a train of thought Dark wig blue chin heavy eyebrows I guess I can t do better than my old Chicago Ed make up Say Jimmy how am I to get to the kid That ll be all right You can stay in my room till the time comes to go to him Use it as a dressing room How am I to get him out of the house Through this room I ll tell Jerry to wait out on the side street with the car from two o clock on mister Crocker considered these arrangements That seems to be about all he said I don t think there s anything else I ll slip downtown and buy the props I ll go and tell Jerry A thought struck mister Crocker You d better tell Jerry to make up too He doesn t want the kid recognising him and squealing on him later Jimmy was lost in admiration of his father s resource You think of everything dad That wouldn t have occurred to me You certainly do take to Crime in the most wonderful way It seems to come naturally to you mister Crocker smirked modestly CHAPTER XX CELESTINE IMPARTS INFORMATION Plit is only as strong as its weakest link The best laid schemes of mice and men gang agley if one of the mice is a mental defective or if one of the men is a Jerry Mitchell Celestine missus Pett s maid she who was really Maggie O Toole and whom Jerry loved with a strength which deprived him of even that small amount of intelligence which had been bestowed upon him by Nature came into the house keeper s room at about ten o clock that night The domestic staff had gone in a body to the moving pictures and the only occupant of the room was the new parlourmaid who was sitting in a hard chair reading Schopenhauer Celestine s face was flushed her dark hair was ruffled and her eyes were shining She breathed a little quickly and her left hand was out of sight behind her back She eyed the new parlour maid doubtfully for a moment The latter was a woman of somewhat unencouraging exterior not the kind that invites confidences But Celestine had confidences to bestow and the exodus to the movies had left her in a position where she could not pick and choose She was faced with the alternative of locking her secret in her palpitating bosom or of revealing it to this one auditor The choice was one which no impulsive damsel in like circumstances would have hesitated to make Say said Celestine A face rose reluctantly from behind Schopenhauer A gleaming eye met Celestine s A second eye no less gleaming glared at the ceiling Say I just been talking to my feller outside said Celestine with a coy simper Say he s a grand man A snort of uncompromising disapproval proceeded from the thin lipped mouth beneath the eyes But Celestine was too full of her news to be discouraged I m strong fer Jer she said Huh said the student of Schopenhauer Jerry Mitchell you know You ain t never met him have you Say he s a grand man For the first time she had the other s undivided attention The new parlour maid placed her book upon the table Uh she said Celestine could hold back her dramatic surprise no longer Her concealed left hand flashed into view On the third finger glittered a ring She gazed at it with awed affection Ain t it a beaut She contemplated its sparkling perfection for a moment in rapturous silence Say you could have knocked me down with a feather she resumed He telephones me awhile ago and says to be outside the back door at ten to night because he d something he wanted to tell me Of course he couldn t come in and tell it me here because he d been fired and everything So I goes out and there he is Hello kid he says to me Fresh I says to him Say I got something to be fresh about he says to me And then he reaches into his jeans and hauls out the sparkler What s that I says to him It s an engagement ring he says to me For you if you ll wear it I came over so weak I could have fell And the next thing I know he s got it on my finger and Celestine broke off modestly Say ain t it a beaut honest She gave herself over to contemplation once more He says to me how he s on Easy Street now or will be pretty soon I says to him Have you got a job then He says to me Now I ain t got a job but I m going to pull off a stunt to night that s going to mean enough to me to start that health farm I ve told you about Say he s always had a line of talk about starting a health farm down on Long Island he knowing all about training and health and everything through having been one of them fighters I asks him what the stunt is but he won t tell me yet He says he ll tell me after we re married but he says it s sure fire and he s going to buy the license tomorrow She paused for comment and congratulations eyeing her companion expectantly Huh said the new parlour maid briefly and resumed her Schopenhauer Decidedly hers was not a winning personality Ain t it a beaut demanded Celestine damped The new parlour maid uttered a curious sound at the back of her throat He s a beaut she said cryptically She added another remark in a lower tone too low for Celestine s ears It could hardly have been that but it sounded to Celestine like I ll fix m

none	none	You re all right I had to throw it away I m on the wagon now but how long I should have stayed on with that smiling up at me I don t know I ve made up my mind never to lower myself to the level of the beasts that perish with the demon Rum again because my future wife has strong views on the subject but there s no sense in taking chances Temptation is all very well but you don t need it on your dressing table It was a kindly thought of yours to place it there dad but Eh I didn t put it there I thought that sort of thing came in your department Isn t it the butler s job to supply drinks to the nobility and gentry Well it doesn t matter It is now distributed over the neighbouring soil thus removing a powerful temptation from your path You re better without it He looked at his watch Well it ought to be all right now He went to the window There s an automobile down there I suppose it s Jerry I told him to be outside at one sharp and it s nearly half past I think you might be starting dad Oh by the way you had better tell Ogden that you represent a gentleman of the name of Buck Maginnis It was Buck who got away with him last time and a firm friendship seems to have sprung up between them There s nothing like coming with a good introduction mister Crocker took a final survey of himself in the mirror Gee I I d hate to meet myself on a lonely road He opened the door and stood for a moment listening From somewhere down the passage came the murmur of a muffled snore Third door on the left said Jimmy Three count em three Don t go getting mixed mister Crocker slid into the outer darkness like a stout ghost and Jimmy closed the door gently behind him Having launched his indulgent parent safely on a career of crime Jimmy switched off the light and returned to the window Leaning out he gave himself up for a moment to sentimental musings The night was very still Through the trees which flanked the house the dimmed headlights of what was presumably Jerry Mitchell s hired car shone faintly like enlarged fire flies A boat of some description was tooting reflectively far down the river Such was the seductive influence of the time and the scene that Jimmy might have remained there indefinitely weaving dreams had he not been under the necessity of making his way down to the library It was his task to close the French windows after his father and Ogden had passed through and he proposed to remain hid in the gallery there until the time came for him to do this It was imperative that he avoid being seen by Ogden Locking his door behind him he went downstairs There were no signs of life in the house Everything was still He found the staircase leading to the gallery without having to switch on the lights It was dusty in the gallery and a smell of old leather enveloped him He hoped his father would not be long He lowered himself cautiously to the floor and resting his head against a convenient shelf began to wonder how the interview between Chicago Ed and his prey was progressing mister Crocker meanwhile masked to the eyes had crept in fearful silence to the door which Jimmy had indicated A good deal of the gay enthusiasm with which he had embarked on this enterprise had ebbed away from him Now that he had become accustomed to the novelty of finding himself once more playing a character part his intimate respectability began to assert itself It was one thing to play Chicago Ed at a Broadway theatre but quite another to give a benefit performance like this As he tip toed along the passage the one thing that presented itself most clearly to him was the appalling outcome of this act of his should anything go wrong He would have turned back but for the thought that Jimmy was depending on him and that success would mean Jimmy s happiness Stimulated by this reflection he opened Ogden s door inch by inch and went in He stole softly across the room He had almost reached the bed and had just begun to wonder how on earth now that he was there he could open the proceedings tactfully and without alarming the boy when he was saved the trouble of pondering further on this problem A light flashed out of the darkness with the suddenness of a bursting bomb and a voice from the same general direction said Hands up When mister Crocker had finished blinking and had adjusted his eyes to the glare he perceived Ogden sitting up in bed with a revolver in his hand The revolver was resting on his knee and its muzzle pointed directly at mister Crocker s ample stomach Exhaustive as had been the thought which Jimmy s father had given to the possible developments of his enterprise this was a contingency of which he had not dreamed He was entirely at a loss
4108_2777_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t do that he said huskily 
4108_2777_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 It might go off 
4108_2777_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I should worry replied Ogden coldly

4108_2777_000036_000000	train-clean-360	mister Crocker s make up was trickling down his face in sticky streams 
none	none	The mask however prevented Ogden from seeing this peculiar phenomenon He was gazing interestedly at his visitor An idea struck him
4108_2777_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Say did you come to kidnap me 
none	none	mister Crocker felt the sense of relief which he had sometimes experienced on the stage when memory had failed him during a scene and a fellow actor had thrown him the line It would be exaggerating to say that he was himself again He could never be completely at his case with that pistol pointing at him but he felt considerably better He lowered his voice an octave or so and spoke in a husky growl Aw cheese it kid 
4108_2777_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Nix on the rough stuff

4108_2777_000070_000000	train-clean-360	mister Crocker played a daring card 
4108_2777_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 All right he said making a move towards the door

4108_2777_000072_000002	train-clean-360	There s no need to fly off the handle like that

none	none	What did you think I was going to do Sing
4108_2777_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 Step dis way said mister Crocker jocosely 
4108_2777_000082_000000	train-clean-360	They left the room cautiously 
none	none	mister Crocker for a moment had a sense of something missing He had reached the stairs before he realised what it was Then it dawned upon him that what was lacking was the applause The scene had deserved a round Jimmy vigilant in the gallery heard the library door open softly and peering over the rail perceived two dim forms in the darkness 
4108_2777_000083_000001	train-clean-360	One was large the other small 
4108_2777_000083_000002	train-clean-360	They crossed the room together 
4108_2777_000084_000000	train-clean-360	Whispered words reached him 
4108_2777_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought you said you came in this way 
none	none	Sure
4108_2777_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Then why s the shutter closed 
4108_2777_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 I fixed it after I was in 
4108_2777_000089_000000	train-clean-360	There was a faint scraping sound followed by a click 
none	none	The darkness of the room was relieved by moonlight 
4108_2777_000089_000002	train-clean-360	The figures passed through 
none	none	Jimmy ran down from the gallery and closed the windows softly He had just fastened the shutters when from the passage outside there came the unmistakeable sound of a footstep CHAPTER XXII IN THE LIBRARY Jimmy s first emotion on hearing the footstep was the crude instinct of self preservation All that he was able to think of at the moment was the fact that he was in a questionable position and one which would require a good deal of explaining away if he were found and his only sensation was a strong desire to avoid discovery He made a silent scrambling leap for the gallery stairs and reached their shelter just as the door opened He stood there rigid waiting to be challenged but apparently he had moved in time for no voice spoke The door closed so gently as to be almost inaudible and then there was silence again The room remained in darkness and it was this perhaps that first suggested to Jimmy the comforting thought that the intruder was equally desirous of avoiding the scrutiny of his fellows He had taken it for granted in his first panic that he himself was the only person in that room whose motive for being there would not have borne inspection But now safely hidden in the gallery out of sight from the floor below he had the leisure to consider the newcomer s movements and to draw conclusions from them An honest man s first act would surely have been to switch on the lights And an honest man would hardly have crept so stealthily It became apparent to Jimmy as he leaned over the rail and tried to pierce the darkness that there was sinister work afoot and he had hardly reached this conclusion when his mind took a further leap and he guessed the identity of the soft footed person below It could be none but his old friend Lord Wisbeach known to the boys as Gentleman Jack It surprised him that he had not thought of this before Then it surprised him that after the talk they had only a few hours earlier in that very room Gentleman Jack should have dared to risk this raid At this moment the blackness was relieved as if by the striking of a match The man below had brought an electric torch into play and now Jimmy could see clearly He had been right in his surmise It was Lord Wisbeach He was kneeling in front of the safe What he was doing to the safe Jimmy could not see for the man s body was in the way but the electric torch shone on his face lighting up grim serious features quite unlike the amiable and slightly vacant mask which his lordship was wont to present to the world As Jimmy looked something happened in the pool of light beyond his vision Gentleman Jack gave a muttered exclamation of satisfaction and then Jimmy saw that the door of the safe had swung open The air was full of a penetrating smell of scorched metal Jimmy was not an expert in these matters but he had read from time to time of modern burglars and their methods and he gathered that an oxy acetylene blow pipe with its flame that cuts steel as a knife cuts cheese had been at work Lord Wisbeach flashed the torch into the open safe plunged his hand in and drew it out again holding something Handling this in a cautious and gingerly manner he placed it carefully in his breast pocket Then he straightened himself He switched off the torch and moved to the window leaving the rest of his implements by the open safe He unfastened the shutter then raised the catch of the window At this point it seemed to Jimmy that the time had come to interfere Tut tut he said in a tone of mild reproof The effect of the rebuke on Lord Wisbeach was remarkable He jumped convulsively away from the window then revolving on his own axis flashed the torch into every corner of the room Who s that he gasped Conscience said Jimmy Lord Wisbeach had overlooked the gallery in his researches He now turned his torch upwards The light flooded the gallery on the opposite side of the room from where Jimmy stood There was a pistol in Gentleman Jack s hand now It followed the torch uncertainly Jimmy lying flat on the gallery floor spoke again Throw that gun away and the torch too he said I ve got you covered The torch flashed above his head but the raised edge of the gallery rail protected him I ll give you five seconds If you haven t dropped that gun by then I shall shoot As he began to count Jimmy heartily regretted that he had allowed his appreciation of the dramatic to lead him into this situation It would have been so simple to have roused the house in a prosaic way and avoided this delicate position Suppose his bluff did not succeed Suppose the other still clung to his pistol at the end of the five seconds He wished that he had made it ten instead Gentleman Jack was an enterprising person as his previous acts had showed He might very well decide to take a chance He might even refuse to believe that Jimmy was armed He had only Jimmy s word for it Perhaps he might be as deficient in simple faith as he had proved to be in Norman blood Jimmy lingered lovingly over his count Four he said reluctantly There was a breathless moment Then to Jimmy s unspeakable relief gun and torch dropped simultaneously to the floor In an instant Jimmy was himself again Go and stand with your face to that wall he said crisply Hold your hands up Why I m going to see how many more guns you ve got I haven t another I d like to make sure of that for myself Get moving Gentleman Jack reluctantly obeyed When he had reached the wall Jimmy came down He switched on the lights He felt in the other s pockets and almost at once encountered something hard and metallic He shook his head reproachfully You are very loose and inaccurate in your statements he said Why all these weapons I didn t raise my boy to be a soldier Now you can turn around and put your hands down Gentleman Jack s appeared to be a philosophical nature The chagrin consequent upon his failure seemed to have left him He sat on the arm of a chair and regarded Jimmy without apparent hostility He even smiled a faint smile I thought I had fixed you he said You must have been smarter than I took you for I never supposed you would get on to that drink and pass it up Understanding of an incident which had perplexed him came to Jimmy Was it you who put that high ball in my room Was it doped Didn t you know Well said Jimmy I never knew before that virtue got its reward so darned quick in this world I rejected that high ball not because I suspected it but out of pure goodness because I had made up my mind that I was through with all that sort of thing His companion laughed If Jimmy had had a more intimate acquaintance with the resourceful individual whom the boys called Gentleman Jack he would have been disquieted by that laugh It was an axiom among those who knew him well that when Gentleman Jack chuckled in the reflective way he generally had something unpleasant up his sleeve It s your lucky night said Gentleman Jack It looks like it Well it isn t over yet Very nearly You had better go and put that test tube back in what is left of the safe now Did you think I had forgotten it What test tube Come come old friend The one filled with Partridge s explosive which you have in your breast pocket Gentleman Jack laughed again Then he moved towards the safe Place it gently on the top shelf said Jimmy The next moment every nerve in his body was leaping and quivering A great shout split the air Gentleman Jack apparently insane was giving tongue at the top of his voice Help Help Help The conversation having been conducted up to this point in undertones the effect of this unexpected uproar was like an explosion The cries seemed to echo round the room and shake the very walls For a moment Jimmy stood paralysed staring feebly then there was a sudden deafening increase in the din Something living seemed to writhe and jump in his hand He dropped it incontinently and found himself gazing in a stupefied way at a round smoking hole in the carpet Such had been the effect of Gentleman Jack s unforeseen outburst that he had quite forgotten that he held the revolver and he had been unfortunate enough at this juncture to pull the trigger There was a sudden rush and a swirl of action Something hit Jimmy under the chin He staggered back and when he had recovered himself found himself looking into the muzzle of the revolver which had nearly blown a hole in his foot a moment back The sardonic face of Gentleman Jack smiled grimly over the barrel I told you the night wasn t over yet he said The blow under the chin had temporarily dulled Jimmy s mentality He stood swallowing and endeavouring to pull himself together and to get rid of a feeling that his head was about to come off He backed to the desk and steadied himself against it As he did so a voice from behind him spoke Whassall this He turned his head A curious procession was filing in through the open French window First came mister Crocker still wearing his hideous mask then a heavily bearded individual with round spectacles who looked like an automobile coming through a haystack then Ogden Ford and finally a sturdy determined looking woman with glittering but poorly company ordinated eyes who held a large revolver in her unshaking right hand and looked the very embodiment of the modern female who will stand no nonsense It was part of the nightmare like atmosphere which seemed to brood inexorably over this particular night that this person looked to Jimmy exactly like the parlour maid who had come to him in this room in answer to the bell and who had sent his father to him Yet how could it be she Jimmy knew little of the habits of parlour maids but surely they did not wander about with revolvers in the small hours While he endeavoured feverishly to find reason in this chaos the door opened and a motley crowd roused from sleep by the cries poured in Jimmy turning his head back again to attend to this invasion perceived missus Pett Ann two or three of the geniuses and Willie Partridge in various stages of negligee and babbling questions The woman with the pistol assuming instant and unquestioned domination of the assembly snapped out an order Shutatdoor Somebody shut the door Now whassall this she said turning to Gentleman Jack CHAPTER XXIII STIRRING TIMES FOR THE PETTS Gentleman Jack had lowered his revolver and was standing waiting to explain all with the insufferable look of the man who is just going to say that he has only done his duty and requires no thanks Who are you he said Nev min who I am said Miss Trimble curtly Siz Pett knows who I am I hope you won t be offended Lord Wisbeach said missus Pett from the group by the door I engaged a detective to help you I really thought you could not manage everything by yourself I hope you do not mind Not at all missus Pett Very wise I m so glad to hear you say so An excellent move Miss Trimble broke in on these amiable exchanges Whassall this Howjer mean help me Lord Wisbeach most kindly offered to do all he could to protect my nephew s explosive said missus Pett Gentleman Jack smiled modestly I hope I have been of some slight assistance I think I came down in the nick of time Look He pointed to the safe He had just got it open Luckily I had my pistol with me I covered him and called for help In another moment he would have got away Miss Trimble crossed to the safe and inspected it with a frown as if she disliked it She gave a grunt and returned to her place by the window Made good job f it was her comment Ann came forward Her face was glowing and her eyes shone Do you mean to say that you found Jimmy breaking into the safe I never heard anything so absurd missus Pett intervened This is not James Crocker Ann This man is an impostor who came into the house in order to steal Willie s invention She looked fondly at Gentleman Jack Lord Wisbeach told me so He only pretended to recognise him this afternoon A low gurgle proceeded from the open mouth of little Ogden The proceedings bewildered him The scene he had overheard in the library between the two men had made it clear to him that Jimmy was genuine and Lord Wisbeach a fraud and he could not understand why Jimmy did not produce his proofs as before He was not aware that Jimmy s head was only just beginning to clear from the effects of the blow on the chin Ogden braced himself for resolute lying in the event of Jimmy calling him as a witness But he did not intend to have his little business proposition dragged into the open Ann was looking at Jimmy with horror struck eyes For the first time it came to her how little she knew of him and how very likely it was in the face of the evidence it was almost certain that he should have come to the house with the intention of stealing Willie s explosive She fought against it but a voice seemed to remind her that it was he who had suggested the idea of posing as Jimmy Crocker She could not help remembering how smoothly and willingly he had embarked on the mad scheme But had it been so mad Had it not been a mere cloak for this other venture If Lord Wisbeach had found him in this room with the safe blown open what other explanation could there be And then simultaneously with her conviction that he was a criminal came the certainty that he was the man she loved It had only needed the spectacle of him in trouble to make her sure She came to his side with the vague idea of doing something to help him of giving him her support Once there she found that there was nothing to do and nothing to say She put her hand on his and stood waiting helplessly for she knew not what It was the touch of her fingers which woke Jimmy from his stupor He came to himself almost with a jerk He had been mistily aware of what had been said but speech had been beyond him Now quite suddenly he was a whole man once more He threw himself into the debate with energy Good Heavens he cried You re all wrong I found him blowing open the safe Gentleman Jack smiled superciliously A likely story what I mean to say it s a bit thin Ridiculous said missus Pett She turned to Miss Trimble with a gesture Arrest that man Wait a mom nt replied that clear headed maiden picking her teeth thoughtfully with the muzzle of her revolver Wait mom nt Gotta look nto this Hear both these guys saint ries Really said Gentleman Jack suavely it seems somewhat absurd Ney mind how bsurd t sounds returned the fair Trimble rebukingly You close y r face n lissen t me Thass all you ve gotta do I know you didn t do it cried Ann tightening her hold on Jimmy s arm Less f it please Less f it Miss Trimble removed the pistol from her mouth and pointed it at Jimmy What ve you to say Talk quick I happened to be down there Why asked Miss Trimble as if she had touched off a bomb Jimmy stopped short He perceived difficulties in the way of explanation I happened to be down there he resumed stoutly and that man came into the room with an electric torch and a blowpipe and began working on the safe The polished tones of Gentleman Jack cut in on his story Really now is it worth while He turned to Miss Trimble I came down here having heard a noise I did not happen to be here for some unexplained purpose I was lying awake and something attracted my attention As missus Pett knows I was suspicious of this worthy and expected him to make an attempt on the explosive at any moment so I took my pistol and crept downstairs When I got here the safe was open and this man making for the window Miss Trimble scratched her chin caressingly with the revolver and remained for a moment in thought Then she turned to Jimmy like a striking rattlesnake Y gotta pull someth g better th n that she said I got y r number Y re caught with th goods No cried Ann Yes said missus Pett The thing is obvious I think the best thing I can do said Gentleman Jack smoothly is to go and telephone for the police You think of everything Lord Wisbeach said missus Pett Not at all said his lordship Jimmy watched him moving to the door At the back of his mind there was a dull feeling that he could solve the whole trouble if only he could remember one fact which had escaped him The effects of the blow he had received still handicapped him He struggled to remember but without result Gentleman Jack reached the door and opened it and as he did so a shrill yapping hitherto inaudible because of the intervening oak and the raised voices within made itself heard from the passage outside Gentleman Jack closed the door with a hasty bang I say that dog s out there he said plaintively The scratching of Aida s busy feet on the wood bore out his words He looked about him baffled That dog s out there he repeated gloomily Something seemed to give way in Jimmy s brain The simple fact which had eluded him till now sprang into his mind Don t let that man get out he cried Good Lord I ve only just remembered You say you found me breaking into the safe You say you heard a noise and came down to investigate Well then what s that test tube of the explosive doing in your breast pocket He swung round to Miss Trimble You needn t take my word or his word There s a much simpler way of finding out who s the real crook Search us both He began to turn out his pockets rapidly Look here and here and here Now ask him to do the same He was pleased to observe a spasm pass across Gentleman Jack s hitherto composed countenance Miss Trimble was eyeing the latter with sudden suspicion Thasso she said Say Bill I ve f gott n y r name sup to you to show us Less ve a look t what y got inside there Gentleman Jack drew himself up haughtily I really could not agree to missus Pett interrupted indignantly I never heard of such a thing Lord Wisbeach is an old friend Less f it ordered Miss Trimble whose left eye was now like the left eye of a basilisk Y gotta show us Bill so b quick bout t A tired smile played over Gentleman Jack s face He was the bored aristocrat mutely protesting against something that wasn t done He dipped his slender fingers into his pocket Then drawing out the test tube and holding it up he spoke with a drawling calm for which even Jimmy could not help admiring him All right If I m done I m done The sensation caused by his action and his words was of the kind usually described as profound missus Pett uttered a strangled shriek Willie Partridge yelped like a dog Sharp exclamations came simultaneously from each of the geniuses Gentleman Jack waited for the clamour to subside Then he resumed his gentle drawl But I m not done he explained I m going out now through that window And if anybody tries to stop me it will be his or her he bowed politely to Miss Trimble last act in the world If any one makes a move to stop me I shall drop this test tube and blow the whole damned place to pieces If his first speech had made a marked impression on his audience his second paralysed them A silence followed as of the tomb Only the yapping of the dog Aida refused to be stilled Y stay where y are said Miss Trimble as the speaker moved towards the window She held the revolver poised but for the first time that night possibly for the first time in her life she spoke irresolutely Superbly competent woman though she was here was a situation that baffled her Gentleman Jack crossed the room slowly the test tube held aloft between fore finger and thumb He was level with Miss Trimble who had lowered her revolver and had drawn to one side plainly at a loss to know how to handle this unprecedented crisis when the door flew open For an instant the face of Howard Bemis the poet was visible missus Pett I have telephoned Then another voice interrupted him Yipe Yipe Yipe Through the opening the dog Aida rejoicing in the removal of the obstacle raced like a fur muff mysteriously endowed with legs and a tongue She tore across the room to where Gentleman Jack s ankles waited invitingly Ever since their first meeting she had wanted a fair chance at those ankles but some one had always prevented her Damn shouted Gentleman Jack The word was drowned in one vast cataclysm of noise From every throat in the room there proceeded a shout a shriek or some other variety of cry as the test tube slipping from between the victim s fingers described a parabola through the air Ann flung herself into Jimmy s arms and he held her tight He shut his eyes Even as he waited for the end the thought flashed through his mind that if he must die this was the manner of death which he would prefer The test tube crashed on the writing desk and burst into a million pieces Jimmy opened his eyes Things seemed to be much about the same as before He was still alive The room in which he stood was solid and intact Nobody was in fragments There was only one respect in which the scene differed from what it had been a moment before Then it had contained Gentleman Jack Now it did not A great sigh seemed to sweep through the room There was a long silence Then from the direction of the street came the roar of a starting automobile And at that sound the bearded man with the spectacles who had formed part of Miss Trimble s procession uttered a wailing cry Gee He s beat it in my bubble And it was a hired one The words seemed to relieve the tension in the air One by one the company became masters of themselves once more Miss Trimble that masterly woman was the first to recover She raised herself from the floor for with a confused idea that she would be safer there she had flung herself down and having dusted her skirt with a few decisive dabs of her strong left hand addressed herself once more to business I let m bluff me with a fake bomb she commented bitterly She brooded on this for a moment Say shut th t door gain some one and t run this mutt out I can t think with th t yapping going on missus Pett pale and scared gathered Aida into her arms At the same time Ann removed herself from Jimmy s She did not look at him She was feeling oddly shy Shyness had never been a failing of hers but she would have given much now to have been elsewhere Miss Trimble again took charge of the situation The sound of the automobile had died away Gentleman Jack had passed out of their lives This fact embittered Miss Trimble She spoke with asperity Well he s gone she said acidly Now we can get down t cases again Say She addressed missus Pett who started nervously The experience of passing through the shadow of the valley of death and of finding herself in one piece instead of several thousand had robbed her of all her wonted masterfulness Say list n t me There s been a double game on here t night That guy that s jus gone was th first part of th entertainment Now we c n start th sec nd part You see these ducks She indicated with a wave of the revolver mister Crocker and his bearded comrade They ve been trying t kidnap y r son missus Pett uttered a piercing cry Oggie Oh can it muttered that youth uncomfortably He foresaw awkward moments ahead and he wished to concentrate his faculties entirely on the part he was to play in them He looked sideways at Chicago Ed In a few minutes he supposed Ed would be attempting to minimise his own crimes by pretending that he Ogden had invited him to come and kidnap him Stout denial must be his weapon I had m suspicions resumed Miss Trimble that someth ng was goin t be pulled off to night nd I was waiting outside f r it to break loose This guy here she indicated the bearded plotter who blinked deprecatingly through his spectacles h s been waiting on the c rner of th street for the last hour with n automobile I ve b n watching him right along I was onto h s game Well just now out came the kid with this plug ugly here She turned to mister Crocker Say you Take off th t mask Let s have a l k at you mister Crocker reluctantly drew the cambric from his face Goosh exclaimed Miss Trimble in strong distaste Say ve you got some kind of a plague or wh t is it Y look like a coloured comic supplement She confronted the shrinking mister Crocker and ran a bony finger over his cheek Make up she said eyeing the stains disgustedly Grease paint Goosh Skinner cried missus Pett Miss Trimble scanned her victim more closely So t is if y do a bit f excavating She turned on the bearded one nd I guess all this shrubbery is fake f you come down to it She wrenched at the unhappy man s beard It came off in her hands leaving a square chin behind it If this ain t a wig y ll have a headache t morrow observed Miss Trimble weaving her fingers into his luxuriant head covering and pulling Wish y luck Ah twas a wig Gimme those spect cles She surveyed the results of her handiwork grimly Say Clarence she remarked y re a wise guy Y look handsomer with em on Does any one know this duck It is Mitchell said missus Pett My husband s physical instructor Miss Trimble turned and walking to Jimmy tapped him meaningly on the chest with her revolver Say this is gett n interesting This is where y xplain y ng man how twas you happened to be down in this room when th t crook who s just gone was monkeyin with the safe L ks t me as if you were in with these two A feeling of being on the verge of one of those crises which dot the smooth path of our lives came to Jimmy To conceal his identity from Ann any longer seemed impossible He was about to speak when Ann broke in Aunt Nesta she said I can t let this go on any longer Jerry Mitchell isn t to blame I told him to kidnap Ogden There was an awkward silence missus Pett laughed nervously I think you had better go to bed my dear child You have had a severe shock You are not yourself But it s true I did tell him didn t I Jerry Say Miss Trimble silenced Jerry with a gesture You beat t back t y r little bed honey like y r aunt says Y say y told this guy t steal th kid Well what about this here Skinner Y didn t tell him did y I I Ann began confusedly She was utterly unable to account for Skinner and it made her task of explaining difficult Jimmy came to the rescue He did not like to think how Ann would receive the news but for her own sake he must speak now It would have required a harder hearted man than himself to resist the mute pleading of his father s grease painted face mister Crocker was a game sport he would not have said a word without the sign from Jimmy even to save himself from a night in prison but he hoped that Jimmy would speak It s perfectly simple said Jimmy with an attempt at airiness which broke down miserably under Miss Trimble s eye Perfectly simple I really am Jimmy Crocker you know He avoided Ann s gaze I can t think what you are making all this fuss about Th n why did y sit in at a plot to kidnap this boy That of course ha ha might seem at first sight to require a little explanation Y admit it then Yes As a matter of fact I did have the idea of kidnapping Ogden Wanted to send him to a dogs hospital if you understand what I mean He tried to smile a conciliatory smile but encountering Miss Trimble s left eye abandoned the project He removed a bead of perspiration from his forehead with his handkerchief It struck him as a very curious thing that the simplest explanations were so often quite difficult to make Before I go any further I ought to explain one thing Skinner there is my father missus Pett gasped Skinner was my sister s butler in London In a way of speaking said Jimmy that is correct It s rather a long story It was this way you see Miss Trimble uttered an ejaculation of supreme contempt I n ver saw such a lot of babbl ng crooks in m life t beats me what y hope to get pulling this stuff Say She indicated mister Crocker This guy s wanted f r something over in England We ve got h s photographs n th office If y ask me he lit out with the spoons r something Say She fixed one of the geniuses with her compelling eye Bout time y made y rself useful Go n call up th Astorbilt on th phone There s a dame there that s been making the enquiries f r this duck She told Anderson s and Anderson s handed it on to us to call her up any hour of the day r night when they found him You go get her on the wire and t ll her t come right up here n a taxi and identify him The genius paused at the door Whom shall I ask for missus Crocker snapped Miss Trimble Siz Bingley Crocker Tell her we ve found th guy she s been looking for The genius backed out There was a howl of anguish from the doorway I beg your pardon said the genius Can t you look where you re going I am exceedingly sorry Brrh mister Pett entered the room hopping He was holding one slippered foot in his hand and appeared to be submitting it to some form of massage It was plain that the usually mild and gentle little man was in a bad temper He glowered round him at the company assembled What the devil s the matter here he demanded I stood it as long as I could but a man can t get a wink of sleep with this noise going on Yipe Yipe Yipe barked Aida from the shelter of missus Pett s arms mister Pett started violently Kill that dog Throw her out Do something to her missus Pett was staring blankly at her husband She had never seen him like this before It was as if a rabbit had turned and growled at her Coming on top of the crowded sensations of the night it had the effect of making her feel curiously weak In all her married life she had never known what fear was She had coped dauntlessly with the late mister Ford a man of a spirited temperament and as for the mild mister Pett she had trampled on him But now she felt afraid This new Peter intimidated her CHAPTER XXIV SENSATIONAL TURNING OF A WORM To this remarkable metamorphosis in mister Peter Pett several causes had contributed In the first place the sudden dismissal of Jerry Mitchell had obliged him to go two days without the physical exercises to which his system had become accustomed and this had produced a heavy irritable condition of body and mind He had brooded on the injustice of his lot until he had almost worked himself up to rebellion And then as sometimes happened with him when he was out of sorts a touch of gout came to add to his troubles Being a patient man by nature he might have borne up against these trials had he been granted an adequate night s rest But just as he had dropped off after tossing restlessly for two hours things had begun to happen noisily in the library He awoke to a vague realisation of tumult below Such was the morose condition of his mind as the result of his misfortune that at first not even the cries for help could interest him sufficiently to induce him to leave his bed He knew that walking in his present state would be painful and he declined to submit to any more pain just because some party unknown was apparently being murdered in his library It was not until the shrill barking of the dog Aida penetrated right in among his nerve centres and began to tie them into knots that he found himself compelled to descend Even when he did so it was in no spirit of kindness He did not come to rescue anybody or to interfere between any murderer and his victim He came in a fever of militant wrath to suppress Aida On the threshold of the library however the genius by treading on his gouty foot had diverted his anger and caused it to become more general He had not ceased to concentrate his venom on Aida He wanted to assail everybody What s the matter here he demanded red eyed Isn t somebody going to tell me Have I got to stop here all night Who on earth is this He glared at Miss Trimble What s she doing with that pistol He stamped incautiously with his bad foot and emitted a dry howl of anguish She is a detective Peter said missus Pett timidly A detective Why Where did she come from Miss Trimble took it upon herself to explain Mister Pett siz Pett sent f r me t watch out so s nobody kidnapped her son Oggie explained missus Pett Miss Trimble was guarding darling Oggie Why To to prevent him being kidnapped Peter mister Pett glowered at the stout boy Then his eye was attracted by the forlorn figure of Jerry Mitchell He started Was this fellow kidnapping the boy he asked Sure said Miss Trimble Caught h m with th goods He w s waiting outside there with a car I held h m and this other guy up w th a gun and brought em back Jerry said mister Pett it wasn t your fault that you didn t bring it off and I m going to treat you right You d have done it if nobody had butted in to stop you You ll get the money to start that health farm of yours all right I ll see to that Now you run off to bed There s nothing to keep you here Say cried Miss Trimble outraged D ya mean t say y aren t going t pros cute Why aren t I tell ng y I caught h m kidnapping th boy I told him to kidnap the boy snarled mister Pett Peter mister Pett looked like an under sized lion as he faced his wife He bristled The recollection of all that he had suffered from Ogden came to strengthen his determination I ve tried for two years to get you to send that boy to a good boarding school and you wouldn t do it I couldn t stand having him loafing around the house any longer so I told Jerry Mitchell to take him away to a friend of his who keeps a dogs hospital on Long Island and to tell his friend to hold him there till he got some sense into him Well you ve spoiled that for the moment with your detectives but it still looks good to me I ll give you a choice You can either send that boy to a boarding school next week or he goes to Jerry Mitchell s friend I m not going to have him in the house any longer loafing in my chair and smoking my cigarettes Which is it to be But Peter Well If I send him to a school he may be kidnapped Kidnapping can t hurt him It s what he needs And anyway if he is I ll pay the bill and be glad to do it Take him off to bed now To morrow you can start looking up schools Great Godfrey He hopped to the writing desk and glared disgustedly at the debris on it Who s been making this mess on my desk It s hard It s darned hard The only room in the house that I ask to have for my own where I can get a little peace and I find it turned into a beer garden and coffee or some damned thing spilled all over my writing desk That isn t coffee Peter said missus Pett mildly This cave man whom she had married under the impression that he was a gentle domestic pet had taken all the spirit out of her It s Willie s explosive Willie s explosive Lord Wisbeach I mean the man who pretended to be Lord Wisbeach dropped it there Dropped it there Well why didn t it explode and blow the place to Hoboken then missus Pett looked helplessly at Willie who thrust his fingers into his mop of hair and rolled his eyes There was fortunately some slight miscalculation in my formula uncle Peter he said I shall have to look into it to morrow Whether the trinitrotoluol mister Pett uttered a sharp howl He beat the air with his clenched fists He seemed to be having a brain storm Has this this fish been living on me all this time have I been supporting this this buzzard in luxury all these years while he fooled about with an explosive that won t explode He pointed an accusing finger at the inventor Look into it tomorrow will you Yes you can look into it to morrow after six o clock Until then you ll be working for the first time in your life working in my office where you ought to have been all along He surveyed the crowded room belligerently Now perhaps you will all go back to bed and let people get a little sleep Go home he said to the detective Miss Trimble stood her ground She watched missus Pett pass away with Ogden and Willie Partridge head a stampede of geniuses but she declined to move Y gotta cut th rough stuff ster Pett she said calmly I need my sleep j saint s much s everyb dy else but I gotta stay here There s a lady c ming right up in a taxi fr m th Astorbilt to identify this gook She s after m f r something What Skinner s what he calls h mself What s he done I d no Th lady ll tell us that There was a violent ringing at the front door bell I guess that s her said Miss Trimble Who s going to let r in I can t go I will said Ann mister Pett regarded mister Crocker with affectionate encouragement I don t know what you ve done Skinner he said but I ll stand by you You re the best fan I ever met and if I can keep you out of the penitentiary I will It isn t the penitentiary said mister Crocker unhappily A tall handsome and determined looking woman came into the room She stood in the doorway looking about her Then her eyes rested on mister Crocker For a moment she gazed incredulously at his discoloured face She drew a little nearer peering D yo dentify m ma am said Miss Trimble Bingley Is t th guy y wanted It s my husband said missus Crocker Y can t arrest m f r that said Miss Trimble disgustedly She thrust her revolver back into the hinterland of her costume Guess I ll be beatin it she said with a sombre frown She was plainly in no sunny mood f all th hunk jobs I was ever on this is th hunkest I m told off t watch a gang of crooks and after I ve lost a night s sleep doing it it turns out t s a nice jolly fam ly party She jerked her thumb towards Jimmy Say this guy says he s that guy s son I s pose it s all right That is my step son James Crocker Ann uttered a little cry but it was lost in Miss Trimble s stupendous snort The detective turned to the window I guess I ll beat t she observed caustically before it turns out that I m y r l il daughter Genevieve CHAPTER XXV NEARLY EVERYBODY HAPPY missus Crocker turned to her husband Well Bingley she said a steely tinkle in her voice Well Eugenia said mister Crocker A strange light was shining in mister Crocker s mild eyes He had seen a miracle happen that night He had seen an even more formidable woman than his wife dominated by an even meeker man than himself and he had been amazed and impressed by the spectacle It had never even started to occur to him before but apparently it could be done A little resolution a little determination nothing more was needed He looked at mister Pett And yet mister Pett had crumpled up Eugenia s sister with about three firm speeches It could be done What have you to say Bingley mister Crocker drew himself up Just this he said I m an American citizen and the way I ve figured it out is that my place is in America It s no good talking about it Eugenia I m sorry if it upsets your plans but I am not going back to London He eyed his speechless wife unflatteringly I m going to stick on here and see the pennant race out And after that I m going to take in the World s Series missus Crocker opened her mouth to speak closed it re opened it Then she found that she had nothing to say I hope you ll be sensible Eugenia and stay on this side and we can all be happy I m sorry to have to take this stand but you tried me too high You re a woman and you don t know what it is to go five years without seeing a ball game but take it from me it s more than any real fan can stand It nearly killed me and I m not going to risk it again If mister Pett will keep me on as his butler I ll stay here in this house If he won t I ll get another job somewhere But whatever happens I stick to this side mister Pett uttered a whoop of approval There s always been a place for you in my house old man he cried When I get a butler who But Bingley How can you be a butler You ought to watch him said mister Pett enthusiastically He s a wonder He can pull all the starchy stuff as if he d lived with the Duke of Whoosis for the last forty years and then go right off and fling a pop bottle at an umpire He s all right The eulogy was wasted on missus Crocker She burst into tears It was a new experience for her husband and he watched her awkwardly his resolute demeanour crumbling under this unexpected assault Eugenia missus Crocker wiped her eyes I can t stand it she sobbed I ve worked and worked all these years and now just as success has nearly come Bingley do come back It will only be for a little longer mister Crocker stared A little longer Why that Lord Percy Whipple business I know you must have had excellent reasons for soaking him Jimmy but it did put the lid on it surely after that Lord Percy affair there s no chance There is There is It has made no difference at all Lord Percy came to call next day with a black eye poor boy and said that James was a sportsman and that he wanted to know him better He said he had never felt so drawn towards any one in his life and he wanted him to show him how he made some blow which he called a right hook The whole affair has simply endeared James to him and Lady Corstorphine says that the Duke of Devizes read the account of the fight to the Premier that very evening and they both laughed till they nearly got apoplexy Jimmy was deeply touched He had not suspected such a sporting spirit in his antagonist Percy s all right he said enthusiastically Dad you ought to go back It s only fair But Jimmy Surely you can understand There s only a game separating the Giants and the Phillies with the Braves coming along just behind And the season only half over missus Crocker looked imploringly at him It will only be for a little while Bingley Lady Corstorphine who has means of knowing says that your name is certain to be in the next Honours List After that you can come back as often as you like We could spend the summer here and the winter in England or whatever you pleased mister Crocker capitulated All right Eugenia I ll come Bingley We shall have to go back by the next boat dear People are beginning to wonder where you are I ve told them that you are taking a rest in the country But they will suspect something if you don t come back at once mister Crocker s face wore a drawn look He had never felt so attached to his wife as now when she wept these unexpected tears and begged favours of him with that unfamiliar catch in her voice On the other hand A vision rose before him of the Polo Grounds on a warm afternoon He crushed it down Very well he said mister Pett offered a word of consolation Maybe you ll be able to run over for the World s Series mister Crocker s face cleared That s true And I ll cable you the scores every day dad said Jimmy missus Crocker looked at him with a touch of disapproval clouding the happiness of her face Are you staying over here James There is no reason why you should not come back too If you make up your mind to change your habits I have made up my mind to change them But I m going to do it in New York mister Pett is going to give me a job in his office I am going to start at the bottom and work my way still further down mister Pett yapped with rapture He was experiencing something of the emotion of the preacher at the camp meeting who sees the Sinners Bench filling up To have secured Willie Partridge whom he intended to lead gradually into the realms of high finance by way of envelope addressing was much But that Jimmy with a choice in the matter should have chosen the office filled him with such content that he only just stopped himself from dancing on his bad foot Don t worry about me dad I shall do wonders It s quite easy to make a large fortune I watched uncle Pete in his office this morning and all he does is sit at a mahogany table and tell the office boy to tell callers that he has gone away for the day I think I ought to rise to great heights in that branch of industry From the little I have seen of it it seems to have been made for me CHAPTER XXVI EVERYBODY HAPPY Jimmy looked at Ann They were alone mister Pett had gone back to bed missus Crocker to her hotel mister Crocker was removing his make up in his room A silence had followed their departure This is the end of a perfect day said Jimmy Ann took a step towards the door Don t go Ann stopped mister Crocker she said Jimmy he corrected mister Crocker repeated Ann firmly Or Algernon if you prefer it May I ask Ann regarded him steadily May I ask Nearly always said Jimmy when people begin with that they are going to say something unpleasant May I ask why you went to all this trouble to make a fool of me Why could you not have told me who you were from the start Have you forgotten all the harsh things you said to me from time to time about Jimmy Crocker I thought that if you knew who I was you would have nothing more to do with me You were quite right Surely though you won t let a thing that happened five years ago make so much difference I shall never forgive you And yet a little while ago when Willie s bomb was about to go off you flung yourself into my arms Ann s face flamed I lost my balance Why try to recover it Ann bit her lip You did a cruel heartless thing What does it matter how long ago it was If you were capable of it then Be reasonable Don t you admit the possibility of reformation Take your own case Five years ago you were a minor poetess Now you are an amateur kidnapper a bright lovable girl at whose approach people lock up their children and sit on the key As for me five years ago I was a heartless brute Now I am a sober serious business man specially called in by your uncle to help jack up his tottering firm Why not bury the dead past Besides I don t want to praise myself I just want to call your attention to it think what I have done for you You admitted yourself that it was my influence that had revolutionised your character But for me you would now be doing worse than write poetry You would be writing vers libre I saved you from that And you spurn me I hate you said Ann Jimmy went to the writing desk and took up a small book Put that down I just wanted to read you Love s Funeral It illustrates my point Think of yourself as you are now and remember that it is I who am responsible for the improvement Here we are Love s Funeral My heart is dead Ann snatched the book from his hands and flung it away It soared up clearing the gallery rails and fell with a thud on the gallery floor She stood facing him with sparkling eyes Then she moved away I beg your pardon she said stiffly I lost my temper It s your hair said Jimmy soothingly You re bound to be quick tempered with hair of that glorious red shade You must marry some nice determined fellow blue eyed dark haired clean shaven about five foot eleven with a future in business He will keep you in order mister Crocker Gently of course Kindly lovingly The velvet thingummy rather than the iron what s its name But nevertheless firmly Ann was at the door To a girl with your ardent nature some one with whom you can quarrel is an absolute necessity of life You and I are affinities Ours will be an ideally happy marriage You would be miserable if you had to go through life with a human doormat with Welcome written on him You want some one made of sterner stuff You want as it were a sparring partner some one with whom you can quarrel happily with the certain knowledge that he will not curl up in a ball for you to kick but will be there with the return wallop I may have my faults He paused expectantly Ann remained silent No no he went on But I am such a man Brisk give and take is the foundation of the happy marriage Do you remember that beautiful line of Tennyson s We fell out my wife and I It always conjures up for me a vision of wonderful domestic happiness I seem to see us in our old age you on one side of the radiator I on the other warming our old limbs and thinking up snappy stuff to hand to each other sweethearts still If I were to go out of your life now you would be miserable You would have nobody to quarrel with You would be in the position of the female jaguar of the Indian jungle who as you doubtless know expresses her affection for her mate by biting him shrewdly in the fleshy part of the leg if she should snap sideways one day and find nothing there Of all the things which Ann had been trying to say during this discourse only one succeeded in finding expression To her mortification it was the only weak one in the collection Are you asking me to marry you I am I won t You think so now because I am not appearing at my best You see me nervous diffident tongue tied All this will wear off however and you will be surprised and delighted as you begin to understand my true self Beneath the surface I speak conservatively I am a corker The door banged behind Ann Jimmy found himself alone He walked thoughtfully to mister Pett s armchair and sat down There was a feeling of desolation upon him He lit a cigarette and began to smoke pensively What a fool he had been to talk like that What girl of spirit could possibly stand it If ever there had been a time for being soothing and serious and pleading it had been these last few minutes And he talked like that Ten minutes passed Jimmy sprang from his chair He thought he had heard a footstep He flung the door open The passage was empty He returned miserably to his chair Of course she had not come back Why should she A voice spoke Jimmy He leaped up again and looked wildly round Then he looked up Ann was leaning over the gallery rail Jimmy I ve been thinking it over There s something I want to ask you Do you admit that you behaved abominably five years ago Yes shouted Jimmy And that you ve been behaving just as badly ever since Yes And that you are really a pretty awful sort of person Yes Then it s all right You deserve it Deserve it Deserve to marry a girl like me I was worried about it but now I see that it s the only punishment bad enough for you She raised her arm Here s the dead past Jimmy Go and bury it Good night A small book fell squashily at Jimmy s feet He regarded it dully for a moment Then with a wild yell which penetrated even to mister Pett s bedroom and woke that sufferer just as he was dropping off to sleep for the third time that night he bounded for the gallery stairs At the further end of the gallery a musical laugh sounded and a door closed Ann had gone Transcriber s Notes for edition eleven I am greatly indebted to the Wodehouse readers from the BLANDINGS e mail group who did such detailed research on this text not only on simple typos but on the differences between the nineteen sixteen Saturday Evening Post serialization and the US and UK early printings I have made use in this new PG edition of the nineteen eighteen UK first edition references provided by these helpful savants to correct misprints or other publisher s errors in the US edition but I have otherwise followed the US edition The punctuation is somewhat different from the UK versions notably in its use of colons The words Uncle and Aunt where used with a name Uncle Peter Aunt Nesta were capitalized in the original serialized and UK editions but lower cased in the US edition so I have retained the lower case I have also restored some italics omitted in the previous PG edition I note below some significant differences between the early printings Chapter II Well played sir when they meant at a boy mean is in the US edition other editions have meant Chapter VI Regent s bill of fare has been corrected from Regent s bill of fair in the US edition pull some boner has been corrected from pull some bone in the US edition Chapter VIII Before his stony eye the immaculate Bartling wilted It was a perfectly astounding likeness but it was apparent to him when what he had ever heard and read about doubles came to him This is a somewhat clumsy construction and quite un Wodehousian The original passage in the serialization read Before his stony eye the immaculate Bartling wilted All that he had ever heard and read about doubles came to him End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Piccadilly Jim by P G Wodehouse END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PICCADILLY JIM This file should be named two thousand
