4599-21274-0000	train-other-500	beautiful beautiful And with a long breath of delight Marcella Boyce threw herself on her knees
none	none	 by the window she had just opened 
4599-21274-0001	train-other-500	and propping her face upon her hands devoured the scene
none	none	 before her with that passionate intensity of pleasure which had been her gift and heritage through life She looked out upon a broad and level lawn smoothed by the care of centuries 
4599-21274-0002	train-other-500	flanked on either side by groups of old trees
none	none	 some Scotch firs 
4599-21274-0003	train-other-500	some beeches a cedar or two groups where the slow selective hand of time had been at work for generations
none	none	 developing here 
4599-21274-0004	train-other-500	the delightful roundness of quiet mass and shade and there
none	none	 the bold caprice of bare fir trunks and ragged branches 
4599-21274-0005	train-other-500	standing black against the sky Beyond the lawn stretched a green descent indefinitely long
none	none	 carrying the eye indeed almost to the limit of the view and becoming from the lawn onwards a wide irregular avenue bordered by beeches of a splendid maturity 
4599-21274-0006	train-other-500	ending at last in a far distant gap where a gate and a gate of some importance clearly should have been
none	none	 yet was not 
4599-21274-0007	train-other-500	The size of the trees the wide uplands of the falling valley to the left of the avenue
none	none	 now rich in the tints of harvest the autumn sun pouring steadily through the vanishing mists 
4599-21274-0008	train-other-500	the green breadth of the vast lawn the unbroken peace of wood and cultivated ground all carried with them a confused general impression of well being and of dignity
none	none	 Marcella drew it 
4599-21274-0009	train-other-500	in this impression with avidity Yet at the same moment she noticed involuntarily the gateless gap at the end of the avenue the choked condition of the garden paths on either side of the lawn
4599-21274-0010	train-other-500	and the unsightly tufts of grass spotting the broad gravel terrace beneath her window It is a heavenly place all said and done
none	none	 she protested to herself with a little frown But no doubt it would have been better still if Uncle Robert had looked after it and we could afford to keep the garden decent Still She dropped on a stool beside the open window 
4599-21274-0011	train-other-500	and as her eyes steeped themselves
none	none	 afresh in what they saw 
4599-21274-0012	train-other-500	the frown disappeared again in the former look of glowing content that content of youth which is never merely passive nay rather contains an invariable element of
4599-21274-0013	train-other-500	covetous eagerness It was but three months or so since Marcella s father mister Richard Boyce had succeeded to the ownership of Mellor Park
none	none	 the old home of 
4599-21274-0014	train-other-500	the Boyces and it was little more than six weeks since Marcella had received her summons home from the students boarding house in Kensington where she had been lately living
4599-21274-0015	train-other-500	She had ardently wished to assist in the June settling in having not been able to apply her mind to the music or painting she was
none	none	 supposed to be studying 
4599-21274-0016	train-other-500	nor indeed to any other subject whatever since the news of their inheritance had reached her
none	none	 But her mother in a dry little note had let it be known that she preferred to manage the move for herself 
4599-21274-0017	train-other-500	Marcella had better go on with her studies as long as possible
none	none	 Yet Marcella was here at last 
4599-21274-0018	train-other-500	And as she looked
none	none	 round her large bare room with its old 
4599-21274-0019	train-other-500	dilapidated furniture and then out again to woods and lawns
none	none	 it seemed to her that all was now well 
4599-21274-0020	train-other-500	and that her childhood with its squalors and miseries was blotted out atoned for by this last kind sudden stroke of fate which might have been delayed so deplorably
4599-21274-0021	train-other-500	since no one could have reasonably expected that an apparently sound man of sixty would have succumbed in three days
none	none	 to the sort of common chill 
4599-21274-0022	train-other-500	a hunter and sportsman must have resisted successfully a score of times before
none	none	 Her great desire now was to put the past the greater part of it at any rate 
4599-21274-0023	train-other-500	behind her altogether Its
none	none	 shabby worries were surely done with poor as she and her parents still were 
4599-21274-0024	train-other-500	relatively to their present position At least she was no longer the self conscious schoolgirl
none	none	 paid for at a lower rate than her 
4599-21274-0025	train-other-500	companions stinted in dress pocket money and education and fiercely
none	none	 resentful at every turn of some real or 
4599-21274-0026	train-other-500	fancied slur she was no longer even the half
none	none	 Bohemian student of these 
4599-21274-0027	train-other-500	past two years enjoying herself in London so far as the iron necessity of keeping her boarding house expenses down to the lowest possible figure would allow
none	none	 She was something altogether different 
4599-21274-0028	train-other-500	She was Marcella Boyce a finished and grown up young woman of twenty one
none	none	 the only daughter and child of 
4599-21274-0029	train-other-500	mister Boyce of Mellor Park
none	none	 inheritress of one of the most ancient names in 
4599-21274-0030	train-other-500	Midland England and just entering on a life which
none	none	 to her own fancy and will at any rate 
4599-21274-0031	train-other-500	promised the highest possible degree of interest and novelty Yet
none	none	 in the very act of putting her past away from her she only succeeded so it seemed in inviting it to repossess her For against her will she fell straightway 
4599-21274-0032	train-other-500	in this quiet of the autumn morning
none	none	 into a riot of memory 
4599-21274-0033	train-other-500	setting her past self against her present more consciously
none	none	 than she had done yet 
4599-21274-0034	train-other-500	recalling scene after scene
none	none	 and stage after stage with feelings of 
4599-21274-0035	train-other-500	sarcasm or amusement
none	none	 or disgust which showed themselves freely as they came and went 
4599-21274-0036	train-other-500	in the fine plastic face turned to the September woods
none	none	 She had been at school since she was 
4599-21274-0037	train-other-500	nine years old there was the dominant fact in these motley uncomfortable years behind her
none	none	 which in her young ignorance of the irrevocableness of living she wished so impatiently to forget As to the time before her school life she had a dim memory of 
4599-21274-0038	train-other-500	seemly and pleasant things of a house in London of a large and bright nursery of a smiling mother who took
none	none	 constant notice of her 
4599-21274-0039	train-other-500	of games little friends and birthday parties
none	none	 What had led to the complete disappearance of 
4599-21274-0040	train-other-500	this earliest set to use a theatrical phrase from the scenery of her childhood Marcella did not yet adequately know
none	none	 though she had some theories and many suspicions 
4599-21274-0041	train-other-500	in the background of her mind But
none	none	 at any rate this first image of memory was 
4599-21274-0042	train-other-500	succeeded by another precise as the first was
none	none	 vague the image of a tall white house set against a white chalk 
4599-21274-0043	train-other-500	cliff rising in terraces behind it and alongside it
none	none	 where she had spent the years from 
4599-21274-0044	train-other-500	nine to fourteen and where
none	none	 if she were set down blindfold 
4599-21274-0045	train-other-500	now at twenty one
none	none	 she could have found her way to every room and door and cupboard and stair with a perfect and fascinated familiarity When she entered that house she was a lanky black eyed creature 
4599-21274-0046	train-other-500	tall for her age and endowed
none	none	 or as she herself would have put it cursed with an 
4599-21274-0047	train-other-500	abundance of curly unmanageable hair whereof the brushing and tending soon became to a nervous clumsy child
none	none	 not long parted from her nurse 
4599-21274-0048	train-other-500	one of the worst plagues of her existence
none	none	 During her home life 
4599-21274-0049	train-other-500	she had been an average child of the quick and clever type
none	none	 with average faults But something in the bare 
4599-21274-0050	train-other-500	ugly rooms the discipline the teaching the companionship of Miss
none	none	 Frederick s Cliff House School for 
4599-21274-0051	train-other-500	Young Ladies transformed little Marcella Boyce for the time being into a demon
none	none	 She hated her lessons though when she chose she could do them in a hundredth part of the time taken by her companions 
4599-21274-0052	train-other-500	she hated getting up in the wintry dark and her cold
none	none	 ablutions with some 
4599-21274-0053	train-other-500	dozen others in the comfortless lavatory she hated the meals in the long schoolroom where because twice meat was forbidden and twice pudding allowed
none	none	 she 
4599-21274-0054	train-other-500	invariably hungered fiercely for more mutton and scorned her second course
none	none	 making a sort of dramatic story to herself out of Miss Frederick s tyranny and her own thwarted appetite as she sat black browed and brooding in her place 
4599-21274-0055	train-other-500	She was not a favourite with her companions and she was a perpetual difficulty
none	none	 and trouble to her perfectly well intentioned schoolmistress 
4599-21274-0056	train-other-500	The whole of her first year was one continual series of sulks quarrels and revolts
none	none	 Perhaps her blackest days were the days she spent occasionally in bed when Miss Frederick at her wit s end would take advantage of one of the child s 
4599-21274-0057	train-other-500	perpetual colds to try the effects of a day s seclusion and solitary confinement
none	none	 administered in such a form that it could do her charge no harm 
4599-21274-0058	train-other-500	and might she hoped do her good For I do believe a great part of it s liver or nerves
none	none	 No child in her right senses could behave so she would declare to the mild and stout French lady who had been her partner for years and who was more inclined to befriend and excuse Marcella than any one else in the house no one exactly knew 
6189_21305_000080_000004	train-clean-360	why 
none	none	Now the rule of the house when any girl was ordered to bed with a cold was in the first place that she should not put her arms outside the bedclothes for if you were allowed to read and amuse yourself in bed you might as well be up that the housemaid should visit the patient in the early morning with a cup of senna tea and at long and regular intervals throughout the day with beef tea and gruel and that no one should come to see and talk with her unless indeed it were the doctor quiet being in all cases of sickness the first condition of recovery and the natural schoolgirl in Miss Frederick s persuasion being more or less inclined to complain without cause if illness were made agreeable 
4599-21274-0059	train-other-500	For some fourteen hours therefore on these days of
none	none	 durance 
4599-21274-0060	train-other-500	Marcella was left almost wholly alone nothing but a wild
none	none	 mass of black hair and a pair of 
4599-21274-0061	train-other-500	roving defiant eyes in a pale
none	none	 face showing above the bedclothes whenever the housemaid chose to visit her a pitiable morsel 
4599-21274-0062	train-other-500	in truth of rather
none	none	 forlorn humanity 
4599-21274-0063	train-other-500	For though she had her movements of fierce revolt
none	none	 when she was within an ace of 
4599-21274-0064	train-other-500	throwing the senna tea in Martha s face and rushing downstairs in her nightgown
none	none	 to denounce Miss Frederick in the midst of an astonished schoolroom 
4599-21274-0065	train-other-500	something generally interposed
none	none	 not conscience 
4599-21274-0066	train-other-500	it is to be feared or any wish to be good but only an aching inmost sense of childish loneliness and helplessness
none	none	 a perception that she had indeed tried everybody s patience to the limit 
4599-21274-0067	train-other-500	and that these days in bed represented crises which must be borne with
none	none	 even by such a rebel as Marcie Boyce 
4599-21274-0068	train-other-500	So she submitted and presently learnt under dire stress of boredom to amuse herself a good deal by developing a natural capacity for dreaming awake
none	none	 Hour by hour she followed out an endless story of which she was always the heroine Before the annoyance of her afternoon gruel which she loathed was well forgotten she was in full fairy land again 
4599-21274-0069	train-other-500	figuring generally as the
none	none	 trusted friend and companion of the Princess of Wales 
4599-21274-0070	train-other-500	of that beautiful Alexandra the top and model of English society whose portrait in the window of the little
none	none	 stationer s shop at Marswell 
4599-21274-0071	train-other-500	the small country town near Cliff House had
none	none	 attracted the child s attention once 
4599-21274-0072	train-other-500	on a dreary walk and had ever since
none	none	 governed her 
4599-21274-0073	train-other-500	dreams Marcella had no fairy tales
none	none	 but she spun a whole cycle for herself around the lovely Princess 
4599-21274-0074	train-other-500	who came to seem to her before long
none	none	 her own particular property She had only to shut her eyes and she had caught her idol s attention 
4599-21274-0075	train-other-500	either by some look or
none	none	 act of passionate yet unobtrusive homage as she passed the royal carriage in the street 
4599-21274-0076	train-other-500	or by throwing herself in front of the
none	none	 divinity s runaway horses or by a series of social steps easily devised by an 
4599-21274-0077	train-other-500	imaginative child well aware in spite of appearances
none	none	 that she was of an old family and had 
4599-21274-0078	train-other-500	aristocratic relations Then when the Princess had held out a gracious hand and smiled all was delight Marcella grew up on the instant
none	none	 she was beautiful of course she had so people said the Boyce eyes and hair she had sweeping gowns 
4599-21274-0079	train-other-500	generally of white muslin with cherry coloured ribbons she went here and there with the Princess laughing and talking quite calmly with the greatest people in the land
4599-21274-0080	train-other-500	her romantic friendship with the adored of England making her all the time the observed of all observers bringing her a thousand
none	none	 delicate flatteries and attentions Then when she was at the very top of ecstasy 
4599-21274-0081	train-other-500	floating in the softest summer sea of fancy some little noise would startle her into
none	none	 opening her eyes and there beside her in the deepening dusk would be the bare white beds of her two dormitory companions the ugly wall paper opposite and the uncovered boards with their frugal strips of carpet stretching away on either hand The tea bell would ring perhaps in the depths far below and the sound would 
4599-21274-0082	train-other-500	complete the transformation of the Princess s maid of honour into Marcie Boyce the plain naughty child whom nobody cared about
none	none	 whose mother never wrote to her 
4599-21274-0083	train-other-500	who in contrast to every other girl in the school had not a single party frock
none	none	 and who would have 
4599-21274-0084	train-other-500	to choose next morning between another dumb day of senna tea and gruel
none	none	 supposing she chose to plead that her cold was still obstinate or getting up at half past six to repeat half a page of 
4599-21274-0085	train-other-500	Ince s Outlines of English History
none	none	 in the chilly schoolroom at seven Looking back now as from another world on that unkempt fractious 
4599-21274-0086	train-other-500	Marcie of Cliff House the Marcella of the present saw with a mixture of amusement and self pity that one great
none	none	 aggravation of that child s daily miseries had been a certain injured 
4599-21274-0087	train-other-500	irritable sense of social difference between herself and her companions
none	none	 Some proportion of the girls at Cliff House were drawn from the tradesman class 
4599-21274-0088	train-other-500	of two or three neighbouring towns Their tradesmen papas were sometimes ready to deal on favourable terms with Miss Frederick
none	none	 for the supply of her establishment in which case 
4599-21274-0089	train-other-500	the young ladies concerned evidently felt themselves very much at home
none	none	 and occasionally gave themselves airs which 
4599-21274-0090	train-other-500	alternately mystified and
none	none	 enraged a little spitfire outsider like Marcella Boyce Even at ten years old she perfectly understood that 
4599-21274-0091	train-other-500	she was one of the Boyces of Brookshire
none	none	 and that her 
4599-21274-0092	train-other-500	great uncle had been a famous Speaker of the House of Commons The portrait of this great uncle had hung in the dining room of that pretty London house
4599-21274-0093	train-other-500	which now seemed so far away her father had again and again pointed it out to the child and taught her to be proud of it and more than once her childish eye had been caught
none	none	 by the likeness between it and an old grey haired gentleman 
4599-21274-0094	train-other-500	who occasionally came to see them
none	none	 and whom she called Grandpapa 
4599-21274-0095	train-other-500	Through one influence and another
none	none	 she had drawn the glory of it and the dignity of her race generally into her childish blood 
4599-21274-0096	train-other-500	There they were now the glory and the dignity
none	none	 a feverish leaven 
4599-21274-0097	train-other-500	driving her perpetually into the most crude and ridiculous outbreaks
none	none	 which could lead 
4599-21274-0098	train-other-500	to nothing but humiliation I wish my great uncle were here
none	none	 He d make you remember 
4599-21274-0099	train-other-500	you great you great big bully you
none	none	 she shrieked on one occasion when she had been defying a big girl in authority 
4599-21274-0100	train-other-500	and the big girl the stout and
none	none	 comely daughter of a local ironmonger 
4599-21274-0101	train-other-500	had been successfully asserting herself The big girl opened her eyes wide and laughed Your great uncle Upon my word
none	none	 And who may 
4599-21274-0102	train-other-500	he be miss
none	none	 If it comes to that I d like to show my great uncle David how you ve scratched my wrist He d give it you 
4599-21274-0103	train-other-500	He s almost as strong as father though he is so old You get along with you and behave yourself and don t talk stuff to me Whereupon Marcella
none	none	 choking with rage and tears found herself pushed out of the schoolroom and the door shut upon her 
4599-21274-0104	train-other-500	She rushed up to the top terrace
none	none	 which was the school playground and sat there in a hidden niche of the wall shaking and crying now planning vengeance on her conqueror and now hot all over with the recollection of her own ill bred and impotent folly No during those first two years the only pleasures so memory declared were three the visits of the cake woman on Saturday Marcella sitting in her window could still taste the three cornered puffs and small sweet pears on which as much from a fierce sense of freedom and self assertion as anything else she had 
4599-21274-0105	train-other-500	lavished her tiny weekly allowance the mad games of tig which she led and organised in the top playground and the kindnesses of
none	none	 fat Mademoiselle Renier Miss Frederick s partner who saw a likeness in Marcella to a long dead small sister of her own and surreptitiously indulged the little wild cat as the school generally dubbed the Speaker s great niece whenever she could But with the third year fresh elements and interests had entered in Romance awoke and with it certain sentimental affections 
4599-21274-0106	train-other-500	In the first place a taste for reading had rooted itself reading of the adventurous and poetical kind There were two or three books which Marcella had absorbed in a way it now made her
4599-21274-0107	train-other-500	envious to remember For at twenty one people who take interest in many things and are in a hurry to have opinions
none	none	 must skim and turn over 
4599-21274-0108	train-other-500	books rather than read them must use indeed as best they may a scattered and distracted mind
none	none	 and suffer occasional pangs of conscience 
4599-21274-0109	train-other-500	as pretenders But at thirteen what concentration what devotion what joy One of these
none	none	 precious volumes was Bulwer s Rienzi another was Miss Porter s Scottish Chiefs a third was a little red volume of Marmion which an 
4599-21274-0110	train-other-500	aunt had given her She probably never read any of them through she had not a particle of industry or method in her composition but she lived in them The parts which it
none	none	 bored her to read she easily invented for herself 
4599-21274-0111	train-other-500	but the scenes and passages
none	none	 which thrilled her she knew by heart she had no gift for verse making but she laboriously wrote a long poem on the death of Rienzi and she tried again and again with a not inapt hand to illustrate for herself in pen and ink the execution of Wallace But all these loves for things and ideas were soon as nothing in comparison with a friendship 
4599-21274-0112	train-other-500	and an adoration To take the adoration first
none	none	 When Marcella came to Cliff House she was recommended by the same relation who gave her 
4599-21274-0113	train-other-500	Marmion to the kind offices of the
none	none	 clergyman of the parish 
4599-21274-0114	train-other-500	who happened to be known to some of the Boyce family He and his wife they had no children did their duty
none	none	 amply by the odd undisciplined child 
4599-21274-0115	train-other-500	They asked her to tea once or twice they invited her to the school treat
none	none	 where she was only self conscious and miserably shy and mister Ellerton had at least one friendly and 
4599-21274-0116	train-other-500	pastoral talk with Miss Frederick as to the difficulties of her pupil s character For a long time little came of it Marcella was hard to tame
none	none	 and when she went to tea at the Rectory missus Ellerton who was refined and sensible did not know what to make of her though in some unaccountable way she was drawn to and interested by the child But with the expansion of her thirteenth year there suddenly developed in Marcie s 
4599-21274-0117	train-other-500	stormy breast an overmastering absorbing passion for these two persons
none	none	 She did not show it to them much 
4599-21274-0118	train-other-500	but for herself it raised her to another plane of existence gave her new objects and new standards
none	none	 She who had hated going to church 
4599-21274-0119	train-other-500	now counted time entirely by Sundays To see the
none	none	 pulpit occupied by any other form and face than those of the 
4599-21274-0120	train-other-500	rector was a calamity hardly to be borne if the exit of the school party were delayed by any accident so that mister and missus Ellerton overtook them in the churchyard
none	none	 Marcella would walk home on air quivering with a passionate delight and in the 
4599-21274-0121	train-other-500	dreary afternoon of the school Sunday
none	none	 she would spend her time happily in trying to write down the heads of mister Ellerton s sermon 
4599-21274-0122	train-other-500	In the natural course of things
none	none	 she would at this time 
4599-21274-0123	train-other-500	have taken no interest in such things at all but whatever had been spoken by him had grace
none	none	 thrill

none	none	 and only threatened the usual upstairs seclusion and senna tea for the former whereupon Marcella in alarm declared that her cold was much better and gave up the cough in despair It was her first sorrow and cost her some days of pale brooding and silence and some nights of stifled tears when during an Easter holiday a letter from Miss Frederick to her mother announced the sudden death of Mary Lant CHAPTER II Friendship and love are humanising things and by her fourteenth year Marcella was no longer a clever little imp but a fast maturing and in some ways remarkable girl with much of the woman in her already She had begun even to feel an interest in her dress to speculate occasionally on her appearance At the fourth breaking up party after her arrival at Cliff House Marcella who had usually figured on these occasions in a linsey woolsey high to the throat amid the frilled and sashed splendours of her companions found lying on her bed when she went up with the others to dress a plain white muslin dress with blue ribbons It was the gift of old Mademoiselle Renier who affectionately wished her queer neglected favourite to look well Marcella examined it and fingered it with an excited mixture of feelings First of all there was the sore and swelling bitterness that she should owe such things to the kindness of the French governess whereas finery for the occasion had been freely sent to all the other girls from home She very nearly turned her back upon the bed and its pretty burden But then the mere snowy whiteness of the muslin and freshness of the ribbons and the burning curiosity to see herself decked therein overcame a nature which in the midst of its penury had been always really possessed by a more than common hunger for sensuous beauty and seemliness Marcella wore it was stormily happy in it and kissed Mademoiselle Renier for it at night with an effusion nay some tears which no one at Cliff House had ever witnessed in her before except with the accompaniments of rage and fury A little later her father came to see her the first and only visit he paid to her at school Marcella to whom he was by now almost a stranger received him demurely making no confidences and took him over the house and gardens When he was about to leave her a sudden upswell of paternal sentiment made him ask her if she was happy and if she wanted anything Yes said Marcella her large eyes gleaming tell mamma I want a fringe Every other girl in the school has got one And she pointed disdainfully to her plainly parted hair Her father astonished by her unexpected vehemence put up his eyeglass and studied the child s appearance Three days later by her mother s permission Marcella was taken to the hairdresser at Marswell by Mademoiselle Renier returned in all the glories of a fringe and in acknowledgment thereof wrote her mother a letter which for the first time had something else than formal news in it Meanwhile new destinies were preparing for her For a variety of small reasons mister Boyce who had never yet troubled himself about the matter from a distance was not upon personal inspection very favourably struck with his daughter s surroundings His wife remarked shortly when he complained to her that Marcella seemed to her as well off as the daughter of persons of their means could expect to be But mister Boyce stuck to his point He had just learnt that Harold the only son of his widowed brother Robert of Mellor Park had recently developed a deadly disease which might be long but must in the end be sure If the young man died and he outlived Robert Mellor Park would be his they would and must return in spite of certain obstacles to their natural rank in society and Marcella must of course be produced as his daughter and heiress When his wife repulsed him he went to his eldest sister an old maid with a small income of her own who happened to be staying with them and was the only member of his family with whom he was now on terms She was struck with his remarks which bore on family pride a commodity not always to be reckoned on in the Boyces but which she herself possessed in abundance and when he paused she slowly said that if an ideal school of another type could be found for Marcella she would be responsible for what it might cost over and above the present arrangement Marcella s manners were certainly rough it was difficult to say what she was learning or with whom she was associating accomplishments she appeared to have none Something should certainly be done for her considering the family contingencies But being a strong evangelical the aunt stipulated for religious influences and said she would write to a friend The result was that a month or two later Marcella now close on her fourteenth birthday was transferred from Cliff House to the charge of a lady who managed a small but much sought after school for young ladies at Solesby a watering place on the east coast But when in the course of reminiscence Marcella found herself once more at Solesby memory began to halt and wander to choose another tone and method At Solesby the rough surroundings and primitive teaching of Cliff House together with her own burning sense of inferiority and disadvantage had troubled her no more She was well taught there and developed quickly from the troublesome child into the young lady duly broken in to all social proprieties But it was not her lessons or her dancing masters that she remembered She had made for herself agitations at Cliff House but what were they as compared to the agitations of Solesby Life there had been one long Wertherish romance in which there were few incidents only feelings which were themselves events It contained humiliations and pleasures but they had been all matters of spiritual relation connected with one figure only the figure of her schoolmistress Miss Pemberton and with one emotion only a passion an adoration akin to that she had lavished on the Ellertons but now much more expressive and mature A tall slender woman with brown grey besprinkled hair falling in light curls after the fashion of our grandmothers on either cheek and braided into a classic knot behind the face of a saint an enthusiast eyes overflowing with feeling above a thin firm mouth the mouth of the obstinate saint yet sweet also this delicate significant picture was stamped on Marcella s heart What tremors of fear and joy could she not remember in connection with it what night vigils when a tired girl kept herself through long hours awake that she might see at last the door open and a figure with a night lamp standing an instant in the doorway for Miss Pemberton who slept little and read late never went to rest without softly going the rounds of her pupils rooms What storms of contest mainly provoked by Marcella for the sake of the emotions first of combat then of reconciliation to which they led What a strange development on the pupil s side of a certain histrionic gift a turn for imaginative intrigue for endless small contrivances such as might rouse or heighten the recurrent excitements of feeling What agitated moments of religious talk What golden days in the holidays when long looked for letters arrived full of religious admonition letters which were carried about and wept over till they fell to pieces under the stress of such a worship what terrors and agonies of a stimulated conscience what remorse for sins committed at school what zeal to confess them in letters of a passionate eloquence and what indifference meanwhile to anything of the same sort that might have happened at home Strange faculty that women have for thus lavishing their heart s blood from their very cradles Marcella could hardly look back now in the quiet of thought to her five years with Miss Pemberton without a shiver of agitation Yet now she never saw her It was two years since they parted the school was broken up her idol had gone to India to join a widowed brother It was all over for ever Those precious letters had worn themselves away so too had Marcella s religious feelings she was once more another being But these two years since she had said good bye to Solesby and her school days Once set thinking of bygones by the stimulus of Mellor and its novelty Marcella must needs think too of her London life of all that it had opened to her and meant for her Fresh agitations fresh passions but this time impersonal passions of the mind and sympathies At the time she left Solesby her father and mother were abroad and it was apparently not convenient that she should join them Marcella looking back could not remember that she had ever been much desired at home No doubt she had been often moody and tiresome in the holidays but she suspected nay was certain that there had been other and more permanent reasons why her parents felt her presence with them a burden At any rate when the moment came for her to leave Miss Pemberton her mother wrote from abroad that as Marcella had of late shown decided aptitude both for music and painting it would be well that she should cultivate both gifts for a while more seriously than would be possible at home missus Boyce had made inquiries and was quite willing that her daughter should go for a time to a lady whose address she enclosed and to whom she herself had written a lady who received girl students working at the South Kensington art classes So began an experience as novel as it was strenuous Marcella soon developed all the airs of independence and all the jargon of two professions Working with consuming energy and ambition she pushed her gifts so far as to become at least a very intelligent eager and confident critic of the art of other people which is much But though art stirred and trained her gave her new horizons and new standards it was not in art that she found ultimately the chief excitement and motive power of her new life not in art but in the birth of social and philanthropic ardour the sense of a hitherto unsuspected social power One of her girl friends and fellow students had two brothers in London both at work at South Kensington and living not far from their sister The three were orphans They sprang from a nervous artistic stock and Marcella had never before come near any one capable of crowding so much living into the twenty four hours The two brothers both of them skilful and artistic designers in different lines and hard at work all day were members of a rising Socialist society and spent their evenings almost entirely on various forms of social effort and Socialist propaganda They seemed to Marcella s young eyes absolutely sincere and quite unworldly They lived as workmen and both the luxuries and the charities of the rich were equally odious to them That there could be any right in private property or private wealth had become incredible to them their minds were full of lurid images or resentments drawn from the existing state of London and though one was humorous and handsome the other short sickly and pedantic neither could discuss the Socialist ideal without passion nor hear it attacked without anger And in milder measure their sister who possessed more artistic gift than either of them was like unto them Marcella saw much of these three persons and something of their friends She went with them to Socialist lectures or to the public evenings of the Venturist Society to which the brothers belonged Edie the sister assaulted the imagination of her friend made her read the books of a certain eminent poet and artist once the poet of love and dreamland the idle singer of an empty day now seer and prophet the herald of an age to come in which none shall possess though all shall enjoy The brothers more ambitious attacked her through the reason brought her popular translations and selections from Marx and Lassalle together with each Venturist pamphlet and essay as it appeared they flattered her with technical talk they were full of the importance of women to the new doctrine and the new era The handsome brother was certainly in love with her the other probably Marcella was not in love with either of them but she was deeply interested in all three and for the sickly brother she felt at that time a profound admiration nay reverence which influenced her vitally at a critical moment of life Blessed are the poor Woe unto you rich men these were the only articles of his scanty creed but they were held with a fervour and acted upon with a conviction which our modern religion seldom commands His influence made Marcella a rent collector under a lady friend of his in the East End because of it she worked herself beyond her strength in a joint attempt made by some members of the Venturist Society to organise a Tailoresses Union and to please him she read articles and blue books on Sweating and Overcrowding It was all very moving and very dramatic so too was the persuasion Marcella divined in her friends that she was destined in time with work and experience to great things and high place in the movement The wholly unexpected news of mister Boyce s accession to Mellor had very various effects upon this little band of comrades It revived in Marcella ambitions instincts and tastes wholly different from those of her companions but natural to her by temperament and inheritance The elder brother Anthony Craven always melancholy and suspicious divined her immediately How glad you are to be done with Bohemia he said to her ironically one day when he had just discovered her with the photographs of Mellor about her And how rapidly it works What works she asked him angrily The poison of possession And what a mean end it puts to things A week ago you were all given to causes not your own now how long will it take you to think of us as poor fanatics and to be ashamed you ever knew us You mean to say that I am a mean hypocrite she cried Do you think that because I delight in in pretty things and old associations I must give up all my convictions Shall I find no poor at Mellor no work to do It is unkind unfair It is the way all reform breaks down through mutual distrust He looked at her with a cold smile in his dark sunken eyes and she turned from him indignantly When they bade her good bye at the station she begged them to write to her No no said Louis the handsome younger brother If ever you want us we are there If you write we will answer But you won t need to think about us yet awhile Good bye And he pressed her hand with a smile The good fellow had put all his own dreams and hopes out of sight with a firm hand since the arrival of her great news Indeed Marcella realised in them all that she was renounced Louis and Edith spoke with affection and regret As to Anthony from the moment that he set eyes upon the maid sent to escort her to Mellor and the first class ticket that had been purchased for her Marcella perfectly understood that she had become to him as an enemy They shall see I will show them she said to herself with angry energy as the train whirled her away And her sense of their unwarrantable injustice kept her tense and silent till she was roused to a childish and passionate pleasure by a first sight of the wide lawns and time stained front of Mellor Of such elements such memories of persons things and events was Marcella s reverie by the window made up One thing however which clearly this report of it has not explained is that spirit of energetic discontent with her past in which she had entered on her musings Why such soreness of spirit Her childhood had been pinched and loveless but after all it could well bear comparison with that of many another child of impoverished parents There had been compensations all through and were not the great passion of her Solesby days together with the interest and novelty of her London experience enough to give zest and glow to the whole retrospect Ah but it will be observed that in this sketch of Marcella s schooldays nothing has been said of Marcella s holidays In this omission the narrative has but followed the hasty half conscious gaps and slurs of the girl s own thought For Marcella never thought of those holidays and all that was connected with them in detail if she could possibly avoid it But it was with them in truth and with what they implied that she was so irritably anxious to be done when she first began to be reflective by the window and it was to them she returned with vague but still intense consciousness when the rush of active reminiscence died away That surely was the breakfast bell ringing and with the dignified ancestral sound which was still so novel and attractive to Marcella s ear Recalled to Mellor Park and its circumstances she went thoughtfully downstairs pondering a little on the shallow steps of the beautiful Jacobean staircase Could she ever turn her back upon those holidays Was she not rather so to speak just embarked upon their sequel or second volume But let us go downstairs also CHAPTER III Breakfast was laid in the Chinese room a room which formed part of the stately garden front added to the original structure of the house in the eighteenth century by a Boyce whose wife had money The decorations especially of the domed and vaulted roof were supposed by their eighteenth century designer to be Oriental they were at any rate intricate and overladen and the figures of mandarins on the worn and discoloured wall paper had at least top knots pigtails and petticoats to distinguish them from the ordinary Englishmen of seventeen sixty besides a charming mellowness of colour and general effect bestowed on them by time and dilapidation The marble mantelpiece was elaborately carved in Chinamen and pagodas There were Chinese curiosities of a miscellaneous kind on the tables and the beautiful remains of an Indian carpet underfoot Unluckily some later Boyce had thrust a crudely Gothic sideboard with an arched and pillared front adapted to the purposes of a warming apparatus into the midst of the mandarins which disturbed the general effect But with all its original absurdities and its modern defacements the room was a beautiful and stately one Marcella stepped into it with a slight unconscious straightening of her tall form It seemed to her that she had never breathed easily till now in the ample space of these rooms and gardens Her father and mother were already at table together with missus Boyce s brown spaniel Lynn mister Boyce was employed in ordering about the tall boy in a worn and greasy livery coat who represented the men service of the establishment his wife was talking to her dog but from the lift of her eyebrows and the twitching of her thin lips it was plain to Marcella that her mother was as usual of opinion that her father was behaving foolishly There for goodness sake cut some bread on the sideboard said the angry master and hand it round instead of staring about you like a stuck pig What they taught you at Sir William Jute s I can t conceive I didn t undertake to make a man servant of you sir The pale harassed lad flew at the bread cut it with a vast scattering of crumbs handed it clumsily round and then took glad advantage of a short supply of coffee to bolt from the room to order more Idiot said mister Boyce with an angry frown as he disappeared If you would allow Ann to do her proper parlour work again said his wife blandly you would I think be less annoyed And as I believe William was boot boy at the Jutes it is not surprising that he did not learn waiting I tell you Evelyn that our position demands a man servant was the hot reply None of my family have ever attempted to run this house with women only It would be unseemly unfitting incon Oh I am no judge of course of what a Boyce may do said his wife carelessly I leave that to you and the neighbourhood mister Boyce looked uncomfortable cooled down and presently when the coffee came back asked his wife for a fresh supply in tones from which all bellicosity had for the time departed He was a small and singularly thin man with blue wandering eyes under the blackest possible eyebrows and hair The cheeks were hollow the complexion as yellow as that of the typical Anglo Indian The special character of the mouth was hidden by a fine black moustache but his prevailing expression varied between irritability and a kind of plaintiveness The conspicuous blue eyes were as a rule melancholy but they could be childishly bright and self assertive There was a general air of breeding about Richard Boyce of that air at any rate which our common generalisations connect with the pride of old family his dress was careful and correct to the last detail and his hands with their long fingers were of an excessive delicacy though marred as to beauty by a thinness which nearly amounted to emaciation The servants say they must leave unless the ghost does Marcella said missus Boyce suddenly laying a morsel of toast as she spoke on Lynn s nose Someone from the village of course has been talking the cook says she heard something last night though she will not condescend to particulars and in general it seems to me that you and I may be left before long to do the house work What do they say in the village asked Marcella eagerly Oh they say there was a Boyce two hundred years ago who fled down here from London after doing something he shouldn t I really forget what The sheriff s officers were advancing on the house Their approach displeased him and he put an end to himself at the head of the little staircase leading from the tapestry room down to my sitting room Why did he choose the staircase said missus Boyce with light reflectiveness It won t do said Marcella shaking her head I know the Boyce they mean He was a ruffian but he shot himself in London and any way he was dead long before that staircase was built Dear me how well up you are said her mother Suppose you give a little lecture on the family in the servants hall Though I never knew a ghost yet that was undone by dates There was a satiric detachment in her tone which contrasted sharply with Marcella s amused but sympathetic interest Detachment was perhaps the characteristic note of missus Boyce s manner a curious separateness as it were from all the things and human beings immediately about her Marcella pondered I shall ask mister Harden about the stories she said presently He will have heard them in the village I am going to the church this morning Her mother looked at her a look of quiet examination and smiled The Lady Bountiful airs that Marcella had already assumed during the six weeks she had been in the house entertained missus Boyce exceedingly Harden said mister Boyce catching the name I wish that man would leave me alone What have I got to do with a water supply for the village It will be as much as ever I can manage to keep a water tight roof over our heads during the winter after the way in which Robert has behaved Marcella s cheek flushed The village water supply is a disgrace she said with low emphasis I never saw such a crew of unhealthy wretched looking children in my life as swarm about those cottages We take the rent and we ought to look after them I believe you could be forced to do something papa if the local authority were of any use She looked at him defiantly Nonsense said mister Boyce testily They got along in your Uncle Robert s days and they can get along now Charity indeed Why the state of this house and the pinch for money altogether is enough I should think to take a man s mind Don t you go talking to mister Harden in the way you do Marcella I don t like it and I won t have it You have the interests of your family and your home to think of first Poor starved things said Marcella sarcastically living in such a den And she swept her white hand round as though calling to witness the room in which they sat I tell you said mister Boyce rising and standing before the fire whence he angrily surveyed the handsome daughter who was in truth so little known to him and whose nature and aims during the close contact of the last few weeks had become something of a perplexity and disturbance to him I tell you our great effort the effort of us all must be to keep up the family position our position Look at that library and its condition look at the state of these wall papers look at the garden look at the estate books if it comes to that Why it will be years before even with all my knowledge of affairs I can pull the thing through years missus Boyce gave a slight cough she had pushed back her chair and was alternately studying her husband and daughter They might have been actors performing for her amusement And yet amusement is not precisely the word For that hazel eye with its frequent smile had not a spark of geniality After a time those about her found something scathing in its dry light Now as soon as her husband became aware that she was watching him his look wavered and his mood collapsed He threw her a curious furtive glance and fell silent I suppose mister Harden and his sister remind you of your London Socialist friends Marcella asked missus Boyce lightly in the pause that followed You have I see taken a great liking for them Oh well I don t know said Marcella with a shrug and something of a proud reticence mister Harden is very kind but he doesn t seem to have thought much about things She never talked about her London friends to her mother if she could help it The sentiments of life generally avoided missus Boyce when they could Marcella being all sentiment and impulse was constantly her mother s victim do what she would But in her quiet moments she stood on the defensive So the Socialists are the only people who think said missus Boyce who was now standing by the window pressing her dog s head against her dress as he pushed up against her Well I am sorry for the Hardens They tell me they give all their substance away already and every one says it is going to be a particularly bad winter The living I hear is worth nothing All the same I should wish them to look more cheerful It is the first duty of martyrs Marcella looked at her mother indignantly It seemed to her often that she said the most heartless things imaginable Cheerful she said in a village like this with all the young men drifting off to London and all the well to do people dissenters no one to stand by him no money and no helpers the people always ill wages eleven and twelve shillings a week and only the old wrecks of men left to do the work He might I think expect the people in this house to back him up a little All he asks is that papa should go and satisfy himself with his own eyes as to the difference between our property and Lord Maxwell s Lord Maxwell s cried mister Boyce rousing himself from a state of half melancholy half sleepy reverie by the fire and throwing away his cigarette Lord Maxwell Difference I should think so Thirty thousand a year if he has a penny By the way I wish he would just have the civility to answer my note about those coverts over by Willow Scrubs He had hardly said the words when the door opened to admit William the footman in his usual tremor of nervousness carrying a salver and a note The man says please sir is there any answer sir Well that s odd said mister Boyce his look brightening Here is Lord Maxwell s answer just as I was talking of it His wife turned sharply and watched him take it her lips parted a strange expectancy in her whole attitude He tore it open read it and then threw it angrily under the grate No answer Shut the door The lad retreated mister Boyce sat down and began carefully to put the fire together His thin left hand shook upon his knee There was a moment s pause of complete silence missus Boyce s face might have been seen by a close observer to quiver and then stiffen as she stood in the light of the window a tall and queenly figure in her sweeping black But she said not a word and presently left the room Marcella watched her father Papa was that a note from Lord Maxwell mister Boyce looked round with a start as though surprised that any one was still there It struck Marcella that he looked yellow and shrunken years older than her mother An impulse of tenderness joined with anger and a sudden sick depression she was conscious of them all as she got up and went across to him determined to speak out Her parents were not her friends and did not possess her confidence but her constant separation from them since her childhood had now sometimes the result of giving her the boldness with them that a stranger might have had She had no habitual deference to break through and the hindering restraints of memory though strong were still less strong than they would have been if she had lived with them day by day and year by year and had known their lives in close detail instead of guessing at them as was now so often the case with her Papa is Lord Maxwell s note an uncivil one mister Boyce stooped forward and began to rub his chilly hand over the blaze Why that man s only son and I used to loaf and shoot and play cricket together from morning till night when we were boys Henry Raeburn was a bit older than I and he lent me the gun with which I shot my first rabbit It was in one of the fields over by Soleyhurst just where the two estates join After that we were always companions we used to go out at night with the keepers after poachers we spent hours in the snow watching for wood pigeons we shot that pair of kestrels over the inner hall door in the Windmill Hill fields at least I did I was a better shot than he by that time He didn t like Robert he always wanted me Well papa but what does he say asked Marcella impatiently She laid her hand however as she spoke on her father s shoulder mister Boyce winced and looked up at her He and her mother had originally sent their daughter away from home that they might avoid the daily worry of her awakening curiosities and one of his resolutions in coming to Mellor Park had been to keep up his dignity with her But the sight of her dark face bent upon him softened by a quick and womanly compassion seemed to set free a new impulse in him He writes in the third person if you want to know my dear and refers me to his agent very much as though I were some London grocer who had just bought the place Oh it is quite evident what he means They were here without moving all through June and July and it is now three weeks at least since he and Miss Raeburn came back from Scotland and not a card nor a word from either of them Nor from the Winterbournes nor the Levens Pleasant Well my dear you must make up your mind to it I did think I was fool enough to think that when I came back to the old place my father s old friends would let bygones be bygones I never did them any harm Let them gang their gait confound them the little dark man straightened himself fiercely I can get my pleasure out of the land and as for your mother she d not lift a finger to propitiate one of them In the last words however there was not a fraction of that sympathetic pride which the ear expected but rather fresh bitterness and grievance Marcella stood thinking her mind travelling hither and thither with lightning speed now over the social events of the last six weeks now over incidents of those long past holidays Was this indeed the second volume beginning the natural sequel to those old mysterious histories of shrinking disillusion and repulse What was it you wanted about those coverts papa she asked presently with a quick decision What the deuce does it matter If you want to know I proposed to him to exchange my coverts over by the Scrubs which work in with his shooting for the wood down by the Home Farm It was an exchange made year after year in my father s time When I spoke to the keeper I found it had been allowed to lapse Your uncle let the shooting go to rack and ruin after Harold s death It gave me something to write about and I was determined to know where I stood Well the old Pharisee can go his way I ll go mine And with a spasmodic attempt to play the squire of Mellor on his native heath Richard Boyce rose drew his emaciated frame to its full height and stood looking out drearily to his ancestral lawns a picturesque and elegant figure for all its weakness and pitiableness I shall ask mister Aldous Raeburn about it if I see him in the village to day said Marcella quietly Her father started and looked at her with some attention What have you seen of Aldous Raeburn he inquired I remember hearing that you had come across him Certainly I have come across him I have met him once or twice at the Vicarage and oh on one or two other occasions said Marcella carelessly He has always made himself agreeable mister Harden says his grandfather is devoted to him and will hardly ever let him go away from home He does a great deal for Lord Maxwell now writes for him and helps to manage the estate and next year when the Tories come back and Lord Maxwell is in office again Why of course there ll be plums for the grandson said mister Boyce with a sneer That goes without saying though we are such a virtuous lot Oh yes he ll get on everybody says so And he ll deserve it too she added her eye kindling combatively as she surveyed her father He takes a lot of trouble down here about the cottages and the board of guardians and the farms The Hardens like him very much but he is not exactly popular according to them His manners are sometimes shy and awkward and the poor people think he s proud Ah a prig I dare say like some of his uncles before him said mister Boyce irritably But he was civil to you you say And again he turned a quick considering eye on his daughter Oh dear yes said Marcella with a little proud smile There was a pause then she spoke again I must go off to the church the Hardens have hard work just now with the harvest festival and I promised to take them some flowers Well said her father grudgingly so long as you don t promise anything on my account I tell you I haven t got sixpence to spend on subscriptions to anything or anybody By the way if you see Reynolds anywhere about the drive you can send him to me He and I are going round the Home Farm to pick up a few birds if we can and see what the coverts look like The stock has all run down and the place has been poached to death But he thinks if we take on an extra man in the spring and spend a little on rearing we shall do pretty decently next year The colour leapt to Marcella s cheek as she tied on her hat You will set up another keeper and you won t do anything for the village she cried her black eyes lightening and without another word she opened the French window and walked rapidly away along the terrace leaving her father both angered and amazed A man like Richard Boyce cannot get comfortably through life without a good deal of masquerading in which those in his immediate neighbourhood are expected to join His wife had long since consented to play the game on condition of making it plain the whole time that she was no dupe As to what Marcella s part in the affair might be going to be her father was as yet uneasily in the dark What constantly astonished him as she moved and talked under his eye was the girl s beauty Surely she had been a plain child though a striking one But now she had not only beauty but the air of beauty The self confidence given by the possession of good looks was very evident in her behaviour She was very accomplished too and more clever than was always quite agreeable to a father whose self conceit was one of the few compensations left him by misfortune Such a girl was sure to be admired She would have lovers friends of her own It seemed that already while Lord Maxwell was preparing to insult the father his grandson had discovered that the daughter was handsome Richard Boyce fell into a miserable reverie wherein the Raeburns behaviour and Marcella s unexpected gifts played about equal parts Meanwhile Marcella was gathering flowers in the Cedar garden the most adorable corner of Mellor Park where the original Tudor house grey mullioned and ivy covered ran at right angles into the later garden front which projected beyond it to the south making thereby a sunny and sheltered corner where roses clematis hollyhocks and sunflowers grew with a more lavish height and blossom than elsewhere as though conscious they must do their part in a whole of beauty The grass indeed wanted mowing and the first autumn leaves lay thickly drifted upon it the flowers were untied and untrimmed But under the condition of two gardeners to ten acres of garden nature does very much as she pleases and mister Boyce when he came that way grumbled in vain As for Marcella she was alternately moved to revolt and tenderness by the ragged charm of the old place On the one hand it angered her that anything so plainly meant for beauty and dignity should go so neglected and unkempt On the other if house and gardens had been spick and span like the other houses of the neighbourhood if there had been sound roofs a modern water supply shutters greenhouses and weedless paths in short the general self complacent air of a well kept country house where would have been that thrilling intimate appeal as for something forlornly lovely which the old place so constantly made upon her It seemed to depend even upon her the latest born of all its children to ask for tendance and cherishing even from her She was always planning how with a minimum of money to spend it could be comforted and healed and in the planning had grown in these few weeks to love it as though she had been bred there But this morning Marcella picked her roses and sunflowers in tumult and depression of spirit What was this past which in these new surroundings was like some vainly fled tyrant clutching at them again She energetically decided that the time had come for her to demand the truth Yet of whom Marcella knew very well that to force her mother to any line of action missus Boyce was unwilling to follow was beyond her power And it was not easy to go to her father directly and say Tell me exactly how and why it is that society has turned its back upon you All the same it was due to them all due to herself especially now that she was grown up and at home that she should not be kept in the dark any longer like a baby that she should be put in possession of the facts which after all threatened to stand here at Mellor Park as untowardly in their in her way as they had done in the shabby school and lodging house existence of all those bygone years Perhaps the secret of her impatience was that she did not and could not believe that the facts if faced would turn out to be insurmountable Her instinct told her as she looked back that their relation toward society in the past though full of discomforts and humiliations had not been the relation of outcasts Their poverty and the shifts to which poverty drives people had brought them the disrespect of one class and as to the acquaintances and friends of their own rank what had been mainly shown them had been a sort of cool distaste for their company an insulting readiness to forget the existence of people who had so to speak lost their social bloom and laid themselves open to the contemptuous disapproval or pity of the world Everybody it seemed knew their affairs and knowing them saw no personal advantage and distinction in the Boyces acquaintance but rather the contrary As she put the facts together a little she realised however that the breach had always been deepest between her father and his relations or his oldest friends A little shiver passed through her as she reflected that here in his own country where his history was best known the feeling towards him whatever it rested upon might very probably be strongest Well it was hard upon them hard upon her mother hard upon her In her first ecstasy over the old ancestral house and the dignities of her new position how little she had thought of these things And there they were all the time dogging and thwarting She walked slowly along with her burden of flowers through a laurel path which led straight to the drive and so across it to the little church The church stood all alone there under the great limes of the Park far away from parsonage and village the property it seemed of the big house When Marcella entered the doors on the north and south sides were both standing open for the vicar and his sister had been already at work there and had but gone back to the parsonage for a bit of necessary business meaning to return in half an hour It was the unpretending church of a hamlet girt outside by the humble graves of toiling and forgotten generations and adorned or at any rate diversified within by a group of mural monuments of various styles and dates but all of them bearing in some way or another the name of Boyce conspicuous amongst them a florid cherub crowned tomb in the chancel marking the remains of that Parliamentarian Boyce who fought side by side with Hampden his boyish friend at Chalgrove Field lived to be driven out of Westminster by Colonel Pryde and to spend his later years at Mellor in disgrace first with the Protector and then with the Restoration From these monuments alone a tolerably faithful idea of the Boyce family could have been gathered Clearly not a family of any very great pretensions a race for the most part of frugal upright country gentlemen to be found with scarcely an exception on the side of political liberty and of a Whiggish religion men who had given their sons to die at Quebec and Plassy and Trafalgar for the making of England s Empire who would have voted with Fox but that the terrors of Burke and a dogged sense that the country must be carried on drove them into supporting Pitt who at home dispensed alternate justice and doles and when their wives died put up inscriptions to them intended to bear witness at once to the Latinity of a Boyce s education and the pious strength of his legitimate affections a tedious race perhaps and pig headed tyrannical too here and there but on the whole honourable English stuff the stuff which has made and still in new forms sustains the fabric of a great state Only once was there a break in the uniform character of the monuments a break corresponding to the highest moment of the Boyce fortunes a moment when the respectability of the family rose suddenly into brilliance and the prose of generations broke into a few years of poetry Somewhere in the last century an earlier Richard Boyce went abroad to make the grand tour He was a man of parts the friend of Horace Walpole and of Gray and his introductions opened to him whatever doors he might wish to enter at a time when the upper classes of the leading European nations were far more intimately and familiarly acquainted with each other than they are now He married at Rome an Italian lady of high birth and large fortune Then he brought her home to Mellor where straightway the garden front was built with all its fantastic and beautiful decoration the great avenue was planted pictures began to invade the house and a musical library was collected whereof the innumerable faded volumes bearing each of them the entwined names of Richard and Marcella Boyce had been during the last few weeks mines of delight and curiosity to the Marcella of to day The Italian wife bore her lord two sons and then in early middle life she died much loved and passionately mourned Her tomb bore no long winded panegyric Her name only her parentage and birthplace for she was Italian to the last and her husband loved her the better for it the dates of her birth and death and then two lines from Dante s Vita Nuova The portrait of this earlier Marcella hung still in the room where her music books survived a dark blurred picture by an inferior hand but the Marcella of to day had long since eagerly decided that her own physique and her father s were to be traced to its original as well no doubt as the artistic aptitudes of both aptitudes not hitherto conspicuous in her respectable race In reality however she loved every one of them these Jacobean and Georgian squires with their interminable epitaphs Now as she stood in the church looking about her her flowers lying beside her in a tumbled heap on the chancel step cheerfulness delight nay the indomitable pride and exultation of her youth came back upon her in one great lifting wave The depression of her father s repentances and trepidations fell away she felt herself in her place under the shelter of her forefathers incorporated and redeemed as it were into their guild of honour There were difficulties in her path no doubt but she had her vantage ground and would use it for her own profit and that of others She had no cause for shame and in these days of the developed individual the old solidarity of the family has become injustice and wrong Her mind filled tumultuously with the evidence these last two years had brought her of her natural power over men and things She knew perfectly well that she could do and dare what other girls of her age could never venture that she had fascination resource brain Already in these few weeks Smiles played about her lips as she thought of that quiet grave gentleman of thirty she had been meeting at the Hardens His grandfather might write what he pleased It did not alter the fact that during the last few weeks mister Aldous Raeburn clearly one of the partis most coveted and one of the men most observed in the neighbourhood had taken and shown a very marked interest in mister Boyce s daughter all the more marked because of the reserved manner with which it had to contend No whatever happened she would carve her path make her own way and her parents too At twenty one nothing looks irrevocable A woman s charm a woman s energy should do it all Ay and something else too She looked quickly round the church her mind swelling with the sense of the Cravens injustice and distrust Never could she be more conscious than here on this very spot of mission of an urging call to the service of man In front of her was the Boyces family pew carved and becushioned but behind it stretched bench after bench of plain and humble oak on which the village sat when it came to church Here for the first time had Marcella been brought face to face with the agricultural world as it is no stage ruralism but the bare fact in one of its most pitiful aspects Men of sixty and upwards grey and furrowed like the chalk soil into which they had worked their lives not old as age goes but already the refuse of their generation and paid for at the rate of refuse with no prospect but the workhouse if the grave should be delayed yet quiet impassive resigned now showing a furtive childish amusement if a schoolboy misbehaved or a dog strayed into church now joining with a stolid unconsciousness in the tremendous sayings of the Psalms women coarse or worn or hopeless girls and boys and young children already blanched and emaciated beyond even the normal Londoner from the effects of insanitary cottages bad water and starvation food these figures and types had been a ghastly and quickening revelation to Marcella In London the agricultural labourer of whom she had heard much had been to her as a pawn in the game of discussion Here he was in the flesh and she was called upon to live with him and not only to talk about him Under circumstances of peculiar responsibility too For it was very clear that upon the owner of Mellor depended and had always depended the labourer of Mellor Well she had tried to live with them ever since she came had gone in and out of their cottages in flat horror and amazement at them and their lives and their surroundings alternately pleased and repelled by their cringing now enjoying her position among them with the natural aristocratic instinct of women now grinding her teeth over her father s and uncle s behaviour and the little good she saw any prospect of doing for her new subjects What their friend and champion and ultimately their redeemer too Well and

none	none	Weak women have done greater things in the world As she stood on the chancel step vowing herself to these great things she was conscious of a dramatic moment would not have been sorry perhaps if some admiring eye could have seen and understood her But there was a saving sincerity at the root of her and her strained mood sank naturally into a girlish excitement We shall see We shall see she said aloud and was startled to hear her words quite plainly in the silent church As she spoke she stooped to separate her flowers and see what quantities she had of each But while she did so a sound of distant voices made her raise herself again She walked down the church and stood at the open south door looking and waiting Before her stretched a green field path leading across the park to the village The vicar and his sister were coming along it towards the church both flower laden and beside walked a tall man in a brown shooting suit with his gun in his hand and his dog beside him The excitement in Marcella s eyes leapt up afresh for a moment as she saw the group and then subsided into a luminous and steady glow She waited quietly for them hardly responding to the affectionate signals of the vicar s sister but inwardly she was not quiet at all For the tall man in the brown shooting coat was mister Aldous Raeburn CHAPTER IV How kind of you said the rector s sister enthusiastically but I thought you would come and help us And as Marcella took some of her burdens from her Miss Harden kissed Marcella s cheek with a sort of timid eagerness She had fallen in love with Miss Boyce from the beginning was now just advanced to this privilege of kissing and being entirely convinced that her new friend possessed all virtues and all knowledge found it not difficult to hold that she had been divinely sent to sustain her brother and herself in the disheartening task of civilising Mellor Mary Harden was naturally a short roundly made girl neither pretty nor plain with grey blue eyes a shy manner and a heart all goodness Her brother was like unto her also short round and full faced with the same attractive eyes Both were singularly young in aspect a boy and girl pair Both had the worn pinched look which missus Boyce complained of and which indeed went oddly with their whole physique It was as though creatures built for a normal life of easy give and take with their fellows had fallen upon some unfitting and jarring experience One striking difference indeed there was between them for amid the brother s timidity and sweetness there lay clearly to be felt and seen the consciousness of the priest nascent and immature but already urging and characteristic Only one face of the three showed any other emotion than quick pleasure at the sight of Marcella Boyce Aldous Raeburn was clearly embarrassed thereby Indeed as he laid down his gun outside the low churchyard wall while Marcella and the Hardens were greeting that generally self possessed though modest person was conscious of a quite disabling perturbation of mind Why in the name of all good manners and decency had he allowed himself to be discovered in shooting trim on that particular morning by mister Boyce s daughter on her father s land and within a stone s throw of her father s house Was he not perfectly well aware of the curt note which his grandfather had that morning despatched to the new owner of Mellor Had he not ineffectually tried to delay execution the night before thereby puzzling and half offending his grandfather Had not the incident weighed on him ever since wounding an admiration and sympathy which seemed to have stolen upon him in the dark during these few weeks since he had made Miss Boyce s acquaintance so strong and startling did he all in a moment feel them to be And then to intrude upon her thus out of nothing apparently but sheer moth like incapacity to keep away The church footpath indeed was public property and Miss Harden s burdens had cried aloud to any passing male to help her But why in this neighbourhood at all why not rather on the other side of the county He could have scourged himself on the spot for an unpardonable breach of manners and feeling However Miss Boyce certainly made no sign She received him without any empressement but also without the smallest symptom of offence They all moved into the church together mister Raeburn carrying a vast bundle of ivy and fern the rector and his sister laden with closely packed baskets of cut flowers Everything was laid down on the chancel steps beside Marcella s contribution and then the Hardens began to plan out operations Miss Harden ran over on her fingers the contributions which had been sent in to the rectory or were presently coming over to the church in a hand cart Lord Maxwell has sent the most beautiful pots for the chancel she said with a grateful look at young Raeburn It will be quite a show To which the young rector assented warmly It was very good indeed of Lord Maxwell to remember them always so liberally at times like these when they had so little direct claim upon him They were not his church or his parish but he never forgot them all the same and Mellor was grateful The rector had all his sister s gentle effusiveness but a professional dignity besides even in his thanks which made itself felt Marcella flushed as he was speaking I went to see what I could get in the way of greenhouse things she said in a sudden proud voice But we have nothing There are the houses but there is nothing in them But you shall have all our out of door flowers and I think a good deal might be done with autumn leaves and wild things if you will let me try A speech which brought a flush to mister Raeburn s cheek as he stood in the background and led Mary Harden into an eager asking of Marcella s counsels and an eager praising of her flowers Aldous Raeburn said nothing but his discomfort increased with every moment Why had his grandfather been so officious in this matter of the flowers All very well when Mellor was empty or in the days of a miser and eccentric without womankind like Robert Boyce But now the act began to seem to him offensive a fresh affront offered to an unprotected girl whose quivering sensitive look as she stood talking to the Hardens touched him profoundly Mellor church might almost be regarded as the Boyces private chapel so bound up was it with the family and the house He realised painfully that he ought to be gone yet could not tear himself away Her passionate willingness to spend herself for the place and people she had made her own at first sight checked every now and then by a proud and sore reserve it was too pretty too sad It stung and spurred him as he watched her one moment his foot moved for departure the next he was resolving that somehow or other he must make speech with her excuse explain Ridiculous How was it possible that he should do either He had met her perhaps had tried to meet her tolerably often since their first chance encounter weeks ago in the vicarage drawing room All through there had been on his side the uncomfortable knowledge of his grandfather s antipathy to Richard Boyce and of the social steps to which that antipathy would inevitably lead But Miss Boyce had never shown the smallest consciousness so far of anything untoward or unusual in her position She had been clearly taken up with the interest and pleasure of this new spectacle upon which she had entered The old house its associations its history the beautiful country in which it lay the speech and characteristics of rural labour as compared with that of the town he had heard her talk of all these things with a freshness a human sympathy a freedom from conventional phrase and no doubt a touch of egotism and extravagance which rivetted attention The egotism and extravagance however after a first moment of critical discomfort on his part had not in the end repelled him at all The girl s vivid beauty glorified them made them seem to him a mere special fulness of life So that in his new preoccupation with herself and by contact with her frank self confidence he had almost forgotten her position and his own indirect relation to it Then had come that unlucky note from Mellor his grandfather s prompt reply to it his own ineffective protest and now this tongue tiedness this clumsy intrusion which she must feel to be an indelicacy an outrage Suddenly he heard Miss Harden saying with penitent emphasis I am stupid I have left the scissors and the wire on the table at home we can t get on without them it is really too bad of me I will go for them said Marcella promptly Here is the hand cart just arrived and some people come to help you can t be spared I will be back directly And gathering up her black skirt in a slim white hand she sped down the church and was out of the south door before the Hardens had time to protest or Aldous Raeburn understood what she was doing A vexed word from Miss Harden enlightened him and he went after the fugitive overtaking her just where his gun and dog lay outside the churchyard Let me go Miss Boyce he said as he caught her up My dog and I will run there and back But Marcella hardly looked at him or paused Oh no she said quickly I should like the walk He hesitated then with a flush which altered his usually quiet self contained expression he moved on beside her Allow me to go with you then You are sure to find fresh loads to bring back If it s like our harvest festival the things keep dropping in all day Marcella s eyes were still on the ground I thought you were on your way to shoot mister Raeburn So I was but there is no hurry if I can be useful Both the birds and the keeper can wait Where are you going To some outlying fields of ours on the Windmill Hill There is a tenant there who wants to see me He is a prosy person with a host of grievances I took my gun as a possible means of escape from him Windmill Hill I know the name Oh I remember it was there my father has just been telling me that your father and he shot the pair of kestrels when they were boys together Her tone was quite light but somehow it had an accent an emphasis which made Aldous Raeburn supremely uncomfortable In his disquiet he thought of various things to say but he was not ready nor naturally effusive the turn of them did not please him and he remained silent Meantime Marcella s heart was beating fast She was meditating a coup mister Raeburn Yes Will you think me a very extraordinary person if I ask you a question Your father and mine were great friends weren t they as boys your family and mine were friends altogether I believe so I have always heard so said her companion flushing still redder You knew Uncle Robert Lord Maxwell did Yes as much as anybody knew him but Oh I know he shut himself up and hated his neighbours Still you knew him and papa and your father were boys together Well then if you won t mind telling me I know it s bold to ask but I have reasons why does Lord Maxwell write to papa in the third person and why has your aunt Miss Raeburn never found time in all these weeks to call on mamma She turned and faced him her splendid eyes one challenge The glow and fire of the whole gesture the daring of it and yet the suggestion of womanish weakness in the hand which trembled against her dress and in the twitching lip if it had been fine acting it could not have been more complete And in a sense acting there was in it Marcella s emotions were real but her mind seldom deserted her One half of her was impulsive and passionate the other half looked on and put in finishing touches Acting or no the surprise of her outburst swept the man beside her off his feet He found himself floundering in a sea of excuses not for his relations but for himself He ought never to have intruded it was odious unpardonable he had no business whatever to put himself in her way Would she please understand that it was an accident It should not happen again He quite understood that she could not regard him with friendliness And so on He had never so lost his self possession Meanwhile Marcella s brows contracted She took his excuses as a fresh offence You mean I suppose that I have no right to ask such questions she cried that I am not behaving like a lady as one of your relations would Well I dare say I was not brought up like that I was not brought up at all I have had to make myself So you must avoid me if you like Of course you will But I resolved there in the church that I would make just one effort before everything crystallises to break through If we must live on here hating our neighbours and being cut by them I thought I would just ask you why first There is no one else to ask Hardly anybody has called except the Hardens and a few new people that don t matter And I have nothing to be ashamed of said the girl passionately nor has mamma Papa I suppose did some bad things long ago I have never known I don t know now what they were But I should like to understand Is everybody going to cut us because of that With a great effort Aldous Raeburn pulled himself together certain fine instincts both of race and conduct coming to his help He met her excited look by one which had both dignity and friendliness I will tell you what I can Miss Boyce If you ask me it is right I should You must forgive me if I say anything that hurts you I will try not I will try not he repeated earnestly In the first place I know hardly anything in detail I do not remember that I have ever wished to know But I gather that some years ago when I was still a lad something in mister Boyce s life some financial matters I believe during the time that he was member of Parliament made a scandal and especially among his family and old friends It was the effect upon his old father I think who as you know died soon afterwards Marcella started I didn t know she said quickly Aldous Raeburn s distress grew I really oughtn t to speak of these things he said for I don t know them accurately But I want to answer what you said I do indeed It was that I think chiefly Everybody here respected and loved your grandfather my grandfather did and there was great feeling for him I see I see said Marcella her chest heaving and against papa She walked on quickly hardly seeing where she was going her eyes dim with tears There was a wretched pause Then Aldous Raeburn broke out But after all it is very long ago And there may have been some harsh judgment My grandfather may have been misinformed as to some of the facts And I He hesitated struck with the awkwardness of what he was going to say But Marcella understood him And you will try and make him alter his mind she said not ungratefully but still with a touch of sarcasm in her tone No mister Raeburn I don t think that will succeed They walked on in silence for a little while At last he said turning upon her a face in which she could not but see the true feeling of a just and kindly man I meant that if my grandfather could be led to express himself in a way which mister Boyce could accept even if there were no great friendship as there used to be there might be something better than this this which which is so painful And any way Miss Boyce whatever happens will you let me say this once that there is no word no feeling in this neighbourhood how could there be towards you and your mother but one of respect and admiration Do believe that even if you feel that you can never be friendly towards me and mine again or forget the things I have said Respect and admiration said Marcella wondering and still scornful Pity perhaps There might be that But any way mamma goes with papa She always has done She always will So shall I of course But I am sorry horribly sore and sorry I was so delighted to come here I have been very little at home and understood hardly anything about this worry not how serious it was nor what it meant Oh I am sorry there was so much I wanted to do here if anybody could only understand what it means to me to come to this place They had reached the brow of a little rising ground Just below them beyond a stubble field in which there were a few bent forms of gleaners lay the small scattered Tillage hardly seen amid its trees the curls of its blue smoke ascending steadily on this calm September morning against a great belt of distant beechwood which begirt the hamlet and the common along which it lay The stubble field was a feast of shade and tint of apricots and golds shot with the subtlest purples and browns the flame of the wild cherry leaf and the deeper crimson of the haws made every hedge a wonder the apples gleamed in the cottage garden and a cloudless sun poured down on field and hedge and on the half hidden medley of tiled roofs sharp gables and jutting dormers which made the village Instinctively both stopped Marcella locked her hands behind her in a gesture familiar to her in moments of excitement the light wind blew back her dress in soft eddying folds for the moment in her tall grace she had the air of some young Victory poised upon a height till you looked at her face which was indeed not exultant at all but tragic extravagantly tragic as Aldous Raeburn in his English reserve would perhaps have thought in the case of any woman with tamer eyes and a less winning mouth I don t want to talk about myself she began But you know mister Raeburn you must know what a state of things there is here you know what a disgrace that village is Oh one reads books but I never thought people could actually live like that here in the wide country with room for all It makes me lie awake at night We are not rich we are very poor the house is all out of repair and the estate as of course you know is in a wretched condition But when I see these cottages and the water and the children I ask what right we have to anything we get I had some friends in London who were Socialists and I followed and agreed with them but here one sees Yes indeed it is too great a risk to let the individual alone when all these lives depend upon him Uncle Robert was an eccentric and a miser and look at the death rate of the village look at the children you can see how it has crushed the Hardens already No we have no right to it it ought to be taken from us some day it will be taken from us Aldous Raeburn smiled and was himself again A woman s speculations were easier to deal with than a woman s distress It is not so hopeless as that I think he said kindly The Mellor cottages are in a bad state certainly But you have no idea how soon a little energy and money and thought sets things to rights But we have no money cried Marcella And if he is miserable here my father will have no energy to do anything He will not care what happens He will defy everybody and just spend what he has on himself And it will make me wretched wretched Look at that cottage to the right mister Raeburn It is Jim Hurd s a man who works mainly on the Church Farm when he is in work But he is deformed and not so strong as others The farmers too seem to be cutting down labour everywhere of course I don t understand I am so new to it Hurd and his family had an awful winter last winter hardly kept body and soul together And now he is out of work already the man at the Church Farm turned him off directly after harvest He sees no prospect of getting work by the winter He spends his days tramping to look for it but nothing turns up Last winter they parted with all they could sell This winter it must be the workhouse It s heart breaking And he has a mind he can feel I lend him the Labour paper I take in and get him to talk He has more education than most and oh the bitterness at the bottom of him But not against persons individuals It is like a sort of blind patience when you come to that they make excuses even for Uncle Robert to whom they have paid rent all these years for a cottage which is a crime yes a crime The woman must have been such a pretty creature and refined too She is consumptive of course what else could you expect with that cottage and that food So is the eldest boy a little white atomy And the other children Talk of London I never saw such sickly objects as there are in this village Twelve shillings a week and work about half the year Oh they ought to hate us I try to make them cried Marcella her eyes gleaming They ought to hate all of us landowners and the whole wicked system It keeps them from the land which they ought to be sharing with us it makes one man master instead of all men brothers And who is fit to be master Which of us Everybody is so ready to take the charge of other people s lives and then look at the result Well the result even in rural England is not always so bad said Aldous Raeburn smiling a little but more coldly Marcella glancing at him understood in a moment that she had roused a certain family and class pride in him a pride which was not going to assert itself but none the less implied the sudden opening of a gulf between herself and him In an instant her quick imagination realised herself as the daughter and niece of two discredited members of a great class When she attacked the class or the system the man beside her any man in similar circumstances must naturally think Ah well poor girl Dick Boyce s daughter what can you expect Whereas Aldous Raeburn she thought of the dignity of the Maxwell name of the width of the Maxwell possessions balanced only by the high reputation of the family for honourable just and Christian living whether as amongst themselves or towards their neighbours and dependents A shiver of passionate vanity wrath and longing passed through her as her tall frame stiffened There are model squires of course she said slowly striving at least for a personal dignity which should match his There are plenty of landowners who do their duty as they understand it no one denies that But that does not affect the system the grandson of the best man may be the worst but his one man power remains the same No the time has come for a wider basis Paternal government and charity were very well in their way democratic self government will manage to do without them She flung him a gay quivering defiant look It delighted her to pit these wide and threatening generalisations against the Maxwell power to show the heir of it that she at least father or no father was no hereditary subject of his and bound to no blind admiration of the Maxwell methods and position Aldous Raeburn took her onslaught very calmly smiling frankly back at her indeed all the time Miss Boyce s opinions could hardly matter to him intellectually whatever charm and stimulus he might find in her talk This subject of the duties rights and prospects of his class went as it happened very deep with him too deep for chance discussion What she said if he ever stopped to think of it in itself seemed to him a compound of elements derived partly from her personal history partly from the random opinions that young people of a generous type pick up from newspapers and magazines She had touched his family pride for an instant but only for an instant What he was abidingly conscious of was of a beautiful wild creature struggling with difficulties in which he was somehow himself concerned and out of which in some way or other he was becoming more and more determined absurdly determined to help her Oh no doubt the world will do very well without us some day he said lightly in answer to her tirade no one is indispensable But are you so sure Miss Boyce you believe in your own creed I thought I had observed pardon me for saying it on the two or three occasions we have met some degenerate signs of individualism You take pleasure in the old place you say you were delighted to come and live where your ancestors lived before you you are full of desires to pull these poor people out of the mire in your own way No I don t feel that you are thorough going Marcella paused a frowning moment then broke suddenly into a delightful laugh a laugh of humorous confession which changed her whole look and mood Is that all you have noticed If you wish to know mister Raeburn I love the labourers for touching their hats to me I love the school children for bobbing to me I love my very self ridiculous as you may think it for being Miss Boyce of Mellor Don t say things like that please he interrupted I think I have not deserved them His tone made her repent her gibe No indeed you have been most kind to me she cried I don t know how it is I am bitter and personal in a moment when I don t mean to be Yes you are quite right I am proud of it all If nobody comes to see us and we are left all alone out in the cold I shall still have room enough to be proud in proud of the old house and our few bits of pictures and the family papers and the beeches How absurd it would seem to other people who have so much more But I have had so little so little Her voice had a hungry lingering note And as for the people yes I am proud too that they like me and that already I can influence them Oh I will do my best for them my very best But it will be hard very hard if there is no one to help me She heaved a long sigh In spite of the words what she had said did not seem to be an appeal for his pity Rather there was in it a sweet self dedicating note as of one going sadly alone to a painful task a note which once more left Aldous Raeburn s self restraint tottering She was walking gently beside him her pretty dress trailing lightly over the dry stubble her hand in its white ruffles hanging so close beside him after all her prophetess airs a pensive womanly thing that must surely hear how his strong man s heart was beginning to beat He bent over to her Don t talk of there being no one to help There may be many ways out of present difficulties Meanwhile however things go could you be large minded enough to count one person here your friend She looked up at him Tall as she was he was taller she liked that she liked too the quiet cautious strength of his English expression and bearing She did not think him handsome and she was conscious of no thrill But inwardly her quick dramatising imagination was already constructing her own future and his The ambition to rule leapt in her and the delight in conquest It was with a delicious sense of her own power and of the general fulness of her new life that she said I am large minded enough You have been very kind and I have been very wild and indiscreet But I don t regret I am sure if you can help me you will There was a little pause They were standing at the last gate before the miry village road began and almost in sight of the little vicarage Aldous Raeburn with his hand on the gate suddenly gathered a spray of travellers joy out of the hedge beside him That was a promise I think and I keep the pledge of it he said and with a smile put the cluster of white seed tufts and green leaves into one of the pockets of his shooting jacket Oh don t tie me down said Marcella laughing but flushing also And don t you think mister Raeburn that you might open that gate At least we can t get the scissors and the wire unless you do CHAPTER V The autumn evening was far advanced when Aldous Raeburn after his day s shooting passed again by the gates of Mellor Park on his road home He glanced up the ill kept drive with its fine overhanging limes caught a glimpse to the left of the little church and to the right of the long eastern front of the house lingered a moment to watch the sunset light streaming through the level branches of two distant cedars standing black and sharp against the fiery west and then walked briskly forwards in the mood of a man going as fast as may be to an appointment he both desires and dreads He had given his gun to the keeper who had already sped far ahead of him in the shooting cart which his master had declined His dog a black retriever was at his heels and both dog and man were somewhat weary and stiff with exercise But for the privilege of solitude Aldous Raeburn would at that moment have faced a good deal more than the two miles of extra walking which now lay between him and Maxwell Court About him as he trudged on lay a beautiful world of English woodland After he had passed through the hamlet of Mellor with its three cornered piece of open common and its patches of arable representing the original forest clearing made centuries ago by the primitive fathers of the village in this corner of the Chiltern uplands the beech woods closed thickly round him Beech woods of all kinds from forest slopes where majestic trees grey and soaring pillars of the woodland roof stood in stately isolation on the dead leaf carpet woven by the years about their carved and polished bases to the close plantations of young trees where the saplings crowded on each other and here and there amid the airless tangle of leaf and branch some long pheasant drive cut straight through the green heart of the wood refreshed the seeking eye with its arched and far receding path Two or three times on his walk Aldous heard from far within the trees the sounds of hatchet and turner s wheel which told him he was passing one of the wood cutter s huts that in the hilly parts of this district supply the first simple steps of the chairmaking industry carried on in the little factory towns of the more populous valleys And two or three times also he passed a string of the great timber carts which haunt the Chiltern lanes the patient team of brown horses straining at the weight behind them the vast prostrate trunks rattling in their chains and the smoke from the carters pipes rising slowly into the damp sunset air But for the most part the road along which he walked was utterly forsaken of human kind Nor were there any signs of habitation no cottages no farms He was scarcely more than thirty miles from London yet in this solemn evening glow it would have been hardly possible to find a remoter lonelier nature than that through which he was passing And presently the solitude took a grander note He was nearing the edge of the high upland along which he had been walking In front of him the long road with its gleaming pools bent sharply to the left showing pale and distinct against a darkening heaven and the wide grey fields which had now on one side of his path replaced the serried growth of young plantations Night was fast advancing from south and east over the upland But straight in front of him and on his right the forest trees still flooded with sunset fell in sharp steeps towards the plain Through their straight stems glowed the blues and purples of that lower world and when the slopes broke and opened here and there above the rounded masses of their red and golden leaf the level distances of the plain could be seen stretching away illimitable in the evening dusk to a west of glory just vacant of the sun The golden ball had sunk into the mists awaiting it but the splendour of its last rays was still on all the western front of the hills bathing the beech woods as they rose and fell with the large undulations of the ground Insensibly Raeburn filled as he was with a new and surging emotion drew the solemnity of the forest glades and of the rolling distances into his heart When he reached the point where the road diverged to the left he mounted a little grassy ridge whence he commanded the whole sweep of the hill rampart from north to west and the whole expanse of the low country beneath and there stood gazing for some minutes lost in many thoughts while the night fell He looked over the central plain of England the plain which stretches westward to the Thames and the Berkshire hills and northward through the Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire lowlands to the basin of the Trent An historic plain symbolic all of it to an English eye There in the western distance amid the light filled mists lay Oxford in front of him was the site of Chalgrove Field where Hampden got his clumsy death wound and Thame where he died and far away to his right where the hills swept to the north he could just discern gleaming against the face of the down the vast scoured cross whereby a Saxon king had blazoned his victory over his Danish foes to all the plain beneath Aldous Raeburn was a man to feel these things He had seldom stood on this high point in such an evening calm without the expansion in him of all that was most manly most English most strenuous If it had not been so indeed he must have been singularly dull of soul For the great view had an interest for him personally it could hardly have possessed to the same degree for any other man On his left hand Maxwell Court rose among its woods on the brow of the hill a splendid pile which some day would be his Behind him through all the upland he had just traversed beneath the point where he stood along the sides of the hills and far into the plain stretched the land which also would be his which indeed practically was already his for his grandfather was an old man with a boundless trust in the heir on whom his affections and hopes were centred The dim churches scattered over the immediate plain below the villages clustered round them where dwelt the toilers in these endless fields the farms amid their trees the cottages showing here and there on the fringes of the wood all the equipment and organisation of popular life over an appreciable part of the English midland at his feet depended to an extent hardly to be exaggerated under the conditions of the England of to day upon him upon his one man s brain and conscience the degree of his mental and moral capacity In his first youth of course the thought had often roused a boy s tremulous elation and sense of romance Since his Cambridge days and of late years any more acute or dramatic perception than usual of his lot in life had been wont to bring with it rather a consciousness of weight than of inspiration Sensitive fastidious reflective he was disturbed by remorses and scruples which had never plagued his forefathers During his college days the special circumstances of a great friendship had drawn him into the full tide of a social speculation which as it happened was destined to go deeper with him than with most men The responsibilities of the rich the disadvantages of the poor the relation of the State to the individual of the old Radical dogma of free contract to the thwarting facts of social inequality the Tory ideal of paternal government by the few as compared with the Liberal ideal of self government by the many these commonplaces of economical and political discussion had very early become living and often sore realities in Aldous Raeburn s mind because of the long conflict in him dating from his Cambridge life between the influences of birth and early education and the influences of an admiring and profound affection which had opened to him the gates of a new moral world Towards the close of his first year at Trinity young man joined the college who rapidly became in spite of various practical disadvantages a leader among the best and keenest of his fellows He was poor and held a small scholarship but it was soon plain that his health was not equal to the Tripos routine and that the prizes of the place brilliant as was his intellectual endowment were not for him After an inward struggle of which none perhaps but Aldous Raeburn had any exact knowledge he laid aside his first ambitions and turned himself to another career A couple of hours serious brainwork in the day was all that was ever possible to him henceforward He spent it as well as the thoughts and conversation of his less strenuous moments on the study of history and sociology with a view to joining the staff of lecturers for the manufacturing and country towns which the two great Universities touched by new and popular sympathies were then beginning to organise He came of a stock which promised well for such a pioneer s task His father had been an able factory inspector well known for his share in the inauguration and revision of certain important factory reforms the son inherited a passionate humanity of soul and added to it a magnetic and personal charm which soon made him a remarkable power not only in his own college but among the finer spirits of the University generally He had the gift which enables a man sitting perhaps after dinner in a mixed society of his college contemporaries to lead the way imperceptibly from the casual subjects of the hour the river the dons the schools to arguments of great pith and moment discussions that search the moral and intellectual powers of the men concerned to the utmost without exciting distrust or any but an argumentative opposition Edward Hallin could do this without a pose without a false note nay rather by the natural force of a boyish intensity and simplicity To many a Trinity man in after life the memory of his slight figure and fair head of the eager slightly parted mouth of the eyes glowing with some inward vision and of the gesture with which he would spring up at some critical point to deliver himself standing amid his seated and often dissentient auditors came back vivid and ineffaceable as only youth can make the image of its prophets Upon Aldous Raeburn Edward Hallin produced from the first a deep impression The interests to which Hallin s mind soon became exclusively devoted such as the systematic study of English poverty or of the relation of religion to social life reforms of the land and of the Church overflowed upon Raeburn with a kindling and disturbing force Edward Hallin was his gad fly and he had no resource because he loved his tormentor Fundamentally the two men were widely different Raeburn was a true son of his fathers possessed by natural inheritance of the finer instincts of aristocratic rule including a deep contempt for mob reason and all the vulgarities of popular rhetoric steeped too in a number of subtle prejudices and in a silent but intense pride of family of the nobler sort He followed with disquiet and distrust the quick motions and conclusions of Hallin s intellect Temperament and the Cambridge discipline made him a fastidious thinker and a fine scholar his mind worked slowly yet with a delicate precision and his generally cold manner was the natural protection of feelings which had never yet except in the case of his friendship with Edward Hallin led him to much personal happiness Hallin left Cambridge after a pass degree to become lecturer on industrial and economical questions in the northern English towns Raeburn stayed on a year longer found himself third classic and the winner of a Greek verse prize and then sacrificing the idea of a fellowship returned to Maxwell Court to be his grandfather s companion and helper in the work of the estate his family proposing that after a few years practical experience of the life and occupations of a country gentleman he should enter Parliament and make a career in politics Since then five or six years had passed during which he had learned to know the estate thoroughly and to take his normal share in the business and pleasures of the neighbourhood For the last two years he had been his grandfather s sole agent a poor law guardian and magistrate besides and a member of most of the various committees for social and educational purposes in the county He was a sufficiently keen sportsman to save appearances with his class enjoyed a walk after the partridges indeed with a friend or two as much as most men and played the host at the two or three great battues of the year with a propriety which his grandfather however no longer mistook for enthusiasm There was nothing much to distinguish him from any other able man of his rank His neighbours felt him to be a personality but thought him reserved and difficult he was respected but he was not popular like his grandfather people speculated as to how he would get on in Parliament or whom he was to marry but except to the dwellers in Maxwell Court itself or of late to the farmers and labourers on the estate it would not have mattered much to anybody if he had not been there Nobody ever connected any romantic thought with him There was something in his strong build pale but healthy aquiline face his inconspicuous brown eyes and hair which seemed from the beginning to mark him out as the ordinary earthy dweller in an earthy world Nevertheless these years had been to Aldous Raeburn years marked by an expansion and deepening of the whole man such as few are capable of Edward Hallin s visits to the Court the walking tours which brought the two friends together almost every year in Switzerland or the Highlands the course of a full and intimate correspondence and the various calls made for public purposes by the enthusiast and pioneer upon the pocket and social power of the rich man these things and influences together of course with the pressure of an environing world ever more real and on the whole ever more oppressive as it was better understood had confronted Aldous Raeburn before now with a good many teasing problems of conduct and experience His tastes his sympathies his affinities were all with the old order but the old faiths economical social religious were fermenting within him in different stages of disintegration and reconstruction and his reserved habit and often solitary life tended to scrupulosity and over refinement His future career as a landowner and politician was by no means clear to him One thing only was clear to him that to dogmatise about any subject under heaven at the present day more than the immediate practical occasion absolutely demanded was the act of an idiot So that Aldous Raeburn s moments of reflection had been constantly mixed with struggle of different kinds And the particular point of view where he stood on this September evening had been often associated in his memory with flashes of self realisation which were on the whole more of a torment to him than a joy If he had not been Aldous Raeburn or any other person tied to a particular individuality with a particular place and label in the world the task of the analytic mind in face of the spectacle of what is would have been a more possible one so it had often seemed to him But to night all this cumbering consciousness all these self made doubts and worries had for the moment dropped clean away A transfigured man it was that lingered at the old spot a man once more young divining with enchantment the approach of passion feeling at last through all his being the ecstasy of a self surrender long missed long hungered for Six weeks was it since he had first seen her this tall straight Marcella Boyce He shut his eyes impatiently against the disturbing golds and purples of the sunset and tried to see her again as she had walked beside him across the church fields in that thin black dress with the shadow of the hat across her brow and eyes the small white teeth flashing as she talked and smiled the hand so ready with its gesture so restless so alive What a presence how absorbing troubling preoccupying No one in her company could forget her nay could fail to observe her What ease and daring and yet no hardness with it rather deep on deep of womanly weakness softness passion beneath it all How straight she had flung her questions at him her most awkward embarrassing questions What other woman would have dared such candour unless perhaps as a stroke of fine art he had known women indeed who could have done it so But where could be the art the policy he asked himself indignantly in the sudden outburst of a young girl pleading with her companion s sense of truth and good feeling in behalf of those nearest to her As to her dilemma itself in his excitement he thought of it with nothing but the purest pleasure She had let him see that she did not expect him to be able to do much for her though she was ready to believe him her friend Ah well he drew a long breath For once Raeburn strange compound that he was of the man of rank and the philosopher remembered his own social power and position with an exultant satisfaction No doubt Dick Boyce had misbehaved himself badly the strength of Lord Maxwell s feeling was sufficient proof thereof No doubt the county as Raeburn himself knew in some detail were disposed to leave Mellor Park severely alone What of that Was it for nothing that the Maxwells had been for generations at the head of the county i e of that circle of neighbouring families connected by the ties of ancestral friendship or of intermarriage on whom in this purely agricultural and rural district the social pleasure and comfort of Miss Boyce and her mother must depend He like Marcella did not believe that Richard Boyce s offences were of the quite unpardonable order although owing to a certain absent and preoccupied temper he had never yet taken the trouble to enquire into them in detail As to any real restoration of cordiality between the owner of Mellor and his father s old friends and connections that of course was not to be looked for but there should be decent social recognition and in the case of missus Boyce and her daughter there should be homage and warm welcome simply because she wished it and it was absurd she should not have it Raeburn whose mind was ordinarily destitute of the most elementary capacity for social intrigue began to plot in detail how it should be done He relied first upon winning his grandfather his popular distinguished grandfather whose lightest word had weight in Brookshire And then he himself had two or three women friends in the county not more for women had not occupied much place in his thoughts till now But they were good friends and from the social point of view important He would set them to work at once These things should be chiefly managed by women But no patronage She would never bear that the glancing proud creature She must guess indeed let him tread as delicately as he might that he and others were at work for her But oh she should be softly handled as far as he could achieve it she should in a very little while live and breathe compassed with warm airs of good will and consideration He felt himself happy amazingly happy that at the very beginning of his love it should thus be open to him in these trivial foolish ways to please and befriend her Her social dilemma and discomfort one moment indeed made him sore for her the next they were a kind of joy since it was they gave him this opportunity to put out a strong right arm Everything about her at this moment was divine and lovely to him all the qualities of her rich uneven youth which she had shown in their short intercourse her rashness her impulsiveness her generosity Let her but trust herself to him and she should try her social experiments as she pleased she should plan Utopias and he would be her hodman to build them The man perplexed with too much thinking remembered the girl s innocent ignorant readiness to stamp the world s stuff anew after the forms of her own pitying thought with a positive thirst of sympathy The deep poetry and ideality at the root of him under all the weight of intellectual and critical debate leapt towards her He thought of the rapid talk she had poured out upon him after their compact of friendship in their walk back to the church of her enthusiasm for her Socialist friends and their ideals with a momentary madness of self suppression and tender humility In reality a man like Aldous Raeburn is born to be the judge and touchstone of natures like Marcella Boyce But the illusion of passion may deal as disturbingly with moral rank as with social It was his first love Years before in the vacation before he went to college his boyish mind had been crossed by a fancy for a pretty cousin a little older than himself who had been very kind indeed to Lord Maxwell s heir But then came Cambridge the flow of a new mental life his friendship for Edward Hallin and the beginnings of a moral storm and stress When he and the cousin next met he was quite cold to her She seemed to him a pretty piece of millinery endowed with a trick of parrot phrases She on her part thought him detestable she married shortly afterwards and often spoke to her husband in private of her escape from that queer fellow Aldous Raeburn Since then he had known plenty of pretty and charming women both in London and in the country and had made friends with some of them in his quiet serious way But none of them had roused in him even a passing thrill of passion He had despised himself for it had told himself again and again that he was but half a man Ah he had done himself injustice he had done himself injustice His heart was light as air When at last the sound of a clock striking in the plain roused him with a start and he sprang up from the heap of stones where he had been sitting in the dusk he bent down a moment to give a gay caress to his dog and then trudged off briskly home whistling under the emerging stars CHAPTER VI By the time however that Aldous Raeburn came within sight of the windows of Maxwell Court his first exaltation had sobered down The lover had fallen for the time into the background and the capable serious man of thirty with a considerable experience of the world behind him was perfectly conscious that there were many difficulties in his path He could not induce his grandfather to move in the matter of Richard Boyce without a statement of his own feelings and aims Nor would he have avoided frankness if he could On every ground it was his grandfather s due The Raeburns were reserved towards the rest of the world but amongst themselves there had always been a fine tradition of mutual trust and Lord Maxwell amply deserved that at this particular moment his grandson should maintain it But Raeburn could not and did not flatter himself that his grandfather would to begin with receive his news even with toleration The grim satisfaction with which that note about the shooting had been despatched was very clear in the grandson s memory At the same time it said much for the history of those long years during which the old man and his heir had been left to console each other for the terrible bereavements which had thrown them together that Aldous Raeburn never for an instant feared the kind of violent outburst and opposition that other men in similar circumstances might have looked forward to The just living of a life time makes a man incapable of any mere selfish handling of another s interests a fact on which the bystander may reckon It was quite dark by the time he entered the large open roofed hall of the Court Is his lordship in he asked of a passing footman Yes sir in the library He has been asking for you sir Aldous turned to the right along the fine corridor lighted with Tudor windows to an inner quadrangle and filled with Graeco Roman statuary and sarcophagi which made one of the principal features of the Court The great house was warm and scented and the various open doors which he passed on his way to the library disclosed large fire lit rooms with panelling tapestry pictures books everywhere The colour of the whole was dim and rich antiquity refinement reigned together with an exquisite quiet and order No one was to be seen and not a voice was to be heard but there was no impression of solitude These warm darkly glowing rooms seemed to be waiting for the return of guests just gone out of them not one of them but had an air of cheerful company For once as he walked through it Aldous Raeburn spared the old house an affectionate possessive thought Its size and wealth with all that both implied had often weighed upon him To night his breath quickened as he passed the range of family portraits leading to the library door There was a vacant space here and there room for your missus too my boy when you get her as his grandfather had once put it Why you ve had a long day Aldous all by yourself said Lord Maxwell turning sharply round at the sound of the opening door What s kept you so late His spectacles fell forward as he spoke and the old man shut them in his hand peering at his grandson through the shadows of the room He was sitting by a huge fire an Edinburgh Review open on his knee Lamp and fire light showed a finely carried head with a high wave of snowy hair thrown back a long face delicately sharp in the lines and an attitude instinct with the alertness of an unimpaired bodily vigour The birds were scarce and we followed them a good way said Aldous as he came up to the fire Rickman kept me on the farm too a good while with interminable screeds about the things he wants done for him Oh there is no end to Rickman said Lord Maxwell good humouredly He pays his rent for the amusement of getting it back again Landowning will soon be the most disinterested form of philanthropy known to mankind But I have some news for you Here is a letter from Barton by the second post he named an old friend of his own and a Cabinet Minister of the day Look at it You will see he says they can t possibly carry on beyond January Half their men are becoming unmanageable and S s bill to which they are committed will certainly dish them Parliament will meet in January and he thinks an amendment to the Address will finish it All this confidential of course but he saw no harm in letting me know So now my boy you will have your work cut out for you this winter Two or three evenings a week you ll not get off with less Nobody s plum drops into his mouth nowadays Barton tells me too that he hears young Wharton will certainly stand for the Durnford division and will be down upon us directly He will make himself as disagreeable to us and the Levens as he can that we may be sure of We may be thankful for one small mercy that his mother has departed this life otherwise you and I would have known furens quid femina posset The old man looked up at his grandson with a humorous eye Aldous was standing absently before the fire and did not reply immediately Come come Aldous said Lord Maxwell with a touch of impatience don t overdo the philosopher Though I am getting old the next Government can t deny me a finger in the pie You and I between us will be able to pull through two or three of the things we care about in the next House with ordinary luck It is my firm belief that the next election will give our side the best chance we have had for half a generation Throw up your cap sir The world may be made of green cheese but we have got to live in it Aldous smiled suddenly uncontrollably with a look which left his grandfather staring He had been appealing to the man of maturity standing on the threshold of a possibly considerable career and as he did so it was as though he saw the boy of eighteen reappear Je ne demands pas mieux said Aldous with a quick lift of the voice above its ordinary key The fact is grandfather I have come home with something in my mind very different from politics and you must give me time to change the focus I did not come home as straight as I might for I wanted to be sure of myself before I spoke to you During the last few weeks Go on cried Lord Maxwell But Aldous did not find it easy to go on It suddenly struck him that it was after all absurd that he should be confiding in any one at such a stage and his tongue stumbled But he had gone too far for retreat Lord Maxwell sprang up and seized him by the arms You are in love sir Out with it I have seen the only woman in the world I have ever wished to marry said Aldous flushing but with deliberation Whether she will ever have me I have no idea But I can conceive no greater happiness than to win her And as I want you grandfather to do something for her and for me it seemed to me I had no right to keep my feelings to myself Besides I am not accustomed to to His voice wavered a little You have treated me as more than a son Lord Maxwell pressed his arm affectionately My dear boy But don t keep me on tenterhooks like this tell me the name the name And two or three long meditated possibilities flashed through the old man s mind Aldous replied with a certain slow stiffness Marcella Boyce Richard Boyce s daughter I saw her first six weeks ago God bless my soul exclaimed Lord Maxwell falling back a step or two and staring at his companion Aldous watched him with anxiety You know that fellow s history Aldous Richard Boyce Not in detail If you will tell me now all you know it will be a help Of course I see that you and the neighbourhood mean to cut him and for the sake of of Miss Boyce and her mother I should be glad to find a way out Good heavens said Lord Maxwell beginning to pace the room hands pressed behind him head bent Good heavens what a business what an extraordinary business He stopped short in front of Aldous Where have you been meeting her this young lady At the Hardens sometimes in Mellor village She goes about among the cottages a great deal You have not proposed to her I was not certain of myself till to day Besides it would have been presumption so far She has shown me nothing but the merest friendliness What you can suppose she would refuse you cried Lord Maxwell and could not for the life of him keep the sarcastic intonation out of his voice Aldous s look showed distress You have not seen her grandfather he said quietly Lord Maxwell began to pace again trying to restrain the painful emotion that filled him Of course Aldous had been entrapped the girl had played upon his pity his chivalry for obvious reasons Aldous tried to soothe him to explain but Lord Maxwell hardly listened At last he threw himself into his chair again with a long breath Give me time Aldous give me time The thought of marrying my heir to that man s daughter knocks me over a little There was silence again Then Lord Maxwell looked at his watch with old fashioned precision There is half an hour before dinner Sit down and let us talk this thing out The conversation thus started however was only begun by dinner time was resumed after Miss Raeburn the small shrewd bright eyed person who governed Lord Maxwell s household had withdrawn and was continued in the library some time beyond his lordship s usual retiring hour It was for the most part a monologue on the part of the grandfather broken by occasional words from his companion and for some time Marcella Boyce herself the woman whom Aldous desired to marry was hardly mentioned in it Oppressed and tormented by a surprise which struck or seemed to strike at some of his most cherished ideals and just resentments Lord Maxwell was bent upon letting his grandson know in all their fulness the reasons why no daughter of Richard Boyce could ever be in the true sense fit wife for a Raeburn Aldous was of course perfectly familiar with the creed implied in it all A Maxwell should give himself no airs whatever should indeed feel no pride whatever towards men of goodwill whether peasant professional or noble Such airs or such feeling would be both vulgar and unchristian But when it came to marriage then it behoved him to see that the family that carefully grafted and selected stock to which he owed so much should suffer no loss or deterioration through him Marriage with the fit woman meant for a Raeburn the preservation of a pure blood of a dignified and honourable family habit and moreover the securing to his children such an atmosphere of self respect within and of consideration from without as he had himself grown up in And a woman could not be fit in this sense who came either of an insignificant stock untrained to large uses and opportunities or of a stock which had degenerated and lost its right of equal mating with the vigorous owners of unblemished names Money was of course important and not to be despised but the present Lord Maxwell at any rate large minded and conscious of wealth he could never spend laid comparatively little stress upon it whereas in his old age the other instinct had but grown the stronger with him as the world waxed more democratic and the influence of the great families waned Nor could Aldous pretend to be insensible to such feelings and beliefs Supposing the daughter could be won there was no doubt whatever that Richard Boyce would be a cross and burden to a Raeburn son in law But then After all Love for once made philosophy easy made class tradition sit light Impatience grew a readiness to believe Richard Boyce as black as Erebus and be done with it so that one might get to the point the real point As to the story it came to this In his youth Richard Boyce had been the younger and favourite son of his father He possessed some ability some good looks some manners all of which were wanting in his loutish elder brother Sacrifices were accordingly made for him He was sent to the bar When he stood for Parliament his election expenses were jubilantly paid and his father afterwards maintained him with as generous a hand as the estate could possibly bear often in the teeth of the grudging resentment of Robert his firstborn Richard showed signs of making a rapid success at any rate on the political platform He spoke with facility and grappled with the drudgery of committees during his first two years at Westminster in a way to win him the favourable attention of the Tory whips He had a gift for modern languages and spoke chiefly on foreign affairs so that when an important Eastern Commission had to be appointed in connection with some troubles in the Balkan States his merits and his father s exertions with certain old family friends sufficed to place him upon it The Commission was headed by a remarkable man and was able to do valuable work at a moment of great public interest under the eyes of Europe Its members came back covered with distinction and were much feted through the London season Old mister Boyce came up from Mellor to see Dick s success for himself and his rubicund country gentleman s face and white head might have been observed at many a London party beside the small Italianate physique of his son And love as he is wont came in the wake of fortune A certain fresh west country girl Miss Evelyn Merritt who had shown her stately beauty at one of the earliest drawing rooms of the season fell across mister Richard Boyce at this moment when he was most at ease with the world and the world was giving him every opportunity She was very young as unspoilt as the daffodils of her Somersetshire valleys and her character a character of much complexity and stoical strength was little more known to herself than it was to others She saw Dick Boyce through a mist of romance forgot herself absolutely in idealising him and could have thanked him on her knees when he asked her to marry him Five years of Parliament and marriage followed and then a crash It was a common and sordid story made tragic by the quality of the wife and the disappointment of the father if not by the ruined possibilities of Dick Boyce himself First the desire to maintain a position to make play in society with a pretty wife and in the City with a marketable reputation then company promoting of a more and more doubtful kind and finally a swindle more energetic and less skilful than the rest which bomb like went to pieces in the face of the public filling the air with noise lamentations and unsavoury odours Nor was this all A man has many warnings of ruin and when things were going badly in the stock market Richard Boyce who on his return from the East had been elected by acclamation a member of several fashionable clubs tried to retrieve himself at the gaming table Lastly when money matters at home and abroad when the anxieties of his wife and the altered manners of his acquaintance in and out of the House of Commons grew more than usually disagreeable a certain little chorus girl came upon the scene and served to make both money and repentance scarcer even than they were before No story could be more commonplace or more detestable Ah how well I remember that poor old fellow old John Boyce said Lord Maxwell slowly shaking his stately white head over it as he leant talking and musing against the mantelpiece I saw him the day he came back from the attempt to hush up the company business I met him in the road and could not help pulling up to speak to him I was so sorry for him We had been friends for many years he and I Oh good God he said when he saw me Don t stop me don t speak to me And he lashed his horse up as white as a sheet fat fresh coloured man that he was in general and was off I never saw him again till after his death First came the trial and Dick Boyce got three months imprisonment on a minor count while several others of the precious lot he was mixed up with came in for penal servitude There was some technical flaw in the evidence with regard to him and the clever lawyers they put on made the most of it but we all thought and society thought that Dick was morally as bad as any of them Then the papers got hold of the gambling debts and the woman She made a disturbance at his club I believe during the trial while he was out on bail anyway it all came out Two or three other people were implicated in the gambling business men of good family Altogether it was one of the biggest scandals I remember in my time The old man paused the long frowning face sternly set Aldous gazed at him in silence It was certainly pretty bad worse than he had thought And the wife and child he said presently Oh poor things said Lord Maxwell forgetting everything for the moment but his story when Boyce s imprisonment was up they disappeared with him His constituents held indignation meetings of course He gave up his seat and his father allowed him a small fixed income she had besides some little money of her own which was secured him afterwards I believe on the estate during his brother s lifetime Some of her people would have gladly persuaded her to leave him for his behaviour towards her had been particularly odious and they were afraid too I think that he might come to worse grief yet and make her life unbearable But she wouldn t And she would have no sympathy and no talk I never saw her after the first year of their marriage when she was a most radiant and beautiful creature But by all accounts of her behaviour at the time she must be a remarkable woman One of her family told me that she broke with all of them She would know nobody who would not know him Nor would she take money though they were wretchedly poor and Dick Boyce was not squeamish She went off to little lodgings in the country or abroad with him without a word At the same time it was plain that her life was withered She could make one great effort but according to my informant she had no energy left for anything else not even to take interest in her little girl Aldous made a movement Suppose we talk about her he said rather shortly Lord Maxwell started and recollected himself After a pause he said looking down under his spectacles at his grandson with an expression in which discomfort strove with humour I see You think we are beating about the bush Perhaps we are It is the difference between being old and being young Aldous my boy Well now then for Miss Boyce How much have you seen of her how deep has it gone You can t wonder that I am knocked over To bring that man amongst us Why the hound cried the old man suddenly we could not even get him to come and see his father when he was dying John had lost his memory mostly had forgotten anyway to be angry and just craved for Dick for the only creature he had ever loved With great difficulty I traced the man and tried my utmost No good He came when his father no longer knew him an hour before the end His nerves I understood were delicate not so delicate however as to prevent his being present at the reading of the will I have never forgiven him that cruelty to the old man and never will And Lord Maxwell began to pace the library again by way of working off memory and indignation Aldous watched him rather gloomily They had now been discussing Boyce s criminalities in great detail for a considerable time and nothing else seemed to have any power to touch or at any rate to hold Lord Maxwell s attention A certain deep pride in Aldous the pride of intimate affection felt itself wounded I see that you have grave cause to think badly of her father he said at last rising as he spoke I must think how it concerns me And to morrow you must let me tell you something about her After all she has done none of these things But I ought not to keep you up like this You will remember Clarke was very emphatic about your not exhausting yourself at night last time he was here Lord Maxwell turned and stared Why why what is the matter with you Aldous Offended Well well There I am an old fool And walking up to his grandson he laid an affectionate and rather shaking hand on the younger s shoulder You have a great charge upon you Aldous a charge for the future It has upset me I shall be calmer to morrow But as to any quarrel between us Are you a youth or am I a three tailed bashaw As to money you know I care nothing But it goes against me my boy it goes against me that your wife should bring such a story as that with her into this house I understand said Aldous wincing But you must see her grandfather Only let me say it again don t for one moment take it for granted that she will marry me I never saw any one so free so unspoilt so unconventional His eyes glowed with the pleasure of remembering her looks her tones Lord Maxwell withdrew his hand and shook his head slowly You have a great deal to offer No woman unless she were either foolish or totally unexperienced could overlook that Is she about twenty About twenty Lord Maxwell waited a moment then bending over the fire shrugged his shoulders in mock despair It is evident you are out of love with me Aldous Why I don t know yet whether she is dark or fair The conversation jarred on both sides Aldous made an effort She is very dark he said like her mother in many ways only quite different in colour To me she seems the most beautiful the only beautiful woman I have ever seen I should think she was very clever in some ways and very unformed childish almost in others The Hardens say she has done everything she could of course it isn t much for that miserable village in the time she has been there Oh by the way she is a Socialist She thinks that all we landowners should be done away with Aldous looked round at his grandfather so soon probably to be one of the lights of a Tory Cabinet and laughed So to his relief did Lord Maxwell Well don t let her fall into young Wharton s clutches Aldous or he will be setting her to canvas So she is beautiful and she is clever and good my boy If she comes here she will have to fill your mother s and your grandmother s place Aldous tried to reply once or twice but failed If I did not feel that she were everything in herself to be loved and respected he said at last with some formality I should not long as I do to bring you and her together Silence fell again But instinctively Aldous felt that his grandfather s mood had grown gentler his own task easier He seized on the moment at once In the whole business he said half smiling there is only one thing clear grandfather and that is that if you will you can do me a great service with Miss Boyce Lord Maxwell turned quickly and was all sharp attention the keen commanding eyes under their fine brows absorbing as it were expression and life from the rest of the blanched and wrinkled face You could if you would make matters easy for her and her mother in the county said Aldous anxious to carry it off lightly You could if you would without committing yourself to any personal contact with Boyce himself make it possible for me to bring her here so that you and my aunt might see her and judge The old man s expression darkened What take back that note Aldous I never wrote anything with greater satisfaction in my life Well more or less said Aldous quietly A very little would do it A man in Richard Boyce s position will naturally not claim very much will take what he can get And you mean besides said his grandfather interrupting him that I must send your aunt to call It will hardly be possible to ask Miss Boyce here unless she does said Aldous And you reckon that I am not likely to go to Mellor even to see her And you want me to say a word to other people to the Winterbournes and the Levens for instance Precisely said Aldous Lord Maxwell meditated then rose Let me now appease the memory of Clarke by going to bed Clarke was his lordship s medical attendant and autocrat I must sleep upon this Aldous I only hope I shall not have tired you out Aldous moved to extinguish a lamp standing on a table near Suddenly his grandfather called him Aldous Yes But as no words followed Aldous turned He saw his grandfather standing erect before the fire and was startled by the emotion he instantly perceived in eye and mouth You understand Aldous that for twenty years it is twenty years last month since your father died you have been the blessing of my life Oh don t say anything my boy I don t want any more agitation I have spoken strongly it was hardly possible but that on such a matter I should feel strongly But don t go away misunderstanding me don t imagine for one instant that there is anything in the world that really matters to me in comparison with your happiness and your future The venerable old man wrung the hand he held walked quickly to the door and shut it behind him An hour later Aldous was writing in his own sitting room a room on the first floor at the western corner of the house and commanding by daylight the falling slopes of wood below the Court and all the wide expanses of the plain To night too the blinds were up and the great view drawn in black and pearl streaked with white mists in the ground hollows and overarched by a wide sky holding a haloed moon lay spread before the windows On a clear night Aldous felt himself stifled by blinds and curtains and would often sit late reading and writing with a lamp so screened that it threw light upon his book or paper while not interfering with the full range of his eye over the night world without He secretly believed that human beings see far too little of the night and so lose a host of august or beautiful impressions which might be honestly theirs if they pleased without borrowing or stealing from anybody poet or painter The room was lined with books partly temporary visitors from the great library downstairs partly his old college books and prizes and partly representing small collections for special studies Here were a large number of volumes blue books and pamphlets bearing on the condition of agriculture and the rural poor in England and abroad there were some shelves devoted to general economics and on a little table by the fire lay the recent numbers of various economic journals English and foreign Between the windows stood a small philosophical bookcase the volumes of it full of small reference slips and marked from end to end and on the other side of the room was a revolving book table crowded with miscellaneous volumes of poets critics and novelists mainly however with the first two Aldous Raeburn read few novels and those with a certain impatience His mind was mostly engaged in a slow wrestle with difficult and unmanageable fact and for that transformation and illumination of fact in which the man of idealist temper must sometimes take refuge and comfort he went easily and eagerly to the poets and to natural beauty Hardly any novel writing or reading seemed to him worth while A man he thought might be much better employed than in doing either Above the mantelpiece was his mother s picture the picture of a young woman in a low dress and muslin scarf trivial and empty in point of art yet linked in Aldous s mind with a hundred touching recollections buried all of them in the silence of an unbroken reserve She had died in childbirth when he was nine her baby had died with her and her husband Lord Maxwell s only son and surviving child fell a victim two years later to a deadly form of throat disease one of those ills which come upon strong men by surprise and excite in the dying a sense of helpless wrong which even religious faith can only partially soothe Aldous remembered his mother s death still more his father s that father who could speak no last message to his son could only lie dumb upon his pillows with those eyes full of incommunicable pain and the hand now restlessly seeking now restlessly putting aside the small and trembling hand of the son His boyhood had been spent under the shadow of these events which had aged his grandfather and made him too early realise himself as standing alone in the gap of loss the only hope left to affection and to ambition This premature development amid the most melancholy surroundings of the sense of personal importance not in any egotistical sense but as a sheer matter of fact had robbed a nervous and sensitive temperament of natural stores of gaiety and elasticity which it could ill do without Aldous Raeburn had been too much thought for and too painfully loved But for Edward Hallin he might well have acquiesced at manhood in a certain impaired vitality in the scholar s range of pleasures and the landowner s customary round of duties It was to Edward Hallin he was writing to night for the stress and stir of feeling caused by the events of the day and not least by his grandfather s outburst seemed to put sleep far off On the table before him stood a photograph of Hallin besides a miniature of his mother as a girl He had drawn the miniature closer to him finding sympathy and joy in its youth in the bright expectancy of the eyes and so wrote as it were having both her and his friend in mind and sight To Hallin he had already spoken of Miss Boyce drawing her in light casual and yet sympathetic strokes as the pretty girl in a difficult position whom one would watch with curiosity and some pity To night his letter which should have discussed a home colonisation scheme of Hallin s had but one topic and his pen flew Would you call her beautiful I ask myself again and again trying to put myself behind your eyes She has nothing at any rate in common with the beauties we have down here or with those my aunt bade me admire in London last May The face has a strong Italian look but not Italian of to day Do you remember the Ghirlandajo frescoes in Santa Maria Novella or the side groups in Andrea s frescoes at the Annunziata Among them among the beautiful tall women of them there are I am sure noble freely poised suggestive heads like hers hair black wavy hair folded like hers in large simple lines and faces with the same long subtle curves It is a face of the Renaissance extraordinarily beautiful as it seems to me in colour and expression imperfect in line as the beauty which marks the meeting point between antique perfection and modern character must always be It has morbidezza unquiet melancholy charm then passionate gaiety everything that is most modern grafted on things Greek and old I am told that Burne Jones drew her several times while she was in London with delight It is the most artistic beauty having both the harmonies and the dissonances that a full grown art loves She may be twenty or rather more The mind has all sorts of ability comes to the right conclusion by a divine instinct ignoring the how and why What does such a being want with the drudgery of learning to such keenness life will be master enough Yet she has evidently read a good deal much poetry some scattered political economy some modern socialistic books Matthew Arnold Ruskin Carlyle She takes everything dramatically imaginatively goes straight from it to life and back again Among the young people with whom she made acquaintance while she was boarding in London and working at South Kensington there seem to have been two brothers both artists and both Socialists ardent young fellows giving all their spare time to good works who must have influenced her a great deal She is full of angers and revolts which you would delight in And first of all she is applying herself to her father s wretched village which will keep her hands full A large and passionate humanity plays about her What she says often seems to me foolish in the ear but the inner sense the heart of it command me Stare as you please Ned Only write to me and come down here as soon as you can I can and will hide nothing from you so you will believe me when I say that all is uncertain that I know nothing and though I hope everything may just as well fear everything too But somehow I am another man and the world shines and glows for me by day and night Aldous Raeburn rose from his chair and going to the window stood looking out at the splendour of the autumn moon Marcella moved across the whiteness of the grass her voice was still speaking to his inward ear His lips smiled his heart was in a wild whirl of happiness Then he walked to the table took up his letter read it tore it across and locked the fragments in a drawer Not yet Ned not yet dear old fellow even to you he said to himself as he put out his lamp CHAPTER VII 
5445-21280-0000	train-other-500	Three days passed On the fourth Marcella returned late in the afternoon from a round of parish visits with Mary Harden As she opened the oak doors which shut off the central hall of Mellor from the outer vestibule
5445-21280-0001	train-other-500	she saw something white lying on the old cut and disused billiard table which still occupied the middle of the floor till Richard Boyce in the course of his economies and improvements could replace it by a new one She ran forward and took up a sheaf of cards
5445-21280-0002	train-other-500	turning them over in a smiling excitement
none	none	 Viscount Maxwell 
5445-21280-0003	train-other-500	mister Raeburn Miss Raeburn Lady Winterbourne
none	none	 and the Misses Winterbourne two cards of Lord Winterbourne s all perfectly in form Then a thought flashed upon her Of course it is his doing and I asked him The cards dropped from her hand on the billiard table and she stood looking at them her pride fighting with her pleasure There was something else in her feeling too the exultation of proved power over a person not as she guessed easily influenced especially by women Marcella is that you It was her mother s voice missus Boyce had come in from the garden through the drawing room and was standing at the inner door of the hall 
5445-21280-0004	train-other-500	trying with shortsighted eyes to distinguish her daughter among the shadows of the great bare place A dark day was drawing to its close
none	none	 and there was little light left in the hall except in one corner where a rainy sunset gleam struck a grim contemporary portrait of Mary Tudor 
5445-21280-0005	train-other-500	bringing out the obstinate mouth and the white hand holding a jewelled glove
none	none	 Marcella turned and by the same gleam her mother saw her flushed and animated look 
5445-21280-0006	train-other-500	Any letters she asked No but there are some cards Oh yes there is a note and she pounced upon an envelope she had overlooked It is for you mother
5445-21280-0007	train-other-500	from the Court missus Boyce came up and took note and cards from her daughter s hand Marcella watched her with quick breath Her mother looked through the cards slowly putting them down one by one without remark Oh mother do read the note
5445-21280-0008	train-other-500	Marcella could not help entreating missus Boyce drew herself together with a quick movement as though her daughter jarred upon her and opened the note Marcella dared not look over her
5445-21280-0009	train-other-500	There was a dignity about her mother s lightest action about every movement of her slender fingers and fine fair head which had always held the daughter in check even while she rebelled missus Boyce read it and then handed it to Marcella
5445-21280-0010	train-other-500	I must go and make the tea she said in a light cold tone and turning she went back to the drawing room whither afternoon tea had just been carried Marcella followed reading The note was from Miss Raeburn
5445-21280-0011	train-other-500	and it contained an invitation to missus Boyce and her daughter to take luncheon at the Court on the following Friday The note was courteously and kindly worded We should be so glad said the writer
5445-21280-0012	train-other-500	to show you and Miss Boyce our beautiful woods while they are still at their best in the way of autumn colour How will mamma take it thought Marcella anxiously There is not a word of papa When she entered the drawing room
5445-21280-0013	train-other-500	she caught her mother standing absently at the tea table The little silver caddy was still in her hand as though she had forgotten to put it down and her eyes which evidently saw nothing were turned to the window the brows frowning
5445-21280-0014	train-other-500	The look of suffering for an instant was unmistakable then she started at the sound of Marcella s step and put down the caddy amid the delicate china crowded on the tray with all the quiet precision of her ordinary manner
5445-21280-0015	train-other-500	You will have to wait for your tea she said the water doesn t nearly boil Marcella went up to the fire and kneeling before it put the logs with which it was piled together But she could not contain herself for long
none	none	 Will you go to the Court mamma she asked quickly without turning round There was a pause Then missus Boyce said drily Miss Raeburn s proceedings are a little unexpected We have been here four months 
5445-21280-0016	train-other-500	within two miles of her and it has never occurred to her to call Now she calls and asks us to luncheon in the same afternoon Either she took too little notice of us before
none	none	 or she takes too much now 
5445-21280-0017	train-other-500	don t you think so Marcella was silent a moment Should she confess It began to occur to her for the first time that in her wild independence she had been taking liberties with her mother Mamma Yes
5445-21280-0018	train-other-500	I asked mister Aldous Raeburn the other day whether everybody here was going to cut us Papa told me that Lord Maxwell had written him an uncivil letter and You asked mister Raeburn said missus Boyce quickly What do you mean
5445-21280-0019	train-other-500	Marcella turned round and met the flash of her mother s eyes I couldn t help it she said in a low hurried voice It seemed so horrid to feel everybody standing aloof we were walking together
none	none	 he was very kind and friendly and I asked him to explain I see said missus Boyce And he went to his aunt and she went to Lady Winterbourne they were compassionate and there are the cards You have certainly taken us all in hand Marcella 
5445-21280-0020	train-other-500	Marcella felt an instant s fear fear of the ironic power in the sparkling look so keenly fixed on her offending self she shrank before the proud reserve expressed in every line of her mother s fragile imperious beauty
5445-21280-0021	train-other-500	Then a cry of nature broke from the girl You have got used to it mamma
none	none	 I feel as if it would kill me to live here 
5445-21280-0022	train-other-500	shut off from everybody joining with nobody with no friendly feelings or society It was bad enough in the old lodging house days but here why should we missus Boyce had certainly grown pale
none	none	 I supposed you would ask sooner or later she said in a low determined voice with what to Marcella was a quite new note of reality in it Probably mister Raeburn told you but you must of course have guessed it long ago that society does not look kindly on us and has its reasons I do not deny in the least that it has its reasons I do not accuse anybody and resent nothing 
5445-21280-0023	train-other-500	But the question with me has always been Shall I accept pity I have always been able to meet it with a No You are very different from me but for you also I believe it would be the happiest answer
none	none	 The eyes of both met the mother s full of an indomitable fire which had for once wholly swept away her satiric calm of every day the daughter s troubled and miserable I want friends said Marcella slowly 
5445-21280-0024	train-other-500	There are so many things I want to do here and one can do nothing if every one is against you People would be friends with you and me and with papa too through us Some of them wish to be kind
none	none	 she added insistently 
5445-21280-0025	train-other-500	thinking of Aldous Raeburn s words and expression as he bent to her at the gate I know they do And if we can t hold our heads high because because of things in the past ought we to be so proud
5445-21280-0026	train-other-500	that we won t take their hands when they stretch them out when they write so kindly and nicely as this And she laid her fingers almost piteously on the note upon her knee missus Boyce tilted the silver urn
5445-21280-0027	train-other-500	and replenished the tea pot Then with a delicate handkerchief she rubbed away a spot from the handle of a spoon near her You shall go she said presently you wish it then go go by all means
5445-21280-0028	train-other-500	I will write to Miss Raeburn and send you over in the carriage One can put a great deal on health mine is quite serviceable in the way of excuses
none	none	 I will try and do you no harm Marcella 
5445-21280-0029	train-other-500	If you have chosen your line and wish to make friends here very well I will do what I can for you so long as you do not expect me to change my life for which my dear I am grown too crotchety and too old Marcella looked at her with dismay
5445-21280-0030	train-other-500	and a yearning she had never felt before And you will never go out with me mamma There was something childlike and touching in the voice something which for once suggested the normal filial relation But missus Boyce did not waver
none	none	 She had long learnt perhaps to regard Marcella as a girl singularly well able to take care of herself and had recognised the fact with relief I will not go to the Court with you anyway she said daintily sipping her tea 
5445-21280-0031	train-other-500	in your interests as well as mine You will make all the greater impression my dear for I have really forgotten how to behave Those cards shall be properly returned of course For the rest let no one disturb themselves till they must
5445-21280-0032	train-other-500	And if I were you Marcella I would hardly discuss the family affairs any more with mister Raeburn or anybody else And again her keen glance disconcerted the tall handsome girl whose power over the world about her had never extended to her mother
5445-21280-0033	train-other-500	Marcella flushed and played with the fire You see mamma she said after a moment still looking at the logs and the shower of sparks they made as she moved them about you never let me discuss them with you Heaven forbid
5445-21280-0034	train-other-500	said missus Boyce quickly then after a pause
none	none	 You will find your own line in a little while Marcella 
5445-21280-0035	train-other-500	and you will see if you so choose it that there will be nothing unsurmountable in your way One piece of advice let me give you Don t be too grateful to Miss Raeburn or anybody else
5445-21280-0036	train-other-500	You take great interest in your Boyce belongings I perceive You may remember too perhaps that there is other blood in you and that no Merritt has ever submitted quietly to either patronage or pity Marcella started
none	none	 Her mother had never named her own kindred to her before that she could remember She had known for many years that there was a breach between the Merritts and themselves The newspapers had told her something at intervals of her Merritt relations for they were fashionable and important folk 
5445-21280-0037	train-other-500	but no one of them had crossed the Boyces threshold since the old London days wherein Marcella could still dimly remember the tall forms of certain Merritt uncles and even a stately lady in a white cap whom she knew to have been her mother s mother
5445-21280-0038	train-other-500	The stately lady had died while she was still a child at her first school she could recollect her own mourning frock but that was almost the last personal remembrance she had connected with the Merritts
5445-21280-0039	train-other-500	And now this note of intense personal and family pride under which missus Boyce s voice had for the first time quivered a little Marcella had never heard it before and it thrilled her
none	none	 She sat on by the fire drinking her tea and every now and then watching her companion with a new and painful curiosity The tacit assumption of many years with her had been that her mother was a dry limited person clever and determined in small ways that affected her own family but on the whole characterless as compared with other people of strong feelings and responsive susceptibilities But her own character had been rapidly maturing of late and her insight sharpening During these recent weeks of close contact her mother s singularity had risen in her mind to the dignity at least of a problem an enigma Presently missus Boyce rose and put the scones down by the fire Your father will be in I suppose Yes I hear the front door As she spoke she took off her velvet cloak put it carefully aside on a sofa and sat down again still in her bonnet at the tea table Her dress was very different from Marcella s which when they were not in mourning was in general of the ample aesthetic type and gave her a good deal of trouble out of doors Marcella wore art serges and velveteens missus Boyce attired herself in soft and costly silks generally black closely and fashionably made and completed by various fanciful and distinguished trifles rings an old chatelaine a diamond brooch which Marcella remembered the same and worn in the same way since her childhood missus Boyce however wore her clothes so daintily and took such scrupulous and ingenious care of them that her dress cost in truth extremely little certainly less than Marcella s There were sounds first of footsteps in the hall then of some scolding of William and finally mister Boyce entered tired and splashed from shooting and evidently in a bad temper Well what are you going to do about those cards he asked his wife abruptly when she had supplied him with tea and he was beginning to dry by the fire He was feeling ill and reckless too tired anyway to trouble himself to keep up appearances with Marcella Return them said missus Boyce calmly blowing out the flame of her silver kettle I don t want any of their precious society he said irritably They should have done their calling long ago There s no grace in it now I don t know that one isn t inclined to think it an intrusion But the women were silent Marcella s attention was diverted from her mother to the father s small dark head and thin face There was a great repulsion and impatience in her heart an angry straining against circumstance and fate yet at the same time a mounting voice of natural affection an understanding at once sad and new which paralysed and silenced her He stood in her way terribly in her way and yet it strangely seemed to her that never before till these last few weeks had she felt herself a daughter You are very wet papa she said to him as she took his cup don t you think you had better go at once and change I m all right he said shortly as right as I m likely to be anyway As for the shooting it s nothing but waste of time and shoe leather I shan t go out any more The place has been clean swept by some of those brutes in the village your friends Marcella By the way Evelyn I came across young Wharton in the road just now Wharton said his wife interrogatively I don t remember ought I Why the Liberal candidate for the division of course he said testily I wish you would inform yourself of what goes on He is working like a horse he tells me Dodgson the Raeburns candidate has got a great start this young man will want all his time to catch him up I like him I won t vote for him but I ll see fair play I ve asked him to come to tea here on Saturday Evelyn He ll be back again by the end of the week He stays at Dell s farm when he comes pretty bad accommodation I should think We must show him some civility He rose and stood with his back to the fire his spare frame stiffening under his nervous determination to assert himself to hold up his head physically and morally against those who would repress him Richard Boyce took his social punishment badly He had passed his first weeks at Mellor in a tremble of desire that his father s old family and country friends should recognise him again and condone his irregularities All sorts of conciliatory ideas had passed through his head He meant to let people see that he would be a good neighbour if they would give him the chance not like that miserly fool his brother Robert The past was so much past who now was more respectable or more well intentioned than he He was an impressionable imaginative man in delicate health and the tears sometimes came into his eyes as he pictured himself restored to society partly by his own efforts partly no doubt by the charms and good looks of his wife and daughter forgiven for their sake and for the sake also of that store of virtue he had so laboriously accumulated since that long past catastrophe Would not most men have gone to the bad altogether after such a lapse He on the contrary had recovered himself had neither drunk nor squandered nor deserted his wife and child These things if the truth were known were indeed due rather to a certain lack of physical energy and vitality which age had developed in him than to self conquest but he was no doubt entitled to make the most of them There were signs indeed that his forecast had been not at all unreasonable His womenkind were making their way At the very moment when Lord Maxwell had written him a quelling letter he had become aware that Marcella was on good terms with Lord Maxwell s heir Had he not also been stopped that morning in a remote lane by Lord Winterbourne and Lord Maxwell on their way back from the meet and had not both recognised and shaken hands with him And now there were these cards Unfortunately in spite of Raeburn s opinion to the contrary no man in such a position and with such a temperament ever gets something without claiming more and more than he can conceivably or possibly get Startled and pleased at first by the salutation which Lord Maxwell and his companion had bestowed upon him Richard Boyce had passed his afternoon in resenting and brooding over the cold civility of it So these were the terms he was to be on with them the deuce take them and their pharisaical airs If all the truth were known most men would look foolish and the men who thanked God that they were not as other men soonest of all He wished he had not been taken by surprise he wished he had not answered them he would show them in the future that he would eat no dirt for them or anybody else So on the way home there had been a particular zest in his chance encounter with the young man who was likely to give the Raeburns and their candidate so all the world said a very great deal of trouble The seat had been held to be an entirely safe one for the Maxwell nominee Young Wharton on the contrary was making way every day and what with securing Aldous s own seat in the next division and helping old Dodgson in this Lord Maxwell and his grandson had their hands full Dick Boyce was glad of it He was a Tory but all the same he wished every success to this handsome agreeable young man whose deferential manners to him at the end of the day had come like ointment to a wound The three sat on together for a little while in silence Marcella kept her seat by the fire on the old gilt fenderstool conscious in a dreamlike way of the room in front of her the stately room with its stucco ceiling its tall windows its Prussian blue wall paper behind the old cabinets and faded pictures and the chair covers in Turkey red twill against the blue which still remained to bear witness at once to the domestic economies and the decorative ideas of old Robert Boyce conscious also of the figures on either side of her and of her own quick beating youth betwixt them She was sore and unhappy yet on the whole what she was thinking most about was Aldous Raeburn What had he said to Lord Maxwell and to the Winterbournes She wished she could know She wished with leaping pulse that she could see him again quickly Yet it would be awkward too Presently she got up and went away to take off her things As the door closed behind her missus Boyce held out Miss Raeburn s note which Marcella had returned to her to her husband They have asked Marcella and me to lunch she said I am not going but I shall send her He read the note by the firelight and it produced the most contradictory effects upon him Why don t you go he asked her aggressively rousing himself for a moment to attack her and so vent some of his ill humour I have lost the habit of going out she said quietly and am too old to begin again What you mean to say he asked her angrily raising his voice that you have never meant to do your duties here the duties of your position I did not foresee many outside this house and land Why should we change our ways We have done very well of late I have no mind to risk what I have got He glanced round at her in a quick nervous way and then looked back again at the fire The sight of her delicate blanched face had in some respects a more and more poignant power with him as the years went on His anger sank into moroseness Then why do you let Marcella go What good will it do her to go about without her parents People will only despise her for a girl of no spirit as they ought It depends upon how it is done I can arrange it I think said missus Boyce A woman has always convenient limitations to plead in the way of health She need never give offence if she has decent wits It will be understood that I do not go out and then someone Miss Raeburn or Lady Winterbourne will take up Marcella and mother her She spoke with her usual light gentleness but he was not appeased If you were to talk of my health it would be more to the purpose he said with grim inconsequence And raising his heavy lids he looked at her full She got up and went over to him Do you feel worse again Why will you not change your things directly you come in Would you like doctor Clarke sent for She was standing close beside him her beautiful hand for which in their young days it had pleased his pride to give her rings almost touched him A passionate hunger leapt within him She would stoop and kiss him if he asked her he knew that But he would not ask her he did not want it he wanted something that never on this earth would she give him again Then moral discomfort lost itself in physical Clarke does me no good not an atom he said rising There don t you come I Can look after myself He went and missus Boyce remained alone in the great fire lit room She put her hands on the mantelpiece and dropped her head upon them and so stood silent for long There was no sound audible in the room or from the house outside And in the silence a proud and broken heart once more nerved itself to an endurance that brought it peace with neither man nor God I shall go for all our sakes thought Marcella as she stood late that night brushing her hair before her dimly lighted and rickety dressing table We have it seems no right to be proud A rush of pain and bitterness filled her heart pain new born and insistent for her mother her father and herself Ever since Aldous Raeburn s hesitating revelations she had been liable to this sudden invasion of a hot and shamed misery And to night after her talk with her mother it could not but overtake her afresh But her strong personality her passionate sense of a moral independence not to be undone by the acts of another even a father made her soon impatient of her own distress and she flung it from her with decision No we have no right to be proud she repeated to herself It must be all true what mister Raeburn said probably a great deal more Poor poor mamma But all the same there is nothing to be got out of empty quarrelling and standing alone And it was so long ago Her hand fell and she stood absently looking at her own black and white reflection in the old flawed glass She was thinking of course of mister Raeburn He had been very prompt in her service There could be no question but that he was specially interested in her And he was not a man to be lightly played upon nay rather a singularly reserved and scrupulous person So at least it had been always held concerning him Marcella was triumphantly conscious that he had not from the beginning given her much trouble But the common report of him made his recent manner towards her this last action of his the more significant Even the Hardens so Marcella gathered from her friend and admirer Mary unworldly dreamy folk wrapt up in good works and in the hastening of Christ s kingdom were on the alert and beginning to take note It was not as though he were in the dark as to her antecedents He knew all at any rate more than she did and yet it might end in his asking her to marry him What then Scarcely a quiver in the young form before the glass Love at such a thought must have sunk upon its knees and hid its face for tender humbleness and requital Marcella only looked quietly at the beauty which might easily prove to be so important an arrow in her quiver What was stirring in her was really a passionate ambition ambition to be the queen and arbitress of human lives to be believed in by her friends to make a mark for herself among women and to make it in the most romantic and yet natural way without what had always seemed to her the sordid and unpleasant drudgeries of the platform of a tiresome company operation with or subordination to others who could not understand your ideas Of course if it happened people would say that she had tried to capture Aldous Raeburn for his money and position s sake Let them say it People with base minds must think basely there was no help for it Those whom she would make her friends would know very well for what purpose she wanted money power and the support of such a man and such a marriage Her modern realism played with the thought quite freely her maidenliness proud and pure as it was being nowise ashamed Oh for something to carry her deep into life into the heart of its widest and most splendid opportunities She threw up her hands clasping them above her head amid her clouds of curly hair a girlish excited gesture I could revive the straw plaiting give them better teaching and better models The cottages should be rebuilt Papa would willingly hand the village over to me if I found the money We would have a parish committee to deal with the charities oh the Hardens would come in The old people should have their pensions as of right No hopeless old age no cringing dependence We would try company operation on the land and pull it through And not in Mellor only One might be the ruler the regenerator of half a county Memory brought to mind in vivid sequence the figures and incidents of the afternoon of her village round with Mary Harden As the eyes of servants towards the hand of their mistress the old words occurred to her as she thought of herself stepping in and out of the cottages Then she was ashamed of herself and rejected the image with vehemence Dependence was the curse of the poor Her whole aim of course should be to teach them to stand on their own feet to know themselves as men But naturally they would be grateful they would let themselves be led Intelligence and enthusiasm give power and ought to give it power for good No doubt under Socialism there will be less scope for either because there will be less need But Socialism as a system will not come in our generation What we have to think for is the transition period The Cravens had never seen that but Marcella saw it She began to feel herself a person of larger experience than they As she undressed it seemed to her as though she still felt the clinging hands of the Hurd children round her knees and through them symbolised by them the suppliant touch of hundreds of other helpless creatures She was just dropping to sleep when her own words to Aldous Raeburn flashed across her Everybody is so ready to take charge of other people s lives and look at the result She must needs laugh at herself but it made little matter She fell asleep cradled in dreams Aldous Raeburn s final part in them was not great CHAPTER VIII missus Boyce wrote her note to Miss Raeburn a note containing cold though civil excuses as to herself while accepting the invitation for Marcella who should be sent to the Court either in the carriage or under the escort of a maid who could bring her back Marcella found her mother inclined to insist punctiliously on conventions of this kind It amused her in submitting to them to remember the free and easy ways of her London life But she submitted and not unwillingly On the afternoon of the day which intervened between the Maxwells call and her introduction to the Court Marcella walked as usual down to the village She was teeming with plans for her new kingdom and could not keep herself out of it And an entry in one of the local papers had suggested to her that Hurd might possibly find work in a parish some miles from Mellor She must go and send him off there When missus Hurd opened the door to her Marcella was astonished to perceive behind her the forms of several other persons filling up the narrow space of the usually solitary cottage in fact a tea party Oh come in miss said missus Hurd with some embarrassment as though it occurred to her that her visitor might legitimately wonder to find a person of her penury entertaining company Then lowering her voice she hurriedly explained There s missus Brunt come in this afternoon to help me wi the washin while I finished my score of plait for the woman who takes em into town to morrow And there s old Patton an his wife you know em miss them as lives in the parish houses top o the common He s walked out a few steps to day It s not often he s able and when I see him through the door I said to em if you ll come in an take a cheer I dessay them tea leaves ull stan another wettin I haven t got nothink else And there s missus Jellison she came in along o the Pattons You can t say her no she s a queer one Do you know her miss Oh bless yer yes yes She knows me said a high jocular voice making missus Hurd start she couldn t be long hereabouts without makkin eeaste to know me You coom in miss We re not afraid o you Lor bless you missus Hurd stood aside for her visitor to pass in looking round her the while in some perplexity to see whether there was a spare chair and room to place it She was a delicate willowy woman still young in figure with a fresh colour belied by the grey circles under the eyes and the pinched sharpness of the features The upper lip which was pretty and childish was raised a little over the teeth the whole expression of the slightly open mouth was unusually soft and sensitive On the whole Minta Hurd was liked in the village though she was thought a trifle fine The whole family indeed kept theirsels to theirsels and to find missus Hurd with company was unusual Her name of course was short for Araminta

none	none	as she caught missus Jellison s remarks and made her way in delighted For the present these village people affected her like figures in poetry or drama She saw them with the eye of the imagination through a medium provided by Socialist discussion or by certain phases of modern art and the little scene of missus Hurd s tea party took for her in an instant the dramatic zest and glamour Look here missus Jellison she said going up to her I was just going to leave these apples for your grandson Perhaps you ll take them now you re here They re quite sweet though they look green They re the best we ve got the gardener says Oh they are are they said missus Jellison composedly looking up at her Well put em down miss I dare say he ll eat em He eats most things and don t want no doctor s stuff nayther though his mother do keep on at me for spoilin his stummuck You are just fond of that boy aren t you missus Jellison said Marcella taking a wooden stool the only piece of furniture left in the tiny cottage on which it was possible to sit and squeezing herself into a corner by the fire whence she commanded the whole group No don t you turn mister Patton out of that chair missus Hurd or I shall have to go away For missus Hurd in her anxiety was whispering in old Patton s ear that it might be well for him to give up her one wooden arm chair in which he was established to Miss Boyce But he being old deaf and rheumatic was slow to move and Marcella s peremptory gesture bade her leave him in peace Well it s you that s the young un ain t it miss said missus Jellison cheerfully Poor old Patton he do get slow on his legs don t you Patton But there there s no helping it when you re turned of eighty And she turned upon him a bright philosophic eye being herself a young thing not much over seventy and energetic accordingly missus Jellison passed for the village wit and was at least talkative and excitable beyond her fellows Well you don t seem to mind getting old missus Jellison said Marcella smiling at her The eyes of all the old people round their tea table were by now drawn irresistibly to Miss Boyce in the chimney corner to her slim grace and the splendour of her large black hat and feathers The new squire s daughter had so far taken them by surprise Some of them however were by now in the second stage of critical observation none the less critical because furtive and inarticulate Ah said missus Jellison interrogatively with a high long drawn note peculiar to her Well I ve never found you get forrarder wi snarlin over what you can t help And there s mercies When you ve had a husband in his bed for fower year miss and he s took at last you ll know She nodded emphatically Marcella laughed I know you were very fond of him missus Jellison and looked after him very well too Oh I don t say nothin about that said missus Jellison hastily But all the same you kin reckon it up and see for yoursen Fower year an fire upstairs an fire downstairs an fire all night an soomthin allus wanted An he such an objeck afore he died It do seem like a holiday now to sit a bit And she crossed her hands on her lap with a long breath of content A lock of grey hair had escaped from her bonnet across her wrinkled forehead and gave her a half careless rakish air Her youth of long ago a youth of mad spirits and of an extraordinary capacity for physical enjoyment seemed at times to pierce to the surface again even through her load of years But in general she had a dreamy sunny look as of one fed with humorous fancies but disinclined often to the trouble of communicating them Well I missed my daughter I kin tell you said missus Brunt with a sigh though she took a deal more lookin after nor your good man missus Jellison missus Brunt was a gentle pretty old woman who lived in another of the village almshouses next door to the Pattons and was always ready to help her neighbours in their domestic toils Her last remaining daughter the victim of a horrible spinal disease had died some nine or ten months before the Boyces arrived at Mellor Marcella had already heard the story several times but it was part of her social gift that she was a good listener to such things even at the twentieth hearing You wouldn t have her back though she said gently turning towards the speaker No I wouldn t have her back miss said missus Brunt raising her hand to brush away a tear partly the result of feeling partly of a long established habit But I do miss her nights terrible Mother ain t it ten o clock mother look at the clock do mother ain t it time for my stuff mother oh I do hope it is That was her stuff miss to make her sleep And when she d got it she d groan you d think she couldn t be asleep and yet she was dead like for two hours I didn t get no rest with her and now I don t seem to get no rest without her And again missus Brunt put her hand up to her eyes Ah you were allus one for toilin an frettin said missus Jellison calmly A body must get through wi it when it s there but I don t hold wi thinkin about it when it s done I know one said old Patton slily that fretted about her darter when it didn t do her no good He had not spoken so far but had sat with his hands on his stick a spectator of the women s humours He was a little hunched man twisted and bent double with rheumatic gout the fruit of seventy years of field work His small face was almost lost dog like under shaggy hair and overgrown eyebrows both snow white He had a look of irritable eagerness seldom however expressed in words A sudden passion in the faded blue eyes a quick spot of red in his old cheeks these Marcella had often noticed in him as though the flame of some inner furnace leapt He had been a Radical and a rebel once in old rick burning days long before he lost the power in his limbs and came down to be thankful for one of the parish almshouses To his social betters he was now a quiet and peaceable old man well aware of the cakes and ale to be got by good manners but in the depths of him there were reminiscences and the ghosts of passions which were still stirred sometimes by causes not always intelligible to the bystander He had rarely however physical energy enough to bring any emotion even of mere worry at his physical ills to the birth The pathetic silence of age enwrapped him more and more Still he could gibe the women sometimes especially missus Jellison who was in general too clever for her company Oh you may talk Patton said missus Jellison with a little flash of excitement You do like to have your talk don t you Well I dare say I was orkard with Isabella I won t go for to say I wasn t orkard for I was She should ha used me to t before if she wor took that way She and I had just settled down comfortable after my old man went and I didn t see no sense in it an I don t now She might ha let the men alone She d seen enough o the worrit ov em Well she did well for hersen said missus Brunt with the same gentle melancholy She married a stiddy man as ull keep her well all her time and never let her want for nothink A sour wooden faced chap as iver I knew said missus Jellison grudgingly I don t have nothink to say to him nor he to me He thinks hissen the Grand Turk he do since they gi en him his uniform and made him full keeper A nassty domineerin sort I calls him He s allus makin bad blood wi the yoong fellers when he don t need It s the way he s got wi im But I don t make no account of im an I let im see t All the tea party grinned except missus Hurd The village was well acquainted with the feud between missus Jellison and her son in law George Westall who had persuaded Isabella Jellison at the mature age of thirty five to leave her mother and marry him and was now one of Lord Maxwell s keepers with good pay and an

none	none	cottage some little way out of the village missus Jellison had never forgiven her daughter for deserting her and was on lively terms of hostility with her son in law but their only child little Johnnie had found the soft spot in his grandmother and her favourite excitement in life now that he was four years old was to steal him from his parents and feed him on the things of which Isabella most vigorously disapproved missus Hurd as has been said did not smile At the mention of Westall she got up hastily and began to put away the tea things Marcella meanwhile had been sitting thoughtful You say Westall makes bad blood with the young men missus Jellison she said looking up Is there much poaching in this village now do you think There was a dead silence missus Hurd was at the other end of the cottage with her back to Marcella at the question her hands paused an instant in their work The eyes of all the old people of Patton and his wife of missus Jellison and pretty missus Brunt were fixed on the speaker but nobody said a word not even missus Jellison Marcella coloured Oh you needn t suppose she said throwing her beautiful head back you needn t suppose that I care about the game or that I would ever be mean enough to tell anything that was told me I know it does cause a great deal of quarrelling and bad blood I believe it does here and I should like to know more about it I want to make up my mind what to think Of course my father has got his land and his own opinions And Lord Maxwell has too But I am not bound to think like either of them I should like you to understand that It seems to me right about all such things that people should enquire and find out for themselves Still silence missus Jellison s mouth twitched and she threw a sly provocative glance at old Patton as though she would have liked to poke him in the ribs But she was not going to help him out and at last the one male in the company found himself obliged to clear his throat for reply We re old folks most on us miss cept missus Hurd We don t hear talk o things now like as we did when we were younger If you ast mister Harden he ll tell you I dessay Patton allowed himself an inward chuckle Even missus Jellison he thought must admit that he knew a thing or two as to the best way of dealing with the gentry But Marcella fixed him with her bright frank eyes I had rather ask in the village she said If you don t know how it is now mister Patton tell me how it used to be when you were young Was the preserving very strict about here Were there often fights with the keepers long ago in my grandfather s days and do you think men poached because they were hungry or because they wanted sport Patton looked at her fixedly a moment undecided then her strong nervous youth seemed to exercise a kind of compulsion on him perhaps too the pretty courtesy of her manner He cleared his throat again and tried to forget missus Jellison who would be sure to let him hear of it again whatever he said Well I can t answer for em miss I m sure but if you ast me I b lieve ther s a bit o boath in it Yer see it s not in human natur when a man s young and s got his blood up as he shouldn t want ter have is sport with the wild creeturs Perhaps he see em when ee s going to the wood with a wood cart or he cooms across em in the turnips wounded birds you understan miss perhaps the day after the gentry as been bangin at em all day An ee don t see not for the life of im why ee shouldn t have em Ther s bin lots an lots for the rich folks an he don t see why ee shouldn t have a few arter they ve enjoyed theirselves And mebbe he s eleven shillin a week an two threy little chillen you understan miss Of course I understand said Marcella eagerly her dark cheek flushing Of course I do But there s a good deal of game given away in these parts isn t there I know Lord Maxwell does and they say Lord Winterbourne gives all his labourers rabbits almost as many as they want Her questions wound old Patton up as though he had been a disused clock He began to feel a whirr among his creaking wheels a shaking of all his rusty mind Perhaps they do miss he said and his wife saw that he was beginning to tremble I dessay they do I don t say nothink agen it though theer s none of it cooms my way But that isn t all the rights on it nayther no that it ain t The labourin man ee s glad enough to get a hare or a rabbit for is eatin but there s more in it nor that miss Ee s allus in the fields that s where it is ee can t help seein the hares and the rabbits a comin in and out o the woods if it were iver so Ee knows ivery run ov ivery one on em if a hare s started furthest corner o t field he can tell yer whar she ll git in by because he s allus there you see miss an it s the only thing he s got to take his mind off like And then he sets a snare or two an ee gits very sharp at settin on em an ee ll go out nights for the sport of it Ther isn t many things ee s got to liven him up an ee takes is chances o goin to jail it s wuth it ee thinks The old man s hands on his stick shook more and more visibly Bygones of his youth had come back to him Oh I know I know cried Marcella with an accent half of indignation half of despair It s the whole wretched system It spoils those who ve got and those who haven t got And there ll be no mending it till the people get the land back again and till the rights on it are common to all My she do speak up don t she said missus Jellison grinning again at her companions Then stooping forward with one of her wild movements she caught Marcella s arm I d like to hear yer tell that to Lord Maxwell miss I likes a roompus I do Marcella flushed and laughed I wouldn t mind saying that or anything else to Lord Maxwell she said proudly I m not ashamed of anything I think No I ll bet you ain t said missus Jellison withdrawing her hand Now then Patton you say what you thinks You ain t got no vote now you re in the parish houses I minds that The quality don t trouble you at lection times This yoong man Muster Wharton as is goin round so free promisin yer the sun out o the sky iv yer ll only vote for im so th men say ee don t coom an set down along o you an me an cocker of us up as ee do Joe Simmons or Jim Hurd here But that don t matter Yur thinkin s yur own anyway But she nudged him in vain Patton had suddenly run down and there was no more to be got out of him Not only had nerves and speech failed him as they were wont but in his cloudy soul there had risen even while Marcella was speaking the inevitable suspicion which dogs the relations of the poor towards the richer class This young lady with her strange talk was the new squire s daughter And the village had already made up its mind that Richard Boyce was a poor sort and a hard sort too in his landlord capacity He wasn t going to be any improvement on his brother not a haporth What was the good of this young woman talking as she did when there were three summonses as he Patton heard tell just taken out by the sanitary inspector against mister Boyce for bad cottages And not a farthing given away in the village neither except perhaps the bits of food that the young lady herself brought down to the village now and then for which no one in truth felt any cause to be particularly grateful Besides what did she mean by asking questions about the poaching Old Patton knew as well as anybody else in the village that during Robert Boyce s last days and after the death of his sportsman son the Mellor estate had become the haunt of poachers from far and near and that the trouble had long since spread into the neighbouring properties so that the Winterbourne and Maxwell keepers regarded it their most arduous business to keep watch on the men of Mellor Of course the young woman knew it all and she and her father wanted to know more That was why she talked Patton hardened himself against the creeping ways of the quality I don t think nought he said roughly in answer to missus Jellison Thinkin won t come atwixt me and the parish coffin when I m took I ve no call to think I tell yer Marcella s chest heaved with indignant feeling Oh but mister Patton she cried leaning forward to him won t it comfort you a bit even if you can t live to see it to think there s a better time coming There must be People can t go on like this always hating each other and trampling on each other They re beginning to see it now they are When I was living in London the persons I was with talked and thought of it all day Some day whenever the people choose for they ve got the power now they ve got the vote there ll be land for everybody and in every village there ll be a council to manage things and the labourer will count for just as much as the squire and the parson and he ll be better educated and better fed and care for many things he doesn t care for now But all the same if he wants sport and shooting it will be there for him to get For everybody will have a chance and a turn and there ll be no bitterness between classes and no hopeless pining and misery as there is now The girl broke off catching her breath It excited her to say these things to these people to these poor tottering old things who had lived out their lives to the end under the pressure of an iron system and had no lien on the future whatever Paradise it might bring Again the situation had something foreseen and dramatic in it She saw herself as the preacher sitting on her stool beside the poor grate she realised as a spectator the figures of the women and the old man played on by the firelight the white bare damp stained walls of the cottage and in the background the fragile though still comely form of Minta Hurd who was standing with her back to the dresser and her head bent forward listening to the talk while her fingers twisted the straw she plaited eternally from morning till night for a wage of about ones threed a week Her mind was all aflame with excitement and defiance defiance of her father Lord Maxwell Aldous Raeburn Let him come her friend and see for himself what she thought it right to do and say in this miserable village Her soul challenged him longed to provoke him Well she was soon to meet him and in a new and more significant relation and environment The fact made her perception of the whole situation the more rich and vibrant Patton while these broken thoughts and sensations were coursing through Marcella s head was slowly revolving what she had been saying and the others were waiting for him At last he rolled his tongue round his dry lips and delivered himself by a final effort Them as likes miss may believe as how things are going to happen that way but yer won t ketch me Them as have got ull keep he let his stick sharply down on the floor an them as aven t got ull ave to go without and lump it as long as you re alive miss you mark my words Oh Lor you wor allus one for makin a poor mouth Patton said missus Jellison She had been sitting with her arms folded across her chest part absent part amused part malicious The young lady speaks beautiful just like a book she do An she s likely to know a deal better nor poor persons like you and me All I kin say is if there s goin to be dividin up of other folks property when I m gone I hope George Westall won t get nothink ov it He s bad enough as tis Isabella ud have a fine time if ee took to drivin ov his carriage The others laughed out Marcella at their head and missus Jellison subsided the corners of her mouth still twitching and her eyes shining as though a host of entertaining notions were trooping through her which however she preferred to amuse herself with rather than the public Marcella looked at Patton thoughtfully You ve been all your life in this village haven t you mister Patton she asked him Born top o Witchett s Hill miss An my wife here she wor born just a house or two further along an we two bin married sixty one year come next March He had resumed his usual almshouse tone civil and a little plaintive His wife behind him smiled gently at being spoken of She had a long fair face and white hair surmounted by a battered black bonnet a mouth set rather on one side and a more observant and refined air than most of her neighbours She sighed while she talked and spoke in a delicate quaver D ye know miss said missus Jellison pointing to missus Patton as she kep school when she was young Did you missus Patton asked Marcella in her tone of sympathetic interest The school wasn t very big then I suppose About forty miss said missus Patton with a sigh There was eighteen the Rector paid for and eighteen mister Boyce paid for and the rest paid for themselves Her voice dropped gently and she sighed again like one weighted with an eternal fatigue And what did you teach them Well I taught them the plaitin miss and as much readin and writin as I knew myself It wasn t as high as it is now you see miss and a delicate flush dawned on the old cheek as missus Patton threw a glance round her companions as though appealing to them not to tell stories of her But missus Jellison was implacable It wor she taught me she said nodding at Marcella and pointing sideways to missus Patton She had a queer way wi the hard words I can tell yer miss When she couldn t tell em herself she d never own up to it Say Jerusalem my dear and pass on That s what she d say she would sure s as you re alive I ve heard her do it times An when Isabella an me used to read the Bible nights I d allus rayther do t than be beholden to me own darter It gets yer through anyway Well it wor a good word said missus Patton blushing and mildly defending herself It didn t do none of yer any harm Oh an before her miss I went to a school to another woman as lived up Shepherd s Row You remember her Betsy Brunt missus Brunt s worn eyes began already to gleam and sparkle Yis I recolleck very well missus Jellison She wor Mercy Moss an a goodish deal of trouble you d use to get me into wi Mercy Moss all along o your tricks missus Jellison still with folded arms began to rock herself gently up and down as though to stimulate memory My word but Muster Maurice he wor the clergyman here then miss wor set on Mercy Moss He and his wife they flattered and cockered her up Ther wor nobody like her for keepin school not in their eyes till one midsummer she well she I don t want to say nothink onpleasant but she transgressed said missus Jellison nodding mysteriously triumphant however in the unimpeachable delicacy of her language and looking round the circle for approval What do you say asked Marcella innocently What did Mercy Moss do missus Jellison s eyes danced with malice and mischief but her mouth shut like a vice Patton leaned forward on his stick shaken with a sort of inward explosion his plaintive wife laughed under her breath till she must needs sigh because laughter tired her old bones missus Brunt gurgled gently And finally missus Jellison was carried away Oh my goodness me don t you make me tell tales o Mercy Moss she said at last dashing the water out of her eyes with an excited tremulous hand She s bin dead and gone these forty year married and buried mos respeckable it ud be a burning shame to bring up tales agen her now Them as tittle tattles about dead folks needn t look to lie quiet theirselves in their graves I ve said it times and I ll say it again What are you lookin at me for Betsy Brunt And missus Jellison drew up suddenly with a fierce glance at missus Brunt Why missus Jellison I niver meant no offence said missus Brunt hastily I won t stand no insinooating said missus Jellison with energy If you ve got soomthink agen me you may out wi t an niver mind the young lady But missus Brunt much flurried retreated amid a shower of excuses pursued by her enemy who was soon worrying the whole little company as a dog worries a flock of sheep snapping here and teasing there chattering at the top of her voice in broad dialect as she got more and more excited and quite as ready to break her wit on Marcella as on anybody else As for the others most of them had known little else for weeks than alternations of toil and sickness they were as much amused and excited to night by missus Jellison s audacities as a Londoner is by his favourite low comedian at his favourite music hall They played chorus to her laughed baited her even old Patton was drawn against his will into a caustic sociability Marcella meanwhile sat on her stool her chin upon her hand and her full glowing eyes turned upon the little spectacle absorbing it all with a covetous curiosity The light heartedness the power of enjoyment left in these old folk struck her dumb missus Brunt had an income of two and sixpence a week plus two loaves from the parish and one of the parish or charity houses a hovel that is to say of one room scarcely fit for human habitation at all She had lost five children was allowed two shillings a week by two labourer sons and earned sixpence a week about by continuous work at the plait Her husband had been run over by a farm cart and killed up to the time of his death his earnings averaged about twenty eight pounds a year Much the same with the Pattons They had lost eight children out of ten and were now mainly supported by the wages of a daughter in service missus Patton had of late years suffered agonies and humiliations indescribable from a terrible illness which the parish doctor was quite incompetent to treat being all through a singularly sensitive woman with a natural instinct for the decorous and the beautiful Amazing Starvation wages hardships of sickness and pain horrors of birth and horrors of death wholesale losses of kindred and friends the meanest surroundings the most sordid cares of this mingled cup of village fate every person in the room had drunk and drunk deep Yet here in this autumn twilight they laughed and chattered and joked weird wrinkled children enjoying an hour s rough play in a clearing of the storm Dependent from birth to death on squire parson parish crushed often and ill treated according to their own ideas but bearing so little ill will amusing themselves with their own tragedies even if they could but sit by a fire and drink a neighbour s cup of tea Her heart swelled and burned within her Yes the old people were past hoping for mere wreck and driftwood on the shore the spring tide of death would soon have swept them all into unremembered graves But the young men and women the children were they too to grow up and grow old like these the same smiling stunted ignobly submissive creatures One woman at least would do her best with her one poor life to rouse some of them to discontent and revolt CHAPTER IX 
5445-21282-0000	train-other-500	The fire sank and missus Hurd made no haste to light her lamp Soon the old people were dim chattering shapes in a red darkness missus Hurd still plaited silent and upright lifting her head every now and then
5445-21282-0001	train-other-500	at each sound upon the road At last there was a knock at the door missus Hurd ran to open it Mother I m going your way said a strident voice I ll help you home if you ve a mind
5445-21282-0002	train-other-500	On the threshold stood missus Jellison s daughter missus Westall with her little boy beside her the woman s broad shoulders and harsh striking head standing out against the pale sky behind
5445-21282-0003	train-other-500	Marcella noticed that she greeted none of the old people nor they her And as for missus Hurd as soon as she saw the keeper s wife she turned her back abruptly on her visitor and walked to the other end of the kitchen Are you comin mother repeated Isabella
5445-21282-0004	train-other-500	missus Jellison grumbled gibed at her and made long leave takings while the daughter stood silent waiting and every now and then peering at Marcella who had never seen her before I don know where yur manners is
5445-21282-0005	train-other-500	said missus Jellison sharply to her as though she had been a child of ten that you don t say good evenin to the young lady missus Westall curtsied low and hoped she might be excused as it had grown so dark
none	none	 Her tone was smooth and servile 
5445-21282-0006	train-other-500	and Marcella disliked her as she shook hands with her
none	none	 The other old people including missus Brunt departed a minute or two after the mother and daughter and Marcella was left an instant with missus Hurd 
5445-21282-0007	train-other-500	Oh thank you thank you kindly miss said missus Hurd raising her apron to her eyes to staunch some irrepressible tears as Marcella showed her the advertisement which it might possibly be worth Hurd s while to answer
5445-21282-0008	train-other-500	He ll try you may be sure But I can t think as how anythink ull come ov it And then suddenly as though something unexplained had upset her self control the poor patient creature utterly broke down
5445-21282-0009	train-other-500	Leaning against the bare shelves which held their few pots and pans she threw her apron over her head and burst into the forlornest weeping I wish I was dead I wish I was dead an the chillen too
5445-21282-0010	train-other-500	Marcella hung over her one flame of passionate pity comforting soothing promising help missus Hurd presently recovered enough to tell her that Hurd had gone off that morning
none	none	 before it was light to a farm near Thame where it had been told him he might possibly find a job 
5445-21282-0011	train-other-500	But he ll not find it miss he ll not find it she said twisting her hands in a sort of restless misery
none	none	 there s nothing good happens to such as us An he wor allus a one to work if he could get it 
5445-21282-0012	train-other-500	There was a sound outside missus Hurd flew to the door and a short deformed man with a large head and red hair stumbled in blindly splashed with mud up to his waist and evidently spent with long walking
5445-21282-0013	train-other-500	He stopped on the threshold straining his eyes to see through the fire lit gloom It s Miss Boyce Jim said his wife Did you hear of anythink They re turnin off hands instead of takin ov em on he said briefly
5445-21282-0014	train-other-500	and fell into a chair by the grate He had hardly greeted Marcella who had certainly looked to be greeted Ever since her arrival in August as she had told Aldous Raeburn she had taken a warm interest in this man
5445-21282-0015	train-other-500	and his family There was something about them which marked them out a bit from their fellows whether it was the husband s strange but not repulsive deformity contrasted with the touch of plaintive grace in the wife
5445-21282-0016	train-other-500	or the charm of the elfish children with their tiny stick like arms and legs and the glancing wildness of their blue eyes under the frizzle of red hair which shone round their little sickly faces Very soon she had begun to haunt them
5445-21282-0017	train-other-500	in her eager way to try and penetrate their peasant lives which were so full of enigma and attraction to her mainly because of their very defectiveness their closeness to an animal simplicity never to be reached by any one of her sort
5445-21282-0018	train-other-500	She soon discovered or imagined that Hurd had more education than his neighbours At any rate he would sit listening to her and smoking as she made him do while she talked politics and socialism to him
5445-21282-0019	train-other-500	and though he said little in return she made the most of it and was sure anyway that he was glad to see her come in and must some time read the labour newspapers and Venturist leaflets she brought him
5445-21282-0020	train-other-500	for they were always well thumbed before they came back to her But to night his sullen weariness would make no effort and the hunted restless glances he threw from side to side as he sat crouching over the fire the large mouth tight shut
5445-21282-0021	train-other-500	the nostrils working showed her that he would be glad when she went away Her young exacting temper was piqued She had been for some time trying to arrange their lives for them So in spite of his dumb resistance she lingered on
5445-21282-0022	train-other-500	questioning and suggesting As to the advertisement she had brought down he put it aside almost without looking at it There ud be a hun erd men after it before ever he could get there was all he would say to it
none	none	 Then she inquired if he had been to ask the steward of the Maxwell Court estate 
5445-21282-0023	train-other-500	for work He did not answer but missus Hurd said timidly
none	none	 that she heard tell a new drive was to be made that winter 
5445-21282-0024	train-other-500	for the sake of giving employment But their own men on the estate would come first and there were plenty of them out of work Well but there is the game persisted Marcella
none	none	 Isn t it possible they might want some extra men now the pheasant shooting has begun 
5445-21282-0025	train-other-500	I might go and inquire of Westall I know him a little The wife made a startled movement and Hurd raised his misshapen form with a jerk Thank yer miss but I ll not trouble yer I don t want nothing to do with Westall
5445-21282-0026	train-other-500	And taking up a bit of half burnt wood which lay on the hearth he threw it violently back into the grate Marcella looked from one to the other with surprise missus Hurd s expression was one of miserable discomfort
5445-21282-0027	train-other-500	and she kept twisting her apron in her gnarled hands Yes I shall
none	none	 tell Jim 
5445-21282-0028	train-other-500	she broke out I shall I know Miss Boyce is one as ull understand Hurd turned round and looked at his wife full But she persisted You see miss they don t speak
none	none	 don t Jim and George Westall When Jim was quite a lad he was employed at Mellor under old Westall George s father as was Jim was watcher and young George he was assistant 
5445-21282-0029	train-other-500	That was in mister Robert s days you understand miss when Master Harold was alive and they took a deal o trouble about the game An George Westall he was allays leading the others a life tale bearing an spyin
5445-21282-0030	train-other-500	an settin his father against any of em as didn t give in to him
none	none	 An oh he behaved fearful to Jim Jim ull tell you Now Jim what s wrong with you why shouldn t I tell For Hurd had risen and as he and his wife looked at each other a sort of mute conversation seemed to pass between them Then he turned angrily 
5445-21282-0031	train-other-500	and went out of the cottage by the back door into the garden The wife sat in some agitation a moment then she resumed He can t bear no talk about Westall it seems to drive him silly But I say as how people should know
5445-21282-0032	train-other-500	Her wavering eye seemed to interrogate her companion Marcella was puzzled by her manner it was so far from simple But that was long ago surely she said Yes it wor long ago but you don t forget them things miss
5445-21282-0033	train-other-500	An Westall he s just the same sort as he was then so folks say she added hurriedly You see Jim miss how he s made His back was twisted that way when he was a little un His father was a good old man everybody spoke well of im
5445-21282-0034	train-other-500	but his mother she was a queer mad body with red hair just like Jim and the children and a temper my word They do say she was an Irish girl out of a gang as used to work near here an she let him drop one day when she was in liquor
5445-21282-0035	train-other-500	an never took no trouble about him afterwards He was a poor sickly lad he was you d wonder how he grew up at all
none	none	 And oh George Westall 
5445-21282-0036	train-other-500	he treated him cruel He d kick and swear at him then he d dare him to fight an thrash him till the others came in an got him away Then he d carry tales to his father and one day old Westall beat Jim within an inch of is life with a strap end
5445-21282-0037	train-other-500	because of a lie George told im The poor chap lay in a ditch under Disley Wood all day because he was that knocked about he couldn t walk and at night he crawled home on his hands and knees He s shown me the place many a time
5445-21282-0038	train-other-500	Then he told his father and next morning he told me as he couldn t stand it no longer an he never went back no more And he told no one else he never complained asked Marcella indignantly
none	none	 What ud ha been the good o that miss 
5445-21282-0039	train-other-500	missus Hurd said wondering
none	none	 Nobody ud ha taken his word agen old Westall s But he come and told me I was housemaid at Lady Leven s then an he and his father were old friends of ourn And I knew George Westall too 
5445-21282-0040	train-other-500	He used to walk out with me of a Sunday just as civil as could be
none	none	 and give my mother rabbits now and again and do anything I d ask him An I up and told him he was a brute to go ill treatin a sickly fellow 
5445-21282-0041	train-other-500	as couldn t pay him back That made him as cross as vinegar an when Jim began to be about with me ov a Sunday sometimes instead of him he got madder and madder An Jim asked me to marry him he begged of me
5445-21282-0042	train-other-500	an I didn t know what to say For Westall had asked me twice
none	none	 an I was afeard of Jim s health 
5445-21282-0043	train-other-500	an the low wages he d get an of not bein strong myself But one day I was going up a lane into Tudley End woods an I heard George Westall on tother side of the hedge with a young dog he was training
none	none	 Somethin crossed him an he flew into a passion with it It turned me sick I ran away and I took against him there and then I was frightened of him I duresn t trust myself and I said to Jim I d take him So you can understan miss 
5445-21282-0044	train-other-500	can t you as Jim don t want to have nothing to do with Westall Thank you kindly all the same she added breaking off her narrative with the same uncertainty of manner the same timid scrutiny of her visitor that Marcella had noticed before
none	none	 Marcella replied that she could certainly understand But I suppose they ve not got in each other s way of late years she said as she rose to go Oh no miss no said missus Hurd as she went hurriedly to fetch a fur tippet which her visitor had laid down on the dresser There is one person I can speak to said Marcella as she put on the wrap And I will 
5445-21282-0045	train-other-500	Against her will she reddened a little but she had not been able to help throwing out the promise
none	none	 And now you won t despair will you 
5445-21282-0046	train-other-500	You ll trust me I could always do something She took missus Hurd s hand with a sweet look and gesture Standing there in her tall vigorous youth her furs wrapped about her
5445-21282-0047	train-other-500	she had the air of protecting and guiding this poverty that could not help itself The mother and wife felt herself shy intimidated The tears came back to her brown eyes When Miss Boyce had gone
5445-21282-0048	train-other-500	Minta Hurd went to the fire and put it together sighing all the time her face still red and miserable The door opened and her husband came in He carried some potatoes in his great earth stained hands
5445-21282-0049	train-other-500	You re goin to put that bit of hare on Well mak eeaste do for I m starvin What did she want to stay all that time for You go and get it I ll blow the fire up damn these sticks
none	none	 they re as wet as Dugnall pond 
5445-21282-0050	train-other-500	Nevertheless as she sadly came and went preparing the supper she saw that he was appeased in a better temper than before What did you tell er he asked abruptly
none	none	 What do you spose I d tell her 
5445-21282-0051	train-other-500	I acted for the best I m always thinkin for you she said as though with a little cry or we d soon be in trouble worse trouble than we are she added miserably He stopped working the old bellows for a moment
none	none	 and holding his long chin stared into the flames 
5445-21282-0052	train-other-500	With his deformity his earth stains his blue eyes his brown wrinkled skin and his shock of red hair he had the look of some strange gnome crouching there I don t know what you re at I ll swear he said after a pause
5445-21282-0053	train-other-500	I ain t in any pertickler trouble just now if yer wouldn t send a fellow stumpin the country for nothink If you ll just let me alone I ll get a livin for you and the chillen right enough Don t you trouble yourself an hold your tongue
5445-21282-0054	train-other-500	She threw down her apron with a gesture of despair as she stood beside him in front of the fire watching the pan What am I to do Jim an them chillen when you re took to prison she asked him vehemently I shan t get took to prison I tell yer
none	none	 All the same Westall got holt o me this mornin 
5445-21282-0055	train-other-500	I thought praps you d better know Her exclamation of terror her wild look at him were exactly what he had expected nevertheless he flinched before them His brutality was mostly assumed
none	none	 He had adopted it as a mask for more than a year past because he must go his way and she worried him Now look here he said resolutely it don t matter I m not goin to be took by Westall I d kill him or myself first 
5445-21282-0056	train-other-500	But he caught me lookin at a snare this mornin it wor misty and I didn t see no one comin It wor close to the footpath and it worn t my snare Jim my chap says he mockin I m sorry for it but I m going to search yer
5445-21282-0057	train-other-500	so take it quietly says he He had young Dynes with him so I didn t say nought I kep as still as a mouse
none	none	 an sure enough he put his ugly han s into all my pockets An what do yer think he foun 
5445-21282-0058	train-other-500	What she said breathlessly Nothink he laughed out Nary an end o string nor a kink o wire nothink
6189_21305_000072_000000	train-clean-360	he laughed 
none	none	out Nary an end o string nor a kink o wire nothink 
5445-21282-0059	train-other-500	I d hidden the two rabbits I got las night and all my bits o things in a ditch far enough out o his way I just laughed at the look ov im I ll have the law on yer for assault an battery yer damned miscalculatin brute

5445-21282-0060	train-other-500	An off I walked Don t you be afeared
none	none	 ee ll never lay hands on me 
5445-21282-0061	train-other-500	But Minta was sore afraid and went on talking and lamenting while she made the tea He took little heed of her He sat by the fire quivering and thinking
5445-21282-0062	train-other-500	In a public house two nights before this one overtures had been made to him on behalf of a well known gang of poachers with head quarters in a neighbouring county town who had their eyes on the pheasant preserves in Westall s particular beat the Tudley End beat
5445-21282-0063	train-other-500	and wanted a local watcher and accomplice He had thought the matter at first too dangerous to touch Moreover he was at that moment in a period of transition pestered by Minta to give up the poachin and yet drawn back to it after his spring and summer of field work
5445-21282-0064	train-other-500	by instincts only recently revived after long dormancy but now hard to resist Presently he turned with anger upon one of Minta s wails which happened to reach him Look ere said he to her
5445-21282-0065	train-other-500	where ud you an the chillen be this night if I adn t done it Adn t we got rid of every stick o stuff we iver ad Ere s a well furnished place for a chap to sit in he glanced bitterly round the bare kitchen which had none of the little properties of the country poor
none	none	 no chest no set of mahogany drawers no comfortable chair nothing but the dresser and the few rush chairs and the table and a few odds and ends of crockery and household stuff wouldn t we all a bin on the parish if we adn t starved fust 
5445-21282-0066	train-other-500	wouldn t we jes answer me that Didn t we sit here an starve till the bones was comin through the chillen s skin didn t we That he could still argue the point with her showed the inner vulnerableness the inner need of her affection
5445-21282-0067	train-other-500	and of peace with her which he still felt far as certain new habits were beginning to sweep him from her It s Westall or Jenkins Jenkins was the village policeman havin the law on yer Jim she said with emphasis
5445-21282-0068	train-other-500	putting down a cup and looking at him it s the thought of that makes me cold in my back
5445-21282-0069	train-other-500	None o my people was ever in prison an if it appened to you I should just die of shame Then yer d better take and read them papers there as she brought he said impatiently first jerking his finger over his shoulder in the direction of Mellor to indicate Miss Boyce
none	none	 and then pointing to a heap of newspapers which lay on the floor in a corner they d tell yer summat about the shame o makin them game laws 
5445-21282-0070	train-other-500	not o breakin ov em But I m sick o this Where s them chillen Why do yer let that boy out so late And opening the door he stood on the threshold looking up and down the village street while Minta once more gave up the struggle dried her eyes
5445-21282-0071	train-other-500	and told herself to be cheerful But it was hard She was far better born and better educated than her husband Her father had been a small master chair maker in Wycombe and her mother
5445-21282-0072	train-other-500	a lackadaisical silly woman had given her her fine name by way of additional proof that she and her children were something out of the common Moreover she had the conforming law abiding instincts of the well treated domestic servant
5445-21282-0073	train-other-500	who has lived on kindly terms with the gentry and shared their standards And for years after their marriage Hurd had allowed her to govern him He had been so patient so hard working
5445-21282-0074	train-other-500	such a kind husband and father so full of a dumb wish to show her he was grateful to her for marrying such a fellow as he The quarrel with Westall seemed to have sunk out of his mind He never spoke to or of him Low wages
5445-21282-0075	train-other-500	the burden of quick coming children the bad sanitary conditions of their wretched cottage and poor health had made their lives one long and sordid struggle But for years he had borne his load with extraordinary patience He and his could just exist
5445-21282-0076	train-other-500	and the man who had been in youth the lonely victim of his neighbours scorn had found a woman to give him all herself and children to love Hence years of submission a hidden flowering time for both of them Till that last awful winter
none	none	 the winter before Richard Boyce s succession to Mellor when the farmers had been mostly ruined 
5445-21282-0077	train-other-500	and half the able bodied men of Mellor had tramped up into the smoke as the village put it in search of London work then out of actual sheer starvation that very rare excuse of the poacher Hurd had gone one night and snared a hare
5445-21282-0078	train-other-500	on the Mellor land Would the wife and mother ever forget the pure animal satisfaction of that meal or the fearful joy of the next night when he got three shillings from a local publican for a hare and two rabbits
5445-21282-0079	train-other-500	But after the first relief Minta had gone in fear and trembling For the old woodcraft revived in Hurd and the old passion for the fields and their chances
5445-21282-0080	train-other-500	which he had felt as a lad before his watcher s place had been made intolerable to him by George Westall s bullying He became excited unmanageable
5445-21282-0081	train-other-500	Very soon he was no longer content with Mellor where since the death of young Harold the heir the keepers had been dismissed and what remained of a once numerous head of game lay open to the wiles of all the bold spirits of the neighbourhood
5445-21282-0082	train-other-500	He must needs go on to those woods of Lord Maxwell s which girdled the Mellor estate on three sides And here he came once more across his enemy For George Westall was now in the far better paid service of the Court and a very clever keeper
5445-21282-0083	train-other-500	with designs on the head keeper s post whenever it might be vacant In the case of a poacher he had the scent of one of his own hares It was known to him in an incredibly short time that that low caselty fellow Hurd
5445-21282-0084	train-other-500	was attacking his game Hurd notwithstanding was cunning itself and Westall lay in wait for him in vain Meanwhile all the old hatred between the two men revived
5445-21282-0085	train-other-500	Hurd drank this winter more than he had ever drunk yet It was necessary to keep on good terms with one or two publicans who acted as receivers of the poached game of the neighbourhood And it seemed to him that Westall pursued him into these low dens
5445-21282-0086	train-other-500	The keeper big burly prosperous would speak to him with insolent patronage watching him all the time or with the old brutality which Hurd dared not resent Only in his excitable dwarf s sense
5445-21282-0087	train-other-500	hate grew and throve very soon to monstrous proportions Westall s menacing figure darkened all his sky for him His poaching besides a means of livelihood became more and more a silent duel between him and his boyhood s tyrant
5445-21282-0088	train-other-500	And now after seven months of regular field work and respectable living it was all to begin again with the new winter The same shudders and terrors the same shames before the gentry and mister Harden the soft timid woman with her conscience
none	none	 could not endure the prospect For some weeks after the harvest was over she struggled He had begun to go out again at nights But she drove him to look for employment and lived in tears when he failed As for him 
5445-21282-0089	train-other-500	she knew that he was glad to fail there was a certain ease and jauntiness in his air to night
none	none	 as he stood calling the children 
5445-21282-0090	train-other-500	Will you come in at once Daisy Nellie Two little figures came pattering up the street in the moist October dusk a third panted behind The girls ran in to their mother chattering and laughing
5445-21282-0091	train-other-500	Hurd lifted the boy in his arm Where you bin Will What were yo out for in this nasty damp
none	none	 I ve brought yo a whole pocket full o chestnuts and summat else too 
5445-21282-0092	train-other-500	He carried him in to the fire and sat him on his knees The little emaciated creature flushed with the pleasure of his father s company played contentedly in the intervals of coughing with the shining chestnuts or ate his slice of the fine pear
none	none	 the gift of a friend in Thame 
5445-21282-0093	train-other-500	which proved to be the summat else of promise The curtains were close drawn the paraffin lamp flared on the table and as the savoury smell of the hare and onions on the fire filled the kitchen
5445-21282-0094	train-other-500	the whole family gathered round watching for the moment of eating The fire played on the thin legs and pinched faces of the children on the baby s cradle in the further corner on the mother red eyed still but able to smile and talk again
5445-21282-0095	train-other-500	on the strange Celtic face and matted hair of the dwarf Family affection and the satisfaction of the simpler physical needs these things make the happiness of the poor For this hour to night
none	none	 the Hurds were happy 
5445-21282-0096	train-other-500	Meanwhile in the lane outside Marcella as she walked home passed a tall broad shouldered man in a velveteen suit and gaiters his gun over his shoulder and two dogs behind him
5445-21282-0097	train-other-500	his pockets bulging on either side He walked with a kind of military air and touched his cap to her as he passed Marcella barely nodded Tyrant and bully she thought to herself with missus Hurd s story in her mind
5445-21282-0098	train-other-500	Yet no doubt he is a valuable keeper Lord Maxwell would be sorry to lose him It is the system makes such men and must have them The clatter of a pony carriage disturbed her thoughts
5445-21282-0099	train-other-500	A small elderly lady in a very large mushroom hat drove past her in the dusk and bowed stiffly Marcella was so taken by surprise that she barely returned the bow Then she looked after the carriage That was Miss Raeburn
none	none	 To morrow CHAPTER X Won t you sit nearer to the window We are rather proud of our view at this time of year said Miss Raeburn to Marcella taking her visitor s jacket from her as she spoke and laying it aside Lady Winterbourne is late but she will come I am sure She is very precise about engagements Marcella moved her chair nearer to the great bow window and looked out over the sloping gardens of the Court and the autumn splendour of the woods girdling them in on all sides She held her head nervously erect was not apparently much inclined to talk and Miss Raeburn who had resumed her knitting within a few paces of her guest said to herself presently after a few minutes conversation on the weather and the walk from Mellor Difficult decidedly difficult and too much manner for a young girl But the most picturesque creature I ever set eyes on Lord Maxwell s sister was an excellent woman the inquisitive benevolent despot of all the Maxwell villages and one of the soundest Tories still left to a degenerate party and a changing time Her brother and her great nephew represented to her the flower of human kind she had never been capable and probably never would be capable of quarrelling with either of them on any subject whatever At the same time she had her rights with them She was at any rate their natural guardian in those matters relating to womankind where men are confessedly given to folly She had accordingly kept a shrewd eye in Aldous s interest on all the young ladies of the neighbourhood for many years past knew perfectly well all that he might have done and sighed over all that he had so far left undone At the present moment in spite of the even good breeding with which she knitted and chattered beside Marcella she was in truth consumed with curiosity conjecture and alarm on the subject of this Miss Boyce Profoundly as they trusted each other the Raeburns were not on the surface a communicative family Neither her brother nor Aldous had so far bestowed any direct confidence upon her but the course of affairs had notwithstanding aroused her very keenest attention In the first place as we know the mistress of Maxwell Court had left Mellor and its new occupants unvisited she had plainly understood it to be her brother s wish that she should do so How indeed could you know the women without knowing Richard Boyce which according to Lord Maxwell was impossible And now it was Lord Maxwell who had suggested not only that after all it would be kind to call upon the poor things who were heavily weighted enough already with Dick Boyce for husband and father but that it would be a graceful act on his sister s part to ask the girl and her mother to luncheon Dick Boyce of course must be made to keep his distance but the resources of civilisation were perhaps not unequal to the task of discriminating if it were prudently set about At any rate Miss Raeburn gathered that she was expected to try and instead of pressing her brother for explanations she held her tongue paid her call forthwith and wrote her note But although Aldous thinking no doubt that he had been already sufficiently premature had said nothing at all as to his own feelings to his great aunt she knew perfectly well that he had said a great deal on the subject of Miss Boyce and her mother to Lady Winterbourne the only woman in the neighbourhood with whom he was ever really confidential No woman of course in Miss Raeburn s position and with Miss Raeburn s general interest in her kind could have been ignorant for any appreciable number of days after the Boyces arrival at Mellor that they possessed a handsome daughter of whom the Hardens in particular gave striking but as Miss Raeburn privately thought by no means wholly attractive accounts And now after all these somewhat agitating preliminaries here was the girl established in the Court drawing room Aldous more nervous and preoccupied than she had ever seen him and Lord Maxwell expressing a particular anxiety to return from his Board meeting in good time for luncheon to which he had especially desired that Lady Winterbourne should be bidden and no one else It may well be supposed that Miss Raeburn was on the alert As for Marcella she was on her side keenly conscious of being observed of having her way to make Here she was alone among these formidable people whose acquaintance she had in a manner compelled Well what blame What was to prevent her from doing the same thing again to morrow Her conscience was absolutely clear If they were not ready to meet her in the same spirit in which through mister Raeburn she had approached them she would know perfectly well how to protect herself above all how to live out her life in the future without troubling them Meanwhile in spite of her dignity and those inward propitiations it from time to time demanded she was in her human vivid way full of an excitement and curiosity she could hardly conceal as perfectly as she desired curiosity as to the great house and the life in it especially as to Aldous Raeburn s part therein She knew very little indeed of the class to which by birth she belonged great houses and great people were strange to her She brought her artist s and student s eyes to look at them with she was determined not to be dazzled or taken in by them At the same time as she glanced every now and then round the splendid room in which they sat with its Tudor ceiling its fine pictures its combination of every luxury with every refinement she was distinctly conscious of a certain thrill a romantic drawing towards the stateliness and power which it all implied together with a proud and careless sense of equality of kinship so to speak which she made light of but would not in reality have been without for the world In birth and blood she had nothing to yield to the Raeburns so her mother assured her If things were to be vulgarly measured this fact too must come in But they should not be vulgarly measured She did not believe in class or wealth not at all Only as her mother had told her she must hold her head up An inward temper which no doubt led to that excess of manner of which Miss Raeburn was meanwhile conscious Where were the gentlemen Marcella was beginning to resent and tire of the innumerable questions as to her likes and dislikes her accomplishments her friends her opinions of Mellor and the neighbourhood which this knitting lady beside her poured out upon her so briskly when to her great relief the door opened and a footman announced Lady Winterbourne A very tall thin lady in black entered the room at the words My dear she said to Miss Raeburn I am very late but the roads are abominable and those horses Edward has just given me have to be taken such tiresome care of I told the coachman next time he might wrap them in shawls and put them to bed and I should walk You are quite capable of it my dear said Miss Raeburn kissing her We know you Miss Boyce Lady Winterbourne Lady Winterbourne shook hands with a shy awkwardness which belied her height and stateliness As she sat down beside Miss Raeburn the contrast between her and Lord Maxwell s sister was sufficiently striking Miss Raeburn was short inclined to be stout and to a certain gay profusion in her attire Her cap was made of a bright silk handkerchief edged with lace round her neck were hung a number of small trinkets on various gold chains she abounded too in bracelets most of which were clearly old fashioned mementos of departed relatives or friends Her dress was a cheerful red verging on crimson and her general air suggested energy bustle and a good humoured common sense Lady Winterbourne on the other hand was not only dressed from head to foot in severe black without an ornament her head and face belonged also to the same impression as of some strong and forcible study in black and white The attitude was rigidly erect the very dark eyes under the snowy and abundant hair had a trick of absent staring in certain aspects the whole figure had a tragic nay formidable dignity from which one expected and sometimes got the tone and gesture of tragic acting Yet at the same time mixed in therewith a curious strain of womanish nay childish weakness appealingness Altogether a great lady and a personality yet something else too something ill assured timid incongruous hard to be defined I believe you have not been at Mellor long the new comer asked in a deep contralto voice which she dragged a little About seven weeks My father and mother have been there since May You must of course think it a very interesting old place Of course I do I love it said Marcella disconcerted by the odd habit Lady Winterbourne had of fixing her eyes upon a person and then as it were forgetting what she had done with them Oh I haven t been there Agneta said the new comer turning after a pause to Miss Raeburn since that summer you remember that party when the Palmerstons came over so long ago twenty years Marcella sat stiffly upright Lady Winterbourne grew a little nervous and flurried I don t think I ever saw your mother Miss Boyce I was much away from home about then Oh yes I did once The speaker stopped a sudden red suffusing her pale cheeks She had felt certain somehow at sight of Marcella that she should say or do something untoward and she had promptly justified her own prevision The only time she had ever seen missus Boyce had been in court on the last day of the famous trial in which Richard Boyce was concerned when she had made out the wife sitting closely veiled as near to her husband as possible waiting for the verdict As she had already confided this reminiscence to Miss Raeburn and had forgotten she had done so both ladies had a moment of embarrassment missus Boyce I am sorry to say does not seem to be strong said Miss Raeburn bending over the heel of her stocking I wish we could have had the pleasure of seeing her to day There was a pause Lady Winterbourne s tragic eyes were once more considering Marcella I hope you will come and see me she said at last abruptly and missus Boyce too The voice was very soft and refined though so deep and Marcella looking up was suddenly magnetised Yes I will she said all her face melting into sensitive life Mamma won t go anywhere but I will come if you will ask me Will you come next Tuesday said Lady Winterbourne quickly come to tea and I will drive you back mister Raeburn told me about you He says you read a great deal The solemnity of the last words the fixedness of the tragic look were not to be resisted Marcella laughed out and both ladies simultaneously thought her extraordinarily radiant and handsome How can he know Why I have hardly talked about books to him at all Well here he comes said Lady Winterbourne smiling suddenly so I can ask him But I am sure he did say so It was now Marcella s turn to colour Aldous Raeburn crossed the room greeted Lady Winterbourne and next moment she felt her hand in his You did tell me Aldous didn t you said Lady Winterbourne that Miss Boyce was a great reader The speaker had known Aldous Raeburn as a boy and was moreover a sort of cousin which explained the Christian name Aldous smiled I said I thought Miss Boyce was like you and me and had a weakness that way Lady Winterbourne But I won t be cross examined I don t think I am a great reader said Marcella bluntly at least I read a great deal but I hardly ever read a book through I haven t patience You want to get at everything so quickly said Miss Raeburn looking up sharply I suppose so said Marcella There seems to be always a hundred things tearing one different ways and no time for any of them Yes when one is young one feels like that said Lady Winterbourne sighing When one is old one accepts one s limitations When I was twenty I never thought that I should still be an ignorant and discontented woman at nearly seventy It is because you are so young still Lady Winterbourne that you feel so said Aldous laughing at her as one does at an old friend Why you are younger than any of us I feel all brushed and stirred up a boy at school again after I have been to see you Well I don t know what you mean I m sure said Lady Winterbourne sighing again Then she looked at the pair beside her at the alert brightness in the man s strong and quiet face as he sat stooping forward with his hands upon his knees hardly able to keep his eyes for an instant from the dark apparition beside him at the girl s evident shyness and pride My dear she said turning suddenly to Miss Raeburn have you heard what a monstrosity Alice has produced this last time in the way of a baby It was born with four teeth Miss Raeburn s astonishment fitted the provocation and the two old friends fell into a gossip on the subject of Lady Winterbourne s numerous family which was clearly meant for a tete a tete Will you come and look at our tapestry said Aldous to his neighbour after a few nothings had passed between them as to the weather and her walk from Mellor I think you would admire it and I am afraid my grandfather will be a few minutes yet He hoped to get home earlier than this but his Board meeting was very long and important and has kept him an unconscionable time Marcella rose and they moved together towards the south end of the room where a famous piece of Italian Renaissance tapestry entirely filled the wall from side to side How beautiful cried the girl her eyes filling with delight What a delicious thing to live with And indeed it was the most adorable medley of forms tints suggestions of gods and goddesses nymphs and shepherds standing in flowery grass under fruit laden trees and wreathed about with roses Both colour and subject were of fairyland The golds and browns and pinks of it the greens and ivory whites had been mellowed and pearled and warmed by age into a most glowing delicate and fanciful beauty It was Italy at the great moment subtle rich exuberant Aldous enjoyed her pleasure I thought you would like it I hoped you would It has been my special delight since I was a child when my mother first routed it out of a garret I am not sure that I don t in my heart prefer it to any of the pictures The flowers said Marcella absorbed in it look at them the irises the cyclamens the lilies It reminds one of the dreams one used to have when one was small of what it would be like to have flowers enough I was at school you know in a part of England where one seemed always cheated out of them We walked two and two along the straight roads and I found one here and one there but such a beggarly wretched few for all one s trouble I used to hate the hard dry soil and console myself by imagining countries where the flowers grew like this yes just like this in a gold and pink and blue mass so that one might thrust one s hands in and gather and gather till one was really satisfied That is the worst of being at school when you are poor You never get enough of anything One day it s flowers but the next day it is pudding and the next frocks Her eye was sparkling her tongue loosened Not only was it pleasant to feel herself beside him enwrapped in such an atmosphere of admiration and deference but the artistic sensitive chord in her had been struck and vibrated happily Well only wait till May and the cowslips in your own fields will make up to you he said smiling at her But now I have been wondering to myself in my room upstairs what you would like to see There are a good many treasures in this house and you will care for them because you are an artist But you shall not be bored with them You shall see what and as much as you like You had about a quarter of an hour s talk with my aunt did you not he asked in a quite different tone So all the time while she and Miss Raeburn had been making acquaintance he had known that she was in the house and he had kept away for his own purposes Marcella felt a colour she could not restrain leap into her cheek Miss Raeburn was very kind she said with a return of shyness which passed however the next moment by reaction into her usual daring Yes she was very kind but all the same she doesn t like me I don t think she is going to like me I am not her sort Have you been talking Socialism to her he asked her smiling No not yet not yet she said emphatically But I am dreadfully uncertain I can t always hold my tongue I am afraid you will be sorry you took me up Are you so aggressive But Aunt Neta is so mild she wouldn t hurt a fly She mothers every one in the house and out of it The only people she is hard upon are the little servant girls who will wear feathers in their hats There cried Marcella indignantly Why shouldn t they wear feathers in their hats It is their form of beauty their tapestry But if one can t have both feathers and boots he asked her humbly a twinkle in his grey eye If one hasn t boots one may catch a cold and die of it which is after all worse than going featherless But why can t they have feathers and boots It is because you we have got too much You have the tapestry and and the pictures she turned and looked round the room and this wonderful house and the park Oh no I think it is Miss Raeburn has too many feathers Perhaps it is he admitted in a different tone his look changing and saddening as though some habitual struggle of thought were recalled to him You see I am in a difficulty I want to show you our feathers I think they would please you and you make me ashamed of them How absurd cried Marcella when
6189_21305_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 I told you 
none	none	how I liked the school children bobbing to me They laughed and then Aldous looked round with a start Ah here is my grandfather Then he stood back watching the look with which Lord Maxwell after greeting Lady Winterbourne approached Miss Boyce He saw the old man s somewhat formal approach the sudden kindle in the blue eyes which marked the first effect of Marcella s form and presence the bow the stately shake of the hand The lover hearing his own heart beat realised that his beautiful lady had so far done well You must let me say that I see a decided likeness in you to your grandfather said Lord Maxwell when they were all seated at lunch Marcella on his left hand opposite to Lady Winterbourne He was one of my dearest friends I m afraid I don t know much about him said Marcella rather bluntly except what I have got out of old letters I never saw him that I remember Lord Maxwell left the subject of course at once but showed a great wish to talk to her and make her talk He had pleasant things to say about Mellor and its past which could be said without offence and some conversation about the Boyce monuments in Mellor church led to a discussion of the part played by the different local families in the Civil Wars in which it seemed to Aldous that his grandfather tried in various shrewd and courteous ways to make Marcella feel at ease with herself and her race accepted as it were of right into the local brotherhood and so to soothe and heal those bruised feelings he could not but divine The girl carried herself a little loftily answering with an independence and freedom beyond her age and born of her London life She was not in the least abashed or shy Yet it was clear that Lord Maxwell s first impressions were favourable Aldous caught every now and then his quick judging look sweeping over her and instantly withdrawn comparing as the grandson very well knew every point and tone and gesture with some inner ideal of what a Raeburn s wife should be How dream like the whole scene was to Aldous yet how exquisitely real The room with its carved and gilt cedar wood panels its Vandykes its tall windows opening on the park the autumn sun flooding the gold and purple fruit on the table and sparkling on the glass and silver the figures of his aunt and Lady Winterbourne the moving servants and dominant of it all interpreting it all for him anew the dark lithe creature beside his grandfather so quick sensitive extravagant so much a woman yet to his lover s sense so utterly unlike any other woman he had ever seen every detail of it was charged to him with a thousand new meanings now oppressive now delightful For he was passing out of the first stage of passion in which it is almost its own satisfaction so new and enriching is it to the whole nature into the second stage the stage of anxiety incredulity Marcella sitting there on his own ground after all his planning seemed to him not nearer but further from him She was terribly on her dignity Where was all that girlish abandonment gone which she had shown him on that walk beside the gate There had been a touch of it a divine touch before luncheon How could he get her to himself again Meanwhile the conversation passed to the prevailing local topic the badness of the harvest the low prices of everything the consequent depression among the farmers and stagnation in the villages I don t know what is to be done for the people this winter said Lord Maxwell without pauperising them I mean To give money is easy enough Our grandfathers would have doled out coal and blankets and thought no more of it We don t get through so easily No said Lady Winterbourne sighing It weighs one down Last winter was a nightmare The tales one heard and the faces one saw though we seemed to be always giving And in the middle of it Edward would buy me a new set of sables I begged him not but he laughed at me Well my dear said Miss Raeburn cheerfully if nobody bought sables there d be other poor people up in Russia isn t it or Hudson s Bay badly off One has to think of that Oh you needn t talk Aldous I know you say it s a fallacy I call it common sense She got however only a slight smile from Aldous who had long ago left his great aunt to work out her own economics And anyway she saw that he was wholly absorbed from his seat beside Lady Winterbourne in watching Miss Boyce It s precisely as Lord Maxwell says replied Lady Winterbourne that kind of thing used to satisfy everybody And our grandmothers were very good women I don t know why we who give ourselves so much more trouble than they did should carry these thorns about with us while they went free She drew herself up a cloud over her fine eyes Miss Raeburn looking round was glad to see the servants had left the room Miss Boyce thinks we are all in a very bad way I m sure I have heard tales of Miss Boyce s opinions said Lord Maxwell smiling at her with an old man s indulgence as though provoking her to talk Her slim fingers were nervously crumbling some bread beside her her head was drooped a little At his challenge she looked up with a start She was perfectly conscious of him as both the great magnate on his native heath and as the trained man of affairs condescending to a girl s fancies But she had made up her mind not to be afraid What tales have you heard she asked him You alarm us you know he said gallantly waiving her question We can t afford a prophetess to the other side just now Miss Raeburn drew herself up with a sharp dry look at Miss Boyce which escaped every one but Lady Winterbourne Oh I am not a Radical said Marcella half scornfully We Socialists don t fight for either political party as such We take what we can get out of both So you call yourself a Socialist A real full blown one Lord Maxwell s pleasant tone masked the mood of a man who after a morning of hard work thinks himself entitled to some amusement at luncheon Yes I am a Socialist she said slowly looking at him At least I ought to be I am in my conscience But not in your judgment he said laughing Isn t that the condition of most of us No not at all she exclaimed both her vanity and her enthusiasm roused by his manner Both my judgment and my conscience make me a Socialist It s only one s wretched love for one s own little luxuries and precedences the worst part of one that makes me waver makes me a traitor The people I worked with in London would think me a traitor often I know And you really think that the world ought to be hatched over again and hatched different That it ought to be if it could be I think that things are intolerable as they are she broke out after a pause The London poor were bad enough the country poor seem to me worse How can any one believe that such serfdom and poverty such mutilation of mind and body were meant to go on for ever Lord Maxwell s brows lifted But it certainly was no wonder that Aldous should find those eyes of hers superb Can you really imagine my dear young lady he asked her mildly that if all property were divided to morrow the force of natural inequality would not have undone all the work the day after and given us back our poor The newspaper cant of this remark as the Cravens would have put it brought a contemptuous look for an instant into the girl s face She began to talk eagerly and cleverly showing a very fair training in the catch words of the school and a good memory as one uncomfortable person at the table soon perceived for some of the leading arguments and illustrations of a book of Venturist Essays which had lately been much read and talked of in London Then irritated more and more by Lord Maxwell s gentle attention and the interjections he threw in from time to time she plunged into history attacked the landowning class spoke of the Statute of Labourers the Law of Settlement the New Poor Law and other great matters all in the same quick flow of glancing picturesque speech and all with the same utter oblivion so it seemed to her stiff indignant hostess at the other end of the table of the manners and modesty proper to a young girl in a strange house and that young girl Richard Boyce s daughter Aldous struck in now and then trying to soothe her by supporting her to a certain extent and so divert the conversation But Marcella was soon too excited to be managed and she had her say a very strong say often as far as language went there could be no doubt of that Ah well said Lord Maxwell wincing at last under some of her phrases in spite of his courteous savoir faire I see you are of the same opinion as a good man whose book I took up yesterday The landlords of England have always shown a mean and malignant passion for profiting by the miseries of others Well Aldous my boy we are judged you and I no help for it The man whose temper and rule had made the prosperity of a whole country side for nearly forty years looked at his grandson with twinkling eyes Miss Raeburn was speechless Lady Winterbourne was absently staring at Marcella a spot of red on each pale cheek Then Marcella suddenly wavered looked across at Aldous and broke down Of course you think me very ridiculous she said with a tremulous change of tone I suppose I am And I am as inconsistent as anybody I hate myself for it Very often when anybody talks to me on the other side I am almost as much persuaded as I am by the Socialists they always told me in London I was the prey of the last speaker But it can t make any difference to one s feeling nothing touches that She turned to Lord Maxwell half appealing It is when I go down from our house to the village when I see the places the people live in when one is comfortable in the carriage and one passes some woman in the rain ragged and dirty and tired trudging back from her work when one realises that they have no rights when they come to be old nothing to look to but charity for which we who have everything expect them to be grateful and when I know that every one of them has done more useful work in a year of their life than I shall ever do in the whole of mine then I feel that the whole state of things is somehow wrong and topsy turvy and wicked Her voice rose a little every emphasis grew more passionate And if I don t do something the little such a person as I can to alter it before I die I might as well never have lived Everybody at table started Lord Maxwell looked at Miss Raeburn his mouth twitching over the humour of his sister s dismay Well this was a forcible young woman was Aldous the kind of man to be able to deal conveniently with such eyes such emotions such a personality Suddenly Lady Winterbourne s deep voice broke in I never could say it half so well as that Miss Boyce but I agree with you I may say that I have agreed with you all my life The girl turned to her grateful and quivering At the same time said Lady Winterbourne relapsing with a long breath from tragic emphasis into a fluttering indecision equally characteristic as you say one is inconsistent I was poor once before Edward came to the title and I did not at all like it not at all And I don t wish my daughters to marry poor men and what I should do without a maid or a carriage when I wanted it I cannot imagine Edward makes the most of these things He tells me I have to choose between things as they are and a graduated income tax which would leave nobody not even the richest more than four hundred a year Just enough for one of those little houses on your station road said Lord Maxwell laughing at her I think you might still have a maid There you laugh said Lady Winterbourne vehemently the men do But I tell you it is no laughing matter to feel that your heart and conscience have gone over to the enemy You want to feel with your class and you can t Think of what used to happen in the old days My grandmother who was as good and kind a woman as ever lived was driving home through our village one evening and a man passed her a labourer who was a little drunk and who did not take off his hat to her She stopped made her men get down and had him put in the stocks there and then the old stocks were still standing on the village green Then she drove home to her dinner and said her prayers no doubt that night with more consciousness than usual of having done her duty But if the power of the stocks still remained to us my dear friend and she laid her thin old woman s hand flashing with diamonds on Lord Maxwell s arm we could no longer do it you or I We have lost the sense of right in our place and position at least I find I have In the old days if there was social disturbance the upper class could put it down with a strong hand So they would still said Lord Maxwell drily if there were violence Once let it come to any real attack on property and you will see where all these Socialist theories will be And of course it will not be we not the landowners or the capitalists who will put it down It will be the hundreds and thousands of people with something to lose a few pounds in a joint stock mill a house of their own built through a company operative store an acre or two of land stocked by their own savings it is they I am afraid who will put Miss Boyce s friends down so far as they represent any real attack on property and brutally too I fear if need be I dare say exclaimed Marcella her colour rising again I never can see how we Socialists are to succeed But how can any one rejoice in it How can any one wish that the present state of things should go on Oh the horrors one sees in London And down here the cottages and the starvation wages and the ridiculous worship of game and then of course the poaching Miss Raeburn pushed back her chair with a sharp noise But her brother was still peeling his pear and no one else moved Why did he let such talk go on It was too unseemly Lord Maxwell only laughed My dear young lady he said much amused are you even in the frame of mind to make a hero of a poacher Disillusion lies that way it does indeed Why Aldous I have been hearing such tales from Westall this morning I stopped at Corbett s farm a minute or two on the way home and met Westall at the gate coming out He says he and his men are being harried to death round about Tudley End by a gang of men that come he thinks from Oxford a driving gang with a gig who come at night or in the early morning the smartest rascals out impossible to catch But he says he thinks he will soon have his hand on the local accomplice a Mellor man a man named Hurd not one of our labourers I think Hurd cried Marcella in dismay Oh no it can t be impossible Lord Maxwell looked at her in astonishment Do you know any Hurds I am afraid your father will find that Mellor is a bad place for poaching If it is it is because they are so starved and miserable said Marcella trying hard to speak coolly but excited almost beyond bounds by the conversation and all that it implied And the Hurds I don t believe it a bit But if it were true oh they have been in such straits they were out of work most of last winter they are out of work now No one could grudge them I told you about them didn t I she said suddenly glancing at Aldous I was going to ask you to day if you could help them Her prophetess air had altogether left her She felt ready to cry and nothing could have been more womanish than her tone He bent across to her Miss Raeburn invaded by a new and intolerable sense of calamity could have beaten him for what she read in his shining eyes and in the flush on his usually pale cheek Is he still out of work he said And you are unhappy about it But I am sure we can find him work I am just now planning improvements at the north end of the park We can take him on I am certain of it You must give me his full name and address And let him beware of Westall said Lord Maxwell kindly Give him a hint Miss Boyce and nobody will rake up bygones There is nothing I dislike so much as rows about the shooting All the keepers know that And of course said Miss Raeburn coldly if the family are in real distress there are plenty of people at hand to assist them The man need not steal Oh charity cried Marcella her lip curling A worse crime than poaching you think said Lord Maxwell laughing Well these are big subjects I confess after my morning with the lunatics I am half inclined like Horace Walpole to think everything serious ridiculous At any rate shall we see what light a cup of coffee throws upon it Agneta shall we adjourn CHAPTER XI Lord Maxwell closed the drawing room door behind Aldous and Marcella Aldous had proposed to take their guest to see the picture gallery which was on the first floor and had found her willing The old man came back to the two other women running his hand nervously through his shock of white hair a gesture which Miss Raeburn well knew to show some disturbance of mind I should like to have your opinion of that young lady he said deliberately taking a chair immediately in front of them I like her said Lady Winterbourne instantly Of course she is crude and extravagant and does not know quite what she may say But all that will improve I like her and shall make friends with her Miss Raeburn threw up her hands in angry amazement Most forward conceited and ill mannered she said with energy I am certain she has no proper principles and as to what her religious views may be I dread to think of them If that is a specimen of the girls of the present day My dear interrupted Lord Maxwell laying a hand on her knee Lady Winterbourne is an old friend a very old friend I think we may be frank before her and I don t wish you to say things you may regret Aldous has made up his mind to get that girl to marry him if he can Lady Winterbourne was silent having in fact been forewarned by that odd little interview with Aldous in her own drawing room when he had suddenly asked her to call on missus Boyce But she looked at Miss Raeburn That lady took up her knitting laid it down again resumed it then broke out How did it come about Where have they been meeting At the Hardens mostly He seems to have been struck from the beginning and now there is no question as to his determination But she may not have him he professes to be still entirely in the dark Oh cried Miss Raeburn with a scornful shrug meant to express all possible incredulity Then she began to knit fast and furiously and presently said in great agitation What can he be thinking of She is very handsome of course but then her words failed her When Aldous remembers his mother how can he undisciplined self willed Why she laid down the law to you Henry as though you had nothing to do but to take your opinions from a chit of a girl like her Oh no no I really can t you must give me time And her father the disgrace and trouble of it I tell you Henry it will bring misfortune Lord Maxwell was much troubled Certainly he should have talked to Agneta beforehand But the fact was he had his cowardice like other men and he had been trusting to the girl herself to this beauty he heard so much of to soften the first shock of the matter to the present mistress of the Court We will hope not Agneta he said gravely We will hope not But you must remember Aldous is no boy I cannot coerce him I see the difficulties and I have put them before him But I am more favourably struck with the girl than you are And anyway if it comes about we must make the best of it Miss Raeburn made no answer but pretended to set her heel her needles shaking Lady Winterbourne was very sorry for her two old friends Wait a little she said laying her hand lightly on Miss Raeburn s No doubt with her opinions she felt specially drawn to assert herself to day One can imagine it very well of a girl and a generous girl in her position You will see other sides of her I am sure you will And you would never you could never make a breach with Aldous We must all remember said Lord Maxwell getting up and beginning to walk up and down beside them that Aldous is in no way dependent upon me He has his own resources He could leave us to morrow Dependent on me It is the other way I think Agneta don t you He stopped and looked at her and she returned his look in spite of herself A tear dropped on her stocking which she hastily brushed away Come now said Lord Maxwell seating himself let us talk it over rationally Don t go Lady Winterbourne Why they may be settling it at this moment cried Miss Raeburn half choked and feeling as though the skies were impious not to fall No no he said smiling Not yet I think But let us prepare ourselves Meanwhile the cause of all this agitation was sitting languidly in a great Louis Quinze chair in the picture gallery upstairs with Aldous beside her She had taken off her big hat as though it oppressed her and her black head lay against a corner of the chair in fine contrast to its mellowed golds and crimsons Opposite to her were two famous Holbein portraits at which she looked from time to time as though attracted to them in spite of herself by some trained sense which could not be silenced But she was not communicative and Aldous was anxious Do you think I was rude to your grandfather she asked him at last abruptly cutting dead short some information she had stiffly asked him for just before as to the date of the gallery and its collection Rude he said startled Not at all Not in the least Do you suppose we are made of such brittle stuff we poor landowners that we can t stand an argument now and then Your aunt thought I was rude she said unheeding I think I was But a house like this excites me And with a little reckless gesture she turned her head over her shoulder and looked down the gallery A Velasquez was beside her a great Titian over the way a priceless Rembrandt beside it On her right hand stood a chair of carved steel presented by a German town to a German emperor which had not its equal in Europe the brocade draping the deep windows in front of her had been specially made to grace a state visit to the house of Charles II At Mellor she went on we are old and tumble down The rain comes in there are no shutters to the big hall and we can t afford to put them we can t afford even to have the pictures cleaned I can pity the house and nurse it as I do the village But here And looking about her she gave a significant shrug What our feathers again he said laughing But consider Even you allow that Socialism cannot begin to morrow There must be a transition time and clearly till the State is ready to take over the historical houses and their contents the present nominal owners of them are bound if they can to take care of them Otherwise the State will be some day defrauded She could not be insensible to the charm of his manner towards her There was in it no doubt the natural force and weight of the man older and better informed than his companion and amused every now and then by her extravagance But even her irritable pride could not take offence For the intellectual dissent she felt at bottom was tempered by a moral sympathy of which the gentleness and warmth touched and moved her in spite of herself And now that they were alone he could express himself So long as they had been in company he had seemed to her as often before shy hesitating and ineffective But with the disappearance of spectators who represented to him no doubt the harassing claim of the critical judgment all was freer more assured more natural She leant her chin on her hand considering his plea Supposing you live long enough to see the State take it shall you be able to reconcile yourself to it Or shall you feel it a wrong and go out a rebel A delightful smile was beginning to dance in the dark eyes She was recovering the tension of her talk with Lord Maxwell All must depend you see on the conditions on how you and your friends are going to manage the transition You may persuade me conceivably or you may eject me with violence Oh no she interposed quickly There will be no violence Only we shall gradually reduce your wages Of course we can t do without leaders we don t want to do away with the captains of any industry agricultural or manufacturing Only we think you overpaid You must be content with less Don t linger out the process he said laughing otherwise it will be painful The people who are condemned to live in these houses before the Commune takes to them while your graduated land and income taxes are slowly starving them out will have a bad time of it Well it will be your first bad time Think of the labourer now with five children of school age on twelve shillings a week think of the sweated women in London Ah think of them he said in a different tone There was a pause of silence No said Marcella springing up Don t let s think of them I get to believe the whole thing a pose in myself and other people Let s go back to the pictures Do you think Titian sweated his drapery men paid them starvation rates and grew rich on their labour Very likely All the same that blue woman she pointed to a bending Magdalen will be a joy to all time They wandered through the gallery and she was now all curiosity pleasure and intelligent interest as though she had thrown off an oppression Then they emerged into the upper corridor answering to the corridor of the antiques below This also was hung with pictures principally family portraits of the second order dating back to the Tudors a fine series of berobed and bejewelled personages wherein clothes pre dominated and character was unimportant Marcella s eye was glancing along the brilliant colour of the wall taking rapid note of jewelled necks surmounting stiff embroidered dresses of the whiteness of lace ruffs or the love locks and gleaming satin of the Caroline beauties when it suddenly occurred to her I shall be their successor This is already potentially mine In a few months if I please I shall be walking this house as mistress its future mistress at any rate She was conscious of a quickening in the blood a momentary blurring of the vision A whirlwind of fancies swept across her She thought of herself as the young peeress Lord Maxwell after all was over seventy her own white neck blazing with diamonds the historic jewels of a great family her will making law in this splendid house in the great domain surrounding it What power what a position what a romance She the out at elbows Marcella the Socialist the friend of the people What new lines of social action and endeavour she might strike out Miss Raeburn should not stop her She caressed the thought of the scandals in store for that lady Only it annoyed her that her dream of large things should be constantly crossed by this foolish delight making her feet dance in this mere prospect of satin gowns and fine jewels of young and feted beauty holding its brilliant court If she made such a marriage it should be it must be on public grounds Her friends must have no right to blame her Then she stole a glance at the tall quiet gentleman beside her A man to be proud of from the beginning and surely to be very fond of in time He would always be my friend she thought I could lead him He is very clever one can see and knows a great deal But he admires what I like His position hampers him but I could help him to get beyond it We might show the way to many Will you come and see this room here he said stopping suddenly yet with a certain hesitation in the voice It is my own sitting room There are one or two portraits I should like to show you if you would let me She followed him with a rosy cheek and they were presently standing in front of the portrait of his mother He spoke of his recollections of his parents quietly and simply yet she felt through every nerve that he was not the man to speak of such things to anybody in whom he did not feel a very strong and peculiar interest As he was talking a rush of liking towards him came across her How good he was how affectionate beneath his reserve a woman might securely trust him with her future So with every minute she grew softer her eye gentler and with each step and word he seemed to himself to be carried deeper into the current of joy Intoxication was mounting within him as her slim warm youth moved and breathed beside him and it was natural that he should read her changing behaviour for something other than it was A man of his type asks for no advance from the woman the woman he loves does not make them but at the same time he has a natural self esteem and believes readily in his power to win the return he is certain he will deserve And this she said moving restlessly towards his table and taking up the photograph of Edward Hallin Ah that is the greatest friend I have in the world But I am sure you know the name mister Hallin Edward Hallin She paused bewildered What the mister Hallin that was Edward Hallin who settled the Nottingham strike last month who lectures so much in the East End and in the north The same We are old college friends I owe him much and in all his excitements he does not forget old friends There you see and he opened a blotting book and pointed smiling to some closely written sheets lying within it is my last letter to him I often write two of those in the week and he to me We don t agree on a number of things but that doesn t matter What can you find to write about she said wondering I thought nobody wrote letters nowadays only notes Is it books or people Both when it pleases us How soon oh ye favouring gods might he reveal to her the part she herself played in those closely covered sheets But he writes to me on social matters chiefly His whole heart as you probably know is in certain experiments and reforms in which he sometimes asks me to help him Marcella opened her eyes These were new lights She began to recall all that she had heard of young Hallin s position in the Labour movement his personal magnetism and prestige his power as a speaker Her Socialist friends she remembered thought him in the way a force but a dangerous one He was for the follies of compromise could not be got to disavow the principle of private property while ready to go great lengths in certain directions towards collective action and corporate control The stalwarts of her sect would have none of him as a leader while admitting his charm as a human being a charm she remembered to have heard discussed with some anxiety among her Venturist friends But for ordinary people he went far enough Her father she remembered had dubbed him an Anarchist in connection with the terms he had been able to secure for the Nottingham strikers as reported in the newspapers It astonished her to come across the man again as mister Raeburn s friend They talked about Hallin a little and about Aldous s Cambridge acquaintance with him Then Marcella still nervous went to look at the bookshelves and found herself in front of that working collection of books on economics which Aldous kept in his own room under his hand by way of guide to the very fine special collection he was gradually making in the library downstairs Here again were surprises for her Aldous had never made the smallest claim to special knowledge on all those subjects she had so often insisted on making him discuss He had been always tentative and diffident deferential even so far as her own opinions were concerned And here already was the library of a student All the books she had ever read or heard discussed were here and as few among many The condition of them moreover the signs of close and careful reading she noticed in them as she took them out abashed her she had never learnt to read in this way It was her first contact with an exact and arduous culture She thought of how she had instructed Lord Maxwell at luncheon No doubt he shared his grandson s interests Her cheek burned anew this time because it seemed to her that she had been ridiculous I don t know why you never told me you took a particular interest in these subjects she said suddenly turning round upon him resentfully she had just laid down of all things a volume of Venturist essays You must have thought I talked a great deal of nonsense at luncheon Why I have always been delighted to find you cared for such things and took an interest in them How few women do he said quite simply opening his eyes Do you know these three pamphlets They were privately printed and are very rare He took out a book and showed it to her as one does to a comrade and equal as he might have done to Edward Hallin But something was jarred in her conscience or self esteem and she could not recover her sense of heroineship She answered absently and when he returned the book to the shelf she said that it was time for her to go and would he kindly ask for her maid who was to walk with her I will ring for her directly he said But you will let me take you home Then he added hurriedly I have some business this afternoon with a man who lives in your direction She assented a little stiffly but with an inward thrill His words and manner seemed suddenly to make the situation unmistakable Among the books it had been for the moment obscured He rang for his own servant and gave directions about the maid Then they went downstairs that Marcella might say good bye Miss Raeburn bade her guest farewell with a dignity which her small person could sometimes assume not unbecomingly Lady Winterbourne held the girl s hand a little looked her out of countenance and insisted on her promising again to come to Winterbourne Park the following Tuesday Then Lord Maxwell with old fashioned politeness made Marcella take his arm through the hall You must come and see us again he said smiling though we are such belated old Tories we are not so bad as we sound And under cover of his mild banter he fixed a penetrating attentive look upon her Flushed and embarrassed Had it indeed been done already or would Aldous settle it on this walk To judge from his manner and hers the thing was going with rapidity Well well there was nothing for it but to hope for the best On their way through the hall she stopped him her hand still in his arm Aldous was in front at the door looking for a light shawl she had brought with her I should like to thank you she said shyly about the Hurds It will be very kind of you and mister Raeburn to find them work Lord Maxwell was pleased and with the usual unfair advantage of beauty her eyes and curving lips gave her little advance a charm infinitely beyond what any plainer woman could have commanded Oh don t thank me he said cheerily Thank Aldous He does all that kind of thing And if in your good works you want any help we can give ask it my dear young lady My old comrade s grand daughter will always find friends in this house Lord Maxwell would have been very much astonished to hear himself making this speech six weeks before As it was he handed her over gallantly to Aldous and stood on the steps looking after them in a stir of mind not unnoted by the confidential butler who held the door open behind him Would Aldous insist on carrying his wife off to the dower house on the other side of the estate or would they be content to stay in the old place with the old people And if so how were that girl and his sister to get on As for himself he was of a naturally optimist temper and ever since the night of his first interview with Aldous on the subject he had been more and more inclining to take a cheerful view He liked to see a young creature of such evident character and cleverness holding opinions and lines of her own It was infinitely better than mere nonentity Of course she was now extravagant and foolish perhaps vain too But that would mend with time mend above all with her position as Aldous s wife Aldous was a strong man how strong Lord Maxwell suspected that this impetuous young lady hardly knew No he thought the family might be trusted to cope with her when once they got her among them And she would certainly be an ornament to the old house Her father of course was and would be the real difficulty and the blight which had descended on the once honoured name But a man so conscious of many kinds of power as Lord Maxwell could not feel much doubt as to his own and his grandson s competence to keep so poor a specimen of humanity as Richard Boyce in his place How wretchedly ill how feeble both in body and soul the fellow had looked when he and Winterbourne met him The white haired owner of the Court walked back slowly to his library his hands in his pockets his head bent in cogitation Impossible to settle to the various important political letters lying on his table and bearing all of them on that approaching crisis in the spring which must put Lord Maxwell and his friends in power He was over seventy but his old blood quickened within him as he thought of those two on this golden afternoon among the beech woods How late Aldous had left all these experiences His grandfather by twenty could have shown him the way Meanwhile the two in question were walking along the edge of the hill rampart overlooking the plain with the road on one side of them and the falling beech woods on the other They were on a woodland path just within the trees sheltered and to all intents and purposes alone The maid with leisurely discretion was following far behind them on the high road Marcella who felt at moments as though she could hardly breathe by reason of a certain tumult of nerve was yet apparently bent on maintaining a conversation without breaks As they diverged from the road into the wood path she plunged into the subject of her companion s election prospects How many meetings did he find that he must hold in the month What places did he regard as his principal strongholds She was told that certain villages which she named were certain to go Radical whatever might be the Tory promises As to a well known Conservative League which was very strong in the country and to which all the great ladies including Lady Winterbourne belonged was he actually going to demean himself by accepting its support How was it possible to defend the bribery buns and beer by which it won its corrupting way Altogether a quick fire of questions remarks and sallies which Aldous met and parried as best he might comforting himself all the time by thought of those deeper and lonelier parts of the wood which lay before them At last she dropped out half laughing half defiant words which arrested him Well I shall know what the other side think of their prospects very soon mister Wharton is coming to lunch with us to morrow Harry Wharton he said astonished But mister Boyce is not supporting him Your father I think is Conservative One of Dick Boyce s first acts as owner of Mellor when social rehabilitation had still looked probable to him had been to send a contribution to the funds of the League aforesaid so that Aldous had public and conspicuous grounds for his remark Need one measure everything by politics she asked him a little disdainfully Mayn t one even feed a Radical He winced visibly a moment touched in his philosopher s pride You remind me he said laughing and reddening and justly that an election perverts all one s standards and besmirches all one s morals Then I suppose mister Wharton is an old friend Papa never saw him before last week she said carelessly Now he talks of asking him to stay some time and says that although he won t vote for him he hopes that he will make a good fight Raeburn s brow contracted in a puzzled frown He will make an excellent fight he said rather shortly Dodgson hardly hopes to get in Harry Wharton is a most taking speaker a very clever fellow and sticks at nothing in the way of promises Ah you will find him interesting Miss Boyce He has a company operative farm on his Lincolnshire property Last year he started a Labour paper which I believe you read I have heard you quote it He believes in all that you hope for great increase in local government and communal control the land for the people graduated income tax the extinction of landlord and capitalist as soon as may be e tutti quanti He talks with great eloquence and ability In our villages I find he is making way every week The people think his manners perfect Ee as a way wi un said an old labourer to me last week If ee wor to coe the wild birds I do believe Muster Raeburn they d coom to un Yet you dislike him said Marcella a daring smile dancing on the dark face she turned to him One can hear it in every word you say He hesitated trying even at the moment that an impulse of jealous alarm which astonished himself had taken possession of him to find the moderate and measured phrase I have known him from a boy he said He is a connection of the Levens and used to be always there in old days He is very brilliant and very gifted Your but must be very bad she threw in it is so long in coming Then I will say whatever opening it gives you he replied with spirit that I admire him without respecting him Who ever thought otherwise of a clever opponent she cried It is the stock formula The remark stung all the more because Aldous was perfectly conscious that there was much truth in her implied charge of prejudice He had never been very capable of seeing this particular man in the dry light of reason and was certainly less so than before since it had been revealed to him that Wharton and mister Boyce s daughter were to be brought before long into close neighbourhood I am sorry that I seem to you such a Pharisee he said turning upon her a look which had both pain and excitement in it She was silent and they walked on a few yards without speaking The wood had thickened around them The high road was no longer visible No sound of wheels or footsteps reached them The sun struck freely through the beech trees already half bared whitening the grey trunks at intervals to an arrowy distinctness and majesty or kindling the slopes of red and freshly fallen leaves below into great patches of light and flame Through the stems as always the girdling blues of the plain and in their faces a gay and buoyant breeze speaking rather of spring than autumn Robins yellow autumn s nightingales sang in the hedge to their right In the pause between them sun wind birds made their charm felt Nature perpetual chorus as she is to man stole in urging wooing defining Aldous s heart leapt to the spur of a sudden resolve Instinctively she turned to him at the same moment as he to her and seeing his look she paled a little Do you guess at all why it hurts me to jar with you he said finding his words in a rush he did not know how Why every syllable of yours matters to me It is because I have hopes dreams which have become my life If you could accept this this feeling this devotion which has grown up in me if you could trust yourself to me you should have no cause I think ever to think me hard or narrow towards any person any enthusiasm for which you had sympathy May I say to you all that is in my mind or or am I presuming She looked away from him crimson again A great wave of exultation boundless intoxicating swept through her Then it was checked by a nobler feeling a quick penitent sense of his nobleness You don t know me she said hurriedly you think you do But I am all odds and ends I should annoy wound disappoint you His quiet grey eyes flamed Come and sit down here on these dry roots he said taking already joyous command of her We shall be undisturbed I have so much to say She obeyed trembling She felt no passion but the strong thrill of something momentous and irreparable together with a swelling pride pride in such homage from such a man He led her a few steps down the slope found a place for her against a sheltering trunk and threw himself down beside her As he looked up at the picture she made amid the autumn branches at her bent head her shy moved look her white hand lying ungloved on her black dress happiness overcame him He took her hand found she did not resist drew it to him and clasping it in both his bent his brow his lips upon it It shook in his hold but she was passive The mixture of emotion and self control she showed touched him deeply In his chivalrous modesty he asked for nothing else dreamt of nothing more Half an hour later they were still in the same spot There had been much talk between them most of it earnest but some of it quite gay broken especially by her smiles Her teasing mood however had passed away She was instead composed and dignified like one conscious that life had opened before her to great issues Yet she had flinched often before that quiet tone of eager joy in which he had described his first impressions of her his surprise at finding in her ideals revolts passions quite unknown to him so far in the women of his own class Naturally he suppressed perhaps he had even forgotten the critical amusement and irritation she had often excited in him He remembered he spoke only of sympathy delight pleasure of his sense as it were of slaking some long felt moral thirst at the well of her fresh feeling So she had attracted him first by a certain strangeness and daring by what she said Now and above all by what you are he broke out suddenly moved out of his even speech Oh it is too much to believe to dream of Put your hand in mine and say again that it is really true that we two are to go forward together that you will be always there to inspire to help And as she gave him the hand she must also let him in this first tremor of a pure passion take the kiss which was now his by right That she should flush and draw away from him as she did seemed to him the most natural thing in the world and the most maidenly Then as their talk wandered on bit by bit he gave her all his confidence and she had felt herself honoured in receiving it She understood now at least something a first fraction of that inner life masked so well beneath his quiet English capacity and unassuming manner He had spoken of his Cambridge years of his friend of the desire of his heart to make his landowner s power and position contribute something towards that new and better social order which he too like Hallin though more faintly and intermittently believed to be approaching The difficulties of any really new departure were tremendous he saw them more plainly and more anxiously than Hallin Yet he believed that he had thought his way to some effective reform on his grandfather s large estate and to some useful work as one of a group of like minded men in Parliament She must have often thought him careless and apathetic towards his great trust But he was not so not careless but paralysed often by intellectual difficulty by the claims of conflicting truths She too explained herself most freely most frankly She would have nothing on her conscience They will say of course she said with sudden nervous abruptness that I am marrying you for wealth and position And in a sense I shall be No don t stop me I should not marry you if if I did not like you But you can give me you have great opportunities I tell you frankly I shall enjoy them and use them Oh do think well before you do it I shall never be a meek dependent wife A woman to my mind is bound to cherish her own individuality sacredly married or not married Have you thought that I may often think it right to do things you disagree with that may scandalise your relations You shall be free he said steadily I have thought of it all Then there is my father she said turning her head away He is ill he wants pity affection I will accept no bond that forces me to disown him Pity and affection are to me the most sacred things in the world he said kissing her hand gently Be content be at rest my beautiful lady There was again silence full of thought on her side of heavenly happiness on his The sun had sunk almost to the verge of the plain the wind had freshened We must go home she said springing up Taylor must have got there an hour ago Mother will be anxious and I must I must tell them I will leave you at the gate he suggested as they walked briskly and you will ask your father will you not if I may see him to night after dinner The trees thinned again in front of them and the path curved inward to the front Suddenly a man walking on the road diverged into the path and came towards them He was swinging a stick and humming His head was uncovered and his light chestnut curls were blown about his forehead by the wind Marcella looking up at the sound of the steps had a sudden impression of something young and radiant and Aldous stopped with an exclamation The new comer perceived them and at sight of Aldous smiled and approached holding out his hand Why Raeburn I seem to have missed you twenty times a day this last fortnight We have been always on each other s tracks without meeting Yet I think if we had met we could have kept our tempers Miss Boyce I think you do not know mister Wharton said Aldous stiffly May I introduce you The young man s blue eyes all alert and curious at the mention of Marcella s name ran over the girl s face and form Then he bowed with a certain charming exaggeration like an eighteenth century beau with his hand upon his heart and turned back with them a step or two towards the road BOOK II A woman has enough to govern wisely Her own demeanours passions and divisions CHAPTER I On a certain night in the December following the engagement of Marcella Boyce to Aldous Raeburn the woods and fields of Mellor and all the bare rampart of chalk down which divides the Buckinghamshire plain from the forest upland of the Chilterns lay steeped in moonlight and in the silence which belongs to intense frost Winter had set in before the leaf had fallen from the last oaks already there had been a fortnight or more of severe cold with hardly any snow The pastures were delicately white the ditches and the wet furrows in the ploughed land the ponds on Mellor common and the stagnant pool in the midst of the village whence it drew its main water supply were frozen hard But the ploughed chalk land itself lay a dull grey beside the glitter of the pastures and the woods under the bright sun of the days dropped their rime only to pass once more with the deadly cold of the night under the fantastic empire of the frost Every day the veil of morning mist rose lightly from the woods uncurtaining the wintry spectacle and melting into the brilliant azure of an unflecked sky every night the moon rose without a breath of wind without a cloud and all the branch work of the trees where they stood in the open fields lay reflected clean and sharp on the whitened ground The bitter cold stole into the cottages marking the old and feeble with the touch of Azrael while without in the field solitudes bird and beast cowered benumbed and starving in hole and roosting place How still it was this midnight on the fringe of the woods Two men sitting concealed among some bushes at the edge of mister Boyce s largest cover and bent upon a common errand hardly spoke to each other so strange and oppressive was the silence One was Jim Hurd the other was a labourer a son of old Patton of the almshouses himself a man of nearly sixty with a small wizened face showing sharp and white to night under his slouched hat They looked out over a shallow cup of treeless land to a further bound of wooded hill ending towards the north in a bare bluff of down shining steep under the moon They were in shadow and so was most of the wide dip of land before them but through a gap to their right beyond the wood the moonbeams poured and the farms nestling under the opposite ridge the plantations ranging along it and the bald beacon hill in which it broke to the plain were all in radiant light Not a stir of life anywhere Hurd put up his hand to his ear and leaning forward listened intently Suddenly a vibration a dull thumping sound in the soil of the bank immediately beside him He started dropped his hand and stooping laid his ear to the ground Gi us the bag he said to his companion drawing himself upright You can hear em turnin and creepin as plain as anything Now then you take these and go t other side He handed over a bundle of rabbit nets Patton crawling on hands and knees climbed over the low overgrown bank on which the hedge stood into the precincts of the wood itself The state of the hedge leaving the cover practically open and defenceless along its whole boundary showed plainly enough that it belonged to the Mellor estate But the field beyond was Lord Maxwell s Hurd applied himself to netting the holes on his own side pushing the brambles and undergrowth aside with the sure hand of one who had already reconnoitred the ground Then he crept over to Patton to see that all was right on the other side came back and went for the ferrets of whom he had four in a closely tied bag A quarter of an hour of intense excitement followed In all five rabbits bolted three on Hurd s side two on Patton s It was all the two men could do to secure their prey manage the ferrets and keep a watch on the holes Hurd s great hands now fixing the pegs that held the nets now dealing death to the entangled rabbit whose neck he broke in an instant by a turn of the thumb now winding up the line that held the ferret seemed to be everywhere At last a ferret laid up the string attached to him having either slipped or broken greatly to the disgust of the men who did not want to be driven either to dig which made a noise and took time or to lose their animal The rabbits made no more sign and it was tolerably evident that they had got as much as they were likely to get out of that particular bury Hurd thrust his arm deep into the hole where he had put the ferret Ther s summat in the way he declared at last Mos likely a dead un Gi me the spade He dug away the mouth of the hole making as little noise as possible and tried again Ere ee be he cried clutching at something drew it out exclaimed in disgust flung it away and pounced upon a rabbit which on the removal of the obstacle followed like a flash pursued by the lost ferret Hurd caught the rabbit by the neck held it by main force and killed it then put the ferret into his pocket Lord he said wiping his brow they do come suddent What he had pulled out was a dead cat a wretched puss who on some happy hunt had got itself wedged in the hole and so perished there miserably He and Patton stooped over it wondering then Hurd walked some paces along the bank looking warily out to the right of him across the open country all the time He threw the poor malodorous thing far into the wood and returned The two men lit their pipes under the shelter of the bushes and rested a bit well hidden but able to see out through a break in the bit of thicket Six on em said Hurd looking at the stark creatures beside him I be too done to try another bury I ll set a snare or two an be off home Patton puffed silently He was wondering whether Hurd would give him one rabbit or two Hurd had both plant and skill and Patton would have been glad enough to come for one Still he was a plaintive man with a perpetual grievance and had already made up his mind that Hurd would treat him shabbily to night in spite of many past demonstrations that his companion was on the whole of a liberal disposition You bin out workin a day s work already han t yer he said presently He himself was out of work like half the village and had been presented by his wife with boiled swede for supper But he knew that Hurd had been taken on at the works at the Court where the new drive was being made and a piece of ornamental water enlarged and improved mainly for the sake of giving employment in bad times He Patton and some of his mates had tried to get a job there But the steward had turned them back The men off the estate had first claim and there was not room for all of them Yet Hurd had been taken on which had set people talking Hurd nodded and said nothing He was not disposed to be communicative on the subject of his employment at the Court An it be true as she be goin to marry Muster Raeburn Patton jerked his head towards the right where above a sloping hedge the chimneys of Mellor and the tops of the Mellor cedars some two or three fields away showed distinct against the deep night blue Hurd nodded again and smoked diligently Patton nettled by this parsimony of speech made the inward comment that his companion was a deep un The village was perfectly aware of the particular friendship shown by Miss Boyce to the Hurds He was goaded into trying a more stinging topic Westall wor braggin last night at Bradsell s Bradsell was the landlord of The Green Man at Mellor ee said as how they d taken you on at the Court but that didn t prevent em knowin as you was a bad lot Ee said ee ad is eye on yer ee ad warned yer twoice last year That s a lie said Hurd removing his pipe an instant and putting it back again Patton looked more cheerful Well ee spoke cru l Ee was certain ee said as you could tell a thing or two about them coverts at Tudley End if the treuth were known You wor allus a loafer an a loafer you d be Yer might go snivellin to Miss Boyce ee said but yer wouldn t do no honest work ee said not if yer could help it that s what ee said Devil said Hurd between his teeth with a quick lift of all his great misshapen chest He took his pipe out of his mouth rammed it down fiercely with his thumb and put it in his pocket Look out exclaimed Patton with a start A whistle clear and distinct from the opposite side of the hollow Then a man s figure black and motionless an instant on the whitened down with a black speck beside it lastly another figure higher up along the hill in quick motion towards the first with other specks behind it The poachers instantly understood that it was Westall whose particular beat lay in this part of the estate signalling to his night watcher Charlie Dynes and that the two men would be on them in no time It was the work of a few seconds to efface as far as possible the traces of their raid to drag some thick and trailing brambles which hung near over the mouth of the hole where there had been digging to catch up the ferrets and game and to bid Hurd s lurcher to come to heel The two men crawled up the ditch with their burdens as far away to leeward as they could get from the track by which the keepers would cross the field The ditch was deeply overgrown and when the approaching voices warned them to lie close they crouched under a dense thicket of brambles and overhanging bushes afraid of nothing but the noses of the keepers dogs Dogs and men however passed unsuspecting Hold still said Hurd checking Patton s first attempt to move He ll be back again mos like It s is dodge And sure enough in twenty minutes or so the men reappeared They retraced their steps from the further corner of the field where some preserves of Lord Maxwell s approached very closely to the big Mellor wood and came back again along the diagonal path within fifty yards or so of the men in the ditch In the stillness the poachers could hear Westall s harsh and peremptory voice giving some orders to his underling or calling to the dogs who had scattered a little in the stubble Hurd s own dog quivered beside him once or twice Then steps and voices faded into the distance and all was safe The poachers crept out grinning and watched the keepers progress along the hill face till they disappeared into the Maxwell woods Ee be sold again blast im said Hurd with a note of quite disproportionate exultation in his queer cracked voice Now I ll set them snares But you d better git home Patton took the hint gave a grunt of thanks as his companion handed him two rabbits which he stowed away in the capacious pockets of his poacher s coat and slouched off home by as sheltered and roundabout a way as possible Hurd left to himself stowed his nets and other apparatus in a hidden crevice of the bank and strolled along to set his snares in three hare runs well known to him round the further side of the wood Then he waited impatiently for the striking of the clock in Mellor church The cold was bitter but his night s work was not over yet and he had had very good reasons for getting rid of Patton Almost immediately the bell rang out the echo rolling round the bend of the hills in the frosty silence Half past twelve Hurd scrambled over the ditch pushed his way through the dilapidated hedge and began to climb the ascent of the wood The outskirts of it were filled with a thin mixed growth of sapling and underwood but the high centre of it was crowned by a grove of full grown beeches through which the moon now at its height was playing freely as Hurd clambered upwards amid the dead leaves just freshly strewn as though in yearly festival about their polished trunks Such infinite grace and strength in the line work of the branches branches not bent into gnarled and unexpected fantasies like those of the oak but gathered into every conceivable harmony of upward curve and sweep rising all together black against the silvery light each tree related to and completing its neighbour as though the whole wood so finely rounded on itself and to the hill were but one majestic conception of a master artist But Hurd saw nothing of this as he plunged through the leaves He was thinking that it was extremely likely a man would be on the look out for him to night under the big beeches a man with some business to propose to him A few words dropped in his ear at a certain public house the night before had seemed to him to mean this and he had accordingly sent Patton out of the way But when he got to the top of the hill no one was to be seen or heard and he sat him down on a fallen log to smoke and wait awhile He had no sooner however taken his seat than he shifted it uneasily turning himself round so as to look in the other direction For in front of him as he was first placed there was a gap in the trees and over the lower wood plainly visible and challenging attention rose the dark mass of Mellor House And the sight of Mellor suggested reflections just now that were not particularly agreeable to Jim Hurd He had just been poaching mister Boyce s rabbits without any sort of scruple But the thought of Miss Boyce was not pleasant to him when he was out on these nightly raids Why had she meddled He bore her a queer sort of grudge for it He had just settled down to the bit of cobbling which together with his wife s plait served him for a blind and was full of a secret excitement as to various plans he had in hand for doing Westall combining a maximum of gain for the winter with a maximum of safety when Miss Boyce walked in radiant with the news that there was employment for him at the Court on the new works whenever he liked to go and ask for it And then she had given him an odd look And I was to pass you on a message from Lord Maxwell Hurd she had said You tell him to keep out of Westall s way for the future and bygones shall be bygones Now I m not going to ask what that means If you ve been breaking some of our landlords law I m not going to say I m shocked I d alter the law to morrow if I could you know I would But I do say you re a fool if you go on with it now you ve got good work for the winter you must please remember your wife and children And there he had sat like a log staring at her both he and Minta not knowing where to look or how to speak Then at last his wife had broken out crying Oh miss we should ha starved And Miss Boyce had stopped her in a moment catching her by the hand Didn t she know it Was she there to preach to them Only Hurd must promise not to do it any more for his wife s sake And he stammering left without excuse or resource either against her charge or the work she offered him had promised her and promised her moreover in his trepidation with more fervency than he at all liked to remember For about a fortnight perhaps he had gone to the Court by day and had kept indoors by night Then just as the vagabond passions the Celtic instincts so long repressed so lately roused were goading at him again he met Westall in the road Westall who looked him over from top to toe with an insolent smile as much as to say Well my man we ve got the whip hand of you now That same night he crept out again in the dark and the early morning in spite of all Minta s tears and scolding Well what matter As towards the rich and the law he had the morals of the slave who does not feel that he has had any part in making the rules he is expected to keep and breaks them when he can with glee It made him uncomfortable certainly that Miss Boyce should come in and out of their place as she did should be teaching Willie to read and bringing her old dresses to make up for Daisy and Nellie while he was making a fool of her in this way Still he took it all as it came One sensation wiped out another Besides Miss Boyce had after all much part in this double life of his Whenever he was at home sitting over the fire with a pipe he read those papers and things she had brought him in the summer He had not taken much notice of them at first Now he spelled them out again and again He had always thought them rich people took advantage of yer But he had never supposed somehow they were such thieves such mean thieves as it appeared they were A curious ferment filled his restless inconsequent brain The poor were downtrodden but they were coming to their rights The land and its creatures were for the people not for the idle rich Above all Westall was a devil and must be put down For the rest if he could have given words to experience he would have said that since he began to go out poaching he had burst his prison and found himself A life which was not merely endurance pulsed in him The scent of the night woods the keenness of the night air the tracks and ways of the wild creatures the wiles by which he slew them the talents and charms of his dog Bruno these things had developed in him new aptitudes both of mind and body which were in themselves exhilaration He carried his dwarf s frame more erect breathed from an ampler chest As for his work at the Court he thought of it often with impatience and disgust It was a more useful blind than his cobbling or he would have shammed illness and got quit of it Them were sharp uns that managed that business at Tudley End He fell thinking about it and chuckling over it as he smoked Two of Westall s best coverts swept almost clear just before the big shoot in November and all done so quick and quiet before you could say Jack Robinson Well there was plenty more yet more woods and more birds There were those coverts down there on the Mellor side of the hollow they had been kept for the last shoot in January Hang him why wasn t that fellow up to time But no one came and he must sit on shivering and smoking a sack across his shoulders As the stir of nerve and blood caused by the ferreting subsided his spirits began to sink Mists of Celtic melancholy perhaps of Celtic superstition gained upon him He found himself glancing from side to side troubled by the noises in the wood A sad light wind crept about the trunks like a whisper the owls called overhead sometimes there was a sudden sharp rustle or fall of a branch that startled him Yet he knew every track every tree in that wood Up and down that field outside he had followed his father at the plough a little sickly object of a lad yet seldom unhappy so long as childhood lasted and his mother s temper could be fled from either at school or in the fields Under that boundary hedge to the right he had lain stunned and bleeding all a summer afternoon after old Westall had thrashed him his heart scorched within him by the sense of wrong and the craving for revenge On that dim path leading down the slope of the wood George Westall had once knocked him down for disturbing a sitting pheasant He could see himself falling the tall powerful lad standing over him with a grin Then inconsequently he began to think of his father s death He made a good end did the old man Jim my lad the Lord s verra merciful or Jim you ll look after Ann Ann was the only daughter Then a sigh or two and a bit of sleep and it was done And everybody must go the same way must come to the same stopping of the breath the same awfulness in a life of blind habit of a moment that never had been before and never could be again He did not put it to these words but the shudder that is in the thought for all of us seized him He was very apt to think of dying to ponder in his secret heart how it would be and when And always it made him very soft towards Minta and the children Not only did the life instinct cling to them to the warm human hands and faces hemming him in and protecting him from that darkness beyond with its shapes of terror But to think of himself as sick and gasping to his end like his father was to put himself back in his old relation to his wife when they were first married He might cross Minta now but if he came to lie sick he could see himself there in the future following her about with his eyes and thanking her and doing all she told him just as he d used to do He couldn t die without her to help him through The very idea of her being taken first roused in him a kind of spasm a fierceness a clenching of the hands But all the same in this poaching matter he must have his way and she must just get used to it Ah a low whistle from the further side of the wood He replied and was almost instantly joined by a tall slouching youth by day a blacksmith s apprentice at Gairsley the Maxwells village who had often brought him information before The two sat talking for ten minutes or so on the log Then they parted Hurd went back to the ditch where he had left the game put two rabbits into his pockets left the other two to be removed in the morning when he came to look at his snares and went off home keeping as much as possible in the shelter of the hedges On one occasion he braved the moonlight and the open field rather than pass through a woody corner where an old farmer had been found dead some six years before Then he reached a deep lane leading to the village and was soon at his own door As he climbed the wooden ladder leading to the one bedroom where he his wife and his four children slept his wife sprang up in bed Jim you must be perished such a night as t is Oh Jim where ha you bin She was a miserable figure in her coarse nightgown with her grizzling hair wild about her and her thin arms nervously outstretched along the bed The room was freezing cold and the moonlight stealing through the scanty bits of curtains brought into dismal clearness the squalid bed the stained walls and bare uneven floor On an iron bedstead at the foot of the large bed lay Willie restless and coughing with the elder girl beside him fast asleep the other girl lay beside her mother and the wooden box with rockers which held the baby stood within reach of missus Hurd s arm He made her no answer but went to look at the coughing boy who had been in bed for a week with bronchitis You ve never been and got in Westall s way again she said anxiously It s no good my tryin to get a wink o sleep when you re out like this Don t you worrit yourself he said to her not roughly but decidedly I m all right This boy s bad Minta Yes an I kep up the fire an put the spout on the kettle too She pointed to the grate and to the thin line of steam which was doing its powerless best against the arctic cold of the room Hurd bent over the boy and tried to put him comfortable The child weak and feverish only began to cry a hoarse bronchial crying which threatened to wake the baby He could not be stopped so Hurd made haste to take off his own coat and boots and then lifted the poor soul in his arms You ll be quiet Will and go sleep won t yer if daddy takes keer on you He wrapped his own coat round the little fellow and lying down beside his wife took him on his arm and drew the thin brown blankets over himself and his charge He himself was warm with exercise and in a little while the huddling creatures on either side of him were warm too The quick panting breath of the boy soon showed that he was asleep His father too sank almost instantly into deep gulfs of sleep Only the wife nervous overdone and possessed by a thousand fears lay tossing and wakeful hour after hour while the still glory of the winter night passed by CHAPTER II Well Marcella have you and Lady Winterbourne arranged your classes missus Boyce was stooping over a piece of needlework beside a window in the Mellor drawing room trying to catch the rapidly failing light It was one of the last days of December Marcella had just come in from the village rather early for they were expecting a visitor to arrive about tea time and had thrown herself tired into a chair near her mother We have got about ten or eleven of the younger women to join none of the old ones will come said Marcella Lady Winterbourne has heard of a capital teacher from Dunstable and we hope to get started next week There is money enough to pay wages for three months In spite of her fatigue her eye was bright and restless The energy of thought and action from which she had just emerged still breathed from every limb and feature Where have you got the money mister Raeburn has managed it said Marcella briefly missus Boyce gave a slight shrug of the shoulders And afterwards what is to become of your product There is a London shop Lady Winterbourne knows will take what we make if it turns out well Of course we don t expect to pay our way Marcella gave her explanations with a certain stiffness of self defence She and Lady Winterbourne had evolved a scheme for reviving and improving the local industry of straw plaiting which after years of decay seemed now on the brink of final disappearance The village women who could at present earn a few pence a week by the coarser kinds of work were to be instructed not only in the finer and better paid sorts but also in the making up of the plait when done and the blocking of hats and bonnets processes hitherto carried on exclusively at one or two large local centres You don t expect to pay your way repeated missus Boyce What never Well we shall give twelve to fourteen shillings a week wages We shall find the materials and the room and prices are very low the whole trade depressed missus Boyce laughed I see How many workers do you expect to get together Oh eventually about two hundred in the three villages It will regenerate the whole life said Marcella a sudden ray from the inner warmth escaping her against her will missus Boyce smiled again and turned her work so as to see it better Does Aldous understand what you are letting him in for Marcella flushed Perfectly It is ransom that s all And he is ready to take your view of it Oh he thinks us economically unsound of course said Marcella impatiently So we are All care for the human being under the present state of things is economically unsound But he likes it no more than I do Well lucky for you he has a long purse said missus Boyce lightly But I gather Marcella you don t insist upon his spending it all on straw plaiting He told me yesterday he had taken the Hertford Street house We shall live quite simply said Marcella quickly What no carriage Marcella hesitated A carriage saves time And if one goes about much it does not cost so much more than cabs So you mean to go about much Lady Winterbourne talks to me of presenting you in May That s Miss Raeburn cried Marcella She says I must and all the family would be scandalised if I didn t go But you can t imagine She stopped and took off her hat pushing the hair back from her forehead A look of worry and excitement had replaced the radiant glow of her first resting moments That you like it said missus Boyce bluntly Well I don t know Most young women like pretty gowns and great functions and prominent positions I don t call you an ascetic Marcella Marcella winced One has to fit oneself to circumstances she said proudly One may hate the circumstances but one can t escape them Oh I don t think you will hate your circumstances my dear You would be very foolish if you did Have you heard finally how much the settlement is to be No said Marcella shortly I have not asked papa nor anybody It was only settled this morning Your father told me hurriedly as he went out You are to have two thousand a year of your own The tone was dry and the speaker s look as she turned towards her daughter had in it a curious hostility but Marcella did not notice her mother s manner It is too much she said in a low voice She had thrown back her head against the chair in which she sat and her half troubled eyes were wandering over the darkening expanse of lawn and avenue He said he wished you to feel perfectly free to live your own life and to follow out your own projects Oh for a person of projects my dear it is not so much You will do well to husband it Keep it for yourself Get what you want out of it not what other people want Again Marcella s attention missed the note of agitation in her mother s sharp manner A soft look a look of compunction passed across her face missus Boyce began to put her working things away finding it too dark to do any more By the way said the mother suddenly I suppose you will be going over to help him in his canvassing this next few weeks Your father says the election will be certainly in February Marcella moved uneasily He knows she said at last that I don t agree with him in so many things He is so full of this Peasant Proprietors Bill And I hate peasant properties They are nothing but a step backwards missus Boyce lifted her eyebrows That s unlucky He tells me it is likely to be his chief work in the new Parliament Isn t it on the whole probable that he knows more about the country than you do Marcella Marcella sat up with sudden energy and gathered her walking things together It isn t knowledge that s the question mamma it s the principle of the thing I mayn t know anything but the people whom I follow know There are the two sides of thought the two ways of looking at things I warned Aldous when he asked me to marry him which I belonged to And he accepted it missus Boyce s thin fine mouth curled a little So you suppose that Aldous had his wits about him on that great occasion as much as you had Marcella first started then quivered with nervous indignation Mother she said I can t bear it It s not the first time that you have talked as though I had taken some unfair advantage made an unworthy bargain It is too hard too Other people may think what they like but that you Her voice failed her and the tears came into her eyes She was tired and over excited and the contrast between the atmosphere of flattery and consideration which surrounded her in Aldous s company in the village or at the Winterbournes and this tone which her mother so often took with her when they were alone was at the moment hardly to be endured missus Boyce looked up more gravely You misunderstand me my dear she said quietly I allow myself to wonder at you a little but I think no hard things of you ever I believe you like Aldous Really mamma cried Marcella half hysterically missus Boyce had by now rolled up her work and shut her workbasket If you are going to take off your things she said please tell William that there will be six or seven at tea You said I think that mister Raeburn was going to bring mister Hallin Yes and Frank Leven is coming When will mister Wharton be here Oh in ten minutes or so if his train is punctual I hear your father just coming in Marcella went away and missus Boyce was left a few minutes alone Her thin hands lay idle a moment on her lap and leaning towards the window beside her she looked out an instant into the snowy twilight Her mind was full of its usual calm scorn for those her daughter included who supposed that the human lot was to be mended by a rise in weekly wages or that suffering has any necessary dependence on the amount of commodities of which a man disposes What hardship is there in starving and scrubbing and toiling Had she ever seen a labourer s wife scrubbing her cottage floor without envy without moral thirst Is it these things that kill or any of the great simple griefs and burdens Doth man live by bread alone The whole language of social and charitable enthusiasm often raised in her a kind of exasperation So Marcella would be rich excessively rich even now Outside the amount settled upon her the figures of Aldous Raeburn s present income irrespective of the inheritance which would come to him on his grandfather s death were a good deal beyond what even mister Boyce upon whom the daily spectacle of the Maxwell wealth exercised a certain angering effect had supposed missus Boyce had received the news of the engagement with astonishment but her after acceptance of the situation had been marked by all her usual philosophy Probably behind the philosophy there was much secret relief Marcella was provided for Not the fondest or most contriving mother could have done more for her than she had at one stroke done for herself During the early autumn missus Boyce had experienced some moments of sharp prevision as to what her future relations might be towards this strong and restless daughter so determined to conquer a world her mother had renounced Now all was clear and a very shrewd observer could allow her mind to play freely with the ironies of the situation As to Aldous Raeburn she had barely spoken to him before the day when Marcella announced the engagement and the lover a few hours later had claimed her daughter at the mother s hands with an emotion to which missus Boyce found her usual difficulty in responding She had done her best however to be gracious and to mask her surprise that he should have proposed that Lord Maxwell should have consented and that Marcella should have so lightly fallen a victim One surprise however had to be confessed at least to herself After her interview with her future son in law missus Boyce realised that for the first time for fifteen years she was likely to admit a new friend The impression made upon him by her own singular personality had translated itself in feelings and language which against her will as it were established an understanding an affinity That she had involuntarily aroused in him the profoundest and most chivalrous pity was plain to her Yet for the first time in her life she did not resent it and Marcella watched her mother s attitude with a mixture of curiosity and relief Then followed talk of an early wedding communications from Lord Maxwell to mister Boyce of a civil and formal kind a good deal more notice from the county and finally this definite statement from Aldous Raeburn as to the settlement he proposed to make upon his wife and the joint income which he and she would have immediately at their disposal Under all these growing and palpable evidences of Marcella s future wealth and position missus Boyce had shown her usual restless and ironic spirit But of late and especially to day restlessness had become oppression While Marcella was so speedily to become the rich and independent woman they themselves Marcella s mother and father were very poor in difficulties even and likely to remain so She gathered from her husband s grumbling that the provision of a suitable trousseau for Marcella would tax his resources to their utmost How long would it be before they were dipping in Marcella s purse missus Boyce s self tormenting soul was possessed by one of those nightmares her pride had brought upon her in grim succession during these fifteen years And this pride strong towards all the world was nowhere so strong or so indomitable at this moment as towards her own daughter They were practically strangers to each other and they jarred To inquire where the fault lay would have seemed to missus Boyce futile Darkness had come on fast and missus Boyce was in the act of ringing for lights when her husband entered Where s Marcella he asked as he threw himself into a chair with the air of irritable fatigue which was now habitual to him Only gone to take off her things and tell William about tea She will be down directly Does she know about that settlement Yes I told her She thought it generous but not I think unsuitable The world cannot be reformed on nothing Reformed fiddlesticks said mister Boyce angrily I never saw a girl with a head so full of nonsense in my life Where does she get it from Why did you let her go about in London with those people She may be spoilt for good Ten to one she ll make a laughing stock of herself and everybody belonging to her before she s done Well that is mister Raeburn s affair I think I should take him into account more than Marcella does if I were she But probably she knows best Of course she does He has lost his head any one can see that While she is in the room he is like a man possessed It doesn t sit well on that kind of fellow It makes him ridiculous I told him half the settlement would be ample She would only spend the rest on nonsense You told him that Yes I did Oh with an angry look at her I suppose you thought I should want to sponge upon her I am as much obliged to you as usual A red spot rose in his wife s thin cheek But she turned and answered him gently so gently that he had the rare sensation of having triumphed over her He allowed himself to be mollified and she stood there over the fire chatting with him for some time a friendly natural note in her voice which was rare and insensibly soothed him like an opiate She chatted about Marcella s trousseau gowns detailing her own contrivances for economy about the probable day of the wedding the latest gossip of the election and so on He sat shading his eyes from the firelight and now and then throwing in a word or two The inmost soul of him was very piteous harrowed often by a new dread the dread of dying The woman beside him held him in the hollow of her hand In the long wrestle between her nature and his she had conquered His fear of her and his need of her had even come to supply the place of a dozen ethical instincts he was naturally without Some discomfort probably physical seemed at last to break up his moment of rest Well I tell you I often wish it were the other man he said with some impatience Raeburn s so d d superior I suppose I offended him by what I said of Marcella s whims and the risk of letting her control so much money at her age and with her ideas You never saw such an air all very quiet of course He buttoned his coat and got up to go as though I were no more worth considering than the table Neither he nor his precious grandfather need alarm themselves I shan t trouble them as a visitor If I shock them they bore me so we re quits Marcella ll have to come here if she wants to see her father But owing to your charming system of keeping her away from us all her childhood she s not likely to want You mean mister Wharton by the other man said missus Boyce not defending herself or Aldous Yes of course But he came on the scene just too late worse luck Why wouldn t he have done just as well He s as mad as she madder He believes all the rubbish she does talks such rot the people tell me in his meetings But then he s good company he amuses you you don t need to be on your p s and q s with him Why wouldn t she have taken up with him As far as money goes they could have rubbed along He s not the man to starve when there are game pies going It s just bad luck missus Boyce smiled a little What there is to make you suppose that she would have inclined to him I don t exactly see She has been taken up with mister Raeburn really from the first week of her arrival here Well I dare say there was no one else said her husband testily That s natural enough It s just what I say All I know is Wharton shall be free to use this house just as he pleases during his canvassing whatever the Raeburns may say He bent forward and poked the somewhat sluggish fire with a violence which hindered rather than helped it missus Boyce s smile had quite vanished She perfectly understood all that was implied whether in his instinctive dislike of Aldous Raeburn or in his cordiality towards young Wharton After a minute s silence he got up again and left the room walking as she observed with difficulty She stopped a minute or so in the same place after he had gone turning her rings absently on her thin fingers She was thinking of some remarks which doctor Clarke the excellent and experienced local doctor had made to her on the occasion of his last visit With all the force of her strong will she had set herself to disbelieve them But they had had subtle effects already Finally she too went upstairs bidding Marcella whom she met coming down hurry William with the tea as mister Wharton might arrive any moment Marcella saw the room shut up the large shabby beautiful room the lamps brought in fresh wood thrown on the fire to make it blaze and the tea table set out Then she sat herself down on a low chair by the fire leaning forward with her elbows on her knees and her hands clasped in front of her Her black dress revealed her fine full throat and her white wrists for she had an impatience of restraint anywhere and wore frills and falls of black lace where other people would have followed the fashion in high collars and close wristbands What must have struck any one with an observant eye as she sat thus thrown into beautiful light and shade by the blaze of the wood fire was the massiveness of the head compared with the nervous delicacy of much of the face the thinness of the wrist and of the long and slender foot raised on the fender It was perhaps the great thickness and full wave of the hair which gave the head its breadth but the effect was singular and would have been heavy but for the glow of the eyes which balanced it She was thinking as a fiancee should of Aldous and their marriage which had been fixed for the end of February Yet not apparently with any rapturous absorption There was a great deal to plan and her mind was full of business Who was to look after her various village schemes while she and Lady Winterbourne were away in London Mary Harden had hardly brains enough dear little thing as she was They must find some capable woman and pay her The Cravens would tell her of course that she was on the high road to the most degrading of roles the role of Lady Bountiful But there were Lady Bountifuls and Lady Bountifuls And the role itself was inevitable It all depended upon how it was managed in the interest of what ideas She must somehow renew her relations with the Cravens in town It would certainly be in her power now to help them and their projects forward a little Of course they would distrust her but that she would get over All the time she was listening mechanically for the hall door bell which however across the distances of the great rambling house it was not easy to hear Their coming guest was not much in her mind She tacitly assumed that her father would look after him On the two or three occasions when they had met during the last three months including his luncheon at Mellor on the day after her engagement her thoughts had been too full to allow her to take much notice of him picturesque and amusing as he seemed to be Of late he had not been much in the neighbourhood There had been a slack time for both candidates which was now to give way to a fresh period of hard canvassing in view of the election which everybody expected at the end of February But Aldous was to bring Edward Hallin That interested her She felt an intense curiosity to see and know Hallin coupled with a certain nervousness The impression she might be able to make on him would be in some sense an earnest of her future Suddenly something undefinable a slight sound a current of air made her turn her head To her amazement she saw a young man in the doorway looking at her with smiling eyes and quietly drawing off his gloves She sprang up with a feeling of annoyance mister Wharton Oh must you he said with a movement of one hand as though to stop her Couldn t you stay like that At first I thought there was nobody in the room Your servant is grappling with my bags which are as the sand of the sea for multitude so I wandered in by myself Then I saw you and the fire and the room It was like a bit of music It was mere wanton waste to interrupt it Marcella flushed as she very stiffly shook hands with him I did not hear the front door she said coldly My mother will be here directly May I give you some tea Thanks No I knew you did not hear me That delighted me It showed what charming things there are in the world that have no spectators What a delicious place this is what a heavenly old place especially in these half lights There was a raw sun when I was here before but now He stood in front of the fire looking round the great room and at the few small lamps making their scanty light amid the flame lit darkness His hands were loosely crossed behind his back and his boyish face in its setting of curls shone with content and self possession Well said Marcella bluntly I should prefer a little more light to live by Perhaps when you have fallen downstairs here in the dark as often as I have you may too He laughed But how much better after all don t you think so to have too little of anything than too much He flung himself into a chair beside the tea table looking up with gay interrogation as Marcella handed him his cup She was a good deal surprised by him On the few occasions of their previous meetings these bright eyes and this pronounced manner had been at any rate as towards herself much less free and evident She began to recover the start he had given her and to study him with a half unwilling curiosity Then Mellor will please you she said drily in answer to his remark carrying her own tea meanwhile to a chair on the other side of the fire My father never bought anything my father can t I believe we have chairs enough to sit down upon but we have no curtains to half the windows Can I give you anything For he had risen and was looking over the tea tray Oh but I must he said discontentedly I must have enough sugar in my tea I gave you more than the average she said with a sudden little leap of laughter as she came to his aid Do all your principles break down like this I was going to suggest that you might like some of that fire taken away And she pointed to the pile of blazing logs which now filled up the great chimney That fire he said shivering and moving up to it Have you any idea what sort of a wind you keep up here on these hills on a night like this And to think that in this weather with a barometer that laughs in your face when you try to move it I have three meetings to morrow night When one loves the People with a large P said Marcella one mustn t mind winds He flashed a smile at her answering to the sparkle of her look then applied himself to his tea and toasted bun again with the dainty deliberation of one enjoying every sip and bite No but if only the People didn t live so far apart Some murderous person wanted them to have only one neck I want them to have only one ear Only then unfortunately everybody would speak well which would bring things round to dulness again Does mister Raeburn make you think very bad things of me Miss Boyce He bent forward to her as he spoke his blue eyes all candour and mirth Marcella started How can he she said abruptly I am not a Conservative Not a Conservative he said joyously Oh but impossible Does that mean that you ever read my poor little speeches He pointed to the local newspaper freshly cut which lay on a table at Marcella s elbow Sometimes said Marcella embarrassed There is so little time In truth she had hardly given his candidature a thought since the day Aldous proposed to her She had been far too much taken up with her own prospects with Lady Winterbourne s friendship and her village schemes He laughed Of course there is When is the great event to be I didn t mean that said Marcella stiffly Lady Winterbourne and I have been trying to start some village workshops We have been working and talking and writing morning noon and night Oh I know yes I heard of it And you really think anything is going to come out of finicking little schemes of that sort His dry change of tone drew a quick look from her The fresh coloured face was transformed In place of easy mirth and mischief she read an acute and half contemptuous attention I don t know what you mean she said slowly after a pause Or rather I do know quite well You told papa didn t you and mister Raeburn says that you are a Socialist not half and half as all the world is but the real thing And of course you want great changes you don t like anything that might strengthen the upper class with the people But that is nonsense You can t get the changes for a long long time And meanwhile people must be clothed and fed and kept alive She lay back in her high backed chair and looked at him defiantly His lip twitched but he kept his gravity You would be much better employed in forming a branch of the Agricultural Union he said decidedly What is the good of playing Lady Bountiful to a decayed industry All that is childish we want the means of revolution The people who are for reform shouldn t waste money and time on fads I understand all that she said scornfully her quick breath rising and falling Perhaps you don t know that I was a member of the Venturist Society in London What you say doesn t sound very new to me His seriousness disappeared in laughter He hastily put down his cup and stepping over to her held out his hand You a Venturist So am I Joy Won t you shake hands with me as comrades should We are a very mixed set of people you know and between ourselves I don t know that we are coming to much But we can make an alderman dream of the guillotine that is always something Oh but now we can talk on quite a new footing She had given him her hand for an instant withdrawing it with shy rapidity and he had thrown himself into a chair again with his arms behind his head and the air of one reflecting happily on a changed situation Quite a new footing he repeated thoughtfully But it is a little surprising What does what does mister Raeburn say to it Nothing He cares just as much about the poor as you or I please understand He doesn t choose my way but he won t interfere with it Ah that is like him like Aldous Marcella started You don t mind my calling him by his Christian name sometimes It drops out We used to meet as boys together at the Levens The Levens are my cousins He was a big boy and I was a little one But he didn t like me You see I was a little beast His air of appealing candour could not have been more engaging Yes I fear I was a little beast And he was even then and always the good and beautiful You don t understand Greek do you Miss Boyce But he was very good to me I got into an awful scrape once I let out a pair of eagle owls that used to be kept in the courtyard Sir Charles loved them a great deal more than his babies I let them out at night for pure wickedness and they came to fearful ends in the park I was to have been sent home next day in the most unnecessary and penal hurry But Aldous interposed said he would look after me for the rest of the holidays And then you tormented him Oh no he said with gentle complacency Oh no I never torment anybody But one must enjoy oneself you know what else can one do Then afterwards when we were older somehow I don t know but we didn t get on It is very sad I wish he thought better of me The last words were said with a certain change of tone and sitting up he laid the tips of his fingers together on his knees with a little plaintive air Marcella s eyes danced with amusement but she looked away from him to the fire and would not answer You don t help me out You don t console me It s unkind of you Don t you think it a melancholy fate to be always admiring the people who detest you Don t admire them she said merrily His eyebrows lifted That he said drily is disloyal I call I call your ancestor over the mantelpiece he waved his hand towards a blackened portrait in front of him to witness that I am all for admiring mister Raeburn and you discourage it Well but now now he drew his chair eagerly towards hers the pose of a minute before thrown to the winds do let us understand each other a little more before people come You know I have a labour newspaper She nodded You read it Is it the Labour Clarion I take it in Capital he cried Then I know now why I found a copy in the village here You lent it to a man called Hurd I did Whose wife worships you whose good angel you have been Do I know something about you or do I not Well now are you satisfied with that paper Can you suggest to me means of improving it It wants some fresh blood I think I must find it I bought the thing last year in a moribund condition with the old staff Oh we will certainly take counsel together about it most certainly But first I have been boasting of knowing something about you but I should like to ask do you know anything about me Both laughed Then Marcella tried to be serious Well I I believe you have some land Eight he nodded I am a Lincolnshire landowner I have about five thousand acres enough to be tolerably poor on and enough to play tricks with I have a company operative farm for instance At present I have lent them a goodish sum of money and remitted them their first half year s rent Not so far a paying speculation But it will do some day Meanwhile the estate wants money and my plans and I want money badly I propose to make the Labour Clarion pay if I can That will give me more time for speaking and organising for what concerns us as Venturists than the Bar The Bar she said a little mystified but following every word with a fascinated attention I made myself a barrister three years ago to please my mother She thought I should do better in Parliament if ever I got in Did you ever hear of my mother There was no escaping these frank smiling questions No said Marcella honestly Well ask Lord Maxwell he said laughing He and she came across each other once or twice when he was Home Secretary years ago and she was wild about some woman s grievance or other She always maintains that she got the better of him no doubt he was left with a different impression Well my mother most people thought her mad perhaps she was but then somehow I loved her He was still smiling but at the last words a charming vibration crept into the words and his eyes sought her with a young open demand for sympathy Is that so rare she asked him half laughing instinctively defending her own feeling lest it should be snatched from her by any make believe Yes as we loved each other it is rare My father died when I was ten She would not send me to school and I was always in her pocket I shared all her interests She was a wild woman but she lived as not one person in twenty lives Then he sighed Marcella was too shy to imitate his readiness to ask questions But she supposed that his mother must be dead indeed now vaguely remembered to have heard as much There was a little silence Please tell me she said suddenly why do you attack my straw plaiting Is a company operative farm any less of a stopgap Instantly his face changed He drew up his chair again beside her as gay and keen eyed as before I can t argue it out now There is so much to say But do listen I have a meeting in the village here next week to preach land nationalisation We mean to try and form a branch of the Labourers Union Will you come Marcella hesitated I think so she said slowly There was a pause Then she raised her eyes and found his fixed upon her A sudden sympathy of youth excitement pleasure seemed to rise between them She had a quick impression of lightness grace of an open brow set in curls of a look more intimate inquisitive commanding than any she had yet met May I speak to you miss said a voice at the door Marcella rose hastily Her mother s maid was standing there She hurried across the room What is the matter Deacon Your mother says miss said the maid retreating into the hall I am to tell you she can t come down Your father is ill and she has sent for doctor Clarke But you are please not to go up Will you give the gentlemen their tea and she will come down before they go if she can Marcella had turned pale Mayn t I go Deacon What is it It s a bad fit of pain your mother says miss Nothing can be done till the doctor comes She begged particular that you wouldn t go up miss She doesn t want any one put out At the same moment there was a ring at the outer door Oh there is Aldous cried Marcella with relief and she ran out into the hall to meet him CHAPTER III Aldous advanced into the inner hall at sight of Marcella leaving his companions behind in the vestibule taking off their coats Marcella ran to him Papa is ill she said to him hastily Mamma has sent for doctor Clarke She won t let me go up and wants us to take no notice and have tea without her I am so sorry Can we do anything The dogcart is here with a fast horse If your messenger went on foot Oh no they are sure to have sent the boy on the pony I don t know why but I have had a presentiment for a long time past that papa was going to be ill She looked white and excited She had turned back to the drawing room forgetting the other guests he walking beside her As they passed along the dim hall Aldous had her hand close in his and when they passed under an archway at the further end he stooped suddenly in the shadows and kissed the hand Touch kiss had the clinging the intensity of passion They were the expression of all that had lain vibrating at the man s inmost heart during the dark drive while he had been chatting with his two companions My darling I hope not Would you rather not see strangers Shall I send Hallin and young Leven away They would understand at once Oh no mister Wharton is here anyway staying Where is mister Hallin I had forgotten him Aldous turned and called mister Hallin and young Frank Leven divining something unusual were looking at the pictures in the hall Edward Hallin came up and took Marcella s offered hand Each looked at the other with a special attention and interest She holds my friend s life in her hands is she worthy of it was naturally the question hanging suspended in the man s judgment The girl s manner was proud and shy the manner of one anxious to please yet already perhaps on the defensive Aldous explained the position of affairs and Hallin expressed his sympathy He had a singularly attractive voice the voice indeed of the orator which can adapt itself with equal charm and strength to the most various needs and to any pitch As he spoke Marcella was conscious of a sudden impression that she already knew him and could be herself with him at once Oh I say broke in young Leven who was standing behind don t you be bothered with us Miss Boyce Just send us back at once I m awfully sorry No you are to come in she said smiling through her pallor which was beginning to pass away and putting out her hand to him the young Eton and Oxford athlete just home for his Christmas vacation was a great favourite with her You must come and have tea and cheer me up by telling me all the things you have killed this week Is there anything left alive You had come down to the fieldfares you know last Tuesday He followed her laughing and protesting and she led the way to the drawing room But as her fingers were on the handle she once more caught sight of the maid Deacon standing on the stairs and ran to speak to her He is better she said coming back with a face of glad relief The attack seems to be passing off Mamma can t come down but she begs that we will all enjoy ourselves We ll endeavour said young Leven rubbing his hands by the help of tea Miss Boyce will you please tell Aldous and mister Hallin not to talk politics when they re taking me out to a party They should fight a man of their own size I m all limp and trampled on and want you to protect me The group moved laughing and talking into the drawing room Jiminy said Leven stopping short behind Aldous who was alone conscious of the lad s indignant astonishment what the deuce is he doing here For there on the rug with his back to the fire stood Wharton surveying the party with his usual smiling aplomb mister Hallin do you know mister Wharton said Marcella mister Wharton and I have met several times on public platforms said Hallin holding out his hand which Wharton took with effusion Aldous greeted him with the impassive manner the three finger manner which was with him an inheritance though not from his grandfather and did not contribute to his popularity in the neighbourhood As for young Leven he barely nodded to the Radical candidate and threw himself into a chair as far from the fire as possible Frank and I have met before to day said Wharton laughing Yes I ve been trying to undo some of your mischief said the boy bluntly I found him Miss Boyce haranguing a lot of men at the dinner hour at Tudley End one of our villages you know cramming them like anything all about the game laws and our misdeeds my father s of course Wharton raised a protesting hand Oh all very well Of course it was us you meant Well when he d driven off I got up on a cart and had my say I asked them whether they didn t all come out at our big shoots and whether they didn t have almost as much fun as we did why the schoolmaster and the postman come to ask to carry cartridges and everybody turns out down to the cripples whether they didn t have rabbits given them all the year round whether half of them hadn t brothers and sons employed somehow about the game well paid and well treated whether any man jack of them would be a ha porth better off if there were no game whether many of them wouldn t be worse off and whether England wouldn t be a beastly dull place to live in if people like him he pointed to Wharton had the governing of it And I brought em all round too I got them cheering and laughing Oh I can tell you old Dodgson ll have to take me on He says he ll ask me to speak for him at several places I m not half bad I declare I m not I thought they gave you a holiday task at Eton observed Wharton blandly The lad coloured hotly then bethought himself radiant I left Eton last half as of course you know quite well But if it had only been last Christmas instead of this wouldn t I have scored by Jove They gave us a beastly essay instead of a book Demagogues I sat up all night and screwed out a page and a half I d have known something about it now And as he stood beside the tea table waiting for Marcella to entrust some tea to him for distribution he turned and made a profound bow to his candidate cousin Everybody joined in the laugh led by Wharton Then there was a general drawing up of chairs and Marcella applied herself to making tea helped by Aldous Wharton alone remained standing before the fire observant and apart Hallin whose health at this moment made all exertion even a drive something of a burden sat a little away from the tea table resting and glad to be silent Yet all the time he was observing the girl presiding and the man beside her his friend her lover The moment had a peculiar perhaps a melancholy interest for him So close had been the bond between himself and Aldous that the lover s communication of his engagement had evoked in the friend that sense poignant inevitable which in the realm of the affections always waits on something done and finished a leaf turned a chapter closed That sad word Joy Hallin was alone and ill when Raeburn s letter reached him and through the following day and night he was haunted by Landor s phrase long familiar and significant to him His letter to his friend and the letter to Miss Boyce for which Raeburn had asked him had cost him an invalid s contribution of sleep and ease The girl s answer had seemed to him constrained and young though touched here and there with a certain fineness and largeness of phrase which if it was to be taken as an index of character no doubt threw light upon the matter so far as Aldous was concerned Her beauty of which he had heard much now that he was face to face with it was certainly striking enough all the more because of its immaturity the subtlety and uncertainty of its promise Immaturity uncertainty these words returned upon him as he observed her manner with its occasional awkwardness the awkwardness which goes with power not yet fully explored or mastered by its possessor How Aldous hung upon her following every movement anticipating every want After a while Hallin found himself half inclined to mister Boyce s view that men of Raeburn s type are never seen to advantage in this stage this queer topsy turvy stage of first passion He felt a certain impatience a certain jealousy for his friend s dignity It seemed to him too every now and then that she the girl was teased by all this absorption this deference He was conscious of watching for something in her that did not appear and a first prescience of things anxious or untoward stirred in his quick sense You may all say what you like said Marcella suddenly putting down her cup and letting her hand drop for emphasis on her knee but you will never persuade me that game preserving doesn t make life in the country much more difficult and the difference between classes much wider and bitterer than they need be The remark cut across some rattling talk of Frank Leven s who was in the first flush of the sportsman s ardour and though by no means without parts could at the present moment apply his mind to little else than killing of one kind or another unless it were to the chances of keeping his odious cousin out of Parliament Leven stared Miss Boyce s speech seemed to him to have no sort of a propos Aldous looked down upon her as he stood beside her smiling I wish you didn t trouble yourself so much about it he said How can I help it she answered quickly and then flushed like one who has drawn attention indiscreetly to their own personal situation Trouble herself echoed young Leven Now look here Miss Boyce will you come for a walk with me I ll convince you as I convinced those fellows over there I know I could and you won t give me the chance it s too bad Oh you she said with a little shrug what do you know about it One might as well consult a gambler about gambling when he is in the middle of his first rush of luck I have ten times more right to an opinion than you have I can keep my head cool and notice a hundred things that you would never see I come fresh into your country life and the first thing that strikes me is that the whole machinery of law and order seems to exist for nothing in the world but to protect your pheasants There are policemen to catch poachers there are magistrates to try them To judge from the newspapers at least they have nothing else to do And if you follow your sporting instincts you are a very fine fellow and everybody admires you But if a shoemaker s son in Mellor follows his he is a villain and a thief and the policeman and the magistrate make for him at once But I don t steal his chickens cried the lad choking with arguments and exasperation and why should he steal my pheasants I paid for the eggs I paid for the hens to sit on em I paid for the coops to rear them in I paid the men to watch them I paid for the barley to feed them with why is he to be allowed to take my property and I am to be sent to jail if I take his Property said Marcella scornfully You can t settle everything nowadays by that big word We are coming to put the public good before property If the nation should decide to curtail your right as you call it in the general interest it will do it and you will be left to scream She had flung her arm round the back of her chair and all her lithe young frame was tense with an eagerness nay an excitement which drew Hallin s attention It was more than was warranted by the conversation he thought Well if you think the abolition of game preserving would be popular in the country Miss Boyce I m certain you make a precious mistake cried Leven Why even you don t think it would be do you mister Hallin he said appealing at random in his disgust I don t know said Hallin with his quiet smile I rather think on the whole it would be The farmers put up with it but a great many of them don t like it Things are mended since the Ground Game Act but there are a good many grievances still left I should think there are said Marcella eagerly bending forward to him I was talking to one of our farmers the other day whose land goes up to the edge of Lord Winterbourne s woods They don t keep their pheasants miss he said I do I and my corn If I didn t send a man up half past five in the morning when the ears begin to fill there d be nothing left for us Why don t you complain to the agent I said Complain Lor bless you miss you may complain till you re black in the face I ve allus found an I ve been here man and boy thirty two year as how Winterbournes generally best it There you have the whole thing in a nutshell It s a tyranny a tyranny of the rich Flushed and sarcastic she looked at Frank Leven but Hallin had an uncomfortable feeling that the sarcasm was not all meant for him Aldous was sitting with his hands on his knees and his head bent forward a little Once as the talk ran on Hallin saw him raise his grey eyes to the girl beside him who certainly did not notice it and was not thinking of him There was a curious pain and perplexity in the expression but something else too a hunger a dependence a yearning that for an instant gripped the friend s heart Well I know Aldous doesn t agree with you Miss Boyce cried Leven looking about him in his indignation for some argument that should be final You don t do you Aldous You don t think the country would be the better if we could do away with game to morrow No more than I think it would be the better said Aldous quietly if we could do away with gold plate and false hair to morrow There would be too many hungry goldsmiths and wig makers on the streets Marcella turned to him half defiant half softened Of course your point lies in to morrow she said I accept that We can t carry reform by starving innocent people But the question is what are we to work towards Mayn t we regard the game laws as one of the obvious crying abuses to be attacked first in the great campaign the campaign which is to bring liberty and self respect back to the country districts and make the labourer feel himself as much of a man as the squire What a head What an attitude thought Hallin half repelled half fascinated But a girl that can talk politics hostile politics to her lover and mean them too or am I inexperienced and is it merely that she is so much interested in him that she wants to be quarrelling with him Aldous looked up I am not sure he said answering her That is always my difficulty you know and he smiled at her Game preserving is not to me personally an attractive form of private property but it seems to me bound up with other forms and I want to see where the attack is going to lead me But I would protect your farmer mind as zealously as you Hallin caught the impatient quiver of the girl s lip The tea had just been taken away and Marcella had gone to sit upon an old sofa near the fire whither Aldous had followed her Wharton who had so far said nothing had left his post of observation on the hearth rug and was sitting under the lamp balancing a paper knife with great attention on two fingers In the half light Hallin by chance saw a movement of Raeburn s hand towards Marcella s which lay hidden among the folds of her dress quick resistance on her part then acquiescence He felt a sudden pleasure in his friend s small triumph Aldous and I have worn these things threadbare many a time he said addressing his hostess You don t know how kind he is to my dreams I am no sportsman and have no landowning relations so he ought to bid me hold my tongue But he lets me rave To me the simple fact is that game preserving creates crime Agricultural life is naturally simpler might be it always seems to me so much more easily moralised and fraternised than the industrial form And you split it up and poison it all by the emphasis laid on this class pleasure It is a natural pleasure you say Perhaps it is the survival perhaps of some primitive instinct in our northern blood but if so why should it be impossible for the rich to share it with the poor I have little plans dreams I throw them out sometimes to catch Aldous but he hardly rises to them Oh I say broke in Frank Leven who could really bear it no longer Now look here Miss Boyce what do you think mister Hallin wants It is just sheer lunacy it really is though I know I m impertinent and he s a great man But I do declare he wants Aldous to give up a big common there is oh over beyond Girtstone down in the plain on Lord Maxwell s estate and make a labourers shoot of it Now I ask you And he vows he doesn t see why they shouldn t rear pheasants if they choose to club and pay for it Well I will say that much for him Aldous didn t see his way to that though he isn t the kind of Conservative I want to see in Parliament by a long way Besides it s such stuff They say sport brutalises us and then they want to go and contaminate the labourer But we won t take the responsibility We ve got our own vices and we ll stick to them we re used to them but we won t hand them on we d scorn the action The flushed young barbarian driven to bay was not to be resisted Marcella laughed heartily and Hallin laid an affectionate hand on the boy s shoulder patting him as though he were a restive horse Yes I remember I was puzzled as to the details of Hallin s scheme said Aldous his mouth twitching I wanted to know who was to pay for the licences how game enough for the number of applicants was to be got without preserving and how men earning twelve or fourteen shillings a week were to pay a keeper Then I asked a clergyman who has a living near this common what he thought would be the end of it Well he said the first day they d shoot every animal on the place the second day they d shoot each other Universal carnage I should say that would be about the end of it These were trifles of course details Hallin shook his head serenely I still maintain he said that a little practical ingenuity might have found a way And I will support you said Wharton laying down the paper knife and bending over to Hallin with good reason For three years and a few months just such an idea as you describe has been carried out on my own estate and it has not worked badly at all There cried Marcella There I knew something could be done if there was a will I have always felt it She half turned to Aldous then bent forward instead as though listening eagerly for what more Wharton might say her face all alive and eloquent Of course there was nothing to shoot exclaimed Frank Leven On the contrary said Wharton smiling we are in the middle of a famous partridge country How your neighbours must dote on you cried the boy But Wharton took no notice And my father preserved strictly he went on It is quite a simple story When I inherited three years ago I thought the whole thing detestable and determined I wouldn t be responsible for keeping it up So I called the estate together farmers and labourers and we worked out a plan There are keepers but they are the estate servants not mine Everybody has his turn according to the rules I and my friends along with the rest Not everybody can shoot every year but everybody gets his chance and moreover a certain percentage of all the game killed is public property and is distributed every year according to a regular order Who pays the keepers interrupted Leven I do said Wharton smiling again Mayn t I for the present do what I will with mine own I return in their wages some of my ill gotten gains as a landowner It is all makeshift of course I understand exclaimed Marcella nodding to him you could not be a Venturist and keep up game preserving Wharton met her bright eye with a half deprecating reserved air You are right of course he said drily For a Socialist to be letting his keepers run in a man earning twelve shillings a week for knocking over a rabbit would have been a little strong No one can be consistent in my position in any landowner s position it is impossible still thank Heaven one can deal with the most glaring matters As mister Raeburn said however all this game business is of course a mere incident of the general land and property system as you will hear me expound when you come to that meeting you promised me to honour He stooped forward scanning her with smiling deference Marcella felt the man s hand that held her own suddenly tighten an instant Then Aldous released her and rising walked towards the fire You re not going to one of his meetings Miss Boyce cried Frank in angry incredulity Marcella hesitated an instant half angry with Wharton Then she reddened and threw back her dark head with the passionate gesture Hallin had already noticed as characteristic Mayn t I go where I belong she said where my convictions lead me There was a moment s awkward silence Then Hallin got up Miss Boyce may we see the house Aldous has told me much of it Presently in the midst of their straggling progress through the half furnished rooms of the garden front preceded by the shy footman carrying a lamp which served for little more than to make darkness visible Marcella found herself left behind with Aldous As soon as she felt that they were alone she realised a jar between herself and him His manner was much as usual but there was an underlying effort and difficulty which her sensitiveness caught at once A sudden wave of girlish trouble remorse swept over her In her impulsiveness she moved close to him as they were passing through her mother s little sitting room and put her hand on his arm I don t think I was nice just now she said stammering I didn t mean it I seem to be always driven into opposition into a feeling of war when you are so good to me so much too good to me Aldous had turned at her first word With a long breath as it were of unspeakable relief he caught her in his arms vehemently passionately So far she had been very shrinking and maidenly with him in their solitary moments and he had been all delicate chivalry and respect tasting to the full the exquisiteness of each fresh advance towards intimacy towards lover s privilege adoring her perhaps all the more for her reserve her sudden flights and stiffenings But to night he asked no leave and in her astonishment she was almost passive Oh do let me go she cried at last trying to disengage herself completely No he said with emphasis still holding her hand firmly Come and sit down here They will look after themselves He put her whether she would or no into an arm chair and knelt beside her Did you think it was hardly kind he said with a quiver of voice he could not repress to let me hear for the first time in public that you had promised to go to one of that man s meetings after refusing again and again to come to any of mine Do you want to forbid me to go she said quickly There was a feeling in her which would have been almost relieved for the moment if he had said yes By no means he said steadily That was not our compact But guess for yourself what I want Do you think he paused a moment do you think I put nothing of myself into my public life into these meetings among the people who have known me from a boy Do you think it is all a convention that my feeling my conscience remain outside You can t think that But if not how can I bear to live what is to be so large a part of my life out of your ken and sight I know I know you warned me amply you can t agree with me But there is much besides intellectual agreement possible much that would help and teach us both if only we are together not separated not holding aloof He stopped watching all the changes of her face She was gulfed in a deep wave of half repentant feeling remembering all his generosity his forbearance his devotion When are you speaking next she half whispered In the dim light her softened pose the gentle sudden relaxation of every line were an intoxication Next week Friday at Gairsly Hallin and Aunt Neta are coming Will Miss Raeburn take me His grey eyes shone upon her and he kissed her hand mister Hallin won t speak for you she said after the silence with a return of mischief Don t be so sure He has given me untold help in the drafting of my Bill If I didn t call myself a Conservative he would vote for me to morrow That s the absurdity of it Do you know I hear them coming back One thing she said hastily drawing him towards her and then holding him back as though shrinking always from the feeling she could so readily evoke I must say it you oughtn t to give me so much money it is too much Suppose I use it for things you don t like You won t he said gaily She tried to push the subject further but he would not have it I am all for free discussion he said in the same tone but sometimes debate must be stifled I am going to stifle it And stooping he kissed her lightly tremulously His manner showed her once more what she was to him how sacred how beloved First it touched and shook her then she sprang up with a sudden disagreeable sense of moral disadvantage inferiority coming she knew not whence and undoing for the moment all that buoyant consciousness of playing the magnanimous disinterested part which had possessed her throughout the talk in the drawing room The others reappeared headed by their lamp Wharton first scanning the two who had lingered behind with his curious eyes so blue and brilliant under the white forehead and the curls We have been making the wildest shots at your ancestors Miss Boyce he said Frank professed to know everything about the pictures and turned out to know nothing I shall ask for some special coaching to morrow morning May I engage you ten o clock Marcella made some evasive answer and they all sauntered back to the drawing room Shall you be at work to morrow Raeburn said Wharton Probably said Aldous drily Marcella struck by the tone looked back and caught an expression and bearing which were as yet new to her in the speaker She supposed they represented the haughtiness natural in the man of birth and power towards the intruder who is also the opponent Instantly the combative critical mood returned upon her and the impulse to assert herself by protecting Wharton His manner throughout the talk in the drawing room had been she declared to herself excellent modest and self restrained comparing curiously with the boyish egotism and self abandonment he had shown in their tete a tete Why there is mister Boyce exclaimed Wharton hurrying forward as they entered the drawing room There indeed on the sofa was the master of the house more ghastly black and white than ever and prepared to claim to the utmost the tragic pre eminence of illness He shook hands coldly with Aldous who asked after his health with the kindly brevity natural to the man who wants no effusions for himself in public or personal matters and concludes therefore that other people desire none You are better papa said Marcella taking his hand Certainly my dear better for morphia Don t talk of me I have got my death warrant but I hope I can take it quietly Evelyn I specially asked to have that thin cushion brought down from my dressing room It is strange that no one pays any attention to my wants missus Boyce almost as white Marcella now saw as her husband moved forward from the fire where she had been speaking to Hallin took a cushion from a chair near exactly similar to the one he missed and changed his position a little It is just the feather s weight of change that makes the difference isn t it said Wharton softly sitting down beside the invalid mister Boyce turned a mollified countenance upon the speaker and being now free from pain gave himself up to the amusement of hearing his guest talk Wharton devoted himself employing all his best arts doctor Clarke is not anxious about him missus Boyce said in a low voice to Marcella as they moved away He does not think the attack will return for a long while and he has given me the means of stopping it if it does come back How tired you look said Aldous coming up to them and speaking in the same undertone Will you not let Marcella take you to rest He was always deeply unreasonably touched by any sign of stoicism of defied suffering in women missus Boyce had proved it many times already On the present occasion she put his sympathy by but she lingered to talk with him Hallin from a distance noticed first of all her tall thinness and fairness and her wonderful dignity of carriage then the cordiality of her manner to her future son in law Marcella stood by listening her young shoulders somewhat stiffly set Her consciousness of her mother s respect and admiration for the man she was to marry was oddly enough never altogether pleasant to her It brought with it a certain discomfort a certain wish to argue things out Hallin and Aldous parted with Frank Leven at Mellor gate and turned homeward together under a starry heaven already whitening to the coming moon Do you know that man Wharton is getting an extraordinary hold upon the London working men said Hallin I have heard him tell that story of the game preserving before He was speaking for one of the Radical candidates at Hackney and I happened to be there It brought down the house The role of your Socialist aristocrat of your land nationalising landlord is a very telling one And comparatively easy said Aldous when you know that neither Socialism nor land nationalisation will come in your time Oh so you think him altogether a windbag Aldous hesitated and laughed I have certainly no reason to suspect him of principles His conscience as a boy was of pretty elastic stuff You may be unfair to him said Hallin quickly Then after a pause How long is he staying at Mellor About a week I believe said Aldous shortly mister Boyce has taken a fancy to him They walked on in silence and then Aldous turned to his friend in distress You know Hallin this wind is much too cold for you You are the most wilful of men Why would you walk Hold your tongue sir and listen to me I think your Marcella is beautiful and as interesting as she is beautiful There Aldous started then turned a grateful face upon him You must get to know her well he said but with some constraint Of course I wonder said Hallin musing whom she has got hold of among the Venturists Shall you persuade her to come out of that do you think Aldous No said Raeburn cheerfully Her sympathies and convictions go with them Then as they passed through the village he began to talk of quite other things college friends a recent volume of philosophical essays and so on Hallin accustomed and jealously accustomed as he was to be the one person in the world with whom Raeburn talked freely would not to night have done or said anything to force a strong man s reserve But his own mind was full of anxiety CHAPTER IV I love this dilapidation said Wharton pausing for a moment with his back against the door he had just shut Only it makes me long to take off my coat and practise some honest trade or other plastering or carpentering or painting What useless drones we upper classes are Neither you nor I could mend that ceiling or patch this floor to save our lives They were in the disused library It was now the last room westwards of the garden front but in reality it was part of the older house and had been only adapted and re built by that eighteenth century Marcella whose money had been so gracefully and vainly lavished on giving dignity to her English husband s birthplace The roof had been raised and domed to match the Chinese room at the expense of some small rooms on the upper floor and the windows and doors had been suited to eighteenth century taste But the old books in the old latticed shelves which the Puritan founder of the family had bought in the days of the Long Parliament were still there so were the chairs in which that worthy had sat to read a tract of Milton s or of Baxter s or the table at which he had penned his letters to Hampden or Fairfax or to his old friend on the wrong side Edmund Verney the standard bearer Only the worm eaten shelves were dropping from their supports and the books lay in mouldy confusion the roofs had great holes and gaps whence the laths hung dismally down and bats came flitting in the dusk and there were rotten places in the carpetless floor I have tried my best said Marcella dolefully stooping to look at a hole in the floor I got a bit of board and some nails and tried to mend some of these places myself But I only broke the rotten wood away and papa was angry and said I did more harm than good I did get a carpenter to mend some of the chairs but one doesn t know where to begin I have cleaned and mended some of the books but She looked sadly round the musty forlorn place But not so well I am afraid as any second hand bookseller s apprentice could have done it said Wharton shaking his head It s maddening to think what duffers we gentlefolks are Why do you harp on that said Marcella quickly She had been taking him over the house and was in twenty minds again as to whether and how much she liked him Because I have been reading some Board of Trade reports before breakfast said Wharton on one or two of the Birmingham industries in particular Goodness what an amount of knowledge and skill and resource these fellows have that I go about calling the lower orders I wonder how long they are going to let me rule over them I suppose brain power and education count for something still said Marcella half scornfully I am greatly obliged to the world for thinking so said Wharton with emphasis and for thinking so about the particular kind of brain power I happen to possess which is the point The processes by which a Birmingham jeweller makes the wonderful things which we attribute to French taste when we see them in the shops of the Rue de la Paix are of course mere imbecility compared to my performances in Responsions Lucky for me at any rate that the world has decided it so I get a good time of it and the Birmingham jeweller calls me sir Oh the skilled labour that can take care of itself and won t go on calling you sir much longer But what about the unskilled the people here for instance the villagers We talk of their governing themselves we wish it and work for it But which of us really believes that they are fit for it or that they are ever going to get along without our brain power No poor souls said Wharton with a peculiar vibrating emphasis By their stripes we are healed by their death we have lived Do you remember your Carlyle They had entered one of the bays formed by the bookcases which on either side of the room projected from the wall at regular intervals and were standing by one of the windows which looked out on the great avenue Beside the window on either side hung a small portrait in the one case of an elderly man in a wig in the other of a young dark haired woman Plenty in general but nothing in particular said Marcella laughing Quote He was leaning against the angle formed by the wall and the bookcase The half serious half provocative intensity of his blue eyes under the brow which drooped forward contrasted with the careless well appointed ease of his general attitude and dress Two men I honour and no third he said quoting in a slightly dragging vibrating voice First the toil worn craftsman that with earth made implement laboriously conquers the earth and makes her man s Hardly entreated Brother For us was thy back so bent for us were thy straight limbs and fingers so deformed thou wert our conscript on whom the lot fell and fighting our battles wert so marred Heavens how the words swing But it is great nonsense you know for you and me Venturists to be maundering like this Charity benevolence that is all Carlyle is leading up to He merely wants the cash nexus supplemented by a few good offices But we want something much more unpleasant Keep your subscriptions hand over your dividends turn out of your land and go to work Nowadays society is trying to get out of doing what we want by doing what Carlyle wanted Do you want it said Marcella I don t know he said laughing It won t come in our time Her lip showed her scorn That s what we all think Meanwhile you will perhaps admit that a little charity greases the wheels You must because you are a woman and women are made for charity and aristocracy Do you suppose you know so much about women she asked him rather hotly I notice it is always the assumption of the people who make most mistakes Oh I know enough to steer by he said smiling with a little inclination of his curly head as though to propitiate her How like you are to that portrait Marcella started and saw that he was pointing to the woman s portrait beside the window looking from it to his hostess with a close considering eye That was an ancestress of mine she said coldly an Italian lady She was rich and musical Her money built these rooms along the garden and these are her music books She showed him that the shelves against which she was leaning were full of old music Italian he said lifting his eyebrows Ah that explains Do you know that you have all the qualities of a leader and he moved away a yard from her studying her mixed blood one must always have that to fire and fuse the English paste and then but no that won t do I should offend you Her first instinct was one of annoyance a wish to send him about his business or rather to return him to her mother who would certainly keep him in order Instead however she found herself saying as she looked carelessly out of window Oh go on Well then he drew himself up suddenly and wheeled round upon her you have the gift of compromise That is invaluable that will take you far Thank you she said Thank you I know what that means from a Venturist You think me a mean insincere person He started then recovered himself and came to lean against the bookshelves beside her I mean nothing of the sort he said in quite a different manner with a sort of gentle and personal emphasis But may I explain myself Miss Boyce in a room with a fire I can see you shivering under your fur For the frost still reigned supreme outside and the white grass and trees threw chill reflected lights into the forsaken library Marcella controlled a pulse of excitement that had begun to beat in her admitted that it was certainly cold and led the way through a side door to a little flagged parlour belonging to the oldest portion of the house where however a great log fire was burning and some chairs drawn up round it She took one and let the fur wrap she had thrown about her for their promenade through the disused rooms drop from her shoulders It lay about her in full brown folds giving special dignity to her slim height and proud head Wharton glancing about in his curious inquisitive way now at the neglected pictures now on the walls now at the old oak chairs and chests now at her said to himself that she was a splendid and inspiring creature She seemed to be on the verge of offence with him too half the time which was stimulating She would have liked he thought to play the great lady with him already as Aldous Raeburn s betrothed But he had so far managed to keep her off that plane and intended to go on doing so Well I meant this he said leaning against the old stone chimney and looking down upon her only don t be offended with me please You are a Socialist and you are going some day to be Lady Maxwell Those combinations are only possible to women They can sustain them because they are imaginative not logical She flushed And you she said breathing quickly are a Socialist and a landlord What is the difference He laughed Ah but I have no gift I can t ride the two horses as you will be able to quite honestly There s the difference And the consequence is that with my own class I am an outcast they all hate me But you will have power as Lady Maxwell and power as a Socialist because you will give and take Half your time you will act as Lady Maxwell should the other half like a Venturist And as I said it will give you power a modified power But men are less clever at that kind of thing Do you mean to say she asked him abruptly that you have given up the luxuries and opportunities of your class He shifted his position a little That is a different matter he said after a moment We Socialists are all agreed I think that no man can be a Socialist by himself Luxuries for the present are something personal individual It is only a man s public form that matters And there as I said before I have no gift I have not a relation or an old friend in the world that has not turned his back upon me as you might see for yourself yesterday My class has renounced me already which after all is a weakness So you pity yourself she said By no means We all choose the part in life that amuses us that brings us most thrill I get most thrill out of throwing myself into the workmen s war much more than I could ever get you will admit out of dancing attendance on my very respectable cousins My mother taught me to see everything dramatically We have no drama in England at the present moment worth a cent so I amuse myself with this great tragi comedy of the working class movement It stirs pricks interests me from morning till night I feel the great rough elemental passions in it and it delights me to know that every day brings us nearer to some great outburst to scenes and struggles at any rate that will make us all look alive I am like a child with the best of its cake to come but with plenty in hand already Ah stay still a moment Miss Boyce To her amazement he stooped suddenly towards her and she looking down saw that a corner of her light black dress which had been overhanging the low stone fender was in flames and that he was putting it out with his hands She made a movement to rise alarmed lest the flames should leap to her face her hair But he releasing one hand for an instant from its task of twisting and rolling the skirt upon itself held her heavily down Don t move I will have it out in a moment You won t be burnt And in a second more she was looking at a ragged brown hole in her dress and at him standing smiling before the fire and wrapping a handkerchief round some of the fingers of his left hand You have burnt yourself mister Wharton A little I will go and get something what would you like A little olive oil if you have some and a bit of lint but don t trouble yourself She flew to find her mother s maid calling and searching on her way for missus Boyce herself but in vain missus Boyce had disappeared after breakfast and was probably helping her husband to dress In a minute or so Marcella ran downstairs again bearing various medicaments She sped to the Stone Parlour her cheek and eye glowing Let me do it for you If you please said Wharton meekly She did her best but she was not skilful with her fingers and this close contact with him somehow excited her There she said laughing and releasing him Of course if I were a work girl I should have done it better They are not going to be very bad I think What the burns Oh no They will have recovered I am afraid long before your dress Oh my dress yes it is deplorable I will go and change it She turned to go but she lingered instead and said with an odd introductory laugh I believe you saved my life Well I am glad I was here You might have lost self possession even you might you know and then it would have been serious Anyway her voice was still uncertain I might have been disfigured disfigured for life I don t know why you should dwell upon it now it s done with he declared smiling It would be strange wouldn t it if I took it quite for granted all in the day s work She held out her hand I am grateful please He bowed over it laughing again with that eighteenth century air which might have become a Chevalier des Grieux May I exact a reward Ask it Will you take me down with you to your village I know you are going I must walk on afterwards and catch a midday train to Widrington I have an appointment there at two o clock But perhaps you will introduce me to one or two of your poor people first Marcella assented went upstairs changed her dress and put on her walking things more than half inclined all the time to press her mother to go with them She was a little unstrung and tremulous pursued by a feeling that she was somehow letting herself go behaving disloyally and indecorously towards whom towards Aldous But how or why She did not know But there was a curious sense of lost bloom lost dignity combined with an odd wish that mister Wharton were not going away for the day In the end however she left her mother undisturbed By the time they were half way to the village Marcella s uncomfortable feelings had all passed away Without knowing it she was becoming too much absorbed in her companion to be self critical so long as they were together It seemed to her however before they had gone more than a few hundred yards that he was taking advantage presuming on what had happened He offended her taste her pride her dignity in a hundred ways she discovered At the same time it was she who was always on the defensive protecting her dreams her acts her opinions against the constant fire of his half ironical questions which seemed to leave her no time at all to carry the war into the enemy s country He put her through a quick cross examination about the village its occupations the incomes of the people its local charities and institutions what she hoped to do for it what she would do if she could what she thought it possible to do She answered first reluctantly then eagerly her pride all alive to show that she was not merely ignorant and amateurish But it was no good In the end he made her feel as Antony Craven had constantly done that she knew nothing exactly that she had not mastered the conditions of any one of the social problems she was talking about that not only was her reading of no account but that she had not even managed to see these people to interpret their lives under her very eyes with any large degree of insight Especially was he merciless to all the Lady Bountiful pose which meant so much to her imagination not in words so much as in manner He let her see that all the doling and shepherding and advising that still pleased her fancy looked to him the merest temporary palliative and irretrievably tainted even at that with some vulgar feeling or other All that the well to do could do for the poor under the present state of society was but a niggardly quit rent as for any relation of superior and inferior in the business or of any social desert attaching to these precious efforts of the upper class to daub the gaps in the ruinous social edifice for which they were themselves responsible he did not attempt to conceal his scorn If you did not do these things so much the worse for you when the working class came to its own if you did do them the burden of debt was hardly diminished and the rope was still left on your neck Now Marcella herself had on one or two occasions taken a malicious pleasure in flaunting these doctrines or some of them under Miss Raeburn s eyes But somehow as applied to herself they were disagreeable Each of us is to himself a special case and she saw the other side Hence a constant soreness of feeling a constant recalling of the argument to the personal point of view and through it all a curious growth of intimacy a rubbing away of barriers She had felt herself of no account before intellectually in Aldous s company as we know But then how involuntary on his part and how counter balanced by that passionate idealism of his love which glorified every pretty impulse in her to the noblest proportions Under Wharton s Socratic method she was conscious at times of the most wild and womanish desires worthy of her childhood to cry to go into a passion and when they came to the village and every human creature old and young dropped its obsequious curtsey as they passed she could first have beaten them for so degrading her and the next moment felt a feverish pleasure in thus parading her petty power before a man who in his doctrinaire pedantry had no sense of poetry or of the dear old natural relations of country life They went first to missus Jellison s to whom Marcella wished to unfold her workshop scheme Don t let me keep you she said to Wharton coldly as they neared the cottage I know you have to catch your train Wharton consulted his watch He had to be at a local station some two miles off within an hour Oh I have time he said Do take me in Miss Boyce I have made acquaintance with these people so far as my constituents now show them to me as your subjects Besides I am an observer I collect peasants They are my study They are not my subjects but my friends she said with the same stiffness They found missus Jellison having her dinner The lively old woman was sitting close against her bit of fire on her left a small deal table which held her cold potatoes and cold bacon on her right a tiny window and window sill whereon lay her coil of plait and the simple straw splitting machine she had just been working When Marcella had taken the only other chair the hovel contained nothing else remained for Wharton but to flatten himself as closely against the door as he might I m sorry I can t bid yer take a cheer said missus Jellison to him but what yer han t got yer can t give so I don t trouble my head about nothink Wharton applauded her with easy politeness and then gave himself with folded arms to examining the cottage while Marcella talked It might be ten feet broad he thought by six feet in one part and eight feet in another The roof was within little more than an inch of his head The stairway in the corner was falling to pieces he wondered how the woman got up safely to her bed at night custom he supposed can make even old bones agile Meanwhile Marcella was unfolding the project of the straw plaiting workshop that she and Lady Winterbourne were about to start missus Jellison put on her spectacles apparently that she might hear the better pushed away her dinner in spite of her visitors civilities and listened with a bright and beady eye An yer agoin to pay me one a sixpence a score where I now gets ninepence And I ll not have to tramp it into town no more you ll send a man round And who is agoin to pay me miss if you ll excuse me asking Lady Winterbourne and I said Marcella smiling We re going to employ this village and two others and make as good business of it as we can But we re going to begin by giving the workers better wages and in time we hope to teach them the higher kinds of work Lor said missus Jellison But I m not one o them as kin do with changes She took up her plait and looked at it thoughtfully Eighteen pence a score It wor that rate when I wor a girl An it ha been dibble dibble iver sense a penny off here an a penny off there an a hard job to keep a bite ov anythink in your mouth Then I may put down your name among our workers missus Jellison said Marcella rising and smiling down upon her Oh lor no I niver said that said missus Jellison hastily I don t hold wi shilly shallyin wi yer means o livin I ve took my plait to Jimmy Gedge im an is son fust shop on yer right hand when yer git into town twenty five year summer and winter me an three other women as give me a penny a journey for takin theirs If I wor to go messin about wi Jimmy Gedge Lor bless yer I should ear ov it oh I shoulden sleep o nights for thinkin o how Jimmy ud serve me out when I wor least egspectin ov it He s a queer un No miss thank yer kindly but I think I ll bide Marcella amazed began to argue a little to expound the many attractions of the new scheme Greatly to her annoyance Wharton came forward to her help guaranteeing the solvency and permanence of her new partnership in glib and pleasant phrase wherein her angry fancy suspected at once the note of irony But missus Jellison held firm embroidering her negative indeed with her usual cheerful chatter but sticking to it all the same At last there was no way of saving dignity but to talk of something else and go above all to talk of something else before going lest the would be benefactor should be thought a petty tyrant Oh Johnnie thank yer miss e s an owdacious young villain as iver I seed but clever lor you d need ave eyes in yer back to look after im An coaxin Aven t yer brought me no sweeties Gran ma No my dear says I But if you was to look Gran ma in both your pockets Gran ma iv you was to let me look It s a sharp un Isabella she don t old wi sweet stuff she says sich a pack o nonsense She d stuff herself sick when she wor is age Why shouldn t ee be happy same as her There ain t much to make a child appy in that ouse Westall ee s that mad about them poachers over Tudley End ee s like a wild bull at ome I told Isabella ee d come to knockin ov her about some day though ee did speak so oily when ee wor a courtin Now she knows as I kin see a thing or two said missus Jellison significantly Her manner Wharton noticed kept always the same gay philosophy whatever subject turned up Why that s an old story that Tudley End business said Marcella rising I should have thought Westall might have got over it by now But bless yer ee says it s goin on as lively as iver Ee says ee knows they re set on grabbin the birds t other side the estate over beyond Mellor way ee s got wind of it an ee s watchin night an day to see they don t do him no bad turn this month bekase o the big shoot they allus has in January An lor ee do speak drefful bad o soom folks said missus Jellison with an amused expression You know some on em miss don t yer And the old woman who had begun toying with her potatoes slanted her fork over her shoulder so as to point towards the Hurds cottage whereof the snow laden roof could be seen conspicuously through the little lattice beside her making sly eyes the while at her visitor I don t believe a word of it said Marcella impatiently Hurd has been in good work since October and has no need to poach Westall has a down on him You may tell him I think so if you like That I will said missus Jellison cheerfully opening the door for them There s nobody makes im ear the treuth nobbut me I loves naggin ov im ee s that masterful But ee don t master me A gay old thing said Wharton as they shut the gate behind them How she does enjoy the human spectacle And obstinate too But you will find the younger ones more amenable Of course said Marcella with dignity I have a great many names already The old people are always difficult But missus Jellison will come round Are you going in here Please Wharton knocked at the Hurds door and missus Hurd opened The cottage was thick with smoke The chimney only drew when the door was left open But the wind to day was so bitter that mother and children preferred the smoke to the draught Marcella soon made out the poor little bronchitic boy sitting coughing by the fire and missus Hurd busied with some washing She introduced Wharton who as before stood for some time hat in hand studying the cottage Marcella was perfectly conscious of it and a blush rose to her cheek while she talked to missus Hurd For both this and missus Jellison s hovel were her father s property and somewhat highly rented Minta Hurd said eagerly that she would join the new straw plaiting and went on to throw out a number of hurried half coherent remarks about the state of the trade past and present leaning meanwhile against the table and endlessly drying her hands on the towel she had taken up when her visitors came in Her manner was often nervous and flighty in these days She never looked happy but Marcella put it down to health or natural querulousness of character Yet both she and the children were clearly better nourished except Willie in whom the tubercular tendency was fast gaining on the child s strength Altogether Marcella was proud of her work and her eager interest in this little knot of people whose lives she had shaped was more possessive than ever Hurd indeed was often silent and secretive but she put down her difficulties with him to our odious system of class differences against which in her own way she was struggling One thing delighted her that he seemed to take more and more interest in the labour questions she discussed with him and in that fervid exuberant literature she provided him with Moreover he now went to all mister Wharton s meetings that were held within reasonable distance of Mellor and as she said to Aldous with a little laugh which however was not unsweet he had found her man work she had robbed his candidate of a vote Wharton listened a while to her talk with Minta smiled a little unperceived of Marcella at the young mother s docilities of manner and phrase then turned his attention to the little hunched and coughing object by the fire Are you very bad little man The white faced child looked up a dreary look revealing a patient melancholy soul He tried to answer but coughed instead Wharton moving towards him saw a bit of ragged white paper lying on the ground which had been torn from a grocery parcel Would you like something to amuse you a bit Ugh this smoke Come round here it won t catch us so much Now then what do you say to a doggie two doggies The child stared let himself be lifted on the stranger s knee and did his very utmost to stop coughing But when he had succeeded his quick panting breaths still shook his tiny frame and Wharton s knee Hm Give him two months or thereabouts thought Wharton What a beastly hole one room up and one down like the other only a shade larger Damp insanitary cold bad water bad drainage I ll be bound bad everything That girl may well try her little best And I go making up to that man Boyce What for Old spites new spites which or both Meanwhile his rapid skilful fingers were tearing pinching and shaping and in a very few minutes there upon his free knee stood the most enticing doggie of pinched paper a hound in full course with long ears and stretching legs The child gazed at it with ravishment put out a weird hand touched it stroked it and then as he looked back at Wharton the most exquisite smile dawned in his saucer blue eyes What did you like it grasshopper cried Wharton enchanted by the beauty of the look his own colour mounting Then you shall have another And he twisted and turned his piece of fresh paper till there beside the first stood a second fairy animal a greyhound this time with arching neck and sharp long nose There s two on em at Westall s cried the child hoarsely clutching at his treasures in an ecstasy missus Hurd at the other end of the cottage started as she heard the name Marcella noticed it and with her eager sympathetic look began at once to talk of Hurd and the works at the Court She understood they were doing grand things and that the work would last all the winter Minta answered hurriedly and with a curious choice of phrases Oh he didn t have nothing to say against it mister Brown the steward seemed satisfied All that she said was somehow irrelevant and to Marcella s annoyance plaintive as usual Wharton with the boy inside his arm turned his head an instant to listen Marcella having thought of repeating without names some of missus Jellison s gossip then shrank from it He had promised her she thought to herself with a proud delicacy and she was not going to treat the word of a working man as different from anybody else s So she fastened her cloak again which she had thrown open in the stifling air of the cottage and turned both to call her companion and give a smile or two to the sick boy But as she did so she stood amazed at the spectacle of Wharton and the child Then moving up to them she perceived the menagerie for it had grown to one on Wharton s knee You didn t guess I had such tricks he said smiling But they are so good so artistic She took up a little galloping horse he had just fashioned and wondered at it A great aunt taught me she was a genius I follow her at a long distance Will you let me go young man You may keep all of them But the child with a sudden contraction of the brow flung a tiny stick like arm round his neck pressing hard and looking at him There was a red spot in each wasted cheek and his eyes were wide and happy Wharton returned the look with one of quiet scrutiny the scrutiny of the doctor or the philosopher On Marcella s quick sense the contrast of the two heads impressed itself the delicate youth of Wharton s with its clustering curls the sunken contours and the helpless suffering of the other Then Wharton kissed the little fellow put his animals carefully on to a chair beside him and set him down They walked along the snowy street again in a different relation to each other Marcella had been touched and charmed and Wharton teased her no more As they reached the door of the almshouse where the old Pattons lived she said to him I think I had rather go in here by myself please I have some things to give them old Patton has been very ill this last week but I know what you think of doles and I know too what you think what you must think of my father s cottages It makes me feel a hypocrite yet I must do these things we are different you and I I am sure you will miss your train But there was no antagonism only painful feeling in her softened look Wharton put out his hand Yes it is time for me to go You say I make you feel a hypocrite I wonder whether you have any idea what you make me feel Do you imagine I should dare to say the things I have said except to one of the elite Would it be worth my while as a social reformer Are you not vowed to great destinies When one comes across one of the tools of the future must one not try to sharpen it out of one s poor resources in spite of manners Marcella stirred abashed fascinated let him press her hand Then he walked rapidly away towards the station a faint smile twitching at his lip An inexperienced girl he said to himself composedly CHAPTER V Before she went home Marcella turned into the little rectory garden to see if she could find Mary Harden for a minute or two The intimacy between them was such that she generally found entrance to the house by going round to a garden door and knocking or calling The house was very small and Mary s little sitting room was close to this door Her knock brought Mary instantly Oh come in You won t mind We were just at dinner Charles is going away directly Do stay and talk to me a bit Marcella hesitated but at last went in The meals at the rectory distressed her the brother and sister showed the marks of them To day she found their usual fare carefully and prettily arranged on a spotless table some bread cheese and boiled rice nothing else Nor did they allow themselves any fire for meals Marcella sitting beside them in her fur did not feel the cold but Mary was clearly shivering under her shawl They eat meat twice a week and in the afternoon Mary lit the sitting room fire In the morning she contented herself with the kitchen where as she cooked for many sick folk and had only a girl of fourteen whom she was training to help her with the housework she had generally much to do The Rector did not stay long after her arrival He had a distant visit to pay to a dying child and hurried off so as to be home if possible before dark Marcella admired him but did not feel that she understood him more as they were better acquainted He was slight and young and not very clever but a certain inexpugnable dignity surrounded him which real as it was sometimes irritated Marcella It sat oddly on his round face boyish still in spite of its pinched and anxious look but there it was not to be ignored Marcella thought him a Conservative and very backward and ignorant in his political and social opinions But she was perfectly conscious that she must also think him a saint and that the deepest things in him were probably not for her mister Harden said a few words to her now as to her straw plaiting scheme which had his warmest sympathy Marcella contrasted his tone gratefully with that of Wharton and once more fell happily in love with her own ideas then he went off leaving the two girls together Have you seen missus Hurd this morning said Mary Yes Willie seems very bad Mary assented The doctor says he will hardly get through the winter especially if this weather goes on But the greatest excitement of the village just now do you know is the quarrel between Hurd and Westall Somebody told Charles yesterday that they never meet without threatening each other Since the covers at Tudley End were raided Westall seems to have quite lost his head He declares Hurd knew all about that and that he is hand and glove with the same gang still He vows he will catch him out and Hurd told the man who told Charles that if Westall bullies him any more he will put a knife into him And Charles says that Hurd is not a bit like he was He used to be such a patient silent creature Now He has woke up to a few more ideas and a little more life than he had that s all said Marcella impatiently He poached last winter and small blame to him But since he got work at the Court in November is it likely He knows that he was suspected and what could be his interest now after a hard day s work to go out again at night and run the risk of falling into Westall s clutches when he doesn t want either the food or the money I don t know said Mary shaking her head Charles says if they once do it they hardly ever leave it off altogether It s the excitement and amusement of it He promised me said Marcella proudly They promise Charles all sorts of things said Mary slyly but they don t keep to them Warmly grateful as both she and the Rector had been from the beginning to Marcella for the passionate interest she took in the place and the people the sister was sometimes now a trifle jealous divinely jealous for her brother Marcella s unbounded confidence in her own power and right over Mellor her growing tendency to ignore anybody else s right or power sometimes set Mary aflame for Charles s sake heartily and humbly as she admired her beautiful friend I shall speak to mister Raeburn about it said Marcella She never called him Aldous to anybody a stiffness which jarred a little upon the gentle sentimental Mary I saw you pass she said from one of the top windows He was with you wasn t he A slight colour sprang to her sallow cheek a light to her eyes Most wonderful most interesting was this engagement to Mary who strange to think had almost brought it about mister Raeburn was to her one of the best and noblest of men and she felt quite simply and with a sort of Christian trembling for him the romance of his great position Was Marcella happy was she proud of him as she ought to be Mary was often puzzled by her Oh no said Marcella with a little laugh That wasn t mister Raeburn I don t know where your eyes were Mary That was mister Wharton who is staying with us He has gone on to a meeting at Widrington Mary s face fell Charles says mister Wharton s influence in the village is very bad she said quickly He makes everybody discontented sets everybody by the ears and after all what can he do for anybody But that s just what he wants to do to make them discontented cried Marcella Then if they vote for him that s the first practical step towards improving their life But it won t give them more wages or keep them out of the public house said Mary bewildered She came of a homely middle class stock accustomed to a small range of thinking and a high standard of doing Marcella s political opinions were an amazement and on the whole a scandal to her She preferred generally to give them a wide berth Marcella did not reply It was not worth while to talk to Mary on these topics But Mary stuck to the subject a moment longer You can t want him to get in though she said in a puzzled voice as she led the way to the little sitting room across the passage and took her workbasket out of the cupboard It was only the week before last mister Raeburn was speaking at the schoolroom for mister Dodgson You weren t there Marcella No said Marcella shortly I thought you knew perfectly well Mary that mister Raeburn and I don t agree politically Certainly I hope mister Wharton will get in Mary opened her eyes in wonderment She stared at Marcella forgetting the sock she had just slipped over her left hand and the darning needle in her right Marcella laughed I know you think that two people who are going to be married ought to say ditto to each other in everything Don t you you dear old goose She came and stood beside Mary a stately and beautiful creature in her loosened furs She stroked Mary s straight sandy hair back from her forehead Mary looked up at her with a thrill nay a passionate throb of envy soon suppressed I think she said steadily it is very strange that love should oppose and disagree with what it loves Marcella went restlessly towards the fire and began to examine the things on the mantelpiece Can t people agree to differ you sentimentalist Can t they respect each other without echoing each other on every subject Respect cried Mary with a sudden scorn which was startling from a creature so soft There she could tear me in pieces said Marcella laughing though her lip was not steady I wonder what you would be like Mary if you were engaged Mary ran her needle in and out with lightning speed for a second or two then she said almost under her breath I shouldn t be engaged unless I were in love And if I were in love why I would go anywhere do anything believe anything if he told me Believe anything Mary you wouldn t I don t mean as to religion said Mary hastily But everything else I would give it all up governing one s self thinking for one s self He should do it and I would bless him She looked up crimson drawing a very long breath as though from some deep centre of painful passionate feeling It was Marcella s turn to stare Never had Mary so revealed herself before Did you ever love any one like that Mary she asked quickly Mary dropped her head again over her work and did not answer immediately Do you see she said at last with a change of tone do you see that we have got our invitation Marcella about to give the rein to an eager curiosity Mary s manner had excited in her felt herself pulled up sharply When she chose this little meek creature could put on the same unapproachableness as her brother Marcella submitted Yes I see she said taking up a card on the mantelpiece It will be a great crush I suppose you know They have asked the whole county it seems to me The card bore an invitation in Miss Raeburn s name for the Rector and his sister to a dance at Maxwell Court the date given was the twenty fifth of January What fun said Mary her eye sparkling You needn t suppose that I know enough of balls to be particular I have only been to one before in my life ever That was at Cheltenham An aunt took me I didn t dance There were hardly any men but I enjoyed it Well you shall dance this time said Marcella for I will make mister Raeburn introduce you Nonsense you won t have any time to think about me You will be the queen everybody will want to speak to you I shall sit in a corner and look at you that will be enough for me Marcella went up to her quickly and kissed her then she said still holding her I know you think I ought to be very happy Mary I should think I do said Mary with astonished emphasis when the voice paused I should think I do I am happy and I want to make him happy But there are so many things so many different aims and motives that complicate life that puzzle one One doesn t know how much to give of one s self to each She stood with her hand on Mary s shoulder looking away towards the window and the snowy garden her brow frowning and distressed Well I don t understand said Mary after a pause As I said before it seems to me so plain and easy to be in love and give one s self all to that But you are so much cleverer than I Marcella you know so much more That makes the difference I can t be like you Perhaps I don t want to be and she laughed But I can admire you and love you and think about you There now tell me what you are going to wear White satin and mister Raeburn wants me to wear some pearls he is going to give me some old pearls of his mother s I believe I shall find them at Mellor when I get back There was little girlish pleasure in the tone It was as though Marcella thought her friend would be more interested in her bit of news than she was herself and was handing it on to her to please her Isn t there a superstition against doing that before you re married said Mary doubtfully As if I should mind if there was But I don t believe there is or Miss Raeburn would have heard of it She s a mass of such things Well I hope I shall behave myself to please her at this function There are not many things I do to her satisfaction it s a mercy we re not going to live with her Lord Maxwell is a dear but she and I would never get on Every way of thinking she has rubs me up the wrong way and as for her view of me I am just a tare sown among her wheat Perhaps she is right enough Marcella leant her cheek pensively on one hand and with the other played with the things on the mantelpiece Mary looked at her and then half smiled half sighed I think it is a very good thing you are to be married soon she said with her little air of wisdom which offended nobody Then you ll know your own mind When is it to be The end of February after the election Two months mused Mary Time enough to throw it all up in you think said Marcella recklessly putting on her gloves for departure Perhaps you ll be pleased to hear that I am going to a meeting of mister Raeburn s next week I am glad You ought to go to them all Really Mary How am I to lift you out of this squaw theory of matrimony Allow me to inform you that the following evening I am going to one of mister Wharton s here in the schoolroom She enjoyed her friend s disapproval By yourself Marcella It isn t seemly I shall take a maid mister Wharton is going to tell us how the people can get the land and how when they have got it all the money that used to go in rent will go in taking off taxes and making life comfortable for the poor She looked at Mary with a teasing smile Oh I dare say he will make his stealing sound very pretty said Mary with unwonted scorn as she opened the front door for her friend Marcella flashed out I know you are a saint Mary she said turning back on the path outside to deliver her last shaft I am often not so sure whether you are a Christian Then she hurried off without another word leaving the flushed and shaken Mary to ponder this strange dictum Marcella was just turning into the straight drive which led past the church on the left to Mellor House when she heard footsteps behind her and looking round she saw Edward Hallin Will you give me some lunch Miss Boyce in return for a message I am here instead of Aldous who is very sorry for himself and will be over later I am to tell you that he went down to the station to meet a certain box The box did not come but will come this afternoon so he waits for it and will bring it over Marcella flushed smiled and said she understood Hallin moved on beside her evidently glad of the opportunity of a talk with her We are all going together to the Gairsley meeting next week aren t we I am so glad you are coming Aldous will do his best There was something very winning in his tone to her It implied both his old and peculiar friendship for Aldous and his eager wish to find a new friend in her to adopt her into their comradeship Something very winning too in his whole personality in the loosely knit nervous figure the irregular charm of feature the benignant eyes and brow even in the suggestions of physical delicacy cheerfully concealed yet none the less evident The whole balance of Marcella s temper changed in some sort as she talked to him She found herself wanting to please instead of wanting to conquer to make an effect You have just come from the village I think said Hallin Aldous tells me you take a great interest in the people He looked at her kindly the look of one who saw all his fellow creatures nobly as it were and to their best advantage One may take an interest she said in a dissatisfied voice poking at the snow crystals on the road before her with the thorn stick she carried but one can do so little And I don t know anything not even what I want myself No one can do next to nothing And systems and theories don t matter or at least very little Yet when you and Aldous are together there will be more chance of doing for you than for most You will be two happy and powerful people His power will be doubled by happiness I have always known that Marcella was seized with shyness looked away and did not know what to answer At last she said abruptly her head still turned to the woods on her left Are you sure he is going to be happy Shall I produce his letter to me he said bantering or letters For I knew a great deal about you before October five their engagement day and suspected what was going to happen long before Aldous did No after all no Those letters are my last bit of the old friendship But the new began that same day he hastened to add smiling It may be richer than the old I don t know It depends on you I don t think I am a very satisfactory friend said Marcella still awkward and speaking with difficulty Well let me find out won t you I don t think Aldous would call me exacting I believe he would give me a decent character though I tease him a good deal You must let me tell you sometime what he did for me what he was to me at Cambridge I shall always feel sorry for Aldous s wife that she did not know him at college A shock went through Marcella at the word that tremendous word wife As Hallin said it there was something intolerable in the claim it made I should like you to tell me she said faintly Then she added with more energy and a sudden advance of friendliness But you really must come in and rest Aldous told me he thought the walk from the Court was too much for you Shall we take this short way And she opened a little gate leading to a door at the side of the house through the Cedar Garden The narrow path only admitted of single file and Hallin followed her admiring her tall youth and the fine black and white of her head and cheek as she turned every now and then to speak to him He realised more vividly than before the rare exciting elements of her beauty and the truth in Aldous s comparison of her to one of the tall women in a Florentine fresco But he felt himself a good deal baffled by her all the same In some ways so far as any man who is not the lover can understand such things he understood why Aldous had fallen in love with her in others she bore no relation whatever to the woman his thoughts had been shaping all these years as his friend s fit and natural wife Luncheon passed as easily as any meal could be expected to do of which mister Boyce was partial president During the preceding month or two he had definitely assumed the character of an invalid although to inexperienced eyes like Marcella s there did not seem to be very much the matter But whatever the facts might be mister Boyce s adroit use of them had made a great difference to his position in his own household His wife s sarcastic freedom of manner was less apparent and he was obviously less in awe of her Meanwhile he was as sore as ever towards the Raeburns and no more inclined to take any particular pleasure in Marcella s prospects or to make himself agreeable towards his future son in law He and missus Boyce had been formally asked in Miss Raeburn s best hand to the Court ball but he had at once snappishly announced his intention of staying at home Marcella sometimes looked back with astonishment to his eagerness for social notice when they first came to Mellor Clearly the rising irritability of illness had made it doubly unpleasant to him to owe all that he was likely to get on that score to his own daughter and moreover he had learnt to occupy himself more continuously on his own land and with his own affairs As to the state of the village neither Marcella s entreaties nor reproaches had any effect upon him When it appeared certain that he would be summoned for some specially flagrant piece of neglect he would spend a few shillings on repairs otherwise not a farthing All that filial softening towards him of which Marcella had been conscious in the early autumn had died away in her She said to herself now plainly and bitterly that it was a misfortune to belong to him and she would have pitied her mother most heartily if her mother had ever allowed her the smallest expression of such a feeling As it was she was left to wonder and chafe at her mother s new born mildness In the drawing room after luncheon Hallin came up to Marcella in a corner and smiling drew from his pocket a folded sheet of foolscap I made Aldous give me his speech to show you before to morrow night he said He would hardly let me take it said it was stupid and that you would not agree with it But I wanted you to see how he does these things He speaks now on an average two or three times a week Each time even for an audience of a score or two of village folk he writes out what he has to say Then he speaks it entirely without notes In this way though he has not much natural gift he is making himself gradually an effective and practical speaker The danger with him of course is lest he should be over subtle and over critical not simple and popular enough Marcella took the paper half unwillingly and glanced over it in silence You are sorry he is a Tory is that it he said to her but in a lower voice and sitting down beside her missus Boyce just catching the words from where she sat with her work at the further side of the room looked up with a double wonder wonder at Marcella s folly wonder still more at the deference with which men like Aldous Raeburn and Hallin treated her It was inevitable of course youth and beauty rule the world But the mother under no spell herself and of keen cool wit resented the intellectual confusion the lowering of standards involved I suppose so said Marcella stupidly in answer to Hallin s question fidgeting the papers under her hand Then his curious confessor s gift his quiet questioning look with its sensitive human interest to all before him told upon her I am sorry he does not look further ahead to the great changes that must come she added hurriedly This is all about details palliatives I want him to be more impatient Great political changes you mean She nodded then added But only for the sake of course of great social changes to come after He pondered a moment Aldous has never believed in great changes coming suddenly He constantly looks upon me as rash in the things I adopt and believe in But for the contriving unceasing effort of every day to make that part of the social machine in which a man finds himself work better and more equitably I have never seen Aldous s equal for the steady passion the persistence of it She looked up His pale face had taken to itself glow and fire his eyes were full of strenuous nay severe expression Her foolish pride rebelled a little Of course I haven t seen much of that yet she said slowly His look for a moment was indignant incredulous then melted into a charming eagerness But you will naturally you will see everything I hug myself sometimes now for pure pleasure that some one besides his grandfather and I will know what Aldous is and does Oh the people on the estate know his neighbours are beginning to know and now that he is going into Parliament the country will know some day if work and high intelligence have the power I believe But I am impatient In the first place I may say it to you Miss Boyce I want Aldous to come out of that manner of his to strangers which is the only bit of the true Tory in him you can get rid of it no one else can How long shall I give you And in the next I want the world not to be wasting itself on baser stuff when it might be praising Aldous Does he mean mister Wharton thought Marcella quickly But this world our world hates him and runs him down But she had no time to answer for the door opened to admit Aldous flushed and bright eyed looking round the room immediately for her and bearing a parcel in his left hand Does she love him at all thought Hallin with a nervous stiffening of all his lithe frame as he walked away to talk to missus Boyce or in spite of all her fine talk is she just marrying him for his money and position Meanwhile Aldous had drawn Marcella into the Stone Parlour and was standing by the fire with his arm covetously round her I have lost two hours with you I might have had just because a tiresome man missed his train Make up for it by liking these pretty things a little for my sake and my mother s He opened the jeweller s case took out the fine old pearls necklace and bracelets it contained and put them into her hand They were his first considerable gift to her and had been chosen for association s sake seeing that his mother had also worn them before her marriage She flushed first of all with a natural pleasure the girl delighting in her gaud Then she allowed herself to be kissed which was indeed inevitable Finally she turned them over and over in her hands and he began to be puzzled by her They are much too good for me I don t know whether you ought to give me such precious things I am dreadfully careless and forgetful Mamma always says so I shall want you to wear them so often that you won t have a chance of forgetting them he said gaily Will you Will you want me to wear them so often she asked in an odd voice Anyway I should like to have just these and nothing else I am glad that we know nobody and have no friends and that I shall have so few presents You won t give me many jewels will you she said suddenly insistently turning to him I shouldn t know what to do with them I used to have a magpie s wish for them and now I don t know but they don t give me pleasure Not these of course not these she added hurriedly taking them up and beginning to fasten the bracelets on her wrists Aldous looked perplexed My darling he said half laughing and in the tone of the apologist You know we have such a lot of things And I am afraid my grandfather will want to give them all to you Need one think so much about it It isn t as though they had to be bought fresh They go with pretty gowns don t they and other people like to see them No but it s what they imply the wealth the having so much while other people want so much Things begin to oppress me so she broke out instinctively moving away from him that she might express herself with more energy I like luxuries so desperately and when I get them I seem to myself now the vulgarest creature alive who has no right to an opinion or an enthusiasm or anything else worth having You must not let me like them you must help me not to care about them Raeburn s eye as he looked at her was tenderness itself He could of course neither mock her nor put what she said aside This question she had raised this most thorny of all the personal questions of the present the ethical relation of the individual to the World s Fair and its vanities was as it happened a question far more sternly and robustly real to him than it was to her Every word in his few sentences as they stood talking by the fire bore on it for a practised ear the signs of a long wrestle of the heart But to Marcella it sounded tame her ear was haunted by the fragments of another tune which she seemed to be perpetually trying to recall and piece together Aldous s slow minor made her impatient He turned presently to ask her what she had been doing with her morning asking her with a certain precision and observing her attentively She replied that she had been showing mister Wharton the house that he had walked down with her to the village and was gone to a meeting at Widrington Then she remarked that he was very good company and very clever but dreadfully sure of his own opinion Finally she laughed and said drily There will be no putting him down all the same I haven t told anybody yet but he saved my life this morning Aldous caught her wrists Saved your life Dear What do you mean She explained giving the little incident all perhaps more than its dramatic due He listened with evident annoyance and stood pondering when she came to an end So I shall be expected to take quite a different view of him henceforward he inquired at last looking round at her with a very forced smile I am sure I don t know that it matters to him what view anybody takes of him she cried flushing He certainly takes the frankest views of other people and expresses them And while she played with the pearls in their box she gave a vivid account of her morning s talk with the Radical candidate for West Brookshire and of their village expedition There was a certain relief in describing the scorn with which her acts and ideals had been treated and underneath a woman s curiosity as to how Aldous would take it I don t know what business he had to express himself so frankly said Aldous turning to the fire and carefully putting it together He hardly knows you it was I think an impertinence He stood upright with his back to the hearth a strong capable frowning Englishman very much on his dignity Such a moment must surely have become him in the eyes of a girl that loved him Marcella proved restive under it No it s very natural she protested quickly When people are so much in earnest they don t stop to think about impertinence I never met any one who dug up one s thoughts by the roots as he does Aldous was startled by her flush her sudden attitude of opposition His intermittent lack of readiness overtook him and there was an awkward silence Then pulling himself together with a strong hand he left the subject and began to talk of her straw plaiting scheme of the Gairsley meeting and of Hallin But in the middle Marcella unexpectedly said I wish you would tell me seriously what reasons you have for not liking mister Wharton other than politics I mean Her black eyes fixed him with a keen insistence He was silent a moment with surprise then he said I had rather not rake up old scores She shrugged her shoulders and he was roused to come and put his arm round her again she shrinking and turning her reddened face away Dearest he said you shall put me in charity with all the world But the worst of it is he added half laughing that I don t see how I am to help disliking him doubly henceforward for having had the luck to put that fire out instead of me CHAPTER VI A few busy and eventful weeks days never forgotten by Marcella in after years passed quickly by Parliament met in the third week of January Ministers according to universal expectation found themselves confronted by a damaging amendment on the Address and were defeated by a small majority A dissolution and appeal to the country followed immediately and the meetings and speech makings already active throughout the constituencies were carried forward with redoubled energy In the Tudley End division Aldous Raeburn was fighting a somewhat younger opponent of the same country gentleman stock a former fag indeed of his at Eton whose zeal and fluency gave him plenty to do Under ordinary circumstances Aldous would have thrown himself with all his heart and mind into a contest which involved for him the most stimulating of possibilities personal and public But as these days went over he found his appetite for the struggle flagging and was harassed rather than spurred by his adversary s activity The real truth was that he could not see enough of Marcella A curious uncertainty and unreality moreover seemed to have crept into some of their relations and it had begun to gall and fever him that Wharton should be staying there week after week beside her in her father s house able to spend all the free intervals of the fight in her society strengthening an influence which Raeburn s pride and delicacy had hardly allowed him as yet in spite of his instinctive jealousy from the beginning to take into his thoughts at all but which was now apparent not only to himself but to others In vain did he spend every possible hour at Mellor he could snatch from a conflict in which his party his grandfather and his own personal fortunes were all deeply interested In vain with a tardy instinct that it was to mister Boyce s dislike of himself and to the wilful fancy for Wharton s society which this dislike had promoted that Wharton s long stay at Mellor was largely owing did Aldous subdue himself to propitiations and amenities wholly foreign to a strong character long accustomed to rule without thinking about it mister Boyce showed himself not a whit less partial to Wharton than before pressed him at least twice in Raeburn s hearing to make Mellor his head quarters so long as it suited him and behaved with an irritable malice with regard to some of the details of the wedding arrangements which neither missus Boyce s indignation nor Marcella s discomfort and annoyance could restrain Clearly there was in him a strong consciousness that by his attentions to the Radical candidate he was asserting his independence of the Raeburns and nothing for the moment seemed to be more of an object with him even though his daughter was going to marry the Raeburns heir Meanwhile Wharton was always ready to walk or chat or play billiards with his host in the intervals of his own campaign and his society had thus come to count considerably among the scanty daily pleasures of a sickly and disappointed man missus Boyce did not like her guest and took no pains to disguise it least of all from Wharton But it seemed to be no longer possible for her to take the vigorous measures she would once have taken to get rid of him In vain too did Miss Raeburn do her best for the nephew to whom she was still devoted in spite of his deplorable choice of a wife She took in the situation as a whole probably sooner than anybody else and she instantly made heroic efforts to see more of Marcella to get her to come oftener to the Court and in many various ways to procure the poor deluded Aldous more of his betrothed s society She paid many chattering and fussy visits to Mellor visits which chafed Marcella and before long indeed roused a certain suspicion in the girl s wilful mind Between Miss Raeburn and missus Boyce there was a curious understanding It was always tacit and never amounted to friendship still less to intimacy But it often yielded a certain melancholy consolation to Aldous Raeburn s great aunt It was clear to her that this strange mother was just as much convinced as she was that Aldous was making a great mistake and that Marcella was not worthy of him But the engagement being there a fact not apparently to be undone both ladies showed themselves disposed to take pains with it to protect it against aggression missus Boyce found herself becoming more of a chaperon than she had ever yet professed to be and Miss Raeburn as we have said made repeated efforts to capture Marcella and hold her for Aldous her lawful master But Marcella proved extremely difficult to manage In the first place she was a young person of many engagements Her village scheme absorbed a great deal of time She was deep in a varied correspondence in the engagement of teachers the provision of work rooms the collecting and registering of workers the organisation of local committees and so forth New sides of the girl s character new capacities and capabilities were coming out new forms of her natural power over her fellows were developing every day she was beginning under the incessant stimulus of Wharton s talk to read and think on social and economic subjects with some system and coherence and it was evident that she took a passionate mental pleasure in it all And the more pleasure these activities gave her the less she had to spare for those accompaniments of her engagement and her position that was to be which once as missus Boyce s sharp eyes perceived had been quite normally attractive to her Why do you take up her time so with all these things said Miss Raeburn impatiently to Lady Winterbourne who was now Marcella s obedient helper in everything she chose to initiate She doesn t care for anything she ought to care about at this time and Aldous sees nothing of her As for her trousseau missus Boyce declares she has had to do it all Marcella won t even go up to London to have her wedding dress fitted Lady Winterbourne looked up bewildered But I can t make her go and have her wedding dress fitted Agneta And I always feel you don t know what a fine creature she is You don t really appreciate her It s splendid the ideas she has about this work and the way she throws herself into it I dare say said Miss Raeburn indignantly That s just what I object to Why can t she throw herself into being in love with Aldous That s her business I imagine just now if she were a young woman like anybody else one had ever seen instead of holding aloof from everything he does and never being there when he wants her Oh I have no patience with her But of course I must said Miss Raeburn hastily correcting herself of course I must have patience It will all come right I am sure when they are married said Lady Winterbourne rather helplessly That s just what my brother says cried Miss Raeburn exasperated He won t hear a word declares she is odd and original and that Aldous will soon know how to manage her It s all very well nowadays men don t manage their wives that s all gone with the rest And I am sure my dear if she behaves after she is married as she is doing now with that most objectionable person mister Wharton walking and talking and taking up his ideas and going to his meetings she ll be a handful for any husband mister Wharton said Lady Winterbourne astonished Her absent black eyes the eyes of the dreamer of the person who lives by a few intense affections saw little or nothing of what was going on immediately under them Oh but that is because he is staying in the house and he is a Socialist she calls herself one My dear said Miss Raeburn interrupting emphatically if you had now an unmarried daughter at home engaged or not would you care to have Harry Wharton hanging about after her Harry Wharton said the other pondering he is the Levens cousin isn t he he used to stay with them I don t think I have seen him since then But yes I do remember there was something something disagreeable She stopped with a hesitating interrogative air No one talked less scandal no one put the uglinesses of life away from her with a hastier hand than Lady Winterbourne She was one of the most consistent of moral epicures Yes extremely disagreeable said Miss Raeburn sitting bolt upright The man has no principles never had any since he was a child in petticoats I know Aldous thinks him unscrupulous in politics and everything else And then just when you are worked to death and have hardly a moment for your own affairs to have a man of that type always at hand to spend odd times with your lady love flattering her engaging her in his ridiculous schemes encouraging her in all the extravagances she has got her head twice too full of already setting her against your own ideas and the life she will have to live you will admit that it is not exactly soothing Poor Aldous said Lady Winterbourne thoughtfully looking far ahead with her odd look of absent rigidity which had in reality so little to do with a character essentially soft but you see he did know all about her opinions And I don t think no I really don t think I could speak to her In truth this woman of nearly seventy old in years but wholly young in temperament was altogether under Marcella s spell more at ease with her already than with most of her own children finding in her satisfaction for a hundred instincts suppressed or starved by her own environment fascinated by the girl s friendship and eagerly grateful for her visits Miss Raeburn thought it all both incomprehensible and silly Apparently no one can cried that lady in answer to her friend s demurrer is all the world afraid of her And she departed in wrath But she knew nevertheless that she was just as much afraid of Marcella as anybody else In her own sphere at the Court or in points connected with what was due to the family or to Lord Maxwell especially as the head of it this short capable old lady could hold her own amply with Aldous s betrothed could maintain indeed a sharp and caustic dignity which kept Marcella very much in order Miss Raeburn on the defensive was strong but when it came to attacking Marcella s own ideas and proceedings Lord Maxwell s sister became shrewdly conscious of her own weaknesses She had no wish to measure her wits on any general field with Marcella s She said to herself that the girl was too clever and would talk you down Meanwhile things went untowardly in various ways Marcella disciplined herself before the Gairsley meeting and went thither resolved to give Aldous as much sympathy as she could But the performance only repelled a mind over which Wharton was every day gaining more influence There was a portly baronet in the chair there were various Primrose Dames on the platform and among the audience there was a considerable representation of clergy and the labourers present seemed to Marcella the most obsequious of their kind Aldous spoke well or so the audience seemed to think but she could feel no enthusiasm for anything that he said She gathered that he advocated a Government inspection of cottages more stringent precautions against cattle disease better technical instruction a more abundant provision of allotments and small freeholds c and he said many cordial and wise sounding things in praise of a progress which should go safely and wisely from step to step and run no risks of dangerous reaction But the assumptions on which as she told herself rebelliously it all went that the rich and the educated must rule and the poor obey that existing classes and rights the forces of individualism and competition must and would go on pretty much as they were that great houses and great people the English land and game system and all the rest of our odious class paraphernalia were in the order of the universe these ideas conceived as the furniture of Aldous s mind threw her again into a ferment of passionate opposition And when the noble baronet in the chair to her eye a pompous frock coated stick sacrificing his after dinner sleep for once that he might the more effectually secure it in the future proposed a vote of confidence in the Conservative candidate when the vote was carried with much cheering and rattling of feet when the Primrose Dames on the platform smiled graciously down upon the meeting as one smiles at good children in their moments of pretty behaviour and when finally scores of toil stained labourers young and old went up to have a word and a hand shake with Muster Raeburn Marcella held herself aloof and cold with a look that threatened sarcasm should she be spoken to Miss Raeburn glancing furtively round at her was outraged anew by her expression She will be a thorn in all our sides thought that lady Aldous is a fool a poor dear noble misguided fool Then on the way home she and Aldous drove together Marcella tried to argue grew vehement and said bitter things for the sake of victory till at last Aldous tired worried and deeply wounded could bear it no longer Let it be dear let it be he entreated snatching at her hand as they rolled along through a stormy night We grope in a dark world you see some points of light in it I see others won t you give me credit for doing what I can seeing what I can I am sure sure you will find it easier to bear with differences when we are quite together when there are no longer all these hateful duties and engagements and persons between us Persons I don t know what you mean said Marcella Aldous only just restrained himself in time Out of sheer fatigue and slackness of nerve he had been all but betrayed into some angry speech on the subject of Wharton the echoes of whose fantastic talk as it seemed to him were always hanging about Mellor when he went there But he did refrain and was thankful That he was indeed jealous and disturbed that he had been jealous and disturbed from the moment Harry Wharton had set foot in Mellor he himself knew quite well But to play the jealous part in public was more than the Raeburn pride could bear There was the dread too of defining the situation of striking some vulgar irrevocable note So he parried Marcella s exclamation by asking her whether she had any idea how many human hands a parliamentary candidate had to shake between breakfast and bed and then having so slipped into another tone he tried to amuse himself and her by some of the daily humours of the contest She lent herself to it and laughed her look mostly turned away from him as though she were following the light of the carriage lamps as it slipped along the snow laden hedges her hand lying limply in his But neither were really gay His soreness of mind grew as in the pauses of talk he came to realise more exactly the failure of the evening of his very successful and encouraging meeting from his own private point of view Didn t you like that last speech he broke out suddenly that labourer s speech I thought you would It was entirely his own idea nobody asked him to do it In reality Gairsley represented a corner of the estate which Aldous had specially made his own He had spent much labour and thought on the improvement of what had been a backward district and in particular he had tried a small profit sharing experiment upon a farm there which he had taken into his own hands for the purpose The experiment had met with fair success and the labourer in question who was one of the workers in it had volunteered some approving remarks upon it at the meeting Oh it was very proper and respectful said Marcella hastily The carriage rolled on some yards before Aldous replied Then he spoke in a drier tone than he had ever yet used to her You do it injustice I think The man is perfectly independent and an honest fellow I was grateful to him for what he said Of course I am no judge cried Marcella quickly repentantly Why did you ask me I saw everything crooked I suppose it was your Primrose Dames they got upon my nerves Why did you have them I didn t mean to vex and hurt you I didn t indeed it was all the other way and now I have She turned upon him laughing but also half crying as he could tell by the flutter of her breath He vowed he was not hurt and once more changed both talk and tone They reached the drive s end without a word of Wharton But Marcella went to bed hating herself and Aldous after his solitary drive home sat up long and late feverishly pacing and thinking Then next evening how differently things fell Marcella having spent the afternoon at the Court hearing all the final arrangements for the ball and bearing with Miss Raeburn in a way which astonished herself came home full of a sense of duty done and announced to her mother that she was going to mister Wharton s meeting in the Baptist chapel that evening Unnecessary don t you think said missus Boyce lifting her eyebrows However if you go I shall go with you Most mothers dealing with a girl of twenty one under the circumstances would have said I had rather you stayed at home missus Boyce never employed locutions of this kind She recognised with perfect calmness that Marcella s bringing up and especially her independent years in London had made it impossible Marcella fidgeted I don t know why you should mamma Papa will be sure to want you Of course I shall take Deacon Please order dinner a quarter of an hour earlier and tell Deacon to bring down my walking things to the hall was all missus Boyce said in answer Marcella walked upstairs with her head very stiff So her mother and Miss Raeburn too thought it necessary to keep watch on her How preposterous She thought of her free and easy relations with her Kensington student friends and wondered when a more reasonable idea of the relations between men and women would begin to penetrate English country society mister Boyce talked recklessly of going too Of course I know he will spout seditious nonsense he said irritably to his wife but it s the fellow s power of talk that is so astonishing He isn t troubled with your Raeburn heaviness Marcella came into the room as the discussion was going on If papa goes she said in an undertone to her mother as she passed her it will spoil the meeting The labourers will turn sulky I shouldn t wonder if they did or said something unpleasant As it is you had much better not come mamma They are sure to attack the cottages and other things missus Boyce took no notice as far as she herself was concerned but her quiet decision at last succeeded in leaving mister Boyce safely settled by the fire provided as usual with a cigarette and a French novel The meeting was held in a little iron Baptist chapel erected some few years before on the outskirts of the village to the grief and scandal of mister Harden There were about a hundred and twenty labourers present and at the back some boys and girls come to giggle and make a noise nobody else The Baptist minister a smooth faced young man possessed as it turned out of opinions little short of Wharton s own in point of vigour and rigour was already in command A few late comers as they slouched in stole side looks at Marcella and the veiled lady in black beside her sitting in the corner of the last bench and Marcella nodded to one or two of the audience Jim Hurd amongst them Otherwise no one took any notice of them It was the first time that missus Boyce had been inside any building belonging to the village Wharton arrived late He had been canvassing at a distance and neither of the Mellor ladies had seen him all day He slipped up the bench with a bow and a smile to greet them I am done he said to Marcella as he took off his hat My voice is gone my mind ditto I shall drivel for half an hour and let them go Did you ever see such a stolid set You will rouse them said Marcella Her eyes were animated her colour high and she took no account at all of his plea of weariness You challenge me I must rouse them that was what you came to see Is that it She laughed and made no answer He left her and went up to the minister s desk the men shuffling their feet a little and rattling a stick here and there as he did so The young minister took the chair and introduced the speaker He had a strong Yorkshire accent and his speech was divided between the most vehement attacks couched in the most Scriptural language upon capital and privilege that is to say on landlords and the land system on State churches and the idle rich interspersed with quavering returns upon himself as though he were scared by his own invective My brothers let us be calm he would say after every burst of passion with a long deep voiced emphasis on the last word let us above all things be calm and then bit by bit voice and denunciation would begin to mount again towards a fresh climax of loud voiced attack only to sink again to the same lamb like refrain missus Boyce s thin lip twitched and Marcella bore the good gentleman a grudge for providing her mother with so much unnecessary amusement As for Wharton at the opening of his speech he spoke both awkwardly and flatly and Marcella had a momentary shock He was as he said tired and his wits were not at command He began with the general political programme of the party to which on its extreme left wing he proclaimed himself to belong This programme was of course by now a newspaper commonplace of the stalest sort He himself recited it without enthusiasm and it was received without a spark so far as appeared of interest or agreement The minister gave an hear hear of a loud official sort the men made no sign They might be a set of Dutch cheeses thought Marcella indignantly after a while But after all why should they care for all this I shall have to get up in a minute and stop those children romping But through all this as it were Wharton was only waiting for his second wind There came a moment when dropping his quasi official and high political tone he said suddenly with another voice and emphasis Well now my men I ll be bound you re thinking That s all pretty enough we haven t got anything against it we dare say it s all right but we don t care a brass ha porth about any of it If that s all you d got to say to us you might have let us bide at home We don t have none too much time to rest our bones a bit by the fire and talk to the missus and the kids Why didn t you let us alone instead of bringing us out in the cold Well but it isn t all I ve got to say and you know it because I ve spoken to you before What I ve been talking about is all true and all important and you ll see it some day when you re fit But what can men in your position know about it or care about it What do any of you want but bread He thundered on the desk a bit of decent comfort a bit of freedom freedom from tyrants who call themselves your betters a bit of rest in your old age a home that s something better than a dog hole a wage that s something better than starvation an honest share in the wealth you are making every day and every hour for other people to gorge and plunder He stopped a moment to see how that took A knot of young men in a corner rattled their sticks vigorously The older men had begun at any rate to look at the speaker The boys on the back benches instinctively stopped scuffling Then he threw himself into a sort of rapid question and answer What were their wages eleven shillings a week Not they cried a man from the middle of the chapel Yer mus reckon it wet an dry I wor turned back two days las week an two days this fower shillin lost each week that s what I call skinnin ov yer 
6189_21305_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Wharton nodded 
none	none	at him approvingly By now he knew the majority of the men in each village by name and never forgot a face or a biography You re right there Watkins Eleven shillings then when it isn t less never more and precious often less and harvest money the people that are kind enough to come round and ask you to vote Tory for them make a deal of that don t they and a few odds and ends here and there precious few of them There that s about it for wages isn t it Thirty pounds a year somewhere about to keep a wife and children on and for ten hours a day work not counting meal times that s it I think Oh you are well off aren t you He dropped his arms folded on the desk in front of him and paused to look at them his bright kindling eye running over rank after rank A chuckle of rough laughter bitter and jeering ran through the benches Then they broke out and applauded him Well and about their cottages His glance caught Marcella passed to her mother sitting stiffly motionless under her veil He drew himself up thought a moment then threw himself far forward again over the desk as though the better to launch what he had to say his voice taking a grinding determined note He had been in all parts of the division he said seen everything inquired into everything No doubt on the great properties there had been a good deal done of late years public opinion had effected something the landlords had been forced to disgorge some of the gains wrested from labour to pay for the decent housing of the labourer But did anybody suppose that enough had been done Why he had seen dens aye on the best properties not fit for the pigs that the farmers wouldn t let the labourers keep lest they should steal their straw for the littering of them where a man was bound to live the life of a beast and his children after him A tall thin man of about sixty rose in his place and pointed a long quavering finger at the speaker What is it Darwin speak up said Wharton dropping at once into the colloquial tone and stooping forward to listen My sleepin room s six foot nine by seven foot six We have to shift our bed for the rain s comin in an yer may see for yoursels ther ain t much room to shift it in An beyont us ther s a room for the chillen same size as ourn an no window nothin but the door into us Ov a summer night the chillen three on em is all of a sweat afore they re asleep An no garden an no chance o decent ways nohow An if yer ask for a bit o repairs yer get sworn at An that s all that most on us can get out of Squire Boyce There was a hasty whisper among some of the men round him as they glanced over their shoulders at the two ladies on the back bench One or two of them half rose and tried to pull him down Wharton looked at Marcella it seemed to him he saw a sort of passionate satisfaction on her pale face and in the erect carriage of her head Then she stooped to the side and whispered to her mother missus Boyce shook her head and sat on immovable All this took but a second or two Ah well said Wharton we won t have names that ll do us no good It s not the men you ve got to go for so much though we shall go for them too before long when we ve got the law more on our side It s the system It s the whole way of dividing the wealth that you made you and your children by your work your hard slavish incessant work between you and those who don t work who live on your labour and grow fat on your poverty What we want is a fair division There ought to be wealth enough there is wealth enough for all in this blessed country The earth gives it the sun gives it labour extracts and piles it up Why should one class take three fourths of it and leave you and your fellow workers in the cities the miserable pittance which is all you have to starve and breed on Why why I say Why because you are a set of dull jealous poor spirited cowards unable to pull together to trust each other to give up so much as a pot of beer a week for the sake of your children and your liberties and your class there that s why it is and I tell it you straight out He drew himself up folded his arms across his chest and looked at them scorn and denunciation in every line of his young frame and the blaze of his blue eye A murmur ran through the room Some of the men laughed excitedly Darwin sprang up again You keep the perlice off us an gie us the cuttin up o their bloomin parks an we ll do it fast enough he cried Much good that ll do you just at present said Wharton contemptuously Now you just listen to me And leaning forward over the desk again his finger pointed at the room he went through the regular Socialist programme as it affects the country districts the transference of authority within the villages from the few to the many the landlords taxed more and more heavily during the transition time for the provision of house room water light education and amusement for the labourer and ultimately land and capital at the free disposal of the State to be supplied to the worker on demand at the most moderate terms while the annexed rent and interest of the capitalist class relieves him of taxes and the disappearance of squire State parson and plutocrat leaves him master in his own house the slave of no man the equal of all And as a first step to this new Jerusalem organisation self sacrifice enough to form and maintain a union to vote for Radical and Socialist candidates in the teeth of the people who have coals and blankets to give away Then I suppose you think you d be turned out of your cottages dismissed your work made to smart for it somehow Just you try There are people all over the country ready to back you if you d only back yourselves But you won t You won t fight that s the worst of you that s what makes all of us sick when we come down to talk to you You won t spare twopence halfpenny a week from boozing not you to subscribe to a union and take the first little step towards filling your stomachs and holding your heads up as free men What s the good of your grumbling I suppose you ll go on like that grumbling and starving and cringing and talking big of the things you could do if you would and all the time not one honest effort not one to better yourselves to pull the yoke off your necks By the Lord I tell you it s a damned sort of business talking to fellows like you Marcella started as he flung the words out with a bitter nay a brutal emphasis The smooth faced minister coughed loudly with a sudden movement half got up to remonstrate and then thought better of it missus Boyce for the first time showed some animation under her veil Her eyes followed the speaker with a quick attention As for the men as they turned clumsily to stare at to laugh or talk to each other Marcella could hardly make out whether they were angered or fascinated Whichever it was Wharton cared for none of them His blood was up his fatigue thrown off Standing there in front of them his hands in his pockets pale with the excitement of speaking his curly head thrown out against the whitened wall of the chapel he lashed into the men before him talking their language their dialect even laying bare their weaknesses sensualities indecisions painting in the sombrest colours the grim truths of their melancholy lives Marcella could hardly breathe It seemed to her that among these cottagers she had never lived till now under the blaze of these eyes within the vibration of this voice Never had she so realised the power of this singular being He was scourging dissecting the weather beaten men before him as with a difference he had scourged dissected her She found herself exulting in his powers of tyranny in the naked thrust of his words so nervous so pitiless And then by a sudden flash she thought of him by missus Hurd s fire the dying child on his knee against his breast Here she thought while her pulses leapt is the leader for me for these Let him call I will follow It was as though he followed the ranging of her thought for suddenly when she and his hearers least expected it his tone changed his storm of speech sank He fell into a strain of quiet sympathy encouragement hope dwelt with a good deal of homely iteration on the immediate practical steps which each man before him could if he would take towards the common end spoke of the help and support lying ready for the country labourers throughout democratic England if they would but put forward their own energies and quit themselves like men pointed forward to a time of plenty education social peace and so with some good tempered banter of his opponent old Dodgson and some precise instructions as to how and where they were to record their votes on the day of election came to an end Two or three other speeches followed and among them a few stumbling words from Hurd Marcella approved herself and applauded him as she recognised a sentence or two taken bodily from the Labour Clarion of the preceding week Then a resolution pledging the meeting to support the Liberal candidate was passed unanimously amid evident excitement It was the first time that such a thing had ever happened in Mellor missus Boyce treated her visitor on their way home with a new respect mixed however as usual with her prevailing irony For one who knew her her manner implied not that she liked him any more but that a man so well trained to his own profession must always hold his own As for Marcella she said little or nothing But Wharton in the dark of the carriage had a strange sense that her eye was often on him that her mood marched with his and that if he could have spoken her response would have been electric When he had helped her out of the carriage and they stood in the vestibule missus Boyce having walked on into the hall he said to her his voice hoarse with fatigue Did I do your bidding did I rouse them Marcella was seized with sudden shyness You rated them enough Well did you disapprove Oh no it seems to be your way My proof of friendship Well can there be a greater Will you show me some to morrow How can I Will you criticise tell me where you thought I was a fool to night or a hypocrite Your mother would I dare say said Marcella her breath quickening but don t expect it from me Why Because because I don t pretend I don t know whether you roused them but you roused me She swept on before him into the dark hall without giving him a moment for reply took her candle and disappeared Wharton found his own staircase and went up to bed The light he carried showed his smiling eyes bent on the ground his mouth still moving as though with some pleasant desire of speech CHAPTER VII Wharton was sitting alone in the big Mellor drawing room after dinner He had drawn one of the few easy chairs the room possessed to the fire and with his feet on the fender and one of mister Boyce s French novels on his knee he was intensely enjoying a moment of physical ease The work of these weeks of canvassing and speaking had been arduous and he was naturally indolent Now beside this fire and at a distance it amazed him that any motive whatever public or private should ever have been strong enough to take him out through the mire on these winter nights to spout himself hoarse to a parcel of rustics What did I do it for he asked himself what am I going to do it for again to morrow Ten o clock mister Boyce was gone to bed No more entertaining of him to be done one might be thankful for that mercy Miss Boyce and her mother would he supposed be down directly They had gone up to dress at nine It was the night of the Maxwell Court ball and the carriage had been ordered for half past ten In a few minutes he would see Miss Boyce in her new dress wearing Raeburn s pearls He was extraordinarily observant and a number of little incidents and domestic arrangements bearing on the feminine side of Marcella s life had been apparent to him from the beginning He knew for instance that the trousseau was being made at home and that during the last few weeks the lady for whom it was destined had shown an indifference to the progress of it which seemed to excite a dumb annoyance in her mother Curious woman missus Boyce He found himself listening to every opening door and already as it were gazing at Marcella in her white array He was not asked to this ball As he had early explained to Miss Boyce he and Miss Raeburn had been cuts for years for what reason he had of course left Marcella to guess As if Marcella found any difficulty in guessing as if the preposterous bigotries and intolerances of the Ladies League were not enough to account for any similar behaviour on the part of any similar high bred spinster As for this occasion she was far too proud both on her own behalf and Wharton s to say anything either to Lord Maxwell or his sister on the subject of an invitation for her father s guest It so happened however that Wharton was aware of certain other reasons for his social exclusion from Maxwell Court There was no necessity of course for enlightening Miss Boyce on the point But as he sat waiting for her Wharton s mind went back to the past connected with those reasons In that past Raeburn had had the whip hand of him Raeburn had been the moral superior dictating indignant terms to a young fellow detected in flagrant misconduct Wharton did not know that he bore him any particular grudge But he had never liked Aldous as a boy that he could remember naturally he had liked him less since that old affair The remembrance of it had made his position at Mellor particularly sweet to him from the beginning he was not sure that it had not determined his original acceptance of the offer made to him by the Liberal Committee to contest old Dodgson s seat And during the past few weeks the exhilaration and interest of the general position considering all things had been very great Not only was he on the point of ousting the Maxwell candidate from a seat which he had held securely for years Wharton was perfectly well aware by now that he was trespassing on Aldous Raeburn s preserves in ways far more important and infinitely more irritating He and Raeburn had not met often at Mellor during these weeks of fight Each had been too busy But whenever they had come across each other Wharton had clearly perceived that his presence in the house his growing intimacy with Marcella Boyce the free masonry of opinion between them the interest she took in his contest the village friendships they had in common were all intensely galling to Aldous Raeburn The course of events indeed had lately produced in Wharton a certain excitement recklessness even He had come down into these parts to court the joy of eventful living politically and personally But the situation had proved to be actually far more poignant and personal than he had expected This proud crude handsome girl to her certainly it was largely due that the days had flown as they had He was perfectly one might almost say gleefully aware that at the present moment it was he and not Aldous Raeburn who was intellectually her master His mind flew back at first with amusement then with a thrill of something else over their talks and quarrels He smiled gaily as he recalled her fits of anger with him her remonstrances appeals and then her awkward inevitable submissions when he had crushed her with sarcasm or with facts Ah she would go to this ball to night Aldous Raeburn would parade her as his possession but she would go with thoughts ambitions ideals which as they developed would make her more and more difficult for a Raeburn to deal with And in those thoughts and ambitions the man who had been her tormentor teacher and companion during six rushing weeks knew well that he already counted for much He had cherished in her all those divine discontents which were already there when he first knew her taught her to formulate them given her better reasons for them so that by now she was a person with a far more defined and stormy will than she had been to begin with Wharton did not particularly know why he should exult but he did exult At any rate he was prodigiously tickled by the whole position A step a rustle outside he hastily shut his book and listened The door opened and Marcella came in a white vision against the heavy blue of the walls With her came too a sudden strong scent of flowers for she carried a marvellous bunch of hot house roses Aldous s gift which had just arrived by special messenger Wharton sprang up and placed a chair for her I had begun to believe the ball only existed in my own imagination he said gaily Surely you are very late Then he saw that she looked disturbed It was papa she said coming to the fire and looking down into it It has been another attack of pain not serious mamma says she is coming down directly But I wonder why they come and why he thinks himself so ill do you know she added abruptly turning to her companion Wharton hesitated taken by surprise During the past weeks what with mister Boyce s confidence and his own acuteness he had arrived at a very shrewd notion of what was wrong with his host But he was not going to enlighten the daughter I should say your father wants a great deal of care and is nervous about himself he said quietly But he will get the care and your mother knows the whole state of the case Yes she knows said Marcella I wish I did And a sudden painful expression of moral worry remorse passed across the girl s face Wharton knew that she had often been impatient of late with her father and incredulous of his complaints He thought he understood One can often be of more use to a sick person if one is not too well acquainted with what ails them he said Hope and cheerfulness are everything in a case like your father s He will do well If he does he won t owe any of it She stopped as impulsively as she had begun To me she meant to have said then had retreated hastily before her own sense of something unduly intimate and personal Wharton stood quietly beside her saying nothing but receiving and soothing her self reproach just as surely as though she had put it into words You are crushing your flowers I think he said suddenly And indeed her roses were dangling against her dress as if she had forgotten all about them She raised them carelessly but he bent to smell them and she held them out Summer he said plunging his face into them with a long breath of sensuous enjoyment How the year sweeps round in an instant And all the effect of a little heat and a little money Will you allow me a philosopher s remark He drew back from her His quick inquisitive but still respectful eye took in every delightful detail If I don t give you leave my experience is that you will take it she said half laughing half resentful as though she had old aggressions in mind You admit the strength of the temptation It is very simple no one could help making it To be spectator of the height of anything the best the climax makes any mortal s pulses run Beauty success happiness for instance He paused smiling She leant a thin hand on the mantelpiece and looked away Aldous s pearls slipped backwards along her white arm Do you suppose to night will be the height of happiness she said at last with a little scorn These functions don t present themselves to me in such a light Wharton could have laughed out her pedantry was so young and unconscious But he restrained himself I shall be with the majority to night he said demurely I may as well warn you Her colour rose No other man had ever dared to speak to her with this assurance this cool scrutinising air She told herself to be indignant the next moment she was indignant but with herself for remembering conventionalities Tell me one thing said Wharton changing his tone wholly I know you went down hurriedly to the village before dinner Was anything wrong Old Patton is very ill she said sighing I went to ask after him he may die any moment And the Hurds boy too He leant against the mantelpiece talking to her about both cases with a quick incisive common sense not unkind but without a touch of unnecessary sentiment still less of the superior person which represented one of the moods she liked best in him In speaking of the poor he always took the tone of comradeship of a plain equality and the tone was in fact genuine Do you know he said presently I did not tell you before but I am certain that Hurd s wife is afraid of you that she has a secret from you From me how could she I know every detail of their affairs No matter I listened to what she said that day in the cottage when I had the boy on my knee I noticed her face and I am quite certain She has a secret and above all a secret from you Marcella looked disturbed for a moment then she laughed Oh no she said with a little superior air I assure you I know her better than you Wharton said no more Marcella called a distant voice from the hall The girl gathered up her white skirts and her flowers in haste Good night Good night I shall hear you come home and wonder how you have sped One word if I may Take your role and play it There is nothing subjects dislike so much as to see royalty decline its part She laughed blushed a little proudly and uncertainly and went without reply As she shut the door behind her a sudden flatness fell upon her She walked through the dark Stone Parlour outside seeing still the firmly knit lightly made figure boyish middle sized yet never insignificant the tumbled waves of fair hair the eyes so keenly blue the face with its sharp mocking lines its powers of sudden charm Then self reproach leapt and possessed her She quickened her pace hurrying into the hall as though from something she was ashamed or afraid of In the hall a new sensation awaited her Her mother fully dressed stood waiting by the old billiard table for her maid who had gone to fetch her a cloak Marcella stopped an instant in surprise and delight then ran up to her Mamma how lovely you look I haven t seen you like that not since I was a child I remember you then once in a low dress a white dress with flowers coming into the nursery But that black becomes you so well and Deacon has done your hair beautifully She took her mother s hand and kissed her cheek touched by an emotion which had many roots There was infinite relief in this tender natural outlet she seemed to recover possession of herself missus Boyce bore the kiss quietly Her face was a little pinched and white But the unusual display Deacon had been allowed to make of her pale golden hair still long and abundant the unveiling of the shapely shoulders and neck little less beautiful than her daughter s the elegant lines of the velvet dress all these things had very nobly transformed her Marcella could not restrain her admiration and delight missus Boyce winced and looking upward to the gallery which ran round the hall called Deacon impatiently Only mamma said Marcella discontentedly I don t like that little chain round your neck It is not equal to the rest not worthy of it I have nothing else my dear said missus Boyce drily Now Deacon don t be all night Nothing else Yet if she shut her eyes Marcella could perfectly recall the diamonds on the neck and arms of that white figure of her childhood could see herself as a baby playing with the treasures of her mother s jewel box Nowadays missus Boyce was very secretive and reserved about her personal possessions Marcella never went into her room unless she was asked and would never have thought of treating it or its contents with any freedom The mean chain which went so ill with the costly hoarded dress it recalled to Marcella all the inexorable silent miseries of her mother s past life and all the sordid disadvantages and troubles of her own youth She followed missus Boyce out to the carriage in silence once more in a tumult of sore pride and doubtful feeling Four weeks to her wedding day The words dinned in her ears as they drove along Yet they sounded strange to her incredible almost How much did she know of Aldous of her life that was to be above all how much of herself She was not happy had not been happy or at ease for many days Yet in her restlessness she could think nothing out Moreover the chain that galled and curbed her was a chain of character In spite of her modernness and the complexity of many of her motives there was certain inherited simplicities of nature at the bottom of her In her wild demonic childhood you could always trust Marcie Boyce if she had given you her word her schoolfellows knew that If her passions were half civilised and southern her way of understanding the point of honour was curiously English sober tenacious So now Her sense of bond to Aldous had never been in the least touched by any of her dissatisfactions and revolts Yet it rushed upon her to night with amazement and that in four weeks she was going to marry him Why how what would it really mean for him and for her It was as though in mid stream she were trying to pit herself for an instant against the current which had so far carried them all on to see what it might be like to retrace a step and could only realise with dismay the force and rapidity of the water Yet all the time another side of her was well aware that she was at that moment the envy of half a county that in another ten minutes hundreds of eager and critical eyes would be upon her and her pride was rising to her part The little incident of the chain had somehow for the moment made the ball and her place in it more attractive to her They had no sooner stepped from their carriage than Aldous who was waiting in the outer hall joyously discovered them Till then he had been walking aimlessly amid the crowd of his own guests wondering when she would come how she would like it This splendid function had been his grandfather s idea it would never have entered his own head for a moment Yet he understood his grandfather s wish to present his heir s promised bride in this public ceremonious way to the society of which she would some day be the natural leader He understood too that there was more in the wish than met the ear that the occasion meant to Lord Maxwell whether Dick Boyce were there or no the final condoning of things past and done with a final throwing of the Maxwell shield over the Boyce weakness and full adoption of Marcella into her new family All this he understood and was grateful for But how would she respond How would she like it this parade that was to be made of her these people that must be introduced to her He was full of anxieties Yet in many ways his mind had been easier of late During the last week she had been very gentle and good to him even Miss Raeburn had been pleased with her There had been no quoting of Wharton when they met and he had done his philosopher s best to forget him He trusted her proudly intensely and in four weeks she would be his wife Can you bear it he said to her in a laughing whisper as she and her mother emerged from the cloak room Tell me what to do she said flushing I will do my best What a crowd Must we stay very long Ah my dear missus Boyce cried Lord Maxwell meeting them on the steps of the inner quadrangular corridor Welcome indeed Let me take you in Marcella with Aldous s permission he stooped his white head gallantly and kissed her on the cheek Remember I am an old man if I choose to pay you compliments you will have to put up with them Then he offered missus Boyce his arm a stately figure in his ribbon and cross of the Bath A delicate red had risen to that lady s thin cheek in spite of her self possession Poor thing said Lord Maxwell to himself as he led her along poor thing how distinguished and charming still One sees to night what she was like as a girl Aldous and Marcella followed They had to pass along the great corridor which ran round the quadrangle of the house The antique marbles which lined it were to night masked in flowers and seats covered in red had been fitted in wherever it was possible and were now crowded with dancers sitting out From the ball room ahead came waves of waltz music the ancient house was alive with colour and perfume with the sounds of laughter and talk lightly fretting and breaking the swaying rhythms of the band Beyond the windows of the corridor which had been left uncurtained because of the beauty of the night the stiff Tudor garden with its fountains which filled up the quadrangle was gaily illuminated under a bright moon and amid all the varied colour of lamps drapery dresses faces the antique heads ranged along the walls of the corridor here Marcus Aurelius there Trajan there Seneca and the marble sarcophagi which broke the line at intervals stood in cold whitish relief Marcella passed along on Aldous s arm conscious that people were streaming into the corridor from all the rooms opening upon it and that every eye was fixed upon her and her mother Look there she is she heard in an excited girl s voice as they passed Lord Maxwell s library now abandoned to the crowd like all the rest Come quick There I told you she was lovely Every now and then some old friend man or woman rose smiling from the seats along the side and Aldous introduced his bride On her dignity said an old hunting squire to his daughter when they had passed Shy no doubt very natural But nowadays girls when they re shy don t giggle and blush as they used to in my young days they look as if you meant to insult them and they weren t going to allow it Oh very handsome very handsome of course But you can see she s advanced peculiar or what d ye call it woman s rights I suppose and all that kind of thing Like to see you go in for it Nettie eh She s awfully handsome sighed his pink cheeked insignificant little daughter still craning her neck to look very simply dressed too except for those lovely pearls She does her hair very oddly so low down in those plaits Nobody does it like that nowadays That s because nobody has such a head said her brother a young Hussar lieutenant beside her in the tone of connoisseurship By George she s ripping she s the best looking girl I ve seen for a good long time But she s a Tartar I ll swear looks it anyway Every one says she has the most extraordinary opinions said the girl eagerly She ll manage him don t you think I m sure he s very meek and mild Don t know that said the young man twisting his moustache with the air of exhaustive information Raeburn s a very good fellow excellent fellow see him shooting you know that kind of thing I expect he s got a will when he wants it The mother s handsome too and looks a lady The father s kept out of the way I see Rather a blessing for the Raeburns Can t be pleasant you know to get a man like that in the family Look after your spoons that kind of thing Meanwhile Marcella was standing beside Miss Raeburn at the head of the long ball room and doing her best to behave prettily One after another she bowed to or shook hands with half the magnates of the county the men in pink the women in the new London dresses for which this brilliant and long expected ball had given so welcome an excuse They knew little or nothing of her except that she was clearly good looking that she was that fellow Dick Boyce s daughter and was reported to be odd Some mostly men who said their conventional few words to her felt an amused admiration for the skill and rapidity with which she had captured the parti of the county some mostly women were already jealous of her A few of the older people here and there both men and women but after all they shook hands like the rest knew perfectly well that the girl must be going through an ordeal were touched by the signs of thought and storm in the face and looked back at her with kind eyes But of these last Marcella realised nothing What she was saying to herself was that if they knew little of her she knew a great deal of many of them In their talks over the Stone Parlour fire she and Wharton had gone through most of the properties large and small of his division and indeed of the divisions round by the help of the knowledge he had gained in his canvass together with a blue book one of the numberless recently issued on the state of the midland labourer He had abounded in anecdote sarcasm reflection based partly on his own experiences partly on his endless talks with the working folk now in the public house now at their own chimney corner Marcella indeed had a large unsuspected acquaintance with the county before she met it in the flesh She knew that a great many of these men who came and spoke to her were doing their best according to their lights that improvements were going on that times were mending But there were abuses enough still and the abuses were far more vividly present to her than the improvements In general the people who thronged these splendid rooms were to her merely the incompetent members of a useless class The nation would do away with them in time Meanwhile it might at least be asked of them that they should practise their profession of landowning such as it was with greater conscience and intelligence that they should not shirk its opportunities or idle them away And she could point out those who did both scandalously intolerably Once or twice she thought passionately of Minta Hurd washing and mending all day in her damp cottage or of the Pattons in the parish house thankful after sixty years of toil for a hovel where the rain came through the thatch and where the smoke choked you unless with the thermometer below freezing point you opened the door to the blast Why should these people have all the gay clothes the flowers the jewels the delicate food all the delight and all the leisure And those nothing Her soul rose against what she saw as she stood there going through her part Wharton s very words every inflection of his voice was in her ears playing chorus to the scene But when these first introductions these little empty talks of three or four phrases apiece and all of them alike were nearly done with Marcella looked eagerly round for Mary Harden There she was sitting quietly against the wall in a remote corner her plain face all smiles her little feet dancing under the white muslin frock which she had fashioned for herself with so much pain under Marcella s directions Miss Raeburn was called away to find an arm chair for some dowager of importance Marcella took advantage of the break and of the end of a dance to hurry down the room to Mary Aldous who was talking to old Sir Charles Leven Frank s father a few steps off nodded and smiled to her as he saw her move Have you been dancing Mary she said severely I wouldn t for worlds I never was so much amused in my life Look at those girls those sisters in the huge velvet sleeves like coloured balloons and that old lady in the pink tulle and diamonds I do so want to get her her cloak And those Lancers I never could have imagined people danced like that They didn t dance them they romped them It wasn t beautiful was it Why do you expect an English crowd to do anything beautiful If we could do it we should be too ashamed But it is beautiful all the same you scornful person cried Mary dragging her friend down beside her How pretty the girls are And as for the diamonds I never saw anything so wonderful I wish I could have made Charles come Wouldn t he No she looked a little troubled he couldn t think it would be quite right But I don t know a sight like this takes me off my feet shakes me up and does me a world of good You dear simple thing said Marcella slipping her hand into Mary s as it lay on the bench Oh you needn t be so superior cried Mary not for another year at least I don t believe you are much more used to it than I am If you mean said Marcella that I was never at anything so big and splendid as this before you are quite right And she looked round the room with that curious cold air of personal detachment from all she saw which had often struck Mary and to night made her indignant Then enjoy it she said laughing and frowning at the same time That s a much more plain duty for you than it was for Charles to stay at home there Haven t you been dancing No mister Raeburn doesn t dance But he thinks he can get through the next Lancers if I will steer him Then I shall find a seat where I can look at you said Mary decidedly Ah there is mister Raeburn coming to introduce somebody to you I knew they wouldn t let you sit here long Aldous brought up a young Guardsman who boldly asked Miss Boyce for the pleasure of a dance Marcella consented and off they swept into a room which was only just beginning to fill for the new dance and where therefore for the moment the young grace of both had free play Marcella had been an indefatigable dancer in the old London days at those students parties with their dyed gloves and lemonade suppers which were running in her head now as she swayed to the rhythm of this perfect band The mere delight in movement came back to her and while they danced she danced with all her heart Then in the pauses she would lean against the wall beside her partner and rack her brain to find a word to say to him As for anything that he said every word whether of Ascot or the last Academy or the new plays or the hunting and the elections sounded to her more vapid than the last Meanwhile Aldous stood near Mary Harden and watched the dancing figure He had never seen her dance before Mary shyly stole a look at him from time to time Well he said at last stooping to his neighbour what are you thinking of I think she is a dream said Mary flushing with the pleasure of being able to say it They were great friends he and she and to night somehow she was not a bit afraid of him Aldous s eye sparkled a moment then he looked down at her with a kind smile If you suppose I am going to let you sit here all night you are very much mistaken Marcella gave me precise instructions I am going off this moment to find somebody mister Raeburn don t cried Mary catching at him But he was gone and she was left in trepidation imagining the sort of formidable young man who was soon to be presented to her and shaking at the thought of him When the dance was over Marcella returned to Miss Raeburn who was standing at the door into the corridor and had beckoned to her She went through a number of new introductions and declared to herself that she was doing all she could Miss Raeburn was not so well satisfied Why can t she smile and chatter like other girls thought Aunt Neta impatiently It s her ideas I suppose What rubbish There now just see the difference For at the moment Lady Winterbourne came up and instantly Marcella was all smiles and talk holding her friend by both hands clinging to her almost Oh do come here she said leading her into a corner There s such a crowd and I say all the wrong things There with a sigh of relief Now I feel myself protected I mustn t keep you said Lady Winterbourne a little taken aback by her effusion Everybody is wanting to talk to you Oh I know There is Miss Raeburn looking at me severely already But I must do as I like a little You ought to do as Aldous likes said Lady Winterbourne suddenly in her deepest and most tragic voice It seemed to her a moment had come for admonition and she seized it hastily Marcella stared at her in surprise She knew by now that when Lady Winterbourne looked most forbidding she was in reality most shy But still she was taken aback Why do you say that I wonder she asked half reproachfully I have been behaving myself quite nicely I have indeed at least as nicely as I knew how Lady Winterbourne s tragic air yielded to a slow smile You look very well my dear That white becomes you charmingly so do the pearls I don t wonder that Aldous always knows where you are Marcella raised her eyes and caught those of Aldous fixed upon her from the other side of the room She blushed smiled slightly and looked away Who is that tall man just gone up to speak to him she asked of her companion That is Lord Wandle said Lady Winterbourne and his plain second wife behind him Edward always scolds me for not admiring him He says women know nothing at all about men s looks and that Lard Wandle was the most splendid man of his time But I always think it an unpleasant face Lord Wandle exclaimed Marcella frowning Oh please come with me dear Lady Winterbourne I know he is asking Aldous to introduce him and I won t no I will not be introduced to him And laying hold of her astonished companion she drew her hastily through a doorway near walked quickly still gripping her through two connected rooms beyond and finally landed her and herself on a sofa in Lord Maxwell s library pursued meanwhile through all her hurried course by the curious looks of an observant throng That man no that would really have been too much said Marcella using her large feather fan with stormy energy What is the matter with you my dear said Lady Winterbourne in her amazement and what is the matter with Lord Wandle You must know said Marcella indignantly Oh you must have seen that case in the paper last week that shocking case A woman and two children died in one of his cottages of blood poisoning nothing in the world but his neglect his brutal neglect Her breast heaved she seemed almost on the point of weeping The agent was appealed to did nothing Then the clergyman wrote to him direct and got an answer The answer was published For cruel insolence I never saw anything like it He ought to be in prison for manslaughter and he comes here And people laugh and talk with him She stopped almost choked by her own passion But the incident after all was only the spark to the mine Lady Winterbourne stared at her helplessly Perhaps it isn t true she suggested The newspapers put in so many lies especially about us the landlords Edward says one ought never to believe them Ah here comes Aldous Aldous indeed with some perplexity on his brow was to be seen approaching looking for his betrothed Marcella dropped her fan and sat erect her angry colour fading into whiteness My darling I couldn t think what had become of you May I bring Lord Wandle and introduce him to you He is an old friend here and my godfather Not that I am particularly proud of the relationship he said dropping his voice as he stooped over her He is a soured disagreeable fellow and I hate many of the things he does But it is an old tie and my grandfather is tender of such things Only a word or two then I will get rid of him Aldous I can t said Marcella looking up at him How could I I saw that case I must be rude to him Aldous looked considerably disturbed It was very bad he said slowly I didn t know you had seen it What shall I do I promised to go back for him Lord Wandle Miss Boyce said Miss Raeburn s sharp little voice behind Aldous Aldous moving aside in hasty dismay saw his aunt looking very determined presenting her tall neighbour who bowed with old fashioned deference to the girl on the sofa Lady Winterbourne looked with trepidation at Marcella But the social instinct held to some extent Ninety nine women can threaten a scene of the kind Lady Winterbourne dreaded for one that can carry it through Marcella wavered then with her most forbidding air she made a scarcely perceptible return of Lord Wandle s bow Did you escape in here out of the heat he asked her But I am afraid no one lets you escape to night The occasion is too interesting Marcella made no reply Lady Winterbourne threw in a nervous remark on the crowd Oh yes a great crush said Lord Wandle Of course we all come to see Aldous happy How long is it Miss Boyce since you settled at Mellor Six months She looked straight before her and not at him as she answered and her tone made Miss Raeburn s blood boil Lord Wandle a battered coarsened but still magnificent looking man of sixty examined the speaker an instant from half shut eyes then put up his hand to his moustache with a half smile You like the country Yes As she spoke her reluctant monosyllable the girl had really no conception of the degree of hostility expressed in her manner Instead she was hating herself for her own pusillanimity And the people Some of them And straightway she raised her fierce black eyes to his and the man before her understood as plainly as any one need understand that whoever else Miss Boyce might like she did not like Lord Wandle and wished for no more conversation with him Her interrogator turned to Aldous with smiling aplomb Thank you my dear Aldous Now let me retire No one must monopolise your charming lady And again he bowed low to her this time with an ironical emphasis not to be mistaken and walked away Lady Winterbourne saw him go up to his wife who had followed him at a distance and speak to her roughly with a frown They left the room and presently through the other door of the library which opened on the corridor she saw them pass as though they were going to their carriage Marcella rose She looked first at Miss Raeburn then at Aldous Will you take me away she said going up to him I am tired take me to your room He put her hand inside his arm and they pushed their way through the crowd Outside in the passage they met Hallin He had not seen her before and he put out his hand But there was something distant in his gentle greeting which struck at this moment like a bruise on Marcella s quivering nerves It came across her that for some time past he had made no further advances to her that his first eager talk of friendship between himself and her had dropped that his acceptance of her into his world and Aldous s was somehow suspended in abeyance She bit her lip tightly and hurried Aldous along Again the same lines of gay chatting people along the corridor and on either side of the wide staircase greetings introduction a nightmare of publicity Rather pronounced to carry him off like that said a clergyman to his wife with a kindly smile as the two tall figures disappeared along the upper gallery She will have him all to herself before long Aldous shut the door of his sitting room behind them Marcella quickly drew her hand out of his arm and going forward to the mantelpiece rested both elbows upon it and hid her face He looked at her a moment in distress and astonishment standing a little apart Then he saw that she was crying The colour flooded into his face and going up to her he took her hand which was all she would yield him and holding it to his lips said in her ear every soothing tender word that love s tutoring could bring to mind In his emotion he told himself and her that he admired and loved her the more for the incident downstairs for the temper she had shown She alone among them all had had the courage to strike the true stern Christian note As to the annoyance such courage might bring upon him and her in the future even as to the trouble it might cause his own dear folk what real matter In these things she should lead What could love have asked better than such a moment Yet Marcella s weeping was in truth the weeping of despair This man s very sweetness to her his very assumption of the right to comfort and approve her roused in her a desperate stifled sense of bonds that should never have been made and that now could not be broken It was all plain to her at last His touch had no thrill for her his frown no terror She had accepted him without loving him coveting what he could give her And now it seemed to her that she cared nothing for anything he could give that the life before her was to be one series of petty conflicts between her and a surrounding circumstance which must inevitably in the end be too strong for her conflicts from which neither heart nor ambition could gain anything She had desired a great position for what she might do with it But could she do with it She would be subdued oh very quickly to great houses and great people and all the vapid pomp and idle toil of wealth All that picture of herself stooping from place and power to bind up the wounds of the people in which she had once delighted was to her now a mere flimsy vulgarity She had been shown other ideals other ways and her pulses were still swaying under the audacity the virile inventive force of the showman Everything she had once desired looked flat to her everything she was not to have glowed and shone Poverty adventure passion the joys of self realisation these she gave up She would become Lady Maxwell make friends with Miss Raeburn and wear the family diamonds Then in the midst of her rage with herself and fate she drew herself away looked up and caught full the eyes of Aldous Raeburn Conscience stung and burned What was this life she had dared to trifle with this man she had dared to treat as a mere pawn in her own game She gave way utterly appalled at her own misdoing and behaved like a penitent child Aldous astonished and alarmed by her emotions and by the wild incoherent things she said won his way at last to some moments of divine happiness when leaving her trembling hand in his she sat submissively beside him gradually quieting down summoning back her smiles and her beauty and letting him call her all the fond names he would CHAPTER VIII Scarcely a word was exchanged between Marcella and her mother on the drive home Yet under ordinary circumstances Marcella s imagination would have found some painful exercise in the effort to find out in what spirit her mother had taken the evening the first social festivity in which Richard Boyce s wife had taken part for sixteen years In fact missus Boyce had gone through it very quietly After her first public entry on Lord Maxwell s arm she had sat in her corner taking keen note of everything enjoying probably the humours of her kind Several old acquaintances who had seen her at Mellor as a young wife in her first married years had come up with some trepidation to speak to her She had received them with her usual well bred indifference and they had gone away under the impression that she regarded herself as restored to society by this great match that her daughter was making Lady Winterbourne had been shyly and therefore formidably kind to her and both Lord Maxwell and Miss Raeburn had been genuinely interested in smoothing the effort to her as much as they could She meanwhile watched Marcella except through the encounter with Lord Wandle which she did not see and found some real pleasure in talking both to Aldous and to Hallin Yet all through she was preoccupied and towards the end very anxious to get home a state of mind which prevented her from noticing Marcella s changed looks after her reappearance with Aldous in the ball room as closely as she otherwise might have done Yet the mother had observed that the end of Marcella s progress had been somewhat different from the beginning that the girl s greetings had been gentler her smiles softer and that in particular she had taken some pains some wistful pains to make Hallin talk to her Lord Maxwell ignorant of the Wandle incident was charmed with her and openly said so both to the mother and Lady Winterbourne in his hearty old man s way Only Miss Raeburn held indignantly aloof and would not pretend even to missus Boyce And now Marcella was tired dead tired she said to herself both in mind and body She lay back in the carriage trying to sink herself in her own fatigue to forget everything to think of nothing Outside the night was mild and the moon clear For some days past after the break up of the long frost there had been heavy rain Now the rain had cleared away and in the air there was already an early promise of spring As she walked home from the village that afternoon she had felt the buds and the fields stirring When they got home missus Boyce turned to her daughter at the head of the stairs Shall I unlace your dress Marcella Oh no thank you Can I help you No Good night Mamma Marcella turned and ran after her I should like to know how papa is I will wait here if you will tell me missus Boyce looked surprised Then she went into her room and shut the door Marcella waited outside leaning against the old oak gallery which ran round the hall her candle the one spot of light and life in the great dark house He seems to have slept well said missus Boyce reappearing and speaking under her breath He has not taken the opiate I left for him so he cannot have been in pain Good night Marcella kissed her and went Somehow in her depression of nerve and will she was loth to go away by herself The loneliness of the night and of her wing of the house weighed upon her the noises made by the old boards under her steps the rustling draughts from the dark passages to right and left startled and troubled her she found herself childishly fearing lest her candle should go out Yet as she descended the two steps to the passage outside her door she could have felt little practical need of it for the moonlight was streaming in through its uncovered windows not directly but reflected from the Tudor front of the house which ran at right angles to this passage and was to night a shining silver palace every battlement window and moulding in sharpest light and shade under the radiance of the night Beneath her feet as she looked out into the Cedar Garden was a deep triangle of shadow thrown by that part of the building in which she stood and beyond the garden the barred black masses of the cedars closing up the view lent additional magic to the glittering unsubstantial fabric of the moonlit house which was as it were embosomed and framed among them She paused a moment struck by the strangeness and beauty of the spectacle The Tudor front had the air of some fairy banqueting hall lit by unearthly hands for some weird gathering of ghostly knights Then she turned to her room impatiently longing in her sick fatigue to be quit of her dress and ornaments and tumble into sleep Yet she made no hurry She fell on the first chair that offered Her candle behind her had little power over the glooms of the dark tapestried room but it did serve to illuminate the lines of her own form as she saw it reflected in the big glass of her wardrobe straight in front of her She sat with her hands round her knees absently looking at herself a white long limbed apparition struck out of the darkness But she was conscious of nothing save one mounting overwhelming passionate desire almost a cry mister Wharton must go away he must or she could not bear it Quick alternations of insight memory self recognition self surrender rose and broke upon her At last physical weariness recalled her She put up her hands to take off her pearls As she did so she started hearing a noise that made her turn her head Just outside her door a little spiral staircase led down from her corridor to the one below which ran at the back of the old library and opened into the Cedar Garden at its further end Steps surely light steps along the corridor outside and on the staircase Nor did they die away She could still hear them as she sat arrested straining her ears pacing slowly along the lower passage Her heart after its pause leapt into fluttering life This room of hers the two passages the library and the staircase represented that part of the house to which the ghost stories of Mellor clung most persistently Substantially the block of building was of early Tudor date but the passages and the staircase had been alterations made with some clumsiness at the time of the erection of the eighteenth century front with a view to bringing these older rooms into the general plan Marcella however might demonstrate as she pleased that the Boyce who was supposed to have stabbed himself on the staircase died at least forty years before the staircase was made None the less no servant would go alone if she could help it into either passage after dark and there was much excited marvelling how Miss Boyce could sleep where she did Deacon abounded in stories of things spiritual and peripatetic of steps groans lights in the library and the rest Marcella had consistently laughed at her Yet all the same she had made in secret a very diligent pursuit of this ghost settling in the end to a certain pique with him that he would not show himself to so ardent a daughter of the house She had sat up waiting for him she had lingered in the corridor outside and on the stairs expecting him By the help of a favourite carpenter she had made researches into roofs water pipes panelling and old cupboards in the hope of finding a practical clue to him In vain Yet here were the steps regular soft unmistakable The colour rushed back into her cheeks Her eager healthy youth forgot its woes flung off its weariness and panted for an adventure a discovery Springing up she threw her fur wrap round her again and gently opened the door listening For a minute nothing then a few vague sounds as of something living and moving down below surely in the library Then the steps again Impossible that it should be any one breaking in No burglar would walk so leisurely She closed her door behind her and gathering her white satin skirts about her she descended the staircase The corridor below was in radiant moonlight chequered by the few pieces of old furniture it contained and the black and white of the old portrait prints hanging on the walls At first her seeking excited eyes could make out nothing Then in a flash they perceived the figure of Wharton at the further end near the garden door leaning against one of the windows He was apparently looking out at the moonlit house and she caught the faint odour of a cigarette Her first instinct was to turn and fly But Wharton had seen her As he looked about him at the sound of her approach the moon which was just rounding the corner of the house struck on her full amid the shadows of the staircase and she heard his exclamation Dignity a natural pride made her pause She came forward slowly he eagerly I heard footsteps she said with a coldness under which he plainly saw her embarrassment I could not suppose that anybody was still up so I came down to see He was silent a moment scanning her with laughing eyes Then he shook his head Confess you took me for the ghost he said She hesitated then must laugh too She herself had told him the stories so that his guess was natural Perhaps I did she said One more disappointment Good night He looked after her a quick undecided moment as she made a step in front of him then at the half burnt cigarette he held in his hand threw the end away with a hasty gesture overtook her and walked beside her along the corridor I heard you and your mother come in he said as though explaining himself Then I waited till I thought you must both be asleep and came down here to look at that wonderful effect on the old house He pointed to the silver palace outside I have a trick of being sleepless a trick too of wandering at night My own people know it and bear with me but I am abashed that you should have found me out Just tell me in one word how the ball went He paused at the foot of the stairs his hands on his sides as keenly wide awake as though it were three o clock in the afternoon instead of three in the morning Womanlike her mood instantly shaped itself to his It went very well she said perversely putting her satin slippered foot on the first step There were six hundred people upstairs and four hundred coachmen and footmen downstairs according to our man Everybody said it was splendid His piercing enigmatic gaze could not leave her As he had often frankly warned her he was a man in quest of sensations Certainly in this strange meeting with Aldous Raeburn s betrothed in the midst of the sleep bound house he had found one Her eyes were heavy her cheek pale But in this soft vague light white arms and neck now hidden now revealed by the cloak she had thrown about her glistening satin she was more enchanting than he had ever seen her His breath quickened He said to himself that he would make Miss Boyce stay and talk to him What harm to her or to Raeburn Raeburn would have chances enough before long Why admit his monopoly before the time She was not in love with him As to missus Grundy absurd What in the true reasonableness of things was to prevent human beings from conversing by night as well as by day One moment he said delaying her You must be dead tired too tired for romance Else I should say to you turn aside an instant and look at the library It is a sight to remember Inevitably she glanced behind her and saw that the library door was ajar He flung it open and the great room showed wide its high domed roof lost in shadow while along the bare floor and up the latticed books crept here streaks and fingers and there wide breadths of light from the unshuttered and curtainless windows Isn t it the very poetry of night and solitude he said looking in with her You love the place but did you ever see it so lovable The dead are here you did right to come and seek them Look at your namesake in that ray To night she lives She knows that is her husband opposite those are her books beside her And the rebel he pointed smiling to the portrait of John Boyce When you are gone I shall shut myself up here sit in his chair invoke him and put my speech together I am nervous about to morrow he was bound as she knew to a large Labour Congress in the Midlands where he was to preside and sleep will make no terms with me Ah how strange Who can that be passing the avenue He made a step or two into the room and put up his hand to his brow looking intently Involuntarily yet with a thrill Marcella followed They walked to the window It is Hurd she cried in a tone of distress pressing her face against the glass Out at this time and with a gun Oh dear dear There could be no question that it was Hurd Wharton had seen him linger in the shadowy edge of the avenue as though reconnoitring and now as he stealthily crossed the moonlit grass his slouching dwarf s figure his large head and the short gun under his arm were all plainly visible What do you suppose he is after said Wharton still gazing his hands in his pockets I don t know he wouldn t poach on our land I m sure he wouldn t Besides there is nothing to poach Wharton smiled He must be going after all to Lord Maxwell s coverts They are just beyond the avenue on the side of the hill Oh it is too disappointing Can we do anything She looked at her companion with troubled eyes This incursion of something sadly and humanly real seemed suddenly to have made it natural to be standing beside him there at that strange hour Her conscience was soothed Wharton shook his head I don t see what we could do How strong the instinct is I told you that woman had a secret Well it is only one form the squalid peasant s form of the same instinct which sends the young fellows of our class ruffling it and chancing it all over the world It is the instinct to take one s fling to get out of the rut to claim one s innings against the powers that be Nature or the law or convention I know all that I never blame them cried Marcella but just now it is so monstrous so dangerous Westall specially alert and this gang about Besides I got him work from Lord Maxwell and made him promise me for the wife and children s sake Wharton shrugged his shoulders I should think Westall is right and that the gang have got hold of him It is what always happens The local man is the catspaw So you are sorry for him this man he said in another tone facing round upon her She looked astonished and drew herself up nervously turning at the same time to leave the room But before she could reply he hurried on He may escape his risk Give your pity Miss Boyce rather to one who has not escaped I don t know what you mean she said unconsciously laying a hand on one of the old chairs beside her to steady herself But it is too late to talk Good night mister Wharton Good bye he said quietly yet with a low emphasis at the same time moving out of her path She stopped hesitating Beneath the lace and faded flowers on her breast he could see how her heart beat Not good bye You are coming back after the meeting I think not I must not inflict myself on missus Boyce any more You will all be very busy during the next three weeks It would be an intrusion if I were to come back at such a time especially considering the fact he spoke slowly that I am as distasteful as I now know myself to be to your future husband Since you all left to night the house has been very quiet I sat over the fire thinking It grew clear to me I must go and go at once Besides a lonely man as I am must not risk his nerve His task is set him and there are none to stand by him if he fails She trembled all over Weariness and excitement made normal self control almost impossible Well then I must say thank you she said indistinctly for you have taught me a great deal You will unlearn it he said gaily recovering his self possession so it seemed as she lost hers Besides before many weeks are over you will have heard hard things of me I know that very well I can say nothing to meet them Nor should I attempt anything It may sound brazen but that past of mine which I can see perpetually present in Aldous Raeburn s mind for instance and which means so much to his good aunt means to me just nothing at all The doctrine of identity must be true I must be the same person I was then But all the same what I did then does not matter a straw to me now To all practical purposes I am another man I was then a youth idle desoeuvre playing with all the keys of life in turn I have now unlocked the path that suits me Its quest has transformed me as I believe ennobled me I do not ask Raeburn or any one else to believe it It is my own affair Only if we ever meet again in life you and I and you think you have reason to ask humiliation of me do not ask it do not expect it The man you will have in your mind has nothing to do with me I will not be answerable for his sins As he said these things he was leaning lightly forward looking up at her his arms resting on the back of one of the old chairs one foot crossed over the other The attitude was easy calm itself The tone indomitable analytic reflective matched it Yet all the same her woman s instinct divined a hidden agitation and woman like responded to that and that only mister Raeburn will never tell me old stories about anybody she said proudly I asked him once out out of curiosity about you and he would tell me nothing Generous said Wharton drily I am grateful No cried Marcella indignantly rushing blindly at the outlet for emotion No you are not grateful you are always judging him harshly criticising despising what he does Wharton was silent a moment Even in the moonlight she could see the reddening of his cheek So be it he said at last I submit You must know best But you are you always content Does this milieu into which you are passing always satisfy you To night did your royalty please you will it soon be enough for you You know it is not enough she broke out hotly it is insulting that you should ask in that tone It means that you think me a hypocrite and I have given you no cause Good heavens no he exclaimed interrupting her and speaking in a low hurried voice I had no motive no reason for what I said none but this that you are going that we are parting I spoke in gibes to make you speak somehow to strike to reach you To morrow it will be too late And before almost she knew that he had moved he had stooped forward caught a fold of her dress pressed it to his lips and dropped it Don t speak he said brokenly springing up and standing before her in her path You shall forgive me I will compel it See here we are on this moonlit space of floor alone in the night Very probably we shall never meet again except as strangers Put off convention and speak to me soul to soul You are not happy altogether in this marriage I know it You have as good as confessed it Yet you will go through with it You have given your word your honour holds you I recognise that it holds you I say nothing not a syllable against your bond But here to night tell me promise me that you will make this marriage of yours serve our hopes and ends the ends that you and I have foreseen together that it shall be your instrument not your chain We have been six weeks together You say you have learnt from me you have you have given me your mind your heart to write on and I have written Henceforward you will never look at life as you might have done if I had not been here Do you think I triumph that I boast Ah he drew in his breath What if in helping you and teaching you for I have helped and taught you I have undone myself What if I came here the slave of impersonal causes of ends not my own What if I leave maimed in face of the battle Not your fault No perhaps not but at least you owe me some gentleness now in these last words some kindness in farewell He came closer held out his hands With one of her own she put his back and lifted the other dizzily to her forehead Don t come near me she said tottering What is it I cannot see Go And guiding herself as though blindfold to a chair she sank upon it and her head dropped It was the natural result of a moment of intense excitement coming upon nerves already strained and tried to their utmost She fought desperately against her weakness but there was a moment when all around her swam and she knew nothing Then came a strange awakening What was this room this weird light these unfamiliar forms of things this warm support against which her cheek lay She opened her eyes languidly They met Wharton s half in wonder He was kneeling beside her holding her But for an instant she realised nothing except his look to which her own helplessly replied Once she heard him whisper Once Then nothing more for ever And stooping slowly deliberately he kissed her In a stinging flow life shame returned upon her She struggled to her feet pushing him from her You dared she said dared such a thing She could say no more but her attitude fiercely instinct through all her physical weakness with her roused best self was speech enough He did not venture to approach her She walked away He heard the door close hurrying steps on the little stairs then silence He remained where she had left him leaning against the latticed wall for some time When he moved it was to pick up a piece of maidenhair which had dropped from her dress That was a scene he said looking at it and at the trembling of his own hand It carries one back to the days of the Romantics Was I Alfred de Musset and she George Sand Did any of them ever taste a more poignant moment than I when she lay upon my breast To be helpless yet yield nothing it challenged me Yet I took no advantage none When she looked when her eye her soul was for that instant mine then Well the world has rushed with me since I saw her on the stairs life can bring me nothing of such a quality again What did I say how much did I mean My God how can I tell I began as an actor did I finish as a man He paced up and down thinking gradually by the help of an iron will quieting down each rebellious pulse That poacher fellow did me a good turn Dare the word galled But after all what woman could say less And what matter I have held her in my arms in a setting under a moon worthy of her Is not life enriched thereby beyond robbery And what harm Raeburn is not injured She will never tell and neither of us will ever forget Ah what was that He walked quickly to the window What he had heard had been a dull report coming apparently from the woods beyond the eastern side of the avenue As he reached the window it was followed by a second That poacher s gun no doubt he strained his eyes in vain Collision perhaps and mischief No matter I have nothing to do with it The world is all lyric for me to night I can hear in it no other rhythm The night passed away When the winter morning broke Marcella was lying with wide sleepless eyes waiting and pining for it Her candle still burnt beside her she had had no courage for darkness nor the smallest desire for sleep She had gone through shame and anguish But she would have scorned to pity herself Was it not her natural inevitable portion I will tell Aldous everything everything she said to herself for the hundredth time as the light penetrated Was that only seven striking seven impossible She sat up haggard and restless hardly able to bear the thought of the hours that must pass before she could see Aldous put all to the touch Suddenly she remembered Hurd then old Patton He was dying last night she thought in her moral torment her passion to get away from herself Is he gone This is the hour when old people die the dawn I will go and see go at once She sprang up To baffle this ache within her by some act of repentance of social amends however small however futile to propitiate herself if but by a hairbreadth this no doubt was the instinct at work She dressed hastily glad of the cold glad of the effort she had to make against the stiffness of her own young bones glad of her hunger and faintness of everything physically hard that had to be fought and conquered In a very short time she had passed quietly downstairs and through the hall greatly to the amazement of William who opened the front door for her Once in the village road the damp raw air revived her greatly She lifted her hot temples to it welcoming the waves of wet mist that swept along the road feeling her youth come back to her Suddenly as she was nearing the end of a narrow bit of lane between high hedges and the first houses of the village were in sight she was stopped by a noise behind her a strange unaccountable noise as of women s voices calling and wailing It startled and frightened her and she stood in the middle of the road waiting Then she saw coming towards her two women running at full speed crying and shouting their aprons up to their faces What is it What is the matter she asked going to meet them and recognising two labourers wives she knew Oh miss oh miss said the foremost too wrapt up in her news to be surprised at the sight of her They ve just found him they re bringin ov im home they ve got a shutter from Muster Wellin im at Disley Farm It wor close by Disley wood they found em And there s one ov is men they ve sent off ridin for the inspector here he come miss Come out o th way They dragged her back and a young labourer galloped past them on a farm colt urging it on to its full pace his face red and set Who is found cried Marcella What is it Westall miss Lor bless you Shot him in the head they did blowed his brains right out and Charlie Dynes oh he s knocked about shamful the doctor don t give no hopes of him Oh deary deary me And we re goin for Muster Harden ee must tell the widder or Miss Mary none on us can And who did it said Marcella pale with horror holding her Why the poachers miss Them as they ve bin waitin for all along and they do say as Jim Hurd s in it Oh Lord oh Lord Marcella stood petrified and let them hurry on CHAPTER IX The lane was still again save for the unwonted sounds coming from the groups which had gathered round the two women and were now moving beside them along the village street a hundred yards ahead Marcella stood in a horror of memory seeing Hurd s figure cross the moonlit avenue from dark to dark Where was he Had he escaped Suddenly she set off running stung by the thought of what might have already happened under the eyes of that unhappy wife those wretched children As she entered the village a young fellow ran up to her in breathless excitement They ve got im miss He d come straight home adn t made no attempt to run As soon as Jenkins Jenkins was the policeman heared of it ee went straight across to is house an caught im Ee wor goin to make off is wife ad been persuadin ov im all night But they ve got him miss sure enough The lad s exultation was horrible Marcella waved him aside and ran on A man on horseback appeared on the road in front of her leading from Widrington to the village She recognised Aldous Raeburn who had checked his horse in sudden amazement as he saw her talking to the boy My darling what are you here for Oh go home go home out of this horrible business They have sent for me as a magistrate Dynes is alive I beg you go home She shook her head out of breath and speechless with running At the same moment she and he looking to the right caught sight of the crowd standing in front of Hurd s cottage A man ran out from it seeing the horse and its rider Muster Raeburn Muster Raeburn They ve cotched im Jenkins has got im Ah said Aldous drawing a long stern breath he didn t try to get off then Marcella you are not going there to that house He spoke in a tone of the strongest remonstrance Her soul rose in anger against it I am going to her she said panting don t wait And she left him and hurried on As soon as the crowd round the cottage saw her coming they divided to let her pass She s quiet now miss said a woman to her significantly nodding towards the hovel Just after Jenkins got in you could hear her crying out pitiful That was when they wor a handcuffin him said a man beside her Marcella shuddered Will they let me in she asked They won t let none ov us in said the man There s Hurd s sister and he pointed to a weeping woman supported by two others They ve kep her out But here s the inspector miss you ask him The inspector a shrewd officer of long experience fetched in haste from a mile s distance galloped up and gave his horse to a boy Marcella went up to him He looked at her with sharp interrogation You are Miss Boyce Miss Boyce of Mellor Yes I want to go to the wife I will promise not to get in your way He nodded The crowd let them pass The inspector knocked at the door which was cautiously unlocked by Jenkins and the two went in together She s a queer one said a thin weasel eyed man in the crowd to his neighbour To think o her bein in it at this time o day You could see Muster Raeburn was a tellin of her to go ome But she s allus pampered them Hurds The speaker was Ned Patton old Patton s son and Hurd s companion on many a profitable night walk It was barely a week since he had been out with Hurd on another ferreting expedition some of the proceeds of which were still hidden in Patton s outhouse But at the present moment he was one of the keenest of the crowd watching eagerly for the moment when he should see his old comrade come out trapped and checkmated bound safely and surely to the gallows The natural love of incident and change which keeps life healthy had been starved in him by his labourer s condition This sudden excitement had made a brute of him The man next him grimaced and took his pipe out of his mouth a moment She won t be able to do nothin for im There isn t a man nor boy in this ere place as didn t know as ee hated Westall like pison and would be as like as not to do for im some day That ll count agen im now terrible strong Ee wor allus one to blab ee wor Well an Westall said jus as much struck in another voice theer wor sure to be a fight iv ever Westall got at im on the job You see they may bring it in manslarter after all Ow does any one know ee wor there at all who seed him inquired a white haired elderly man raising a loud quavering voice from the middle of the crowd Charlie Dynes seed im cried several together How do yer know ee seed im From the babel of voices which followed the white haired man slowly gathered the beginnings of the matter Charlie Dynes Westall s assistant had been first discovered by a horsekeeper in Farmer Wellin s employment as he was going to his work The lad had been found under a hedge bleeding and frightfully injured but still alive Close beside him was the dead body of Westall with shot wounds in the head On being taken to the farm and given brandy Dynes was asked if he had recognised anybody He had said there were five of them town chaps and then he had named Hurd quite plainly whether anybody else nobody knew It was said he would die and that mister Raeburn had gone to take his deposition An them town chaps got off eh said the elderly man Clean said Patton refilling his pipe Trust them Meanwhile inside this poor cottage Marcella was putting out all the powers of the soul As the door closed behind her and the inspector she saw Hurd sitting handcuffed in the middle of the kitchen watched by a man whom Jenkins the local policeman had got in to help him till some more police should arrive Jenkins was now upstairs searching the bedroom The little bronchitic boy sat on the fender in front of the untidy fireless grate shivering his emaciated face like a yellowish white mask his eyes fixed immovably on his father Every now and then he was shaken with coughing but still he looked with the dumb devoted attention of some watching animal Hurd too was sitting silent His eyes which seemed wider open and more brilliant than usual wandered restlessly from thing to thing about the room his great earth stained hands in their fetters twitched every now and then on his knee Haggard and dirty as he was there was a certain aloofness a dignity even about the misshapen figure which struck Marcella strangely Both criminal and victim may have it this dignity It means that a man feels himself set apart from his kind Hurd started at sight of Marcella I want to speak to her he said hoarsely as the inspector approached him to that lady nodding towards her Very well said the inspector only it is my duty to warn you that anything you say now will be taken down and used as evidence at the inquest Marcella came near As she stood in front of him one trembling ungloved hand crossed over the other the diamond in her engagement ring catching the light from the window sparkled brightly diverting even for the moment the eyes of the little fellow against whom her skirts were brushing Ee might ha killed me just as well as I killed im said Hurd bending over to her and speaking with difficulty from the dryness of his mouth I didn t mean nothink o what happened He and Charlie came on us round Disley Wood He didn t take no notice o them It was they as beat Charlie But he came straight on at me all in a fury a blackguardin ov me with his stick up I thought he was for beatin my brains out an I up with my gun and fired He was so close that was how he got it all in the head But ee might a killed me just as well He paused staring at her with a certain anguished intensity as though he were watching to see how she took it nay trying its effect both on her and himself He did not look afraid or cast down nay there was a curious buoyancy and steadiness about his manner for the moment which astonished her She could almost have fancied that he was more alive more of a man than she had ever seen him mind and body better fused more at command Is there anything more you wish to say to me she asked him after waiting Then suddenly his manner changed Their eyes met Hers with all their subtle inheritance of various expression their realised character as it were searched his tried to understand them those peasant eyes so piercing to her strained sense in their animal urgency and shame Why had he done this awful thing deceived her wrecked his wife that was what her look asked It seemed to her too childish too stupid to be believed I haven t made nobbut a poor return to you miss he said in a shambling way as though the words were dragged out of him Then he threw up his head again But I didn t mean nothink o what happened he repeated doggedly going off again into a rapid yet on the whole vivid and consecutive account of Westall s attack to which Marcella listened trying to remember every word Keep that for your solicitor the inspector said at last interrupting him you are only giving pain to Miss Boyce You had better let her go to your wife Hurd looked steadily once more at Marcella It be a bad end I m come to he said after a moment But I thank you kindly all the same They ll want seein after He jerked his head towards the boy then towards the outhouse or scullery where his wife was She takes it terr ble hard She wanted me to run But I said No I ll stan it out mister Brown at the Court ll give you the bit wages he owes me But they ll have to go on the Union Everybody ll turn their backs on them now

none	none	said Marcella and I will do the best I can for you Now I will go to missus Hurd Minta Hurd was sitting in a corner of the outhouse on the clay floor her head leaning against the wall The face was turned upward the eyes shut the mouth helplessly open When Marcella saw her she knew that the unhappy woman had already wept so much in the hours since her husband came back to her that she could weep no more The two little girls in the scantiest of clothing half fastened sat on the floor beside her shivering and begrimed watching her They had been crying at the tops of their voices but were now only whimpering miserably and trying at intervals to dry their tear stained cheeks with the skirts of their frocks The baby wrapped in an old shawl lay on its mother s knee asleep and unheeded The little lean to place full of odds and ends of rubbish and darkened overhead by a string of damp clothes was intolerably cold in the damp February dawn The children were blue the mother felt like ice as Marcella stooped to touch her Outcast misery could go no further The mother moaned as she felt Marcella s hand then started wildly forward straining her thin neck and swollen eyes that she might see through the two open doors of the kitchen and the outhouse They re not taking him away she said fiercely Jenkins swore to me they d give me notice No he s still there said Marcella her voice shaking The inspector s come You shall have notice missus Hurd recognised her voice and looked up at her in amazement You must put this on said Marcella taking off the short fur cape she wore You are perished Give me the baby and wrap yourself in it But missus Hurd put it away from her with a vehement hand I m not cold miss I m burning hot He made me come in here He said he d do better if the children and I ud go away a bit An I couldn t go upstairs because because she hid her face on her knees Marcella had a sudden sick vision of the horrors this poor creature must have gone through since her husband had appeared to her splashed with the blood of his enemy under that same marvellous moon which Her mind repelled its own memories with haste Moreover she was aware of the inspector standing at the kitchen door and beckoning to her She stole across to him so softly that missus Hurd did not hear her We have found all we want he said in his official tone but under his breath the clothes anyway We must now look for the gun Jenkins is first going to take him off to Widrington The inquest will be held to morrow here at The Green Man We shall bring him over Then he added in another voice touching his hat I don t like leaving you miss in this place Shall Jenkins go and fetch somebody to look after that poor thing They ll be all swarming in here as soon as we ve gone No I ll stay for a while I ll look after her They won t come in if I m here Except his sister missus Mullins she may come in of course if she wants The inspector hesitated I m going now to meet mister Raeburn miss I ll tell him that you re here He knows said Marcella briefly Now are you ready He signed assent and Marcella went back to the wife missus Hurd she said kneeling on the ground beside her they re going The wife sprang up with a cry and ran into the kitchen where Hurd was already on his feet between Jenkins and another policeman who were to convey him to the gaol at Widrington But when she came face to face with her husband something perhaps the nervous appeal in his strained eyes checked her and she controlled herself piteously She did not even attempt to kiss him With her eyes on the ground she put her hand on his arm They ll let me come and see you Jim she said trembling Yes you can find out the rules he said shortly Don t let them children cry They want their breakfast to warm them There s plenty of coal I brought a sack home from Jellaby s last night myself Good bye Now march said the inspector sternly pushing the wife back Marcella put her arm round the shaking woman The door opened and beyond the three figures as they passed out her eye passed to the waiting crowd then to the misty expanse of common and the dark woods behind still wrapped in fog When missus Hurd saw the rows of people waiting within a stone s throw of the door she shrank back Perhaps it struck her as it struck Marcella that every face was the face of a foe Marcella ran to the door as the inspector stepped out and locked it after him missus Hurd hiding herself behind a bit of baize curtain watched the two policemen mount with Hurd into the fly that was waiting and then followed it with her eyes along the bit of straight road uttering sounds the while of low anguish which wrung the heart in Marcella s breast Looking back in after days it always seemed to her that for this poor soul the true parting the true wrench between life and life came at this moment She went up to her her own tears running over You must come and lie down she said recovering herself as quickly as possible You and the children are both starved and you will want your strength if you are to help him I will see to things She put the helpless woman on the wooden settle by the fireplace rolling up her cloak to make a pillow Now Willie you sit by your mother Daisy where s the cradle Put the baby down and come and help me make the fire The dazed children did exactly as they were told and the mother lay like a log on the settle Marcella found coal and wood under Daisy s guidance and soon lit the fire piling on the fuel with a lavish hand Daisy brought her water and she filled the kettle and set it on to boil while the little girl still sobbing at intervals like some little weeping automaton laid the breakfast Then the children all crouched round the warmth while Marcella rubbed their cold hands and feet and mothered them Shaken as she was with emotion and horror she was yet full of a passionate joy that this pity this tendance was allowed to her The crushing weight of self contempt had lifted She felt morally free and at ease Already she was revolving what she could do for Hurd It was as clear as daylight to her that there had been no murder but a free fight an even chance between him and Westall The violence of a hard and tyrannous man had provoked his own destruction so it stood for her passionate protesting sense That at any rate must be the defence and some able man must be found to press it She thought she would write to the Cravens and consult them Her thoughts carefully avoided the names both of Aldous Raeburn and of Wharton She was about to make the tea when some one knocked at the door It proved to be Hurd s sister a helpless woman with a face swollen by crying who seemed to be afraid to come into the cottage and afraid to go near her sister in law Marcella gave her money and sent her for some eggs to the neighbouring shop then told her to come back in half an hour and take charge She was an incapable but there was nothing better to be done Where is Miss Harden she asked the woman The answer was that ever since the news came to the village the rector and his sister had been with missus Westall and Charlie Dyne s mother missus Westall had gone into fit after fit it had taken two to hold her and Charlie s mother who was in bed recovering from pneumonia had also been very bad Again Marcella s heart contracted with rage rather than pity Such wrack and waste of human life moral and physical for what For the protection of a hateful sport which demoralised the rich and their agents no less than it tempted and provoked the poor When she had fed and physically comforted the children she went and knelt down beside missus Hurd who still lay with closed eyes in heavy breathing stupor Dear missus Hurd she said I want you to drink this tea and eat something The half stupefied woman signed refusal But Marcella insisted You have got to fight for your husband s life she said firmly and to look after your children I must go in a very short time and before I go you must tell me all that you can of this business Hurd would tell you to do it He knows and you know that I am to be trusted I want to save him I shall get a good lawyer to help him But first you must take this and then you must talk to me The habit of obedience to a lady established long ago in years of domestic service held The miserable wife submitted to be fed looked with forlorn wonder at the children round the fire and then sank back with a groan In her tension of feeling Marcella for an impatient moment thought her a poor creature Then with quick remorse she put her arms tenderly round her raised the dishevelled grey streaked head on her shoulder and stooping kissed the marred face her own lips quivering You are not alone said the girl with her whole soul You shall never be alone while I live Now tell me She made the white and gasping woman sit up in a corner of the settle and she herself got a stool and established herself a little way off frowning self contained and determined to make out the truth Shall I send the children upstairs she asked No said the boy suddenly in his husky voice shaking his head with energy I m not a going Oh he s safe is Willie said missus Hurd looking at him but strangely and as it were from a long distance and the others is too little Then gradually Marcella got the story out of her first the misery of alarm and anxiety in which she had lived ever since the Tudley End raid owing first to her knowledge of Hurd s connection with it and with the gang that had carried it out then to her appreciation of the quick and ghastly growth of the hatred between him and Westall lastly to her sense of ingratitude towards those who had been kind to them I knew we was acting bad towards you I told Jim so I couldn t hardly bear to see you come in But there miss I couldn t do anything I tried oh the Lord knows I tried There was never no happiness between us at last I talked so But I don t believe he could help himself he s not made like other folks isn t Jim Her features became convulsed again with the struggle for speech Marcella reached out for the toil disfigured hand that was fingering and clutching at the edge of the settle and held it close Gradually she made out that although Hurd had not been able of course to conceal his night absences from his wife he had kept his connection with the Oxford gang absolutely dark from her till in his wild exultation over Westall s discomfiture in the Tudley End raid he had said things in his restless snatches of sleep which had enabled her to get the whole truth out of him by degrees Her reproaches her fears had merely angered and estranged him her nature had had somehow to accommodate itself to his lest affection should lose its miserable all As to this last fatal attack on the Maxwell coverts it was clear to Marcella as she questioned and listened that the wife had long foreseen it and that she now knew much more about it than suddenly she would allow herself to say For in the midst of her out pourings she drew herself together tried to collect and calm herself looked at Marcella with an agonised suspicious eye and fell silent I don t know nothing about it miss she stubbornly declared at last with an inconsequent absurdity which smote Marcella s pity afresh How am I to know There was seven o them Oxford fellows at Tudley End that I know Who s to say as Jim was with em at all last night Who s to say as it wasn t them as She stopped shivering Marcella held her reluctant hand You don t know she said quietly that I saw your husband in here for a minute before I came in to you and that he told me as he had already told Jenkins that it was in a struggle with him that Westall was shot but that he had fired in self defence because Westall was attacking him You don t know too that Charlie Dynes is alive and says he saw Hurd Charlie Dynes missus Hurd gave a shriek and then fell to weeping and trembling again so that Marcella had need of patience If you can t help me more she said at last in despair I don t know what we shall do Listen to me Your husband will be charged with Westall s murder That I am sure of He says it was not murder that it happened in a fight I believe it I want to get a lawyer to prove it I am your friend you know I am But if you are not going to help me by telling me what you know of last night I may as well go home and get your sister in law to look after you and the children She rose as she spoke missus Hurd clutched at her Oh my God she said looking straight before her vacantly at the children who at once began to cry again Oh my God Look here miss her voice dropped her swollen eyes fixed themselves on Marcella the words came out in a low hurried stream It was just after four o clock I heard that door turn I got up in my nightgown and ran down and there was Jim Put that light out he says to me sharp like Oh Jim says I wherever have you been You ll be the death o me and them poor children You go to bed says he to me and I ll come presently But I could see him cos of the moon almost as plain as day an I couldn t take my eyes off him And he went about the kitchen so strange like puttin down his hat and takin it up again an I saw he hadn t got his gun So I went up and caught holt on him An he gave me a push back Can t you let me alone he says you ll know soon enough An then I looked at my sleeve where I d touched him oh my God my God Marcella white to the lips and shuddering too held her tight She had the seeing faculty which goes with such quick nervous natures and she saw the scene as though she had been there the moonlit cottage the miserable husband and wife the life blood on the woman s sleeve missus Hurd went on in a torrent of half finished sentences and fragments of remembered talk She told her husband s story of the encounter with the keepers as he had told it to her of course with additions and modifications already struck out by the agony of inventive pain she described how she had made him take his blood stained clothes and hide them in a hole in the roof then how she had urged him to strike across country at once and get a few hours start before the ghastly business was known But the more he talked to her the more confident he became of his own story and the more determined to stay and brave it out Besides he was shrewd enough to see that escape for a man of his deformity was impossible and he tried to make her understand it so But she was mad and blind with fear and at last just as the light was coming in he told her roughly to end their long wrestle that he should go to bed and get some sleep She would make a fool of him and he should want all his wits She followed him up the steep ladder to their room weeping And there was little Willie sitting up in bed choking with the phlegm in his throat and half dead of fright because of the voices below And when Hurd see him he went and cuddled him up and rubbed his legs and feet to warm them an I could hear him groanin And I says to him Jim if you won t go for my sake will you go for the boy s For you see miss there was a bit of money in the house an I thought he d hide himself by day and walk by night and so get to Liverpool perhaps and off to the States An it seemed as though my head would burst with listening for people comin and him taken up there like a rat in a trap an no way of provin the truth and everybody agen him because of the things he d said And he burst out a cryin an Willie cried An I came an entreated of him An he kissed me an at last he said he d go An I made haste the light was getting so terrible strong an just as he d got to the foot of the stairs an I was holding little Willie in my arms an saying good bye to him She let her head sink against the settle There was no more to say and Marcella asked no more questions she sat thinking Willie stood a wasted worn figure by his mother stroking her face his hoarse breathing was for the time the only sound in the cottage Then Marcella heard a loud knock at the door She got up and looked through the casement window The crowd had mostly dispersed but a few people stood about on the green and a policeman was stationed outside the cottage On the steps stood Aldous Raeburn his horse held behind him by a boy She went and opened the door I will come she said at once There I see missus Mullins crossing the common Now I can leave her Aldous taking off his hat closed the door behind him and stood with his hand on Marcella s arm looking at the huddled woman on the settle at the pale children There was a solemnity in his expression a mixture of judgment and pity which showed that the emotion of other scenes also scenes through which he had just passed was entering into it Poor unhappy souls he said slowly under his breath You say that you have got some one to see after her She looks as though it might kill her too Marcella nodded Now that her task for the moment was nearly over she could hardly restrain herself nervously or keep herself from crying Aldous observed her with disquiet as she put on her hat His heart was deeply stirred She had chosen more nobly for herself than he would have chosen for her in thus daring an awful experience for the sake of mercy His moral sense exalted and awed by the sight of death approved worshipped her His man s impatience pined to get her away to cherish and comfort hen Why she could hardly have slept three hours since they parted on the steps of the Court amidst the crowd of carriages missus Mullins came in still scared and weeping and dropping frightened curtseys to Muster Raeburn Marcella spoke to her a little in a whisper gave some counsels which filled Aldous with admiration for the girl s practical sense and thoughtfulness and promised to come again later missus Hurd neither moved nor opened her eyes Can you walk said Aldous bending over her as they stood outside the cottage I can see that you are worn out Could you sit my horse if I led him No let us walk They went on together followed by the eyes of the village the boy leading the horse some distance behind Where have you been said Marcella when they had passed the village Oh please don t think of my being tired I had so much rather know it all I must know it all She was deathly pale but her black eyes flashed impatience and excitement She even drew her hand out of the arm where Aldous was tenderly holding it and walked on erect by herself I have been with poor Dynes said Aldous sadly we had to take his deposition He died while I was there He died Yes The fiends who killed him had left small doubt of that But he lived long enough thank God to give the information which will I think bring them to justice The tone of the magistrate and the magnate goaded Marcella s quivering nerves What is justice she cried the system that wastes human lives in protecting your tame pheasants A cloud came over the stern clearness of his look He gave a bitter sigh the sigh of the man to whom his own position in life had been as it were one long scruple You may well ask that he said You cannot imagine that I did not ask it of myself a hundred times as I stood by that poor fellow s bedside They walked on in silence She was hardly appeased There was a deep inner excitement in her urging her towards difference towards attack At last he resumed But whatever the merits of our present game system may be the present case is surely clear horribly clear Six men with at least three guns among them probably more go out on a pheasant stealing expedition They come across two keepers one a lad of seventeen who have nothing but a light stick apiece The boy is beaten to death the keeper shot dead at the first brush by a man who has been his life long enemy and threatened several times in public to do for him If that is not brutal and deliberate murder it is difficult to say what is Marcella stood still in the misty road trying to command herself It was not deliberate she said at last with difficulty not in Hurd s case I have heard it all from his own mouth It was a struggle he might have been killed instead of Westall Westall attacked Hurd defended himself Aldous shook his head Of course Hurd would tell you so he said sadly and his poor wife He is not a bad or vicious fellow like the rest of the rascally pack Probably when he came to himself after the moment of rage he could not simply believe what he had done But that makes no difference It was murder no judge or jury could possibly take any other view Dynes s evidence is clear and the proof of motive is overwhelming Then as he saw her pallor and trembling he broke off in deep distress My dear one if I could but have kept you out of this They were alone in the misty road The boy with the horse was out of sight He would fain have put his arm round her have consoled and supported her But she would not let him Please understand she said in a sort of gasp as she drew herself away that I do not believe Hurd is guilty that I shall do my very utmost to defend him He is to me the victim of unjust abominable laws If you will not help me to protect him then I must look to some one else Aldous felt a sudden stab of suspicion presentiment Of course he will be well defended he will have every chance that you may be sure of he said slowly Marcella controlled herself and they walked on As they entered the drive of Mellor Aldous thought passionately of those divine moments in his sitting room hardly yet nine hours old And now now she walked beside him as an enemy The sound of a step on the gravel in front of them made them look up Past present and future met in the girl s bewildered and stormy sense as she recognised Wharton CHAPTER X The first sitting of the Birmingham Labour Congress was just over and the streets about the hall in which it had been held were beginning to fill with the issuing delegates Rain was pouring down and umbrellas were plentiful Harry Wharton accompanied by a group of men left the main entrance of the hall releasing himself with difficulty from the friendly crowd about the doors and crossed the street to his hotel Well I m glad you think I did decently he said as they mounted the hotel stairs What a beastly day and how stuffy that hall was Come in and have something to drink He threw open the door of his sitting room as he spoke The four men with him followed him in I must go back to the hall to see two or three men before everybody disperses said the one in front No refreshment for me thank you mister Wharton But I want to ask a question what arrangements have you made for the reporting of your speech The man who spoke was thin and dark with a modest kindly eye He wore a black frock coat and had the air of a minister Oh thank you Bennett it s all right The Post the Chronicle and the Northern Guardian will have full copies I sent them off before the meeting And my own paper of course As to the rest they may report it as they like I don t care They ll all have it said another man bluntly It s the best speech you ve ever made the best president s speech we ve had yet I say don t you think so The speaker a man called Casey turned to the two men behind him Both nodded Hallin s speech last year was first rate he continued but somehow Hallin damps you down at least he did me last year what you want just now is fight and my word mister Wharton let em have it And standing with his hands on his sides he glanced round from one to another His own face was flushed partly from the effects of a crowded hall and bad air but mostly with excitement All the men present indeed though it was less evident in Bennett and Wharton than in the rest had the bright nervous look which belongs to leaders keenly conscious of standing well with the led and of having just emerged successfully from an agitating ordeal As they stood together they went over the speech to which they had been listening and the scene which had followed it in a running stream of talk laughter and gossip Wharton took little part except to make a joke occasionally at his own expense but the pleasure on his smiling lip and in his roving contented eye was not to be mistaken The speech he had just delivered had been first thought out as he paced the moonlit library and corridor at Mellor After Marcella had left him and he was once more in his own room he had had the extraordinary self control to write it out and make two or three machine copies of it for the press Neither its range nor its logical order had suffered for that intervening experience The programme of labour for the next five years had never been better presented more boldly planned more eloquently justified Hallin s presidential speech of the year before as Casey said rang flat in the memory when compared with it Wharton knew that he had made a mark and knew also that his speech had given him the whip hand of some fellows who would otherwise have stood in his way Casey was the first man to cease talking about the speech He had already betrayed himself about it more than he meant He belonged to the New Unionism and affected a costume in character fustian trousers flannel shirt a full red tie and work man s coat all well calculated to set off a fine lion like head and broad shoulders He had begun life as a bricklayer s labourer and was now the secretary of a recently formed Union His influence had been considerable but was said to be already on the wane though it was thought likely that he would win a seat in the coming Parliament The other two men were Molloy secretary to the congress short smooth faced and wiry a man whose pleasant eye and manner were often misleading since he was in truth one of the hottest fighting men of a fighting movement and Wilkins a friend of Casey s ex iron worker Union official and Labour candidate for a Yorkshire division an uneducated passionate fellow speaking with a broad Yorkshire accent a bad man of affairs but honest and endowed with the influence which comes of sincerity together with a gift for speaking and superhuman powers of physical endurance Well I m glad it s over said Wharton throwing himself into a chair with a long breath and at the same time stretching out his hand to ring the bell Casey some whisky No Nor you Wilkins nor Molloy As for you Bennett I know it s no good asking you By George our grandfathers would have thought us a poor lot Well some coffee at any rate you must all of you have before you go back Waiter coffee By the way I have been seeing something of Hallin Bennett down in the country He took out his cigarette case as he spoke and offered it to the others All refused except Molloy Casey took his half smoked pipe out of his pocket and lit up He was not a teetotaler as the others were but he would have scorned to drink his whisky and water at the expense of a gentleman like Wharton or to smoke the gentleman s cigarettes His class pride was irritably strong Molloy who was by nature anybody s equal took the cigarette with an easy good manners which made Casey look at him askance mister Bennett drew his chair close to Wharton s The mention of Hallin had roused a look of anxiety in his quick dark eyes How is he mister Wharton The last letter I had from him he made light of his health But you know he only just avoided a breakdown in that strike business We only pulled him through by the skin of his teeth mister Raeburn and I Oh he s no constitution never had I suppose But he seemed much as usual He s staying with Raeburn you know and I ve been staying with the father of the young lady whom Raeburn s going to marry Ah I ve heard of that said Bennett with a look of interest Well mister Raeburn isn t on our side but for judgment and fair dealing there are very few men of his class and circumstances I would trust as I would him The lady should be happy Of course said Wharton drily However neither she nor Raeburn are very happy just at this moment A horrible affair happened down there last night One of Lord Maxwell s gamekeepers and a helper a lad of seventeen were killed last night in a fight with poachers I only just heard the outlines of it before I came away but I got a telegram just before going into congress asking me to defend the man charged with the murder A quick expression of repulsion and disgust crossed Bennett s face There have been a whole crop of such cases lately he said How shall we ever escape from the curse of this game system We shan t escape it said Wharton quietly knocking the end off his cigarette not in your lifetime or mine When we get more Radicals on the bench we shall lighten the sentences but that will only exasperate the sporting class into finding new ways of protecting themselves Oh the man will be hung that s quite clear to me But it will be a good case from the public point of view will work up well He ran his hand through his curls considering Will work up admirably he added in a lower tone of voice as though to himself his eyes keen and brilliant as ever in spite of the marks of sleeplessness and fatigue visible in the rest of the face though only visible there since he had allowed himself the repose of his cigarette and arm chair Are yo comin to dine at the Peterloo to night mister Wharton said Wilkins as Wharton handed him a cup of coffee but of coorse you are part of yower duties I suppose While Molloy and Casey were deep in animated discussion of the great meeting of the afternoon he had been sitting silent against the edge of the table a short bearded sombre figure ready at any moment to make a grievance to suspect a slight I m afraid I can t said Wharton bending forward and speaking in a tone of concern that was just what I was going to ask you all if you would make my excuses to night I have been explaining to Bennett I have an important piece of business in the country a labourer has been getting into trouble for shooting a keeper they have asked me to defend him The assizes come on in little more than a fortnight worse luck so that the time is short And he went on to explain that by taking an evening train back to Widrington he could get the following Saturday morning with the solicitor in charge of the case and be back in Birmingham thanks to the convenience of a new line lately opened in time for the second meeting of the congress which was fixed for the early afternoon He spoke with great cordiality and persuasiveness Among the men who surrounded him his youth good looks and easy breeding shone out conspicuous In the opinion of Wilkins indeed who followed his every word and gesture he was far too well dressed and too well educated A day would soon come when the labour movement would be able to show these young aristocrats the door Not yet however Well I thowt you wouldn t dine with us he said turning away with a blunt laugh Bennett s mild eye showed annoyance mister Wharton has explained himself very fully I think he said turning to the others We shall miss him at dinner but this matter seems to be one of life and death And we mustn t forget anyway that mister Wharton is fulfilling this engagement at great inconvenience to himself We none of us knew when we elected him last year that he would have to be fighting his election at the same time Next Saturday isn t it Bennett rose as he spoke and carefully buttoned his coat It was curious to contrast his position among his fellows one of marked ascendency and authority with his small insignificant physique He had a gentle deprecating eye and the heart of a poet He played the flute and possessed the gift of repeating verse especially Ebenezer Eliot s Corn Law Rhymes so as to stir a great audience to enthusiasm or tears The Wesleyan community of his native Cheshire village owned no more successful class leader and no humbler Christian At the same time he could hold a large business meeting sternly in check was the secretary of one of the largest and oldest Unions in the country had been in Parliament for years and was generally looked upon even by the men who hated his moderate policy as a power not to be ignored Next Saturday Yes said Wharton nodding in answer to his inquiry Well are you going to do it said Casey looking round at him Oh yes said Wharton cheerfully oh yes we shall do it We shall settle old Dodgson I think Are the Raeburns as strong as they were asked Molloy who knew Brookshire What landlord is Since eighty four the ground is mined for them all good and bad and they know it The mine takes a long time blowing up too long for my patience said Wilkins gruffly How the country can go on year after year paying its tribute to these plunderers passes my comprehension But you may attack them as you please You will never get any forrarder so long as Parliament and the Cabinet is made up of them and their hangers on Wharton looked at him brightly but silently making a little assenting inclination of the head He was not surprised that anything should pass Wilkins s comprehension and he was determined to give him no opening for holding forth Well we ll let you alone said Bennett You ll have very little time to get off in We ll make your excuses mister Wharton You may be sure everybody is so pleased with your speech we shall find them all in a good temper It was grand let me congratulate you again Good night I hope you ll get your poacher off The others followed suit and they all took leave in character Molloy with an eager business reference to the order of the day for Saturday Give me your address at Widrington I ll post you everything to night so that you may have it all under your eye Casey with the off hand patronage of the man who would not for the world have his benevolence mistaken for servility and Wilkins with as gruff a nod and as limp a shake of the hand as possible It might perhaps have been read in the manner of the last two that although this young man had just made a most remarkable impression and was clearly destined to go far they were determined not to yield themselves to him a moment before they must In truth both were already jealous of him whereas Molloy absorbed in the business of the congress cared for nothing except to know whether in the next two days debates Wharton would show himself as good a chairman as he was an orator and Bennett while saying no word that he did not mean was fully conscious of an inner judgment which pronounced five minutes of Edward Hallin s company to be worth more to him than anything which this brilliant young fellow could do or say Wharton saw them out then came back and threw himself again into his chair by the window The venetian blinds were not closed and he looked out on a wide and handsome street of tall red brick houses and shops crowded with people and carriages and lit with a lavishness of gas which overcame even the February dark and damp But he noticed nothing and even the sensation of his triumph was passing off He was once more in the Mellor drive Aldous Raeburn and Marcella stood in front of him the thrill of the moment beat once more in his pulse He buried his head in his hands and thought The news of the murder had reached him from mister Boyce The master of Mellor had heard the news from William the man servant at half past seven and had instantly knocked up his guest by way of sharing the excitement with which his own feeble frame was throbbing By Gad I never heard such an atrocious business said the invalid his thin hand shaking against his dressing gown That s what your Radical notions bring us to We shall have them plundering and burning the country houses next I don t think my Radical notions have much to do with it said Wharton composedly But there was a red spot in his cheeks which belied his manner So when he they saw Hurd cross the avenue he was on his way to this deed of blood The shot that he Wharton had heard had been the shot which slew Westall Probably Well what was the bearing of it Could she keep her own counsel or would they find themselves in the witness box The idea quickened his pulse amazingly Any clue Any arrests he asked of his host Why I told you said Boyce testily though as a matter of fact he had said nothing They have got that man Hurd The ruffian has been a marked man by the keepers and police they tell me for the last year or more And there s my daughter has been pampering him and his wife all the time and preaching to me about them She got Raeburn even to take him on at the Court I trust it will be a lesson to her Wharton drew a breath of relief So the man was in custody and there was other evidence Good There was no saying what a woman s conscience might be capable of even against her friends and herself When mister Boyce at last left him free to dress and make his preparations for the early train by which the night before after the ladies departure for the ball he had suddenly made up his mind to leave Mellor it was some time before Wharton could rouse himself to action The situation absorbed him Miss Boyce s friend was now in imminent danger of his neck and Miss Boyce s thoughts must be of necessity concentrated upon his plight and that of his family He foresaw the passion the saeva indignatio that she must ultimately throw the general situation being what it was into the struggle for Hurd s life Whatever the evidence might be he would be to her either victim or champion and Westall of course merely the Holofernes of the piece How would Raeburn take it Ah well the situation must develop It occurred to him however that he would catch an earlier train to Widrington than the one he had fixed on and have half an hour s talk with a solicitor who was a good friend of his before going on to Birmingham Accordingly he rang for William who came all staring and dishevelled fresh from the agitation of the servants hall gave orders for his luggage to be sent after him got as much fresh information as he could from the excited lad plunged into his bath and finally emerged fresh and vigorous in every nerve showing no trace whatever of the fact that two hours of broken sleep had been his sole portion for a night in which he had gone through emotions and sustained a travail of brain either of which would have left their mark on most men Then the meeting in the drive How plainly he saw them both Raeburn grave and pale Marcella in her dark serge skirt and cap with an eye all passion and a cheek white as her hand A tragic splendour enwrapped her a fierce heroic air She was the embodiment of the moment of the melancholy morning with its rain and leafless woods of the human anguish throbbing in the little village And I who had seen her last in her festal dress who had held her warm perfumed youth in my arms who had watched in her white breast the heaving of the heart that I I had troubled how did I find it possible to stand and face her But I did It rushed through me at once how I would make her forgive me how I would regain possession of her I had thought the play was closed it was suddenly plain to me that the second act was but just beginning She and Raeburn had already come to words I knew it directly I saw them This business will divide them more and more His conscience will come in and a Raeburn s conscience is the devil By now he hates me every word I speak to him still more every word to her galls him But he controlled himself when I made him tell me the story I had no reason to complain though every now and then I could see him wince under the knowledge I must needs show of the persons and places concerned a knowledge I could only have got from her And she stood by meanwhile like a statue Not a word not a look so far though she had been forced to touch my hand But my instinct saved me I roused her I played upon her I took the line that I was morally certain she had been taking in their tete a tete Why not a scuffle a general scrimmage in which it was matter of accident who fell The man surely was inoffensive and gentle incapable of deliberate murder And as to the evidence of hatred it told both ways He stiffened and was silent What a fine brow he has a look sometimes when he is moved of antique power and probity But she she trembled animation came back She would almost have spoken to me but I did well not to prolong it to hurry on Then he took the telegram out of his pocket which had been put into his hands as he reached the hotel his mouth quivering again with the exultation which he had felt when he had received it It recalled to his ranging memory all the details of his hurried interview with the little Widrington solicitor who had already scented a job in the matter of Hurd s defence This man needy shrewd and well equipped with local knowledge had done work for Wharton and the party and asked nothing better than to stand well with the future member for the division There is a lady Wharton had said the daughter of mister Boyce of Mellor who is already very much interested in this fellow and his family She takes this business greatly to heart I have seen her this morning but had no time to discuss the matter with her She will I have little doubt try to help the relations in the arrangements for the defence Go to her this morning tell her that the case has my sympathy that as she knows I am a barrister and if she wishes it I will defend Hurd I shall be hard put to it to get up the case with the election coming on but I will do it for the sake of the public interest involved You understand Her father is a Tory and she is just about to marry mister Raeburn Her position therefore is difficult Nevertheless she will feel strongly she does feel strongly about this case and about the whole game system and I feel moved to support her She will take her own line whatever happens See her see the wife too who is entirely under Miss Boyce s influence and wire to me at my hotel at Birmingham If they wish to make other arrangements well and good I shall have all the more time to give to the election Leaving this commission behind him he had started on his journey At the end of it a telegram had been handed to him on the stairs of his hotel Have seen the lady also missus Hurd You are urgently asked to undertake defence He spread it out before him now and pondered it The bit of flimsy paper contained for him the promise of all he most coveted influence emotion excitement She will have returns upon herself he thought smiling when I see her again She will be dignified resentful she will suspect everything I say or do still more she will suspect herself No matter The situation is in my hands Whether I succeed or fail she will be forced to work with me to consult with me she will owe me gratitude What made her consent she must have felt it in some sort a humiliation Is it that Raeburn has been driving her to strong measures that she wants woman like to win and thought me after all her best chance and put her pride in her pocket Or is it ah one should put that out of one s head It s like wine it unsteadies one And for a thing like this one must go into training Shall I write to her there is just time now before I start take the lofty tone the equal masculine tone which I have noticed she likes ask her pardon for an act of madness before we go together to the rescue of a life It might do it might go down But no I think not Let the situation develop itself Action and reaction the unexpected I commit myself to that She marry Aldous Raeburn in a month Well she may certainly she may But there is no need for me I think to take it greatly into account Curious twenty four hours ago I thought it all done with dead and done with So like Provvy as Bentham used to say when he heard of anything particularly unseemly in the way of natural catastrophe Now to dine and be off How little sleep can I do with in the next fortnight He rang ordered his cab and then went to the coffee room for some hasty food As he was passing one of the small tables with which the room was filled a man who was dining there with a friend recognised him and gave him a cold nod Wharton walked on to the further end of the room and while waiting for his meal buried himself in the local evening paper which already contained a report of his speech Did you see that man asked the stranger of his friend The small young fellow with the curly hair Small young fellow indeed He is the wiriest athlete I know extraordinary physical strength for his size and one of the cleverest rascals out as a politician I am a neighbour of his in the country His property joins mine I knew his father a little dried up old chap of the old school very elegant manners and very obstinate worried to death by his wife oh my goodness such a woman What s the name said the friend interrupting Wharton H S Wharton His mother was a daughter of Lord Westgate and her mother was an actress whom the old lord married in his dotage Lady Mildred Wharton was like Garrick only natural when she was acting which she did on every possible occasion A preposterous woman Old Wharton ought to have beaten her for her handwriting and murdered her for her gowns Her signature took a sheet of note paper and as for her dress I never could get out of her way Whatever part of the room I happened to be in I always found my feet tangled in her skirts Somehow I never could understand how she was able to find so much stuff of one pattern But it was only to make you notice her like all the rest Every bit of her was a pose and the maternal pose was the worst of all H S Wharton said the other Why that s the man who has been speaking here to day I ve just been reading the account of it in the Evening Star A big meeting called by a joint committee of the leading Birmingham trades to consider the Liberal election programme as it affects labour that s the man he s been at it hammer and tongs red hot all the usual devices for harrying the employer out of existence with a few trifles graduated income tax and land nationalisation thrown in Oh that s the man is it they say he had a great reception spoke brilliantly and is certainly going to get into Parliament next week The speaker who had the air of a shrewd and prosperous manufacturer put up his eyeglass to look at this young Robespierre His vis a vis a stout country gentleman who had been in the army and knocked about the world before coming into his estate shrugged his shoulders So I hear he daren t show his nose as a candidate in our part of the world though of course he does us all the harm he can I remember a good story of his mother she quarrelled with her husband and all her relations his and hers and then she took to speaking in public accompanied by her dear boy On one occasion she was speaking at a market town near us and telling the farmers that as far as she was concerned she would like to see the big properties cut up to morrow The sooner her father s and husband s estates were made into small holdings stocked with public capital the better After it was all over a friend of mine who was there was coming home in a sort of omnibus that ran between the town and a neighbouring village He found himself between two fat farmers and this was the conversation broad Lincolnshire of course Did tha hear Lady Mildred Wharton say them things Willum Aye a did What did tha think Willum What did tha think George Wal aa thowt Laady Mildred Wharton wor a graaet fule Willum if tha asks me I ll uphowd tha George I ll uphowd tha said the other and then they talked no more for the rest of the journey The friend laughed So it was from the dear mamma that the young man got his opinions Of course She dragged him into every absurdity she could from the time he was fifteen When the husband died she tried to get the servants to come in to meals but the butler struck So did Wharton himself who for a Socialist has always showed a very pretty turn for comfort I am bound to say he was cut up when she died It was the only time I ever felt like being civil to him in those months after she departed I suppose she was devoted to him which after all is something Good heavens said the other still lazily turning over the pages of the newspaper as they sat waiting for their second course here is another poaching murder in Brookshire the third I have noticed within a month On Lord Maxwell s property you know them I know the old man a little fine old fellow They ll make him President of the Council I suppose He can t have much work left in him but it is such a popular respectable name Ah I m sorry the sort of thing to distress him terribly I see the grandson is standing Oh yes will get in too A queer sort of man great ability and high character But you can t imagine him getting on in politics unless it s by sheer weight of wealth and family influence He ll find a scruple in every bush never stand the rough work of the House or get on with the men My goodness you have to pull with some queer customers nowadays By the way I hear he is making an unsatisfactory marriage a girl very handsome but with no manners and like nobody else the daughter too of an extremely shady father It s surprising you d have thought a man like Aldous Raeburn would have looked for the pick of things Perhaps it was she looked for the pick of things said the other with a blunt laugh Waiter another bottle of champagne CHAPTER XI Marcella was lying on the sofa in the Mellor drawing room The February evening had just been shut out but she had told William not to bring the lamps till they were rung for Even the fire light seemed more than she could bear She was utterly exhausted both in body and mind yet as she lay there with shut eyes and hands clasped under her cheek a start went through her at every sound in the house which showed that she was not resting but listening She had spent the morning in the Hurds cottage sitting by missus Hurd and nursing the little boy Minta Hurd always delicate and consumptive was now generally too ill from shock and misery to be anywhere but in her bed and Willie was growing steadily weaker though the child s spirit was such that he would insist on dressing on hearing and knowing everything about his father and on moving about the house as usual Yet every movement of his wasted bones cost him the effort of a hero and the dumb signs in him of longing for his father increased the general impression as of some patient creature driven by Nature to monstrous and disproportionate extremity The plight of this handful of human beings worked in Marcella like some fevering torture She was wholly out of gear physically and morally Another practically sleepless night peopled with images of horror had decreased her stock of sane self control already lessened by long conflict of feeling and the pressure of self contempt Now as she lay listening for Aldous Raeburn s ring and step she hardly knew whether to be angry with him for coming so late or miserable that he should come at all That there was a long score to settle between herself and him she knew well Shame for an experience which seemed to her maiden sense indelible both a weakness and a treachery lay like a dull weight on heart and conscience But she would not realise it she would not act upon it She shook the moral debate from her impatiently Aldous should have his due all in good time should have ample opportunity of deciding whether he would after all marry such a girl as she Meanwhile his attitude with regard to the murder exasperated her Yet in some strange way it relieved her to be angry and sore with him to have a grievance she could avow and on which she made it a merit to dwell His gentle yet firm difference of opinion with her on the subject struck her as something new in him It gave her a kind of fierce pleasure to fight it He seemed somehow to be providing her with excuses to be coming down to her level to be equalling wrong with wrong The door handle turned At last She sprang up But it was only William coming in with the evening post missus Boyce followed him She took a quiet look at her daughter and asked if her headache was better and then sat down near her to some needlework During these two days she had been unusually kind to Marcella She had none of the little feminine arts of consolation She was incapable of fussing and she never caressed But from the moment that Marcella had come home from the village that morning a pale hollow eyed wreck the mother had asserted her authority She would not hear of the girl s crossing the threshold again she had put her on the sofa and dosed her with sal volatile And Marcella was too exhausted to rebel She had only stipulated that a note should be sent to Aldous asking him to come on to Mellor with the news as soon as the verdict of the coroner s jury should be given The jury had been sitting all day and the verdict was expected in the evening Marcella turned over her letters till she came to one from a London firm which contained a number of cloth patterns As she touched it she threw it aside with a sudden gesture of impatience and sat upright Mamma I have something to say to you Yes my dear Mamma the wedding must be put off it must for some weeks I have been thinking about it while I have been lying here How can I you can see for yourself That miserable woman depends on me altogether How can I spend my time on clothing and dressmakers I feel as if I could think of nothing else nothing else in the world but her and her children She spoke with difficulty her voice high and strained The assizes may be held that very week who knows the very day we are married She stopped looking at her mother almost threateningly missus Boyce showed no sign of surprise She put her work down I had imagined you might say something of the kind she said after a pause I don t know that from your point of view it is unreasonable But of course you must understand that very few people will see it from your point of view Aldous Raeburn may you must know best But his people certainly won t and your father will think it Madness she was going to say but with her usual instinct for the moderate fastidious word she corrected it to foolish Marcella s tired eyes were all wilfulness and defiance I can t help it I couldn t do it I will tell Aldous at once It must be put off for a month And even that she added with a shudder will be bad enough missus Boyce could not help an unperceived shrug of the shoulders and a movement of pity towards the future husband Then she said drily You must always consider whether it is just to mister Raeburn to let a matter of this kind interfere so considerably with his wishes and his plans He must I suppose be in London for Parliament within six weeks Marcella did not answer She sat with her hands round her knees lost in perplexities The wedding as originally fixed was now three weeks and three days off After it she and Aldous were to have spent a short fortnight s honeymoon at a famous house in the north lent them for the occasion by a Duke who was a cousin of Aldous s on the mother s side and had more houses than he knew what to do with Then they were to go immediately up to London for the opening of Parliament The furnishing of the Mayfair house was being pressed on In her new born impatience with such things Marcella had hardly of late concerned herself with it at all and Miss Raeburn scandalised yet not unwilling had been doing the whole of it subject to conscientious worryings of the bride whenever she could be got hold of on the subject of papers and curtains As they sat silent the unspoken idea in the mother s mind was Eight weeks more will carry us past the execution missus Boyce had already possessed herself very clearly of the facts of the case and it was her perception that Marcella was throwing herself headlong into a hopeless struggle together with something else a confession perhaps of a touch of greatness in the girl s temper passionate and violent as it was that had led to this unwonted softness of manner this absence of sarcasm Very much the same thought only treated as a nameless horror not to be recognised or admitted was in Marcella s mind also joined however with another unsuspected even by missus Boyce s acuteness Very likely when I tell him he will not want to marry me at all and of course I shall tell him But not yet certainly not yet She had the instinctive sense that during the next few weeks she should want all her dignity with Aldous that she could not afford to put herself at a disadvantage with him To be troubled about her own sins at such a moment would be like the meanness of the lazy and canting Christian who whines about saving his soul while he ought to be rather occupied with feeding the bodies of his wife and children A ring at the front door Marcella rose leaning one hand on the end of the sofa a long slim figure in her black dress haggard and pathetic When Aldous entered her face was one question He went up to her and took her hand In the case of Westall the verdict is one of Wilful Murder against Hurd In that of poor Charlie Dynes the court is adjourned Enough evidence has been taken to justify burial But there is news to night that one of the Widrington gang has turned informer and the police say they will have their hands on them all within the next two or three days Marcella withdrew herself from him and fell back into the corner of the sofa Shading her eyes with her hand she tried to be very composed and business like Was Hurd himself examined Yes under the new Act He gave the account which he gave to you and to his wife But the Court Did not believe it No The evidence of motive was too strong It was clear from his own account that he was out for poaching purposes that he was leading the Oxford gang and that he had a gun while Westall was unarmed He admitted too that Westall called on him to give up the bag of pheasants he held and the gun He refused Then he says Westall came at him and he fired Dick Patton and one or two others gave evidence as to the language he has habitually used about Westall for months past Cowards curs cried Marcella clenching both her hands a kind of sob in her throat Aldous already white and careworn showed missus Boyce thought a ray of indignation for an instant Then he resumed steadily And Brown our steward gave evidence as to his employment since October The coroner summed up carefully and I think fairly and the verdict was given about half past six They took him back to prison Of course He comes before the magistrates on Thursday And you will be one The girl s tone was indescribable Aldous started missus Boyce reddened with anger and checking her instinct to intervene began to put away her working materials that she might leave them together While she was still busy Aldous said You forget no magistrate ever tries a case in which he is personally concerned I shall take no part in the trial My grandfather of course must prosecute But it will be a bench of landlords cried Marcella of men with whom a poacher is already condemned You are unjust to us I think said Aldous slowly after a pause during which missus Boyce left the room to some of us at any rate Besides as of course you know the case will be simply sent on for trial at the assizes By the way his tone changed I hear to night that Harry Wharton undertakes the defence Yes said Marcella defiantly Is there anything to say against it You wouldn t wish Hurd not to be defended I suppose Marcella Even her bitter mood was pierced by the tone She had never wounded him so deeply yet and for a moment he felt the situation intolerable the surging grievance and reproach with which his heart was really full all but found vent in an outburst which would have wholly swept away his ordinary measure and self control But then as he looked at her it struck his lover s sense painfully how pale and miserable she was He could not scold But it came home to him strongly that for her own sake and his it would be better there should be explanations After all things had been going untowardly for many weeks His nature moved slowly and with much self doubt but it was plain to him now that he must make a stand After his cry her first instinct was to apologise Then the words stuck in her throat To her as to him they seemed to be close on a trial of strength If she could not influence him in this matter so obvious as it seemed to her and so near to her heart what was to become of that lead of hers in their married life on which she had been reckoning from the beginning All that was worst in her and all that was best rose to the struggle But as he did not speak she looked up at last I was waiting he said in a low voice What for Waiting till you should tell me you did not mean what you said She saw that he was painfully moved she also saw that he was introducing something into their relation an element of proud self assertion which she had never felt in it before Her own vanity instantly rebelled I ought not to have said exactly what I did she said almost stifled by her own excitement and making great efforts not to play the mere wilful child that I admit But it has been clear to me from the beginning that that her words hurried she took up a book and restlessly lifted it and let it fall you have never looked at this thing justly You have looked at the crime as any one must who is a landowner you have never allowed for the provocation you have not let yourself feel pity He made an exclamation Do you know where I was before I went into the inquest No she said defiantly determined not to be impressed feeling a childish irritation at the interruption I was with missus Westall Harden and I went in to see her She is a hard silent woman She is clearly not popular in the village and no one comes in to her Her he hesitated her baby is expected before long She is in such a state of shock and excitement that Clarke thinks it quite possible she may go out of her mind I saw her sitting by the fire quite silent not crying but with a wild eye that means mischief We have sent in a nurse to help missus Jellison watch her She seems to care nothing about her boy Everything that that woman most desired in life has been struck from her at a blow Why That a man who was in no stress of poverty who had friends and employment should indulge himself in acts which he knew to be against the law and had promised you and his wife to forego and should at the same time satisfy a wild beast s hatred against the man who was simply defending his master s property Have you no pity for missus Westall or her child He spoke as calmly as he could making his appeal to reason and moral sense but in reality every word was charged with electric feeling I am sorry for her cried Marcella passionately But after all how can one feel for the oppressor or those connected with him as one does for the victim He shook his head protesting against the word but she rushed on You do know for I told you yesterday how under the shelter of this hateful game system Westall made Kurd s life a burden to him when he was a young man how he had begun to bully him again this past year We had the same sort of dispute the other day about that murder in Ireland You were shocked that I would not condemn the Moonlighters who had shot their landlord from behind a hedge as you did You said the man had tried to do his duty and that the murder was brutal and unprovoked But I thought of the system of the memories in the minds of the murderers There were excuses he suffered for his father I am not going to judge that as I judge other murders So when a Czar of Russia is blown up do you expect one to think only of his wife and children No I will think of the tyranny and the revolt I will pray yes pray that I might have courage to do as they did You may think me wild and mad I dare say I am made so I shall always feel so She flung out her words at him every limb quivering under the emotion of them His cool penetrating eye this manner she had never yet known in him exasperated her Where was the tyranny in this case he asked her quietly I agree with you that there are murders and murders But I thought your point was that here was neither murder nor attack but only an act of self defence That is Hurd s plea She hesitated and stumbled I know she said I know I believe it But even if the attack had been on Hurd s part I should still find excuses because of the system and because of Westall s hatefulness He shook his head again Because a man is harsh and masterful and uses stinging language is he to be shot down like a dog There was a silence Marcella was lashing herself up by thoughts of the deformed man in his cell looking forward after the wretched unsatisfied life which was all society had allowed him to the violent death by which society would get rid of him of the wife yearning her heart away of the boy whom other human beings under the name of law were about to separate from his father for ever At last she broke out thickly and indistinctly The terrible thing is that I cannot count upon you that now I cannot make you feel as I do feel with me And by and by when I shall want your help desperately when your help might be everything I suppose it will be no good to ask it He started and bending forward he possessed himself of both her hands her hot trembling hands and kissed them with a passionate tenderness What help will you ask of me that I cannot give That would be hard to bear Still held by him she answered his question by another Give me your idea of what will happen Tell me how you think it will end I shall only distress you dear he said sadly No tell me You think him guilty You believe he will be convicted Unless some wholly fresh evidence is forthcoming he said reluctantly I can see no other issue Very well then he will be sentenced to death But after sentence I know that man from Widrington that solicitor told me if if strong influence is brought to bear if anybody whose word counts if Lord Maxwell and you were to join the movement to save him There is sure to be a movement the Radicals will take it up Will you do it will you promise me now for my sake He was silent She looked at him all her heart burning in her eyes conscious of her woman s power too and pressing it If that man is hung she said pleadingly it will leave a mark on my life nothing will ever smooth out I shall feel myself somehow responsible I shall say to myself if I had not been thinking about my own selfish affairs about getting married about the straw plaiting I might have seen what was going on I might have saved these people who have been my friends my real friends from this horror She drew her hands away and fell back on the sofa pressing her handkerchief to her eyes If you had seen her this morning she said in a strangled voice She was saying Oh miss if they do find him guilty they can t hang him not my poor deformed Jim that never had a chance of being like the others Oh we ll beg so hard I know there s many people will speak for him He was mad miss when he did it He d never been himself not since last winter when we all sat and starved and he was driven out of his senses by thinking of me and the children You ll get mister Raeburn to speak won t you miss and Lord Maxwell It was their game I know it was their game But they ll forgive him They re such great people and so rich and we we ve always had such a struggle Oh the bad times we ve had and no one know They ll try and get him off miss Oh I ll go and beg of them She stopped unable to trust her voice any further He stooped over her and kissed her brow There was a certain solemnity in the moment for both of them The pity of human fate overshadowed them At last he said firmly yet with great feeling I will not prejudge anything that I promise you I will keep my mind open to the last But I should like to say it would not be any easier to me to throw myself into an agitation for reprieve because this man was tempted to crime by my property on my land I should think it right to look at it altogether from the public point of view The satisfaction of my own private compunctions of my own private feelings is not what I ought to regard My own share in the circumstances in the conditions which made such an act possible does indeed concern me deeply You cannot imagine but that the moral problem of it has possessed me ever since this dreadful thing happened It troubled me much before Now it has become an oppression a torture I have never seen my grandfather so moved so distressed in all my remembrance of him Yet he is a man of the old school with the old standards As for me if ever I come to the estate I will change the whole system I will run no risks of such human wreck and ruin as this His voice faltered But he resumed speaking steadily again I ought to warn you that such considerations as these will not affect my judgment of this particular case In the first place I have no quarrel with capital punishment as such I do not believe we could rightly give it up Your attitude properly means that wherever we can legitimately feel pity for a murderer we should let him escape his penalty I on the other hand believe that if the murderer saw things as they truly are he would himself claim his own death as his best chance his only chance in this mysterious universe of self recovery Then it comes to this was the act murder The English law of murder is not perfect but it appears to me to be substantially just and guided by it You talk as if there were no such things as mercy and pity in the world she interrupted wildly as if law were not made and administered by men of just the same stuff and fabric as the lawbreaker He looked troubled Ah but law is something beyond laws or those who administer them he said in a lower tone and the law the obligation sense of our own race and time however imperfect it may be is sacred not because it has been imposed upon us from without but because it has grown up to what it is out of our own best life ours yet not ours the best proof we have when we look back at it in the large when we feel its work in ourselves of some diviner power than our own will our best clue to what that power may be He spoke at first looking away wrestling out his thought as it were by himself then turning back to her his eyes emphasised the appeal implied though not expressed in what he said intense appeal to her for sympathy forbearance mutual respect through all acuteness of difference His look both promised and implored He bad spoken to her but very rarely or indirectly as yet of his own religious or philosophical beliefs She was in a stage when such things interested her but little and reticence in personal matters was so much the law of his life that even to her expansion was difficult So that inevitably she was arrested for the moment as any quick perception must be by the things that unveil character Then an upheaval of indignant feeling swept the impression away All that he said might be ideally profoundly true but the red blood of the common life was lacking in every word of it He ought to be incapable of saying it now Her passionate question was how could he argue how could he hold and mark the ethical balance when a woman was suffering when children were to be left fatherless Besides the ethical balance itself does it not alter according to the hands that hold it poacher or landlord rich or poor But she was too exhausted to carry on the contest in words Both felt it would have to be renewed But she said to herself secretly that mister Wharton when he got to work would alter the whole aspect of affairs And she knew well that her vantage ground as towards Aldous was strong Then at last he was free to turn his whole attention for a little to her and her physical state which made him miserable He had never imagined that any one vigorous and healthy as she was could look so worn out in so short a time She let him talk to her lament entreat advise and at last she took advantage of his anxiety and her admissions to come to the point to plead that the marriage should be put off She used the same arguments that she had done to her mother How can I bear to be thinking of these things she pointed a shaking finger at the dress patterns lying scattered on the table with this agony this death under my eyes It was a great blow to him and the practical inconveniences involved were great But the fibre of him of which she had just felt the toughness was delicate and sensitive as her own and after a very short recoil he met her with great chivalry and sweetness agreeing that everything should be put off for six weeks till Easter in fact She would have been very grateful to him but that something some secret thought checked the words she tried to say I must go home then he said rising and trying to smile I shall have to make things straight with Aunt Neta and set a great many arrangements in train Now you will try to think of something else Let me leave you with a book that I can imagine you will read She let herself be tended and thought for At the last just as he was going he said Have you seen mister Wharton at all since this happened His manner was just as usual She felt that her eye was guilty but the darkness of the firelit room shielded her I have not seen him since we met him in the drive I saw the solicitor who is working up the case for him yesterday He came over to see missus Hurd and me I had not thought of asking him but we agreed that if he would undertake it it would be the best chance It is probably the best chance said Aldous thoughtfully I believe Wharton has not done much at the Bar since he was called but that no doubt is because he has had so much on his hands in the way of journalism and politics His ability is enough for anything and he will throw himself into this I do not think Hurd could do better She did not answer She felt that he was magnanimous but felt it coldly without emotion He came and stooped over her Good night good night tired child dear heart When I saw you in that cottage this morning I thought of the words Give and it shall be given unto you All that my life can do to pour good measure pressed down running over into yours I vowed you then When the door closed upon him Marcella stretched in the darkness shed the bitterest tears that had ever yet been hers tears which transformed her youth which baptised her as it were into the fulness of our tragic life She was still weeping when she heard the door softly opened She sprang up and dried her eyes but the little figure that glided in was not one to shrink from Mary Harden came and sat down beside her I knew you would be miserable Let me come and cry too I have been my round have seen them all and I came to bring you news How has she taken the verdict asked Marcella struggling with her sobs and succeeding at last in composing herself She was prepared for it Charlie told her when he saw her after you left this afternoon that she must expect it There was a pause I shall soon hear I suppose said Marcella in a hardening voice her hands round her knees what mister Wharton is doing for the defence He will appear before the magistrates I suppose Yes but Charlie thinks the defence will be mainly reserved Only a little more than a fortnight to the assizes The time is so short But now this man has turned informer they say the case is quite straightforward With all the other evidence the police have there will be no difficulty in trying them all Marcella Yes Had there been light enough to show it Mary s face would have revealed her timidity Marcella Charlie asked me to give you a message He begs you not to not to make missus Hurd hope too much He himself believes there is no hope and it is not kind Are you and he like all the rest cried Marcella her passion breaking out again only eager to have blood for blood Mary waited an instant It has almost broken Charlie s heart she said at last but he thinks it was murder and that Hurd will pay the penalty nay more she spoke with a kind of religious awe in her gentle voice that he ought to be glad to pay it He believes it to be God s will and I have heard him say that he would even have executions in public again under stricter regulations of course that we may not escape as we always do if we can from all sight and thought of God s justice and God s punishments Marcella shuddered and rose She almost threw Mary s hand away from her Tell your brother from me Mary she said that his God is to me just a constable in the service of the English game laws If He is such a one I at least will fling my Everlasting No at him while I live And she swept from the room leaving Mary aghast Meanwhile there was consternation and wrath at Maxwell Court where Aldous on his return from Mellor had first of all given his great aunt the news of the coroner s verdict and had then gone on to break to her the putting off of the marriage His championship of Marcella in the matter and his disavowal of all grievance were so quiet and decided that Miss Raeburn had been only able to allow herself a very modified strain of comment and remonstrance so long as he was still there to listen But she was all the more outspoken when he was gone and Lady Winterbourne was sitting with her Lady Winterbourne who was at home alone while her husband was with a married daughter on the Riviera had come over to dine tete a tete with her friend finding it impossible to remain solitary while so much was happening Well my dear said Miss Raeburn shortly as her guest entered the room I may as well tell you at once that Aldous s marriage is put off Put off exclaimed Lady Winterbourne bewildered Why it was only Thursday that I was discussing it all with Marcella and she told me everything was settled Thursday I dare say said Miss Raeburn stitching away with fiery energy but since then a poacher has murdered one of our gamekeepers which makes all the difference What do you mean Agneta What I say my dear The poacher was Marcella s friend and she cannot now distract her mind from him sufficiently to marry Aldous though every plan he has in the world will be upset by her proceedings And as for his election you may depend upon it she will never ask or know whether he gets in next Monday or no That goes without saying She is meanwhile absorbed with the poacher s defence Mr Wharton of course conducting it This is your modern young woman my dear typical I should think Miss Raeburn turned her buttonhole in fine style and at lightning speed to show the coolness of her mind then with a rattling of all her lockets looked up and waited for Lady Winterbourne s reflections She has often talked to me of these people the Hurds said Lady Winterbourne slowly She has always made special friends with them Don t you remember she told us about them that day she first came back to lunch Of course I remember That day she lectured Maxwell at first sight on his duties She began well As for these people said Miss Raeburn more slowly one is of course sorry for the wife and children though I am a good deal sorrier for missus Westall and poor poor missus Dynes The whole affair has so upset Maxwell and me we have hardly been able to eat or sleep since I thought it made Maxwell look dreadfully old this morning and with all that he has got before him too I shall insist on sending for Clarke to morrow morning if he does not have a better night And now this postponement will be one more trouble all the engagements to alter and the invitations Really that girl And Miss Raeburn broke off short feeling simply that the words which were allowed to a well bred person were wholly inadequate to her state of mind But if she feels it as you or I might feel such a thing about some one we knew or cared for Agneta How can she feel it like that cried Miss Raeburn exasperated How can she know any one of of that class well enough It is not seemly I tell you Adelaide and I don t believe it is sincere It s just done to make herself conspicuous and show her power over Aldous For other reasons too if the truth were known Miss Raeburn turned over the shirt she was making for some charitable society and drew out some tacking threads with a loud noise which relieved her Lady Winterbourne s old and delicate cheek had flushed I m sure it s sincere she said with emphasis Do you mean to say Agneta that one can t sympathise in such an awful thing with people of another class as one would with one s own flesh and blood Miss Raeburn winced She felt for a moment the pressure of a democratic world a hated formidable world through her friend s question Then she stood to her guns I dare say you ll think it sounds bad she said stoutly but in my young days it would have been thought a piece of posing of sentimentalism something indecorous and unfitting if a girl had put herself in such a position Marcella ought to be absorbed in her marriage that is the natural thing How missus Boyce can allow her to mix herself with such things as this murder to live in that cottage as I hear she has been doing passes my comprehension You mean said Lady Winterbourne dreamily that if one had been very fond of one s maid and she died one wouldn t put on mourning for her Marcella would I dare say said Miss Raeburn snappishly She is capable of anything far fetched and theatrical The door opened and Hallin came in He had been suffering of late and much confined to the house But the news of the murder had made a deep and painful impression upon him and he had been eagerly acquainting himself with the facts Miss Raeburn whose kindness ran with unceasing flow along the channels she allowed it was greatly attached to him in spite of his views and she now threw herself upon him for sympathy in the matter of the wedding In any grievance that concerned Aldous she counted upon him and her shrewd eyes had plainly perceived that he had made no great friendship with Marcella I am very sorry for Aldous he said at once but I understand her perfectly So does Aldous Miss Raeburn was angrily silent But when Lord Maxwell who had been talking with Aldous came in he proved to her final discomfiture to be very much of the same opinion My dear he said wearily as he dropped into his chair his old face grey and pinched this thing is too terrible the number of widows and orphans that night s work will make before the end breaks my heart to think of It will be a relief not to have to consider festivities while these men are actually before the courts What I am anxious about is that Marcella should not make herself ill with excitement The man she is interested in will be hung must be hung and with her somewhat volatile impulsive nature He spoke with old fashioned discretion and measure Then quickly he pulled himself up and with some trivial question or other offered his arm to Lady Winterbourne for Aldous had just come in and dinner was ready CHAPTER XII Nearly three weeks passed short flashing weeks crowded with agitations inward or outward for all the persons of this story After the inquiry before the magistrates conducted as she passionately thought with the most marked animus on the part of the bench and police towards the prisoners had resulted in the committal for trial of Hurd and his five companions Marcella wrote Aldous Raeburn a letter which hurt him sorely Don t come over to see me for a little while it ran My mind is all given over to feelings which must seem to you which I know do seem to you unreasonable and unjust But they are my life and when they are criticised or even treated coldly I cannot bear it When you are not there to argue with I can believe most sincerely that you have a right to see this matter as you do and that it is monstrous of me to expect you to yield to me entirely in a thing that concerns your sense of public duty But don t come now not before the trial I will appeal to you if I think you can help me I know you will if you can mister Wharton keeps me informed of everything I enclose his last two letters which will show you the line he means to take up with regard to some of the evidence Aldous s reply cost him a prodigal amount of pain and difficulty I will do anything in the world to make these days less of a burden to you You can hardly imagine that it is not grievous to me to think of any trouble of yours as being made worse by my being with you But still I understand One thing only I ask that you should not imagine the difference between us greater than it is The two letters you enclose have given me much to ponder If only the course of the trial enables me with an honest heart to throw myself into your crusade of mercy with what joy shall I come and ask you to lead me and to forgive my own slower sense and pity I should like you to know that Hallin is very much inclined to agree with you to think that the whole affair was a scrimmage and that Hurd at least ought to be reprieved He would have come to talk it over with you himself but that Clarke forbids him anything that interests or excites him for the present He has been very ill and suffering for the last fortnight and as you know when these attacks come on we try to keep everything from him that could pain or agitate him But I see that this whole affair is very much on his mind in spite of my efforts Oh my darling I am writing late at night with your letter open before me and your picture close to my hand So many things rise in my mind to say to you There will come a time there must when I may pour them all out Meanwhile amid all jars and frets remember this that I have loved you better each day since first we met I will not come to Mellor then for a little while My election little heart as I have for it will fill up the week The nomination day is fixed for Thursday and the polling for Monday Marcella read the letter with a confusion of feeling so great as to be in itself monstrous and demoralising Was she never to be simple to see her way clearly again As for him as he rode about the lanes and beechwoods in the days that followed alone often with that nature for which all such temperaments as Aldous Raeburn s have so secret and so observant an affection he was perpetually occupied with this difficulty which had arisen between Marcella and himself turning it over and over in the quiet of the morning before the turmoil of the day began He had followed the whole case before the magistrates with the most scrupulous care And since then he had twice run across the Widrington solicitor for the defence who was now instructing Wharton This man although a strong Radical and employed generally by his own side saw no objection at all to letting Lord Maxwell s heir and representative understand how in his opinion the case was going Aldous Raeburn was a person whom everybody respected confidences were safe with him and he was himself deeply interested in the affair The Raeburns being the Raeburns with all that that implied for smaller people in Brookshire little mister Burridge was aware of no reason whatever why Westall s employers should not know that although mister Wharton was working up the defence with an energy and ability which set Burridge marvelling it was still his Burridge s opinion that everything that could be advanced would be wholly unavailing with the jury that the evidence as it came into final shape looked worse for Hurd rather than better and that the only hope for the man lay in the after movement for reprieve which can always be got up in a game preserving case And is as a rule political and anti landlord thought Aldous on one of these mornings as he rode along the edge of the down He foresaw exactly what would happen As he envisaged the immediate future he saw one figure as the centre of it not Marcella but Wharton Wharton was defending Wharton would organise the petition Wharton would apply for his own support and his grandfather s through Marcella To Wharton would belong not only the popular kudos of the matter but much more and above all Marcella s gratitude Aldous pulled up his horse an instant recognising that spot in the road that downward stretching glade among the beeches where he had asked Marcella to be his wife The pale February sunlight was spreading from his left hand through the bare grey trunks and over the distant shoulders of the woods far into the white and purple of the chalk plain Sounds of labour came from the distant fields sounds of winter birds from the branches round him The place the time raised in him all the intensest powers of consciousness He saw himself as the man standing midway in everything speculation politics sympathies as the perennially ineffective and as it seemed to his morbid mood the perennially defeated type beside the Whartons of this world Wharton He knew him had read him long ago read him afresh of late Raeburn s lip showed the contempt the bitterness which the philosopher could not repress showed also the humiliation of the lover Here was he banished from Marcella here was Wharton in possession of her mind and sympathies busily forging a link It shall be broken said Raeburn to himself with a sudden fierce concentration of will So much I will claim and enforce But not now nothing now but patience delicacy prudence He gathered himself together with a long breath and went his way For the rest the clash of motives and affections he felt and foresaw in this matter of the Disley murders became day by day more harassing The moral debate was strenuous enough The murders had roused all the humane and ethical instincts which were in fact the man to such a point that they pursued him constantly in the pauses of his crowded days like avenging Erinnyes Hallin s remark that game preserving creates crime left him no peace Intellectually he argued it and on the whole rejected it morally and in feeling it scourged him He had suffered all his mature life under a too painful and scrupulous sense that he more than other men was called to be his brother s keeper It was natural that during these exhausting days the fierce death on Westall s rugged face the piteous agony in Dynes s young eyes and limbs should haunt him should make his landlord s place and responsibility often mere ashes and bitterness But as Marcella had been obliged to perceive he drew the sharpest line between the bearings of this ghastly business on his own private life and action and its relation to public order That the gamekeepers destroyed were his servants or practically his servants made no difference to him whatever in his estimate of the crime itself If the circumstances had been such that he could honestly have held Hurd not to be a murderer no employer s interest no landlord s desire for vengeance would have stood in his way On the other hand believing as he emphatically did that Hurd s slaying of Westall had been of a kind more deliberate and less capable of excuse than most murders he would have held it a piece of moral cowardice to allow his own qualms and compunctions as to the rights and wrongs of game preserving to interfere with a duty to justice and society Ay and something infinitely dearer to him than his own qualms and compunctions Hallin who watched the whole debate in his friend day by day was conscious that he had never seen Aldous more himself in spite of trouble of mind more in character so to speak than at this moment Spiritual dignity of mind and temper blended with a painful personal humility and interfused with all determining all elements of judgment subtleties prejudices modes of looking at things for which he was hardly responsible so deeply ingrained were they by inheritance and custom More than this did not the ultimate explanation of the whole attitude of the man lie in the slow but irresistible revolt of a strong individuality against the passion which had for a time suppressed it The truth of certain moral relations may be for a time obscured and distorted none the less reality wins the day So Hallin read it Meanwhile during days when both for Aldous and Wharton the claims of a bustling shouting public which must be canvassed shaken hands with and spoken to and the constant alternations of business meetings committee rooms and the rest made it impossible after all for either man to spend more than the odds and ends of thought upon anything outside the clatter of politics Marcella had been living a life of intense and monotonous feeling shut up almost within the walls of a tiny cottage hanging over sick beds and thrilling to each pulse of anguish as it beat in the miserable beings she tended The marriage of the season with all its accompanying festivities and jubilations had not been put off for seven weeks till after Easter without arousing a storm of critical astonishment both in village and county And when the reason was known that it was because Miss Boyce had taken the Disley murder so desperately to heart that until the whole affair was over and the men either executed or reprieved she could spare no thought to wedding clothes or cates there was curiously little sympathy with Marcella Most of her own class thought it a piece of posing if they did not say so as frankly as Miss Raeburn something done for self advertisement and to advance anti social opinions while the Mellor cottagers with the instinctive English recoil from any touch of sentiment not so to speak in the bargain gossiped and joked about it freely She can t be very fond o im not of Muster Raeburn she can t said old Patton delivering himself as he sat leaning on his stick at his open door while his wife and another woman or two chattered inside Not what I d call lover y She don t want to run in harness she don t no sooner than she need She s a peert filly is Miss Boyce I ve been a waitin an a waitin said his wife with her gentle sigh to hear summat o that new straw plaitin she talk about But nary a word They do say as it s give up althegither No she s took up wi nursin Minta Hurd wonderful took up said another woman They do say as Ann Mullins can t abear her When she s there nobody can open their mouth When that kind o thing happens in the fambly it s bad enoof without havin a lady trailin about you all day long so that you have to be mindin yersel an thinkin about givin her a cheer an the like One day in the dusk more than a fortnight after the inquest Marcella coming from the Hurds cottage overtook missus Jellison who was going home after spending the afternoon with her daughter Hitherto Marcella had held aloof from Isabella Westall and her relations mainly to do her justice from fear lest she might somehow hurt or offend them She had been to see Charlie Dynes s mother but she had only brought herself to send a message of sympathy through Mary Harden to the keeper s widow missus Jellison looked at her askance with her old wild eyes as Marcella came up with her Oh she s puddlin along she said in answer to Marcella s inquiry using a word very familiar in the village She ll not do herself a mischief while there s Nurse Ellen an me to watch her like a pair o cats She s dreadful upset is Isabella shouldn t ha thought it of her That fust day a cloud darkened the curious dreamy face no I m not a goin to think about that fust day I m not tain t a ha porth o good she added resolutely but she was all right when they d let her get im ome and wash an settle im an put im comfortable like in his coffin He

brings these awful hings about Wal I don t see that said missus Jellison pugnaciously he wor paid to do t an he had the law on his side Ow s she she said lowering her voice and jerking her thumb in the direction of the Hurds cottage She s very ill replied Marcella with a contraction of the brow doctor Clarke says she ought to stay in bed but of course she won t They re a goin to try im Thursday

she were to try and forgive that poor wretch She might remember that her husband gave him provocation and that anyway if his life is spared his punishment and their misery will be heavy enough Oh lor no said missus Jellison composedly She don t want to be forgivin of im mister Harden ee come talkin to er but she isn t one o that sort isn t Isabella I m sartin sure she ll be better in erself when

an says ee ll look after Johnnie And what with my bit airnins we ll do yer know miss we ll do The old woman looked up with a nod her green eyes sparkling with the queer inhuman light that belonged to them Marcella could not bring herself to say good night to her and was hurrying on without a word when missus Jellison stopped her An ow about that straw plaitin miss she said slyly I have had to put it on one side for a bit said Marcella coldly hating the woman s society I have had my hands full and Lady Winterbourne has been away but we shall of course take it up again later She walked away quickly and missus Jellison hobbled after her grinning to herself every now and then as she caught the straight tall figure against the red evening sky I ll go in ter town termorrer she thought an

when yer wants im yer kin find im Marcella hurried home she was expecting a letter from Wharton the third within a week She had not set eyes on him since they had met that first morning in the drive and it was plain to her that he was as unwilling as she was that there should be any meeting between them Since the moment of his taking up the case in spite of the pressure of innumerable engagements he had found time to send her almost daily sheets covered with his small even writing in which every detail and prospect of the legal situation so far as it concerned James Hurd were noted and criticised with a shrewdness and fulness which never wavered and never lost for a moment the professional note Dear Miss Boyce the letters began leading up to a Yours faithfully which Marcella read as carefully as the rest Often as she turned them over she asked herself whether that scene in the library had not been a mere delusion of the brain whether the man whose wild words and act had burnt themselves into her life could possibly be writing her these letters in this key without a reference without an allusion Every day as she opened them she looked them through quietly with a shaking pulse every day she found herself proudly able to hand them on to her mother with the satisfaction of one who has nothing to conceal whatever the rest of the world may suspect He was certainly doing his best to replace their friendship on that level of high comradeship in ideas and causes which as she told herself it had once occupied His own wanton aggression and her weakness had toppled it down thence and brought it to ruin She could never speak to him never know him again till it was re established Still his letters galled her He assumed she supposed that such a thing could happen and nothing more be said about it How little he knew her or what she had in her mind Now as she walked along wrapped in her plaid cape her thought was one long tumultuous succession of painful or passionate images interrupted none the less at times by those curious self observing pauses of which she had always been capable She had been sitting for hours beside missus Hurd with little Willie upon her knees The mother always anaemic and consumptive was by now prostrate the prey of a long drawn agony peopled by visions of Jim alone and in prison Jim on the scaffold with the white cap over his eyes Jim in the prison coffin which would rouse her shrieking from dreams which were the rending asunder of soul and body Minta Hurd s love for the unhappy being who had brought her to this pass had been infinitely maternal There had been a boundless pity in it and the secret pride of a soul which humble and modest towards all the rest of the world yet knew itself to be the breath and sustenance the indispensable aid of one other soul in the universe and gloried accordingly To be cut off now from all ministration all comforting to have to lie there like a log imagining the moment when the neighbours should come in and say It is all over they have broken his neck and buried him it was a doom beyond all even that her timid pessimist heart had ever dreamed She had already seen him twice in prison and she knew that she would see him again She was to go on Monday Miss Boyce said before the trial began and after if they brought him in guilty they would let her say good bye She was always thirsting to see him But when she went the prison surroundings paralysed her Both she and Hurd felt themselves caught in the wheels of a great relentless machine of which the workings filled them with a voiceless terror He talked to her spasmodically of the most incongruous things breaking out sometimes with a glittering eye into a string of instances bearing on Westall s bullying and tyrannous ways He told her to return the books Miss Boyce had lent him but when asked if he would like to see Marcella he shrank and said no mister Wharton was doin capital for him but she wasn t to count on his getting off And he didn t know that he wanted to neither Once she took Willie to see him the child nearly died of the journey and the father though any one can see miss he s just sick for im would not hear of his coming again Sometimes he would hardly kiss her at parting he sat on his chair with his great head drooped forward over his red hands lost in a kind of animal lethargy Westall s name always roused him Hate still survived But it made her life faint within her to talk of the murdered man wherein she showed her lack of the usual peasant s realism and curiosity in the presence of facts of blood and violence When she was told it was time for her to go and the heavy door was locked behind her the poor creature terrified at the warder and the bare prison silences would hurry away as though the heavy hand of this awful Justice were laid upon her too torn by the thought of him she left behind and by the remembrance that he had only kissed her once and yet impelled by mere physical instinct towards the relief of Ann Mullins s rough face waiting for her of the outer air and the free heaven As for Willie he was fast dwindling Another week or two the doctor said no more He lay on Marcella s knee on a pillow wasted to an infant s weight panting and staring with those strange blue eyes but always patient always struggling to say his painful thank you when she fed him with some of the fruit constantly sent her from Maxwell Court Everything that was said about his father he took in and understood but he did not seem to fret His mother was almost divided from him by this passivity of the dying nor could she give him or his state much attention Her gentle sensitive but not profound nature was strained already beyond bearing by more gnawing griefs After her long sit in missus Hurd s kitchen Marcella found the air of the February evening tonic and delightful Unconsciously impressions stole upon her the lengthening day the celandines in the hedges the swelling lilac buds in the cottage gardens They spoke to her youth and out of mere physical congruity it could not but respond Still her face kept the angered look with which she had parted from missus Jellison More than that the last few weeks had visibly changed it had graved upon it the signs of living It was more beautiful than ever in its significant black and white but it was older a woman spoke from it Marcella had gone down into reality and had found there the rebellion and the storm for which such souls as hers are made Rebellion most of all She had been living with the poor in their stifling rooms amid their perpetual struggle for a little food and clothes and bodily ease she had seen this struggle so hard in itself combined with agonies of soul and spirit which made the physical destitution seem to the spectator something brutally gratuitous a piece of careless and tyrannous cruelty on the part of Nature or God She would hardly let herself think of Aldous though she must think of him by and by He and his fared sumptuously every hour As for her it was as though in her woman s arms on her woman s breast she carried Lazarus all day stooping to him with a hungering pity And Aldous stood aloof Aldous would not help her or not with any help worth having in consoling this misery binding up these sores Her heart cried shame on him She had a crime against him to confess but she felt herself his superior none the less If he cast her off why then surely they would be quits quits for good and all As she reached the front door of Mellor she saw a little two wheeled cart standing outside it and William holding the pony Visitors were nowadays more common at Mellor than they had been and her instinct was to escape But as she was turning to a side door William touched his cap to her mister Wharton s waiting to see you miss She stopped sharply Where is missus Boyce William In the drawing room miss She walked in calmly Wharton was standing on the rug talking missus Boyce was listening to what he had to say with the light repellent air Marcella knew so well When she came in Wharton stepped forward ceremoniously to shake hands then began to speak at once with the manner of one who is on a business errand and has no time to waste I thought it best Miss Boyce as I had unexpectedly a couple of spare hours this evening to come and let you know how things were going You understand that the case comes on at the assizes next Thursday Marcella assented She had seated herself on the old sofa beside the fire her ungloved hands on her knee Something in her aspect made Wharton s eyes waver an instant as he looked down upon her but it was the only sign I should like to warn you he said gravely that I entertain no hope whatever of getting James Hurd off I shall do my best but the verdict will certainly be murder and the judge I think is sure to take a severe view We may get a recommendation to mercy though I believe it to be extremely unlikely But if so the influence of the judge according to what I hear will probably be against us The prosecution have got together extremely strong evidence as to Hurd s long connection with the gang in spite of the Raeburns kindness as to his repeated threats that he would do for Westall if he and his friends were interrupted and so on His own story is wholly uncorroborated and Dynes s deposition so far as it goes is all against it He went on to elaborate these points with great clearness of exposition and at some length then he paused This being so he resumed the question is what can be done There must be a petition Amongst my own party I shall be of course able to do something but we must have men of all sides Without some at least of the leading Conservatives we shall fare badly In one word do you imagine that you can induce mister Raeburn and Lord Maxwell to sign missus Boyce watched him keenly Marcella sat in frozen paleness I will try she said at last with deliberation Then he took up his gloves there may be a chance for us If you cannot succeed no one else can But if Lord Maxwell and mister Raeburn can be secured others will easily follow Their names especially under all the circumstances will carry a peculiar weight I may say everything in the first instance the weight the first effect of the petition depends on them Well then I leave it in your hands No time should be lost after the sentence As to the grounds of our plea I shall of course lay them down in court to the best of my ability I shall be there she interrupted He started So did missus Boyce but characteristically she made no comment Well then he resumed after a pause I need say no more for the present How is the wife She replied and a few other formal sentences of inquiry or comment passed between them And your election said missus Boyce still studying him with hostile eyes as he got up to take leave To morrow He threw up his hands with a little gesture of impatience That at least will be one thread spun off and out of the way whatever happens I must get back to Widrington as fast as my pony can carry me Good bye Miss Boyce Marcella went slowly upstairs The scene which had just passed was unreal impossible yet every limb was quivering Then the sound of the front door shutting sent a shock through her whole nature The first sensation was one of horrible emptiness forlornness The next her mind threw itself with fresh vehemence upon the question Can I by any means get my way with Aldous CHAPTER XIII And may the Lord have mercy on your soul The deep pitched words fell slowly on Marcella s ears as she sat leaning forward in the gallery of the Widrington Assize Court Women were sobbing beside and behind her Minta Hurd to her left lay in a half swoon against her sister in law her face buried in Ann s black shawl For an instant after Hurd s death sentence had been spoken Marcella s nerves ceased to throb the long exhaustion of feeling stopped The harsh light and shade of the ill lit room the gas lamps in front of the judge blanching the ranged faces of the jury the long table of reporters below some writing but most looking intently towards the dock the figure of Wharton opposite in his barrister s gown and wig that face of his so small nervous delicate the frowning eyebrows a dark bar under the white of the wig his look alert and hostile fixed upon the judge the heads and attitudes of the condemned men especially the form of a fair haired youth the principal murderer of Charlie Dynes who stood a little in front of the line next to Hurd and overshadowing his dwarf s stature these things Marcella saw indeed for years after she could have described them point by point but for some seconds or minutes her eyes stared at them without conscious reaction of the mind on the immediate spectacle In place of it the whole day all these hours that she had been sitting there brushed before her in a synthesis of thought replacing the stream of impressions and images The crushing accumulation of hostile evidence witness after witness coming forward to add to the damning weight of it the awful weakness of the defence Wharton s irritation under it the sharpness the useless acrid ability of his cross examinations yet contrasting with the legal failure the personal success the mixture of grace with energy the technical accomplishment of the manner as one wrestling before his equals nothing left here of the garrulous vigour and brutality of the labourers meeting the masterly use of all that could avail the few quiet words addressed at the end to the pity of the jury and by implication to the larger ethical sense of the community all this she thought of with great intellectual clearness while the judge s sonorous voice rolled along sentencing each prisoner in turn Horror and pity were alike weary the brain asserted itself The court was packed Aldous Raeburn sat on Marcella s right hand and during the day the attention of everybody in the dingy building had been largely divided between the scene below and that strange group in the gallery where the man who had just been elected Conservative member for East Brookshire who was Lord Maxwell s heir and Westall s employer sat beside his betrothed in charge of a party which comprised not only Marcella Boyce but the wife sister and little girl of Westall s murderer On one occasion some blunt answer of a witness had provoked a laugh coming no one knew whence The judge turned to the gallery and looked up sternly I cannot conceive why men and women women especially should come crowding in to hear such a case as this but if I hear another laugh I shall clear the court Marcella whose whole conscious nature was by now one network of sensitive nerve saw Aldous flush and shrink as the words were spoken Then looking across the court she caught the eye of an old friend of the Raeburns a county magistrate At the judge s remark he had turned involuntarily to where she and Aldous sat then as he met Miss Boyce s face instantly looked away again She perfectly passionately understood that Brookshire was very sorry for Aldous Raeburn that day The death sentences three in number were over The judge was a very ordinary man but even for the ordinary man such an act carries with it a great tradition of what is befitting which imposes itself on voice and gesture When he ceased the deep breath of natural emotion could be felt and heard throughout the crowded court loud wails of sobbing women broke from the gallery Silence cried an official voice and the judge resumed amid stifled sounds that stabbed Marcella s sense once more nakedly alive to everything around it The sentences to penal servitude came to an end also Then a ghastly pause The line of prisoners directed by the warders turned right about face towards a door in the back wall of the court As the men filed out the tall fair youth one of those condemned to death stopped an instant and waved his hand to his sobbing sweetheart in the gallery Hurd also turned irresolutely Look exclaimed Ann Mullins propping up the fainting woman beside her he s goin Marcella bent forward She rather than the wife caught the last look on his large dwarf s face so white and dazed the eyes blinking under the gas Aldous touched her softly on the arm Yes she said quickly yes we must get her out Ann can you lift her Aldous went to one side of the helpless woman Ann Mullins held her on the other Marcella followed pressing the little girl close against her long black cloak The gallery made way for them every one looked and whispered till they had passed Below at the foot of the stairs they found themselves in a passage crowded with people lawyers witnesses officials mixed with the populace Again a road was opened for Aldous and his charges This way mister Raeburn said a policeman with alacrity Stand back please Is your carriage there sir Let Ann Mullins take her put them into the cab I want to speak to mister Wharton said Marcella in Aldous s ear Get me a cab at once he said to the policeman and tell my carriage to wait Miss Boyce Marcella turned hastily and saw Wharton beside her Aldous also saw him and the two men interchanged a few words There is a private room close by said Wharton I am to take you there and mister Raeburn will join us at once He led her along a corridor and opened a door to the left They entered a small dingy room looking through a begrimed window on a courtyard The gas was lit and the table was strewn with papers Never never more beautiful flashed through Wharton s mind with that knit strenuous brow that tragic scorn for a base world that royal gait Aloud he said I have done my best privately among the people I can get at and I thought before I go up to town to night you know Parliament meets on Monday I would show you what I had been able to do and ask you to take charge of a copy of the petition He pointed to a long envelope lying on the table I have drafted it myself I think it puts all the points we can possibly urge but as to the names He took out a folded sheet of paper from his breast pocket It won t do he said looking down at it and shaking his head As I said to you it is so far political merely There is a very strong Liberal and Radical feeling getting up about the case But that won t carry us far This petition with these names is a demonstration against game preserving and keepers tyranny What we want is the company operation of a neighbourhood especially of its leading citizens However I explained all this to you there is no need to discuss it Will you look at the list Still holding it he ran his finger over it commenting here and there She stood beside him the sleeve of his gown brushed her black cloak and under his perfect composure there beat a wild exultation in his power without any apology any forgiveness to hold her there alone with him listening her proud head stooped to his her eye following his with this effort of anxious attention She made a few hurried remarks on the names but her knowledge of the county was naturally not very serviceable He folded up the paper and put it back I think we understand he said You will do what you can in the only quarter he spoke slowly that can really aid and you will communicate with me at the House of Commons I shall do what I can of course when the moment comes in Parliament and meanwhile I shall start the matter in the Press our best hope The Radical papers are already taking it up There was a sound of steps in the passage outside A policeman opened the door and Aldous Raeburn entered His quick look ran over the two figures standing beside the table I had some difficulty in finding a cab he explained and we had to get some brandy but she came round and we got her off I sent one of our men with her The carriage is here He spoke to Marcella with some formality He was very pale but there was both authority and tension in his bearing I have been consulting with Miss Boyce said Wharton with equal distance of manner as to the petition we are sending up to the Home Office Aldous made no reply One word Miss Boyce Wharton quietly turned to her May I ask you to read the petition carefully before you attempt to do anything with it It lays stress on the only doubt that can reasonably be felt after the evidence and after the judge s summing up That particular doubt I hold to be entirely untouched by the trial but it requires careful stating the issues may easily be confused Will you come said Aldous to Marcella What she chose to think the forced patience of his tone exasperated her I will do everything I can she said in a low distinct voice to Wharton Good bye She held out her hand To both the moment was one of infinite meaning to her in her high spiritual excitement a sacrament of pardon and gratitude expressed once for all by this touch in Aldous Raeburn s presence The two men nodded to each other Wharton was already busy putting his papers together We shall meet next week I suppose in the House said Wharton casually Good night Will you take me to the Court said Marcella to Aldous directly the door of the carriage was shut upon them and amid a gaping crowd that almost filled the little market place of Widrington the horses moved off I told mamma that if I did not come home I should be with you and that I should ask you to send me back from the Court to night She still held the packet Wharton had given her in her hand As though for air she had thrown back the black gauze veil she had worn all through the trial and as they passed through the lights of the town Aldous could see in her face the signs the plain startling signs of the effect of these weeks upon her Pale exhausted yet showing in every movement the nervous excitement which was driving her on his heart sank as he looked at her foreseeing what was to come As soon as the main street had been left behind he put his head out of the window and gave the coachman who had been told to go to Mellor the new order Will you mind if I don t talk said Marcella when he was again beside her I think I am tired out but I might rest now a little When we get to the Court will you ask Miss Raeburn to let me have some food in her sitting room Then at nine o clock or so may I come down and see Lord Maxwell and you together What she said and the manner in which she said it could only add to his uneasiness but he assented put a cushion behind her wrapped the rugs round her and then sat silent train after train of close and anxious thought passing through his mind as they rolled along the dark roads When they arrived at Maxwell Court the sound of the carriage brought Lord Maxwell and Miss Raeburn at once into the hall Aldous went forward in front of Marcella I have brought Marcella he said hastily to his aunt Will you take her upstairs to your sitting room and let her have some food and rest She is not fit for the exertion of dinner but she wishes to speak to my grandfather afterwards Lord Maxwell had already hurried to meet the black veiled figure standing proudly in the dim light of the outer hall My dear my dear he said drawing her arm within his and patting her hand in fatherly fashion How worn out you look Yes certainly Agneta take her up and let her rest And you wish to speak to me afterwards Of course my dear of course at any time Miss Raeburn controlling herself absolutely partly because of Aldous s manner partly because of the servants took her guest upstairs straightway put her on the sofa in a cheerful sitting room with a bright fire and then shrewdly guessing that she herself could not possibly be a congenial companion to the girl at such a moment whatever might have happened or might be going to happen she looked at her watch said that she must go down to dinner and promptly left her to the charge of a kind elderly maid who was to do and get for her whatever she would Marcella made herself swallow some food and wine Then she said that she wished to be alone and rest for an hour and would come downstairs at nine o clock The maid shocked by her pallor was loth to leave her but Marcella insisted When she was left alone she drew herself up to the fire and tried hard to get warm as she had tried to eat When in this way a portion of physical ease and strength had come back to her she took out the petition from its envelope and read it carefully As she did so her lip relaxed her eye recovered something of its brightness All the points that had occurred to her confusedly amateurishly throughout the day were here thrown into luminous and admirable form She had listened to them indeed as urged by Wharton in his concluding speech to the jury but it had not alas seemed so marvellous to her then as it did now that after such a plea the judge should have summed up as he did When she had finished it and had sat thinking awhile over the declining fire an idea struck her She took a piece of paper from Miss Raeburn s desk and wrote on it Will you read this and Lord Maxwell before I come down I forgot that you had not seen it M A ring at the bell brought the maid Will you please get this taken to mister Raeburn And then don t disturb me again for half an hour And for that time she lay in Miss Raeburn s favourite chair outwardly at rest Inwardly she was ranging all her arguments marshalling all her forces When the chiming clock in the great hall below struck nine she got up and put the lamp for a moment on the mantelpiece which held a mirror She had already bathed her face and smoothed her hair But she looked at herself again with attention drew down the thick front waves of hair a little lower on the white brow as she liked to have them and once more straightened the collar and cuffs which were the only relief to her plain black dress The house as she stepped out into it seemed very still Perfumed breaths of flowers and pot pourri ascended from the hall The pictures along the walls as she passed were those same Caroline and early Georgian beauties that had so flashingly suggested her own future rule in this domain on the day when Aldous proposed to her She felt suddenly very shrinking and lonely as she went downstairs The ticking of a large clock somewhere the short screaming note of Miss Raeburn s parrot in one of the ground floor rooms these sounds and the beating of her own heart seemed to have the vast house to themselves No that was a door opening Aldous coming to fetch her She drew a childish breath of comfort He sprang up the stairs two or three steps at a time as he saw her coming Are you rested were they good to you Oh my precious one how pale you are still Will you come and see my grandfather now He is quite ready She let him lead her in Lord Maxwell was standing by his writing table leaning over the petition which was open before him one hand upon it At sight of her he lifted his white head His fine aquiline face was grave and disturbed But nothing could have been kinder or more courtly than his manner as he came towards her Sit down in that chair Aldous make her comfortable Poor child how tired she looks I hear you wished to speak to me on this most unhappy most miserable business Marcella who was sitting erect on the edge of the chair into which Aldous had put her lifted her eyes with a sudden confidence She had always liked Lord Maxwell Yes she said struggling to keep down eagerness and emotion Yes I came to bring you this petition which is to be sent up to the Home Secretary on behalf of Jim Hurd and and to beg of you and Aldous to sign it if in any way you can I know it will be difficult but I thought I might I might be able to suggest something to you to convince you as I have known these people so well and it is very important to have your signatures How crude it sounded how mechanical She felt that she had not yet command of herself The strange place the stately room the consciousness of Aldous behind her Aldous who should have been on her side and was not all combined to intimidate her Lord Maxwell s concern was evident In the first place he was painfully unexpectedly struck by the change in the speaker Why what had Aldous been about So thin so frail and willowy in her black dress monstrous My dear he said walking up to her and laying a fatherly hand on her shoulder my dear I wish I could make you understand how gladly I would do this or anything else for you if I honourably could I would do it for your sake and for your grandfather s sake But this is a matter of conscience of public duty both for Aldous and myself You will not surely wish even that we should be governed in our relations to it by any private feeling or motive No but I have had no opportunity of speaking to you about it and I take such a different view from Aldous He knows everybody must know that there is another side another possible view from that which the judge took You weren t in court to day were you at all No But I read all the evidence before the magistrates with great care and I have just talked over the crucial points with Aldous who followed everything to day as you know and seems to have taken special note of mister Wharton s speeches Aldous her voice broke irrepressibly into another note I thought he would have let me speak to you first to night Lord Maxwell looking quickly at his grandson was very sorry for him Aldous bent over her chair You remember he said you sent down the petition I thought that meant that we were to read and discuss it I am very sorry She tried to command herself pressing her hand to her brow But already she felt the irrevocable and anger and despair were rising The whole point lies in this she said looking up Can we believe Hurd s own story There is no evidence to corroborate it I grant that the judge did not believe it and there is the evidence of hatred But is it not possible and conceivable all the same He says that he did not go out with any thought whatever of killing Westall but that when Westall came upon him with his stick up threatening and abusing him as he had done often before in a fit of wild rage he shot at him Surely surely that is conceivable There is there must be a doubt or if it is murder murder done in that way is quite quite different from other kinds and degrees of murder Now she possessed herself The gift of flowing persuasive speech which was naturally hers which the agitations the debates of these weeks had been maturing came to her call She leant forward and took up the petition One by one she went through its pleas adding to them here and there from her own knowledge of Hurd and his peasant s life presenting it all clearly with great intellectual force but in an atmosphere of emotion of high pity charged throughout with the tears of things To her gradually unconsciously the whole matter so sordid commonplace brutal in Lord Maxwell s eyes had become a tragic poem a thing of fear and pity to which her whole being vibrated And as she conceived it so she reproduced it Wharton s points were there indeed but so were Hurd s poverty Hurd s deformity Hurd as the boyish victim of a tyrant s insults the miserable wife the branded children emphasised all of them by the occasional quiver quickly steadied again of the girl s voice Lord Maxwell sat by his writing table his head resting on his hand one knee crossed over the other Aldous still hung over her chair Neither interrupted her Once the eyes of the two men met over her head a distressed significant look Aldous heard all she said but what absorbed him mainly was the wild desire to kiss the dark hair so close below him alternating with the miserable certainty that for him at that moment to touch to soothe her was to be repulsed When her voice broke when she had said all she could think of she remained looking imploringly at Lord Maxwell He was silent a little then he stooped forward and took her hand You have spoken he said with great feeling most nobly most well like a good woman with a true compassionate heart But all these things you have said are not new to me my dear child Aldous warned me of this petition he has pressed upon me still more I am sure upon himself all that he conceived to be your view of the case the view of those who are now moving in the matter But with the best will in the world I cannot and I believe that he cannot though he must speak for himself I cannot take that view In my belief Hurd s act was murder and deserves the penalty of murder I have paid some attention to these things I was a practising barrister in my youth and later I was for two years Home Secretary I will explain to you my grounds very shortly And bending forward he gave the reasons for his judgment of the case as carefully and as lucidly as though he were stating them to a fellow expert and not to an agitated girl of twenty one Both in words and manner there was an implied tribute not only to Marcella but perhaps to that altered position of the woman in our moving world which affects so many things and persons in unexpected ways Marcella listened restlessly She had drawn her hand away and was twisting her handkerchief between her fingers The flush that had sprung up while she was talking had died away She grew whiter and whiter When Lord Maxwell ceased she said quickly and as he thought unreasonably So you will not sign No he replied firmly I cannot sign Holding the conviction about the matter I do I should be giving my name to statements I do not believe and in order to give myself the pleasure of pleasing you and of indulging the pity that every man must feel for every murderer s wife and children I should be not only committing a public wrong but I should be doing what I could to lessen the safety and security of one whole class of my servants men who give me honourable service and two of whom have been so cruelly so wantonly hurried before their Maker His voice gave the first sign of his own deep and painful feeling on the matter Marcella shivered Then she said slowly Hurd will be executed Lord Maxwell had a movement of impatience Let me tell you he said that that does not follow at all There is some importance in signatures or rather in the local movement that the signatures imply It enables a case to be reopened which in any event this case is sure to be But any Home Secretary who could decide a murder case on any other grounds whatever than those of law and his own conscience would not deserve his place a day an hour Believe me you mistake the whole situation He spoke slowly with the sharp emphasis natural to his age and authority Marcella did not believe him Every nerve was beginning to throb anew with that passionate recoil against tyranny and prejudice which was in itself an agony And you say the same she said turning to Aldous I cannot sign that petition he said sadly Won t you try and believe what it costs me to refuse It was a heavy blow to her Amply as she had been prepared for it there had always been at the bottom of her mind a persuasion that in the end she would get her way She had been used to feel barriers go down before that ultimate power of personality of which she was abundantly conscious Yet it had not availed her here not even with the man who loved her Lord Maxwell looked at the two the man s face of suffering the girl s struggling breath There there Aldous he said rising I will leave you a minute Do make Marcella rest get her for all our sakes to forget this a little Bring her in presently to us for some coffee Above all persuade her that we love her and admire her with all our hearts but that in a matter of this kind she must leave us to do as before God what we think right He stood before her an instant gazing down upon her with dignity nay a certain severity Then he turned away and left the room Marcella sprang up Will you order the carriage she said in a strangled voice I will go upstairs Marcella cried Aldous can you not be just to me if it is impossible for you to be generous Just she repeated with a tone and gesture of repulsion pushing him back from her You can talk of justice He tried to speak stammered and failed That strange paralysis of the will forces which dogs the man of reflection at the moment when he must either take his world by storm or lose it was upon him now He had never loved her more passionately but as he stood there looking at her something broke within him the first prescience of the inevitable dawned You she said again walking stormily to and fro and catching at her breath You in this house with this life to talk of justice the justice that comes of slaying a man like Hurd And I must go back to that cottage to that woman and tell her there is no hope none Because you must follow your conscience you who have everything Oh I would not have your conscience I wish you a heart rather Don t come to me please Oh I must think how it can be Things cannot go on so I should kill myself and make you miserable But now I must go to her to the poor to those whom I love whom I carry in my heart She broke off sobbing He saw her in her wild excitement look round the splendid room as though she would wither it to ruin with one fiery accusing glance You are very scornful of wealth he said catching her wrists but one thing you have no right to scorn the man who has given you his inmost heart and now only asks you to believe in this that he is not the cruel hypocrite you are determined to make him His face quivered in every feature She was checked a moment checked by the moral compulsion of his tone and manner as well as by his words But again she tore herself away Please go and order the carriage she said I cannot bear any more I must go home and rest Some day I will ask your pardon oh for this and and she was almost choked again other things But now I must go away There is some one who will help me I must not forget that The reckless words the inflection turned Aldous to stone Unconsciously he drew himself proudly erect their eyes met Then he went up to the bell and rang it The brougham at once for Miss Boyce Will you have a maid to go with you he asked motioning the servant to stay till Miss Boyce had given her answer No thank you I must go and put on my things Will you explain to Miss Raeburn The footman opened the door for her She went CHAPTER XIV But this is unbearable said Aldous Do you mean to say that she is at home and that she will not see me missus Boyce s self possession was shaken for once by the flushed humiliation of the man before her I am afraid it is so she said hurriedly I remonstrated with Marcella but I could do nothing I think if you are wise you will not for the present attempt to see her Aldous sat down with his hat in his hand staring at the floor After a few moments silence he looked up again And she gave you no message for me No said missus Boyce reluctantly Only that she could not bear to see anybody from the Court even you while this matter was still undecided Aldous s eye travelled round the Mellor drawing room It was arrested by a chair beside him On it lay an envelope addressed to Miss Boyce of which the handwriting seemed to him familiar A needle with some black silk hanging from it had been thrust into the stuffed arm of the chair the cushion at the back still bore the imprint of the sitter She had been there not three minutes ago and had fled before him The door into missus Boyce s sitting room was still ajar He looked again at the envelope on the chair and recognised the writing Walking across to where missus Boyce sat he took a seat beside her Will you tell me he said steadily I think you will admit I have a right to know is Marcella in constant correspondence now with Henry Wharton missus Boyce s start was not perceptible I believe so she quickly replied So far as I can judge he writes to her almost every other day Does she show you his letters Very often They are entirely concerned with his daily interviews and efforts on Hurd s behalf Would you not say he asked after another pause raising his clear grey eyes to her that since his arrival here in December Marcella s whole views and thoughts have been largely perhaps vitally influenced by this man missus Boyce had long expected questions of this kind had indeed often marvelled and cavilled that Aldous had not asked them weeks before Now that they were put to her she was first of all anxious to treat them with common sense and as much plain truth as might be fair to both parties The perpetual emotion in which Marcella lived tired and oppressed the mother For herself she asked to see things in a dry light Yet she knew well that the moment was critical Her feeling was more mixed than it had been On the whole it was indignantly on Aldous s side with qualifications and impatiences however She took up her embroidery again before she answered him In her opinion the needle is to the woman what the cigarette is to the diplomatist Yes certainly she said at last He has done a great deal to form her opinions He has made her both read and think on all those subjects she has so long been fond of talking about She saw Aldous wince but she had her reasons for being plain with him Has there been nothing else than that in it said Aldous in an odd voice missus Boyce tried no evasions She looked at him straight her slight energetic head with its pale gold hair lit up by the March sun behind her I do not know she said calmly that is the real truth I think there is nothing else But let me tell you what more I think Aldous laid his hand on hers for an instant In his pity and liking for her he had once or twice allowed himself this quasi filial freedom If you would he entreated Leave Marcella quite alone for the present She is not herself not normal in any way Nor will she be till this dreadful thing is over But when it is over and she has had time to recover a little then her thin voice expressed all the emphasis it could then assert yourself Ask her that question you have asked me and get your answer He understood Her advice to him and the tone of it implied that she had not always thought highly of his powers of self defence in the past But there was a proud and sensitive instinct in him which both told him that he could not have done differently and forbade him to explain You have come from London to day said missus Boyce changing the subject All intimate and personal conversation was distasteful to her and she admitted few responsibilities Her daughter hardly counted among them Yes London is hard at work cabinet making he said trying to smile I must get back to night I don t know how you could be spared said missus Boyce He paused then he broke out When a man is in the doubt and trouble I am he must be spared Indeed since the night of the trial I feel as though I had been of very little use to any human being He spoke simply but every word touched her What an inconceivable entanglement the whole thing was Yet she was no longer merely contemptuous of it Look she said lifting a bit of black stuff from the ground beside the chair which held the envelope she is already making the mourning for the children I can see she despairs He made a sound of horror Can you do nothing he cried reproachfully To think of her dwelling upon this nothing but this day and night and I banished and powerless He buried his head in his hands No I can do nothing said missus Boyce deliberately Then after a pause You do not imagine there is any chance of success for her He looked up and shook his head The Radical papers are full of it as you know Wharton is managing it with great ability and has got some good supporters in the House But I happened to see the judge the day before yesterday and I certainly gathered from him that the Home Office was likely to stand firm There may be some delay The new ministry will not kiss hands till Saturday But no doubt it will be the first business of the new Home Secretary By the way I had rather Marcella did not hear of my seeing Judge Cartwright he added hastily almost imploringly I could not bear that she should suppose missus Boyce thought to herself indignantly that she never could have imagined such a man in such a plight I must go he said rising Will you tell her from me he added slowly that I could never have believed she would be so unkind as to let me come down from London to see her and send me away empty without a word Leave it to my discretion said missus Boyce smiling and looking up Oh by the way she told me to thank you mister Wharton in his letter this morning mentioned that you had given him two introductions which were important to him She specially wished you to be thanked for it His exclamation had a note of impatient contempt that missus Boyce was genuinely glad to hear In her opinion he was much too apt to forget that the world yields itself only to the violent He walked away from the house without once looking back Marcella from her window watched him go How could she see him she asked herself passionately both then and on many other occasions during these rushing ghastly days His turn would come and it should be amply given him But now the very thought of that half hour in Lord Maxwell s library threw her into wild tears The time for entreaty for argument was gone by so far as he was concerned He might have been her champion and would not She threw herself recklessly madly into the encouragement and support of the man who had taken up the task which in her eyes should have been her lover s It had become to her a fight with society with the law with Aldous in which her whole nature was absorbed In the course of the fight she had realised Aldous s strength and it was a bitter offence to her How little she could do after all She gathered together all the newspapers that were debating the case and feverishly read every line she wrote to Wharton commenting on what she read and on his letters she attended the meetings of the Reprieve Committee which had been started at Widrington and she passed hours of every day with Minta Hurd and her children She would hardly speak to Mary Harden and the rector because they had not signed the petition and at home her relations with her father were much strained mister Boyce was awakening to a good deal of alarm as to how things might end He might not like the Raeburns but that anything should come in the way of his daughter s match was notwithstanding the very last thing in the world as he soon discovered that he really desired During six months he had taken it for granted so had the county He of all men could not afford to be made ridiculous apart from the solid the extraordinary advantages of the matter He thought Marcella a foolish unreasonable girl and was not the less in a panic because his wife let him understand that he had had a good deal to do with it So that between him and his daughter there were now constant sparrings sparrings which degraded Marcella in her own eyes and contributed not a little to make her keep away from home The one place where she breathed freely where the soul had full course was in Minta Hurd s kitchen Side by side with that piteous plaintive misery her own fierceness dwindled She would sit with little Willie on her knees in the dusk of the spring evenings looking into the fire and crying silently She never suspected that her presence was often a burden and constraint not only to the sulky sister in law but to the wife herself While Miss Boyce was there the village kept away and missus Hurd was sometimes athirst without knowing it for homelier speech and simpler consolations than any Marcella could give her The last week arrived Wharton s letters grew more uncertain and despondent the Radical press fought on with added heat as the cause became more desperate On Monday the wife went to see the condemned man who told her not to be so silly as to imagine there was any hope Tuesday night Wharton asked his last question in Parliament Friday was the day fixed for the execution The question in Parliament came on late The Home Secretary s answer though not final in form was final in substance Wharton went out immediately and wrote to Marcella She will not sleep if I telegraph to night he thought with that instinct for detail especially for physical detail which had in it something of the woman But knowing that his letter could not reach her by the early post with the stroke of eight next morning he sent out his telegram that she might not learn the news first from the papers Marcella had wandered out before breakfast feeling the house an oppression and knowing that one way or another the last news might reach her any hour She had just passed through the little wood behind and alongside of the house and was in a field beyond when she heard some one running behind her William handed her the telegram his own red face full of understanding Marcella took it commanded herself till the boy was out of sight and hearing again then sank down on the grass to read it All over The Home Secretary s official refusal to interfere with sentence sent to Widrington to day Accept my sorrow and sympathy She crushed it in her hand raising her head mechanically Before her lay that same shallow cup of ploughed land stretching from her father s big wood to the downs on the edge of which Hurd had plied his ferrets in the winter nights But to day the spring worked in it and breathed upon it The young corn was already green in the furrows the hazel catkins quivered in the hedge above her larks were in the air daisies in the grass and the march of sunny clouds could be seen in the flying shadows they flung on the pale greens and sheeny purples of the wide treeless basin Human helplessness human agony set against the careless joy of nature there is no new way of feeling these things But not to have felt them and with the mad impotent passion and outcry which filled Marcella s heart at this moment is never to have risen to the full stature of our kind Marcella it is my strong wish my command that you do not go out to the village to night I must go papa It was Thursday night the night before the Friday morning fixed for Hurd s execution Dinner at Mellor was just over mister Boyce who was standing in front of the fire unconsciously making the most of his own inadequate height and size looked angrily at his stately daughter She had not appeared at dinner and she was now dressed in the long black cloak and black hat she had worn so constantly in the last few weeks mister Boyce detested the garb You are making yourself ridiculous Marcella Pity for these wretched people is all very well but you have no business to carry it to such a point that you and we become the talk the laughing stock of the county And I should like to see you too pay some attention to Aldous Raeburn s feelings and wishes The admonition in her father s mouth would almost have made her laugh if she could have laughed at anything But instead she only repeated I must go I have explained to mamma Evelyn why do you permit it cried mister Boyce turning aggressively to his wife Marcella explained to me as she truly said replied missus Boyce looking up calmly It is not her habit to ask permission of any one Mamma exclaimed the girl in her deep voice you would not wish to stop me No said missus Boyce after a pause no You have gone so far I understand your wish to do this Richard she got up and went to him don t excite yourself about it shall I read to you or play a game with you He looked at her trembling with anger But her quiet eye warned him that he had had threatenings of pain that afternoon His anger sank into fear He became once more irritable and abject Let her gang her gait he said throwing himself into a chair But I tell you I shall not put up with this kind of thing much longer Marcella I shall not ask you papa she said steadily as she moved towards the door missus Boyce paused where she stood and looked after her daughter struck by her words mister Boyce simply took them as referring to the marriage which would emancipate her before long from any control of his and fumed without finding a reply The maid servant who by missus Boyce s orders was to accompany Marcella to the village was already at the front door She carried a basket containing invalid food for little Willie and a lighted lantern It was a dark night and raining fast Marcella was fastening up her tweed skirt in the hall when she saw missus Boyce hurry along the gallery above and immediately afterwards her mother came across the hall to her You had better take the shawl Marcella it is cold and raw If you are going to sit up most of the night you will want it She put a wrap of her own across Marcella s arm Your father is quite right she went on You have had one horrible experience to day already Don t mamma exclaimed Marcella interrupting her Then suddenly she threw her arms round her mother Kiss me mamma please kiss me missus Boyce kissed her gravely and let herself even linger a moment in the girl s strong hold You are extraordinarily wilful she said And it is so strange to me that you think you do any good Are you sure even that she wants to have you Marcella s lip quivered She could not speak apparently Waving her hand to her mother she joined the maid waiting for her and the two disappeared into the blackness But does it do any good missus Boyce repeated to herself as she went back to the drawing room Sympathy who was ever yet fed warmed comforted by sympathy Marcella robs that woman of the only thing that the human being should want at such a moment solitude Why should we force on the poor what to us would be an outrage Meanwhile Marcella battled through the wind and rain thankful that the warm spring burst was over and that the skies no longer mocked this horror which was beneath them At the entrance to the village she stopped and took the basket from the little maid Now Ruth you can go home Run quick it is so dark Ruth Yes miss The young country girl trembled Miss Boyce s tragic passion in this matter had to some extent infected the whole household in which she lived Ruth when you say your prayers to night pray God to comfort the poor and to punish the cruel Yes miss said the girl timidly and ready to cry The lantern she held flashed its light on Miss Boyce s white face and tall form Till her mistress turned away she did not dare to move that dark eye so wide full and living roused in her a kind of terror On the steps of the cottage Marcella paused She heard voices inside or rather the rector s voice reading A thought of scorn rose in her heart How long will the poor endure this religion this make believe which preaches patience patience when it ought to be urging war But she went in softly so as not to interrupt The rector looked up and made a grave sign of the head as she entered her own gesture forbade any other movement in the group she took a stool beside Willie whose makeshift bed of chairs and pillows stood on one side of the fire and the reading went on Since Minta Hurd had returned with Marcella from Widrington Gaol that afternoon she had been so ill that a doctor had been sent for He had bade them make up her bed downstairs in the warm and accordingly a mattress had been laid on the settle and she was now stretched upon it Her huddled form the staring whiteness of the narrow face and closed eyelids thrown out against the dark oak of the settle and the disordered mass of grizzled hair made the centre of the cottage Beside her on the floor sat Mary Harden her head bowed over the rough hand she held her eyes red with weeping Fronting them beside a little table which held a small paraffin lamp sat the young rector his Testament in his hand his slight boy s figure cast in sharp shadow on the cottage wall He had placed himself so as to screen the crude light of the lamp from the wife s eyes and an old skirt had been hung over a chair to keep it from little Willie Between mother and child sat Ann Mullins rocking herself to and fro over the fire and groaning from time to time a shapeless sullen creature brutalised by many children and much poverty of whom Marcella was often impatient And he said Lord remember me when Thou comest into Thy Kingdom And He said unto him Verily I say unto thee To day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise The rector s voice in its awed monotony dwelt insistently on each word then paused To day whispered Mary caressing Minta s hand while the tears streamed down her cheeks he repented Minta and the Lord took him to Himself at once forgiving all his sins missus Hurd gave no sign but the dark figure on the other side of the cottage made an involuntary movement which threw down a fire iron and sent a start through Willie s wasted body The reader resumed but perfect spontaneity was somehow lost both for him and for Mary Marcella s stormy presence worked in them both like a troubling leaven Nevertheless the priest went steadily through his duty dwelling on every pang of the Passion putting together every sacred and sublime word For centuries on centuries his brethren and forerunners had held up the Man of Sorrows before the anguished and the dying his turn had come his moment and place in the marvellous never ending task he accepted it with the meek ardour of an undoubting faith And all the multitudes that came together to this sight when they beheld the things that were done returned smiting their breasts He closed the book and bent forward so as to bring his voice close to the wife s ear So He died the Sinless and the Just for you for your husband He has passed through death through cruel death and where He has gone we poor weak stained sinners can follow holding to Him No sin however black can divide us from Him can tear us from His hand in the dark waters if it be only repented thrown upon His Cross Let us pray for your husband let us implore the Lord s mercy this night this hour upon his soul A shudder of remembrance passed through Marcella The rector knelt missus Hurd lay motionless save for deep gasps of struggling breath at intervals Ann Mullins sobbed loudly and Mary Harden wept as she prayed lost in a mystical vision of the Lord Himself among them there on the cottage floor stretching hands of pity over the woman beside her showing His marred side and brow Marcella alone sat erect her whole being one passionate protest against a faith which could thus heap all the crimes and responsibilities of this too real earth on the shadowy head of one far off Redeemer This very man who prays she thought is in some sort an accomplice of those who after tempting are now destroying and killing because they know of nothing better to do with the life they themselves have made outcast And she hardened her heart When the spoken prayer was over mister Harden still knelt on silently for some minutes So did Mary In the midst of the hush Marcella saw the boy s eyes unclose He looked with a sort of remote wonder at his mother and the figures beside her Then suddenly the gaze became eager concrete he sought for something Her eye followed his and she perceived in the shadow beside him on a broken chair placed behind the rough screen which had been made for him the four tiny animals of pinched paper Wharton had once fashioned She stooped noiselessly and moved the chair a little forward that he might see them better The child with difficulty turned his wasted head and lay with his skeleton hand under his cheek staring at his treasures his little all with just a gleam a faint gleam of that same exquisite content which had fascinated Wharton Then for the first time that day Marcella could have wept At last the rector and his sister rose God be with you missus Hurd said mister Harden stooping to her God support you His voice trembled missus Hurd in bewilderment looked up Oh mister Harden she cried with a sudden wail mister Harden Mary bent over her with tears trying to still her speaking again with quivering lips of the dear Lord the Saviour The rector turned to Marcella You are staying the night with her he asked under his breath Yes missus Mullins was up all last night I offered to come to night You went with her to the prison to day I believe Yes Did you see Hurd For a very few minutes Did you hear anything of his state of mind he asked anxiously Is he penitent He talked to me of Willie she said a fierce humanness in her unfriendly eyes I promised him that when the child died he should be buried respectably not by the parish And I told him I would always look after the little girls The rector sighed He moved away Then unexpectedly he came back again I must say it to you he said firmly but still so low as not to be heard by any one else in the cottage You are taking a great responsibility here to night Let me implore you not to fill that poor woman with thoughts of bitterness and revenge at such a moment of her life That you feel bitterly I know Mary has explained to me but ask yourself I beg of you how is she to be helped through her misery either now or in the future except by patience and submission to the will of God He had never made so long a speech to this formidable parishioner of his and his young cheek glowed with the effort You must leave me to do what I think best said Marcella coldly She felt herself wholly set free from that sort of moral compulsion which his holiness of mind and character had once exerted upon her That hateful opinion of his which Mary had reported had broken the spell once for all Mary did not venture to kiss her friend They all went Ann Mulling who was dropping as much with sleep as grief shuffled off last When she was going missus Hurd seemed to rouse a little and held her by the skirt saying incoherent things Dear missus Hurd said Marcella kneeling down beside her won t you let Ann go I am going to spend the night here and take care of you and Willie missus Hurd gave a painful start You re very good miss she said half consciously very good I m sure But she s his own flesh and blood is Ann his own flesh and blood Ann The two women clung together the rough ill tempered sister in law muttering what soothing she could think of When she was gone Minta Hurd turned her face to the back of the settle and moaned her hands clenched under her breast Marcella went about her preparations for the night She is extremely weak doctor Clarke had said the heart in such a state she may die of syncope on very small provocation If she is to spend the night in crying and exciting herself it will go hard with her Get her to sleep if you possibly can And he had left a sleeping draught Marcella resolved that she would persuade her to take it But I will wake her before eight o clock she thought No human being has the right to rob her of herself through that last hour And tenderly she coaxed Minta to take the doctor s medicine Minta swallowed it submissively asking no questions But the act of taking it roused her for the time and she would talk She even got up and tottered across to Willie Willie Willie Oh look miss he s got his animals he don t think of nothing else Oh Willie won t you think of your father you ll never have a father Willie not after to night The boy was startled by her appearance there beside him his haggard dishevelled mother with the dews of perspiration standing on the face and her black dress thrown open at the throat and breast for air He looked at her and a little frown lined the white brow But he did not speak Marcella thought he was too weak to speak and for an instant it struck her with a thrill of girlish fear that he was dying then and there that night that hour But when she had half helped half forced missus Hurd back to bed again and had returned to him his eyelids had fallen he seemed asleep The fast whistling breath was much the same as it had been for days she reassured herself And at last the wife slept too The narcotic seized her The aching limbs relaxed and all was still Marcella stooping over her kissed the shoulder of her dress for very joy so grateful to every sense of the watcher was the sudden lull in the long activity of anguish Then she sat down in the rocking chair by the fire yielding herself with a momentary relief to the night and the silence The tall clock showed that it was not yet ten She had brought a book with her and she drew it upon her knee but it lay unopened A fretting gusty wind beat against the window with occasional rushes of rain Marcella shivered though she had built up the fire and put on her cloak A few distant sounds from the village street round the corner the chiming of the church clock the crackling of the fire close beside her she heard everything there was to hear with unusual sharpness of ear and imagined more All at once restlessness or some undefined impression made her look round her She saw that the scanty baize curtain was only half drawn across one of the windows and she got up to close it Fresh from the light of the lamp she stared through the panes into the night without at first seeing anything Then there flashed out upon the dark the door of a public house to the right the last in the village road A man came out stumbling and reeling the light within streamed out an instant on the road and the common then the pursuing rain and darkness fell upon him She was drawing back when with sudden horror she perceived something else close beside her pressing against the window A woman s face the powerful black and white of it the strong aquiline features the mad keenness of the look were all plain to her The eyes looked in hungrily at the prostrate form on the settle at the sleeping child Another figure appeared out of the dark running up the path There was a slight scuffle and voices outside Marcella drew the curtain close with a hasty hand and sat down hardly able to breathe The woman who had looked in was Isabella Westall It was said that she was becoming more and more difficult to manage and to watch Marcella was some time in recovering herself That look as of a sleepless hateful eagerness clung to the memory Once or twice as it haunted her she got up again to make sure that the door was fast The incident with all it suggested did but intensify the horror and struggle in which the girl stood made her mood more strained more piercingly awake and alert Gradually as the hours passed as all sounds from without even that of the wind died away and the silence settled round her in ever widening circles like deep waters sinking to repose Marcella felt herself a naked soul alone on a wide sea with shapes of pain and agony and revolt She looked at the sleeping wife He too is probably asleep she thought remembering some information which a kindly warder had given her in a few jerky well meant sentences while she was waiting downstairs in the gaol for Minta Hurd Incredible only so many hours minutes left so far as any mortal knows of living thinking recollecting of all that makes us something as against the nothing of death and a man wastes them in sleep in that which is only meant for the ease and repair of the daily struggle And Minta her husband is her all to morrow she will have no husband yet she sleeps and I have helped to make her Ah Nature may well despise and trample on us there is no reason in us no dignity Oh why are we here why am I here to ache like this to hate good people like Charles Harden and Mary to refuse all I could give to madden myself over pain I can never help I cannot help it yet I cannot forsake it it drives it clings to me She sat over the fire Willie s hand clasped in hers He alone in this forlorn household loved her missus Hurd and the other children feared and depended on her This creature of thistle down this little thread and patch of humanity felt no fear of her It was as though his weakness divined through her harshness and unripeness those maternal and protecting powers with which her nature was in truth so richly dowered He confided himself to her with no misgivings He was at ease when she was there Little piteous hand its touch was to her symbolic imperative Eight months had she been at Mellor And that Marcella who had been living and moving amid these woods and lanes all this time that foolish girl delighting in new grandeurs and flattered by Aldous Raeburn s attentions that hot ambitious person who had meant to rule a county through a husband what had become of her Up to the night of Hurd s death sentence she had still existed in some sort with her obligations qualms remorses But since then every day every hour had been grinding scorching her away fashioning in flame and fever this new Marcella who sat here looking impatiently into another life which should know nothing of the bonds of the old Ah yes her thought could distinguish between the act and the man between the man and his class but in her feeling all was confounded This awful growth of sympathy in her strange irony had made all sympathy for Aldous Raeburn impossible to her Marry him no no never But she would make it quite easy to him to give her up Pride should come in he should feel no pain in doing it She had in her pocket the letter she had received from him that afternoon She had hardly been able to read it Ear and heart were alike dull to it From time to time she probably slept in her chair Or else it was the perpetual rush of images and sensations through the mind that hastened the hours Once when the first streaks of the March dawn were showing through the curtains Minta Hurd sprang up with a loud cry Oh my God Jim Jim Oh no take that off Oh please sir please Oh for God s sake sir Agony struggled with sleep Marcella shuddering held and soothed her and for a while sleep or rather the drug in her veins triumphed again For another hour or two she lay restlessly tossing from side to side but unconscious Willie hardly moved all night Again and again Marcella held beef tea or milk to his mouth and tried to rouse him to take it but she could make no impression on the passive lips the sleeping serenity of the brow never changed At last with a start Marcella looked round and saw that the morning was fully there A cold light was streaming through the curtains the fire was still glowing but her limbs were stiff and chilled under her shawl She sprang up horror descending on her Her shaking fingers could hardly draw out the watch in her belt Ten minutes to eight For the first time the girl felt nerve and resolution fail her She looked at missus Hurd and wrung her hands The mother was muttering and moving but not yet fully awake and Willie lay as before Hardly knowing what she was doing she drew the curtains back as though inspiration might come with the light The rain clouds trailed across the common water dripped heavily from the thatch of the cottage and a few birds twittered from some bedraggled larches at the edge of the common Far away beyond and beneath those woods to the right Widrington lay on the plain with that high walled stone building at its edge She saw everything as it must now be happening as plainly as though she were bodily present there the last meal the pinioning the chaplain Goaded by the passing seconds she turned back at last to wake that poor sleeper behind her But something diverted her With a start she saw that Willie s eyes were open Willie she said running to him how are you dear Shall I lift your head a little He did not answer though she thought he tried and she was struck by the blueness under the eyes and nose Hurriedly she felt his tiny feet They were quite cold missus Hurd she cried rousing her in haste dear missus Hurd come and see Willie The mother sprang up bewildered and hurrying across the room threw herself upon him Willie what is it ails you dear Tell mother Is it your feet are so cold But we ll rub them we ll get you warm soon And here s something to make you better Marcella handed her some brandy Drink it dear drink it sweetheart Her voice grew shrill He can t said Marcella Do not let us plague him it is the end doctor Clarke said it would come in the morning They hung over him forgetting everything but him for the moment the only moment in his little life he came first even with his mother There was a slight movement of the hand He wants his animals said Marcella the tears pouring down her cheeks She lifted them and put them on his breast laying the cold fingers over them Then he tried to speak Daddy he whispered looking up fully at his mother take em to Daddy She fell on her knees beside him with a shriek hiding her face and shaking from head to foot Marcella alone saw the slight mysterious smile the gradual sinking of the lids the shudder of departing life that ran through the limbs A heavy sound swung through the air a heavy repeated sound missus Hurd held up her head and listened The church clock tolled eight She knelt there struck motionless by terror by recollection Oh Jim she said under her breath my Jim The plaintive tone as of a creature that has not even breath and strength left wherewith to chide the fate that crushes it broke Marcella s heart Sitting beside the dead son she wrapt the mother in her arms and the only words that even her wild spirit could find wherewith to sustain this woman through the moments of her husband s death were words of prayer the old shuddering cries wherewith the human soul from the beginning has thrown itself on that awful encompassing Life whence it issued and whither it returns CHAPTER XV Two days later in the afternoon Aldous Raeburn found himself at the door of Mellor When he entered the drawing room missus Boyce who had heard his ring was hurrying away Don t go he said detaining her with a certain peremptoriness I want all the light on this I can get Tell me she has actually brought herself to regard this man s death as in some sort my doing as something which ought to separate us missus Boyce saw that he held an opened letter from Marcella crushed in his hand But she did not need the explanation She had been expecting him at any hour throughout the day and in just this condition of mind Marcella must explain for herself she said after a moment s thought I have no right whatever to speak for her Besides frankly I do not understand her and when I argue with her she only makes me realise that I have no part or lot in her that I never had It is just enough She was brought up away from me And I have no natural hold I cannot help you or any one else with her Aldous had been very tolerant and compassionate in the past of this strange mother s abdication of her maternal place and of its probable causes But it was not in human nature that he should be either to day He resumed his questioning not without sharpness One word please Tell me something of what has happened since Thursday before I see her I have written but till this morning I have had not one line from her They were standing by the window he with his frowning gaze in which agitation struggled against all his normal habits of manner and expression fixed upon the lawn and the avenue She told him briefly what she knew of Marcella s doings since the arrival of Wharton s telegram of the night in the cottage and the child s death It was plain that he listened with a shuddering repulsion Do you know he exclaimed turning upon her that she may never recover this Such a strain such a horror rushed upon so wantonly so needlessly I understand You think that I have been to blame I do not wonder But it is not true not in this particular case And anyway your view is not mine Life and the iron of it has to be faced even by women perhaps most of all by women But let me go now Otherwise my husband will come in And I imagine you would rather see Marcella before you see him or any one That suggestion told He instantly gathered himself together and nervously begged that she would send Marcella to him at once He could think of nothing talk of nothing till he had seen her She went and Aldous was left to walk up and down the room planning what he should say After the ghastly intermingling of public interests and private misery in which he had lived for these many weeks there was a certain relief in having reached the cleared space the decisive moment when he might at last give himself wholly to what truly concerned him He would not lose her without a struggle None the less he knew and had known ever since the scene in the Court library that the great disaster of his life was upon him The handle of the door turned She was there He did not go to meet her She had come in wrought up to face attack reproaches entreaties ready to be angry or to be humble as he should give her the lead But he gave her no lead She had to break through that quivering silence as best she could I wanted to explain everything to you she said in a low voice as she came near to him I know my note last night was very hard and abrupt I didn t mean to be hard But I am still so tired and everything that one says and feels hurts so She sank down upon a chair This womanish appeal to his pity had not been at all in her programme Nor did it immediately succeed As he looked at her he could only feel the wantonness of this eclipse into which she had plunged her youth and beauty There was wrath a passionate protesting wrath under his pain Marcella he said sitting down beside her did you read my letter that I wrote you the day before Yes And after that you could still believe that I was indifferent to your grief your suffering or to the suffering of any human being for whom you cared You could still think it and feel it It was not what you have said all through she replied looking sombrely away from him her chin on her hand it is what you have done What have I done he said proudly bending forward from his seat beside her What have I ever done but claim from you that freedom you desire so passionately for others freedom of conscience freedom of judgment You denied me this freedom though I asked it of you with all my soul And you denied me more Through these five weeks you have refused me the commonest right of love the right to show you myself to prove to you that through all this misery of differing opinion misery much more oh much more to me than to you I was in truth bent on the same ends with you bearing the same burden groping towards the same goal No no she cried turning upon him and catching at a word what burden have you ever borne I know you were sorry that there was a struggle in your mind that you pitied me pitied them But you judged it all from above you looked down and I could not see that you had any right It made me mad to have such things seen from a height when I was below in the midst close to the horror and anguish of them Whose fault was it he interrupted that I was not with you Did I not offer entreat I could not sign a statement of fact which seemed to me an untrue statement but what prevented me prevented us However let me take that point first Would you he spoke deliberately would you have had me put my name to a public statement which I rightly or wrongly believed to be false because you asked me You owe it to me to answer She could not escape the penetrating fire of his eye The man s mildness his quiet self renouncing reserve were all burnt up at last in this white heat of an accusing passion In return she began to forget her own resolve to bear herself gently You don t remember she cried that what divided us was your your incapacity to put the human pity first to think of the surrounding circumstances of the debt that you and I and everybody like us owe to a man like Hurd to one who had been stunted and starved by life as he had been Her lip began to tremble Then it comes to this he said steadily that if I had been a poor man you would have allowed me my conscience my judgment of right and wrong in such a matter You would have let me remember that I was a citizen and that pity is only one side of justice You would have let me plead that Hurd s sin was not against me but against the community and that in determining whether to do what you wished or no I must think of the community and its good before even I thought of pleasing you If I had possessed no more than Hurd all this would have been permitted me but because of Maxwell Court because of my money she shrank before the accent of the word you refused me the commonest moral rights My scruple my feeling were nothing to you Your pride was engaged as well as your pity and I must give way Marcella you talk of justice you talk of equality is the only man who can get neither at your hands the man whom you promised to marry His voice dwelt on that last word dwelt and broke He leant over her in his roused strength and tried to take her hand But she moved away from him with a cry It is no use Oh don t don t It may be all true I was vain I dare say and unjust and hard But don t you see don t you understand if we could take such different views of such a case if it could divide us so deeply what chance would there be if we were married I ought never never to have said Yes to you even as I was then But now she turned to him slowly can t you see it for yourself I am a changed creature Certain things in me are gone gone and instead there is a fire something driving tormenting which must burn its way out When I think of what I liked so much when you asked me to marry you being rich and having beautiful things and dresses and jewels and servants and power social power above all that I feel sick and choked I couldn t breathe now in a house like Maxwell Court The poor have come to mean to me the only people who really live and really suffer I must live with them work for them find out what I can do for them You must give me up you must indeed Oh and you will You will be glad enough thankful enough when when you know what I am He started at the words Where was the prophetess He saw that she was lying white and breathless her face hidden against the arm of the chair In an instant he was on his knees beside her Marcella he could hardly command his voice but he held her struggling hand against his lips You think that suffering belongs to one class Have you really no conception of what you will be dealing to me if you tear yourself away from me She withdrew her hand sobbing Don t don t stay near me she said there is more there is something else Aldous rose You mean he said in an altered voice after a pause of silence that another influence another man has come between us She sat up and with a strong effort drove back her weeping If I could say to you only this she began at last with long pauses I mistook myself and my part in life I did wrong but forgive me and let me go for both our sakes that would be well that would be difficult but easier than this Haven t you understood at all When when mister Wharton came I began to see things very soon not in my own way but in his way I had never met any one like him not any one who showed me such possibilities in myself such new ways of using one s life and not only one s possessions of looking at all the great questions I thought it was just friendship but it made me critical impatient of everything else I was never myself from the beginning Then after the ball he stooped over her that he might hear her the more plainly when I came home I was in my room and I heard steps there are ghost stories you know about that part of the house I went out to see Perhaps in my heart of hearts oh I can t tell I can t tell anyway he was there We went into the library and we talked He did not want to touch our marriage but he said all sorts of mad things and at last he kissed me The last words were only breathed She had often pictured herself confessing these things to him But the humiliation in which she actually found herself before him was more than she had ever dreamed of more than she could bear All those great words of pity and mercy all that implication of a moral atmosphere to which he could never attain to end in this story The effect of it on herself rather than on him was what she had not foreseen Aldous raised himself slowly And when did this happen he asked after a moment I told you the night of the ball of the murder she said with a shiver we saw Hurd cross the avenue I meant to have told you everything at once And you gave up that intention he asked her when he had waited a little for more and nothing came She turned upon him with a flash of the old defiance How could I think of my own affairs Or of mine he said bitterly She made no answer Aldous got up and walked to the chimney piece He was very pale but his eyes were bright and sparkling When she looked up at him at last she saw that her task was done His scorn his resentment were they not the expiation the penalty she had looked forward to all along and with that determination to bear them calmly Yet now that they were there in front of her they stung So that for all those weeks while you were letting me write as I did while you were letting me conceive you and your action as I did you had this on your mind You never gave me a hint you let me plead you let me regard you as wrapped up in the unselfish end you sent me those letters of his those most misleading letters and all the time But I meant to tell you I always meant to tell you she cried passionately I would never have gone on with a secret like that not for your sake but for my own Yet you did go on so long he said steadily and my agony of mind during those weeks my feeling towards you my He broke off wrestling with himself As for her she had fallen back in her chair physically incapable of anything more He walked over to her side and took up his hat You have done me wrong he said gazing down upon her I pray God you may not do yourself a greater wrong in the future Give me leave to write to you once more or to send my friend Edward Hallin to see you Then I will not trouble you again He waited but she could give him no answer Her form as she lay there in this physical and moral abasement printed itself upon his heart Yet he felt no desire whatever to snatch the last touch the last kiss that wounded passion so often craves Inwardly and without words he said farewell to her She heard his steps across the room the door shut she was alone and free BOOK III O Neigung sage wie hast du so tief Im Herzen dich verstecket Wer hat dich die verborgen schlief Gewecket CHAPTER I Don t suppose that I feel enthusiastic or sentimental about the claims of Labour said Wharton smiling to the lady beside him You may get that from other people but not from me I am not moral enough to be a fanatic My position is simplicity itself When things are inevitable I prefer to be on the right side of them and not on the wrong There is not much more in it than that I would rather be on the back of the bore for instance as it sweeps up the tidal river than the swimmer caught underneath it Well that is intelligible said Lady Selina Farrell looking at her neighbour as she crumbled her dinner roll To crumble your bread at dinner is a sign of nervousness according to Sydney Smith who did it with both hands when he sat next an Archbishop yet no one for a good many years past had ever suspected Lady Selina of nervousness though her powers had probably been tried before now by the neighbourhood of many Primates Catholic and Anglican For Lady Selina went much into society and had begun it young Still you know she resumed after a moment s pause you play enthusiasm in public I suppose you must Oh of course said Wharton indifferently That is in the game Why should it be always If you are a leader of the people why don t you educate them My father says that bringing feeling into politics is like making rhymes in one s account book Well when you have taught the masses how not to feel said Wharton laughing we will follow your advice Meanwhile it is our brains and their feelings that do the trick And by the way Lady Selina are you always so cool If you saw the Revolution coming to morrow into the garden of Alresford House would you go to the balcony and argue I devoutly hope there would be somebody ready to do something more to the point said Lady Selina hastily But of course we have enthusiasms too What the Flag and the Throne that kind of thing The ironical attention which Wharton began at this moment to devote to the selection of an olive annoyed his companion Yes she repeated emphatically the Flag and the Throne all that has made England great in the past But we know very well that they are not your enthusiasms Wharton s upper lip twitched a little And you are quite sure that Busbridge Towers has nothing to do with it he said suddenly looking round upon her Busbridge Towers was the fine ancestral seat which belonged to Lady Selina s father that very respectable and ancient peer Lord Alresford whom an ungrateful party had unaccountably omitted for the first time from the latest Conservative administration Of course we perfectly understand replied Lady Selina scornfully that your side and especially your Socialist friends put down all that we do and say to greed and selfishness It is our misfortune hardly our fault Not at all said Wharton quietly I was only trying to convince you that it is a little difficult to drive feeling out of politics Do you suppose our host succeeds You perceive this is a Radical house and a Radical banquet He pushed the menu towards her significantly Then his eye travelled with its usual keen rapidity over the room over the splendid dinner table with its display of flowers and plate and over the assembled guests He and Lady Selina were dining at the hospitable board of a certain rich manufacturer who drew enormous revenues from the west had formed part of the Radical contingent of the last Liberal ministry and had especially distinguished himself by a series of uncompromising attacks on the ground landlords of London Lady Selina sighed It is all a horrible tangle she said and what the next twenty years will bring forth who can tell Oh one moment mister Wharton before I forget Are you engaged for Saturday week He drew a little note book out of his pocket and consulted it It appeared that he was not engaged Then will you dine with us She lightly mentioned the names of four or five distinguished guests including the Conservative Premier of the day Wharton made her a little ceremonious bow I shall be delighted Can you trust me to behave Lady Selina s smile made her his match for the moment Oh we can defend ourselves she said By the way I think you told me that mister Raeburn was not a friend of yours No said Wharton facing her look with coolness If you have asked mister Raeburn for the twenty third let me crave your leave to cancel that note in my pocket book Not for my sake you understand at all She had difficulty in concealing her curiosity But his face betrayed nothing It always seemed to her that his very dark and straight eyebrows so obtrusive and unusual as compared with the delicacy of the features of the fair skin and light brown curls made it easy for him to wear any mask he pleased By their mere physical emphasis they drew attention away from the subtler and more revealing things of expression They say she went on that he is sure to do well in the House if only he can be made to take interest enough in the party But one of his admirers told me that he was not at all anxious to accept this post they have just given him He only did it to please his grandfather My father thinks Lord Maxwell much aged this year He is laid up now with a chill of some sort I believe mister Raeburn will have to make haste if he is to have any career in the Commons But you can see he cares very little about it All his friends tell me they find him changed since that unlucky affair last year By the way did you ever see that girl Certainly I was staying in her father s house while the engagement was going on Were you said Lady Selina eagerly and what did you think of her Well in the first place said Wharton slowly she is beautiful you knew that Lady Selina nodded Yes Miss Raeburn who has told me most of what I know always throws in a shrug and a but when you ask about her looks However I have seen a photograph of her so I can judge for myself It seemed to me a beauty that men perhaps would admire more than women Wharton devoted himself to his green peas and made no reply Lady Selina glanced at him sharply She herself was by no means a beauty But neither was she plain She had a long rather distinguished face with a marked nose and a wide thin lipped mouth Her plentiful fair hair a little dull and ashy in colour was heaped up above her forehead in infinitesimal curls and rolls which did great credit to her maid and gave additional height to the head and length to a thin white neck Her light blue eyes were very direct and observant Their expression implied both considerable knowledge of the world and a natural inquisitiveness Many persons indeed were of opinion that Lady Selina wished to know too much about you and were on their guard when she approached You admired her very much I see she resumed as Wharton still remained silent Oh yes We talked Socialism and then I defended her poacher for her Oh I remember And it is really true as Miss Raeburn says that she broke it off because she could not get Lord Maxwell and mister Raeburn to sign the petition for the poacher Somewhere about true said Wharton carelessly Miss Raeburn always gives the same account you can never get anything else out of her But I sometimes wonder whether it is the whole truth You think she was sincere Well she gave up Maxwell Court and thirty thousand a year he replied drily I should say she had at least earned the benefit of the doubt I mean said Lady Selina was she in love with anybody else and was the poacher an excuse She turned upon him as she spoke a smiling self possessed person a little spoilt by those hard inquisitive eyes No I think not said Wharton throwing his head back to meet her scrutiny If so nothing has been heard of him yet Miss Boyce has been at saint Edward s Hospital for the last year To learn nursing It is what all the women do nowadays they tell me who can t get on with their relations or their lovers Do you suppose it is such a very hard life I don t want to try said Wharton Do you She evaded his smile What is she going to do when she has done her training Settle down and nurse among the poor I believe Magnificent no doubt but hardly business from her point of view How much more she might have done for the poor with thirty thousand a year And any woman could put up with Aldous Raeburn Wharton shrugged his shoulders We come back to those feelings Lady Selina you think so badly of She laughed Well but feelings must be intelligible And this seems so small a cause However were you there when it was broken off No I have never seen her since the day of the poacher s trial Oh So she has gone into complete seclusion from all her friends That I can t answer for I can only tell you my own experience Lady Selina bethought herself of a great many more questions to ask but somehow did not ask them The talk fell upon politics which lasted till the hostess gave the signal and Lady Selina gathering up her fan and gloves swept from the room next after the Countess at the head of the table while a host of elderly ladies wives of ministers and the like stood meekly by to let her pass As he sat down again Wharton made the entry of the dinner at Alresford House to which he had just promised himself a little plainer It was the second time in three weeks that Lady Selina had asked him and he was well aware that several other men at this dinner table of about the same standing and prospects as himself would be very glad to be in his place Lady Selina though she was unmarried and not particularly handsome or particularly charming was a personage and knew it As the mistress of her father s various fine houses and the kinswoman of half the great families of England she had ample social opportunities and made on the whole clever use of them She was not exactly popular but in her day she had been extremely useful to many and her invitations were prized Wharton had been introduced to her at the beginning of this his second session had adopted with her the easy aggressive personal manner which on the whole was his natural manner towards women and had found it immediately successful When he had replaced his pocket book he found himself approached by a man on his own side of the table a member of Parliament like himself with whom he was on moderately friendly terms Your motion comes on next Friday I think said the new comer Wharton nodded It ll be a beastly queer division said the other a precious lot of cross voting That ll be the way with that kind of question for a good while to come don t you think said Wharton smiling till we get a complete reorganisation of parties As he leaned back in his chair enjoying his cigarette his half shut eyes behind the curls of smoke made a good humoured but contemptuous study of his companion mister Bateson was a young manufacturer recently returned to Parliament and newly married He had an open ruddy face spoilt by an expression of chronic perplexity which was almost fretfulness Not that the countenance was without shrewdness but it suggested that the man had ambitions far beyond his powers of performance and already knew himself to be inadequate Well I shouldn t wonder if you get a considerable vote he resumed after a pause it s like women s suffrage People will go on voting for this kind of thing till there seems a chance of getting it Then Ah well said Wharton easily I see we shan t get you I vote for an eight hours day by local and trade option In my opinion I might as well vote for striking the flag on the British Empire at once It would be the death knell of all our prosperity Wharton s artistic ear disliked the mixture of metaphor and he frowned slightly mister Bateson hurried on He was already excited and had fallen upon Wharton as a prey And you really desire to make it penal for us manufacturers for me in my industry in spite of all the chances and changes of the market to work my men more than eight hours a day even if they wish it We must get our decision our majority of the adult workers in any given district in favour of an eight hours day said Wharton blandly then when they have voted for it the local authority will put the Act in motion And my men conceivably may have voted in the minority against any such tomfoolery yet when the vote is given it will be a punishable offence for them and me to work overtime You actually mean that how do you propose to punish us Well said Wharton relighting his cigarette that is a much debated point Personally I am in favour of imprisonment rather than fine The other bounded on his chair You would imprison me for working overtime with willing men Wharton eyed him with smiling composure Two or three other men an old general the smart private secretary of a cabinet minister and a well known permanent official at the head of one of the great spending departments who were sitting grouped at the end of the table a few feet away stopped their conversation to listen Except in cases of emergency which are provided for under the Act said Wharton Yes I should imprison you with the greatest pleasure in life Eight hours plus overtime is what we are going to stop at all hazards A flash broke from his blue eyes Then he tranquilly resumed his smoking The young manufacturer flushed with angry agitation But you must know it is inconceivable that you should not know that the whole thing is stark staring lunacy In our business trade is declining the export falling every year the imports from France steadily advancing And you are going to make us fight a country where men work eleven hours a day for lower wages with our hands tied behind our backs by legislation of this kind Well you know he threw himself back in his chair with a contemptuous laugh there can be only one explanation You and your friends of course have banished political economy to Saturn and you suppose that by doing so you get rid of it for all the rest of the world But I imagine it will beat you all the same He stopped in a heat As usual what he found to say was not equal to what he wanted to say and beneath his anger with Wharton was the familiar fuming at his own lack of impressiveness Well I dare say said Wharton serenely However let s take your political economy a moment and see if I can understand what you mean by it There never were two words that meant all things to all men so disreputably And thereupon to the constant accompaniment of his cigarette and with the utmost composure and good temper he began to heckle his companion putting questions suggesting perfidious illustrations extracting innocent admissions with a practised shrewdness and malice which presently left the unfortunate Bateson floundering in a sea of his own contradictions and totally unable for the moment to attach any rational idea whatever to those great words of his favourite science wherewith he was generally accustomed to make such triumphant play both on the platform and in the bosom of the family The permanent official round the corner watched the unequal fight with attentive amusement Once when it was a question of Mill s doctrine of cost of production as compared with that of a leading modern collectivist he leant forward and supplied a correction of something Wharton had said Wharton instantly put down his cigarette and addressed him in another tone A rapid dialogue passed between them the dialogue of experts sharp allusive elliptical in the midst of which the host gave the signal for joining the ladies Well all I know is said Bateson as he got up that these kinds of questions if you and your friends have your way will wreck the Liberal party before long far more effectually than anything Irish has ever done On these things some of us will fight if it must come to that Wharton laughed It would be a national misfortune if you didn t give us a stiff job he said with an airy good humour which at once made the other s blustering look ridiculous I wonder what that fellow is going to do in the House said the permanent official to his companion as they went slowly upstairs Wharton being some distance ahead People are all beginning to talk of him as a coming man though nobody quite knows why as yet They tell me he frames well in speaking and will probably make a mark with his speech next Friday But his future seems to me very doubtful He can only become a power as the head of a new Labour party But where is the party They all want to be kings The best point in his favour is that they are likely enough to take a gentleman if they must have a leader But there still remains the question whether he can make anything out of the material I hope to God he can t said the old general grimly it is these town chatterers of yours that will bring the Empire about our heads before we ve done They ve begun it already wherever they saw a chance In the drawing room Wharton devoted himself for a few minutes to his hostess a little pushing woman who confided to his apparently attentive ear a series of grievances as to the bad manners of the great ladies of their common party and the general evil plight of Liberalism in London from the social point of view Either they give themselves airs rediculous airs or they admit everybody she said with a lavish use of white shoulders and scarlet fan by way of emphasis My husband feels it just as much as I do It is a real misfortune for the party that its social affairs should be so villainously managed Oh I dare say you don t mind mister Wharton because you are a Socialist But I assure you those of us who still believe in the influence of the best people don t like it A point whence Wharton easily led her through a series of spiteful anecdotes bearing on her own social mishaps and rebuffs which were none the less illuminating because of the teller s anxious effort to give them a dignified and disinterested air Then when neither she nor her plight were any longer amusing he took his leave exchanging another skirmishing word or two on the staircase with Lady Selina who it appeared was going on as he was and to the same house In a few minutes his hansom landed him at the door of a great mansion in Berkeley Square where a huge evening party was proceeding given by one of those Liberal ladies whom his late hostess had been so freely denouncing The lady and the house belonged to a man who had held high office in the late Administration As he made his way slowly to the top of the crowded stairs the stately woman in white satin and diamonds who was receiving on the landing marked him and when his name was announced she came forward a step or two Nothing could have been more flattering than the smile with which she gave him her gloved hand to touch Have you been out of town all these Sundays she said to him with the slightest air of soft reproach I am always at home you know I told you so She spoke with the ease of one who could afford to make whatever social advances she pleased Wharton excused himself and they chatted a little in the intervals of her perpetual greetings to the mounting crowd She and he had met at a famous country house in the Easter recess and her aristocrat s instinct for all that gives savour and sharpness to the dish of life had marked him at once Sir Hugh wants you to come down and see us in Sussex she said stretching her white neck a little to speak after him as he was at last carried through the drawing room door by the pressure behind him Will you He threw back an answer which she rather took for granted than heard for she nodded and smiled through it stiffening her delicate face the moment afterwards to meet the timid remarks of one of her husband s constituents asked by Sir Hugh in the streets that afternoon who happened to present her with the next hand to shake Inside Wharton soon found himself brought up against the ex Secretary of State himself who greeted him cordially and then bantered him a little on his coming motion Oh I shall be interested to see what you make of it But you know it has no actuality never can have till you can agree among yourselves You say you want the same thing I dare say you ll all swear it on Friday but really The statesman shook his head pleasantly The details are a little vague still I grant you said Wharton smiling And you think the principle matters twopence without the details I have always found that the difficulty with the Christian command Be ye perfect The principle doesn t trouble me at all The swaying of the entering throng parted the two speakers and for a second or two the portly host followed with his eye the fair profile and lightly built figure of the younger man as they receded from him in the crowd It was in his mind that the next twenty years whether this man or that turned out to be important or no must see an enormous quickening of the political pace He himself was not conscious of any jealousy of the younger men but neither did he see among them any commanding personality This young fellow with his vivacity his energy and his Socialist whims was interesting enough and his problem was interesting the problem of whether he could make a party out of the heterogeneous group of which he was turning out to be indisputably the ablest member But what was there certain or inevitable about his future after all And it was the same with all the rest Whereas the leaders of the past had surely announced themselves beyond mistake from the beginning He was inclined to think however that we were levelling up rather than levelling down The world grew too clever and leadership was more difficult every day Meanwhile Wharton found his progress through these stately rooms extremely pleasant He was astonished at the multitude of people he knew at the numbers of faces that smiled upon him Presently after half an hour of hard small talk he found himself for a moment without an acquaintance leaning against an archway between two rooms and free to watch the throng Self love that froward presence like a chattering child within us was all alert and happy A feeling of surprise too which had not yet worn away A year before he had told Marcella Boyce and with conviction that he was an outcast from his class He smiled now at that past naivete which had allowed him to take the flouts of his country neighbours and his mother s unpopularity with her aristocratic relations for an index of the way in which society in general would be likely to treat him and his opinions He now knew on the contrary that those opinions had been his best advertisement Few people it appeared were more in demand among the great than those who gave it out that they would if they could abolish the great It s because they re not enough afraid of us yet he said to himself not without spleen When we really get to business if we ever do I shall not be coming to Lady Cradock s parties mister Wharton do you ever do such a frivolous thing as go to the theatre said a pretty languishing creature at his elbow the wife of a London theatrical manager Suppose you come and see us in The Minister s Wooing first night next Saturday I ve got one seat in my box for somebody very agreeable Only it must be somebody who can appreciate my frocks I should be charmed said Wharton Are the frocks so adorable Adorable Then I may write you a note You don t have your horrid Parliament that night do you and she fluttered on I think you don t know my younger daughter mister Wharton said a severe voice at his elbow He turned and saw an elderly matron with the usual matronly cap and careworn countenance putting forward a young thing in white to whom he bowed with great ceremony The lady was the wife of a north country magnate of very old family and one of the most exclusive of her kind in London The daughter a vision of young shyness and bloom looked at him with frightened eyes as he leant against the wall beside her and began to talk She wished he would go away and let her get to the girl friend who was waiting for her and signalling to her across the room But in a minute or two she had forgotten to wish anything of the kind The mixture of audacity with a perfect self command in the manner of her new acquaintance that searching half mocking look which saw everything in detail and was always pressing beyond the generalisations of talk and manners the lightness and brightness of the whole aspect of the curls the eyes the flexible determined mouth these things arrested her She began to open her virgin heart first in protesting against attack then in confession till in ten minutes her white breast was heaving under the excitement of her own temerity and Wharton knew practically all about her her mingled pleasure and remorse in going out her astonishment at the difference between the world as it was this year and the world as it had been last when she was still in the school room her Sunday school her brothers her ideals for she was a little nun at heart her favourite clergyman and all the rest of it I say Wharton come and dine will you Thursday at the House small party meet in my room So said one of the party whips from behind into his ear The speaker was a popular young aristocrat who in the preceding year had treated the member for West Brookshire with chilliness Wharton turned to consider a moment then gave a smiling assent All right said the other withdrawing his hand from Wharton s shoulder good night two more of these beastly crushes to fight through till I can get to my bed worse luck Are any of your fellows here to night Wharton shook his head Too austere I suppose A question of dress coats I should think said Wharton drily The other shrugged his shoulders And this calls itself a party gathering in a radical and democratic house what a farce it all is Agreed good night And Wharton moved on just catching as he did so the eyes of his new girl acquaintance looking back at him from a distant door Their shy owner withdrew them instantly coloured and passed out of sight At the same moment a guest entered by the same door a tall grave man in the prime of life but already grey haired Wharton to his surprise recognised Aldous Raeburn and saw also that the master of the house had him by the arm They came towards him talking The crowd prevented him from getting effectually out of their way but he turned aside and took up a magazine lying on a bookcase near And you really think him a trifle better said the ex minister Oh yes better certainly better but I am afraid he will hardly get back to work this session the doctors talk of sending him away at once Ah well said the other smiling we don t intend it seems to let you send anything important up to the Lords yet awhile so there will be time for him to recruit I wish I was confident about the recruiting said Raeburn sadly He has lost much strength I shall go with them to the Italian lakes at the end of next week see them settled and come back at once Shall you miss a sitting of the commission asked his host Both he and Raeburn were members of an important Labour Commission appointed the year before by the new Conservative government Hardly I think said Raeburn I am particularly anxious not to miss D s evidence And they fell talking a little about the Commission and the witnesses recently examined before it Wharton who was wedged in by a group of ladies and could not for the moment move heard most of what they were saying much against his will Moreover Raeburn s tone of quiet and masterly familiarity with what he and his companion were discussing annoyed him There was nothing in the world that he himself would more eagerly have accepted than a seat on that Commission Ah there is Lady Cradock said Raeburn perceiving his hostess across a sea of intervening faces and responding to her little wave of the hand I must go and get a few words with her and then take my aunt away As he made his way towards her he suddenly brushed against Wharton who could not escape Raeburn looked up recognised the man he had touched flushed slightly and passed on A bystander would have supposed them strangers to each other CHAPTER II Two or three minutes later Wharton was walking down a side street towards Piccadilly After all the flattering incidents of the evening the chance meeting with which it concluded had jarred unpleasantly Confound the fellow Was he the first man in the world who had been thrown over by a girl because he had been discovered to be a tiresome pedant For even supposing Miss Boyce had described that little scene in the library at Mellor to her fiance at the moment of giving him his dismissal and the year before by the help of all the news that reached him about the broken engagement by the help still more of the look or rather the entire absence of look wherewith Raeburn had walked past his greeting and his outstretched hand in a corridor of the House on the first occasion of their meeting after the news had become public property Wharton was inclined to think she had what then No doubt the stern moralist might have something to say on the subject of taking advantage of a guest s position to tamper with another man s betrothed If so the stern moralist would only show his usual incapacity to grasp the actual facts of flesh and blood What chance would he or any one else have had with Marcella Boyce if she had happened to be in love with the man she had promised to marry That little trifle had been left out in the arrangement It might have worked through perfectly well without as it happened it had broken down Realities had broken it down Small blame to them I stood for truth he said to himself with a kind of rage that moment when I held her in the library she lived Raeburn offered her a platform a position I made her think and feel I helped her to know herself Our relation was not passion it stood on the threshold but it was real a true relation so far as it went That it went no farther was due again to circumstances realities of another kind That he should scorn and resent my performance at Mellor is natural enough If we were in France he would call me out and I should give him satisfaction with all the pleasure in life But what am I about Are his ways mine I should have nothing left but to shoot myself to morrow if they were He walked on swiftly angrily rating himself for those symptoms of a merely false and conventional conscience which were apt to be roused in him by contact with Aldous Raeburn Has he not interfered with my freedom stamped his pedantic foot on me ever since we were boys together I have owed him one for many years now I have paid it Let him take the chances of war Then driven on by an irritation not to be quieted he began against his will to think of those various occasions on which he and Aldous Raeburn had crossed each other in the past of that incident in particular which Miss Raeburn had roughly recalled to Lady Winterbourne s reluctant memory Well and what of it It had occurred when Wharton was a lad of twenty one and during an interval of some months when Aldous Raeburn who had left Cambridge some three years before and was already the man of importance had shown a decided disposition to take up the brilliant unmanageable boy whom the Levens among other relations had already washed their hands of What did he do it for thought Wharton Philanthropic motives of course He is one of the men who must always be saving their souls and the black sheep of the world come in handy for the purpose I remember I was flattered then It takes one some time to understand the workings of the Hebraistic conscience Yes as it galled him to recollect he had shown great plasticity for a time He was then in the middle of his Oxford years and Raeburn s letters and Raeburn s influence had certainly pulled him through various scrapes that might have been disastrous Then a little later he could see the shooting lodge on the moors above Loch Etive where he and Raeburn Lord Maxwell Miss Raeburn and a small party had spent the August of his twenty first birthday Well that surly keeper and his pretty wife who had been Miss Raeburn s maid could anything be more inevitable A hard and jealous husband and one of the softest most sensuous natures that ever idleness made love to The thing was in the air in the summer in the blood as little to be resisted as the impulse to eat when you are hungry or drink when you thirst Besides what particular harm had been done what particular harm could have been done with such a Cerberus of a husband As to the outcry which had followed one special incident nothing could have been more uncalled for more superfluous Aldous had demanded contrition had said strong things with the flashing eyes the set mouth of a Cato And the culprit had turned obstinate would repent nothing not for the asking Everything was arguable and Renan s doubt as to whether he or Theophile Gautier were in the right of it would remain a doubt to all time that was all Raeburn could get out of him After which the Hebraist friend of course had turned his back on the offender and there was an end of it That incident however had belonged to a stage in his past life a stage marked by a certain prolonged tumult of the senses on which he now looked back with great composure That tumult had found vent in other adventures more emphatic a good deal than the adventure of the keeper s wife He believed that one or two of them had been not unknown to Raeburn Well that was done with His mother s death that wanton stupidity on the part of fate and the shock it had somehow caused him had first drawn him out of the slough of a cheap and facile pleasure on which he now looked back with contempt Afterwards his two years of travel and the joys at once virile and pure they had brought with them joys of adventure bodily endurance discovery together with the intellectual stimulus which comes of perpetual change of new heavens new seas new societies had loosened the yoke of the flesh and saved him from himself The deliverance so begun had been completed at home by the various chances and opportunities which had since opened to him a solid and tempting career in that Labour movement his mother had linked him with without indeed ever understanding either its objects or its men The attack on capital now developing on all sides the planning of the vast campaign and the handling of its industrial troops these things had made the pursuit of women look insipid coupled as they were with the thrill of increasing personal success Passion would require to present itself in new forms if it was now to take possession of him again As to his relation to Raeburn he well remembered that when after that long break in his life he and Aldous had met casually again in London or elsewhere Aldous had shown a certain disposition to forget the old quarrel and to behave with civility though not with friendliness As to Wharton he was quite willing though at the same time he had gone down to contest West Brookshire and above all had found himself in the same house as Aldous Raeburn s betrothed with an even livelier sense than usual of the excitement to be got out of mere living No doubt when Raeburn heard that story of the library if he had heard it he recognised in it the man and the character he had known of old and had shrunk from the connection of both with Marcella Boyce in bitter and insurmountable disgust A mere Hebraist s mistake That girl s attraction for me was not an attraction of the senses except so far that for every normal man and woman charm is charm and ginger is hot in the mouth and always will be What I played for with her was power power over a nature that piqued and yet by natural affinity belonged to me I could not have retained that power as it happened by any bait of passion Even without the Hurd affair if I had gone on to approach her so her whole moral nature would have risen against me and her own treachery I knew that perfectly well and took the line I did because for the moment the game was too exciting too interesting to give up For the moment then a few days a few weeks later Good Lord what stuff we mortals be And he raised his shoulders mocking yet by no means disliking his own idiosyncrasies It had been strange indeed that complete change of mental emphasis that alteration of spiritual axis that had befallen him within the first weeks of his parliamentary life nay even before the Hurd agitation was over That agitation had brought him vigorously and profitably into public notice at a convenient moment But what had originally sprung from the impulse to retain a hold over a woman became in the end the instrument of a new and quite other situation Wharton had no sooner entered the House of Commons than he felt himself strangely at home there He had the instinct for debate the instinct for management together with a sensitive and contriving ambition He found himself possessed for the moment of powers of nervous endurance that astonished him a patience of boredom besides a capacity for drudgery and for making the best of dull men The omens were all favourable sometimes startlingly so He was no longer hampered by the ill will of a county or a family connection Here in this new world every man counted strictly for what in the parliamentary sense he was worth Wharton saw that owing to his public appearances during the two preceding years he was noticed listened to talked about in the House from the first and that his position in the newly formed though still loosely bound Labour party was one of indefinite promise The anxieties and pitfalls of the position only made it the more absorbing The quick elastic nature adjusted itself at once To some kinds of success nothing is so important as the ability to forget to sweep the mind free of everything irrelevant and superfluous Marcella Boyce and all connected with her passed clean out of Wharton s consciousness Except that once or twice he said to himself with a passing smile that it was a good thing he had not got himself into a worse scrape at Mellor Good heavens in what plight would a man stand a man with his career to make who had given Marcella Boyce claims upon him As well entangle oneself with the Tragic Muse at once as with that stormy unmanageable soul So much for a year ago To night however the past had been thrust back upon him both by Lady Selina s talk and by the meeting with Raeburn To smart indeed once more under that old ascendency of Raeburn s was to be provoked into thinking of Raeburn s old love Where was Miss Boyce Surely her year of hospital training must be up by now He turned into saint James Street stopped at a door not far from the Palace end let himself in and groped his way to the second floor A sleepy man servant turned out of his room and finding that his master was not inclined to go to bed brought lights and mineral water Wharton was practically a teetotaller He had taken a whim that way as a boy and a few experiments in drunkenness which he had made at college had only confirmed what had been originally perhaps a piece of notoriety hunting He had as a rule flawless health and the unaccustomed headaches and nausea which followed these occasional excesses had disgusted and deterred him He shook himself easily free of a habit which had never gained a hold upon him and had ever since found his abstinence a source both of vanity and of distinction Nothing annoyed him more than to hear it put down to any ethical motive If I liked the beastly stuff I should swim in it to morrow he would say with an angry eye when certain acquaintance not those he made at Labour Congresses goaded him on the point As it is why should I make it or chloral or morphia or any other poison my master What s the inducement eh you fellows En revanche he smoked inordinately Is that all sir said his servant pausing behind his chair after candles matches cigarettes and Apollinaris had been supplied in abundance Yes go to bed Williams but don t lock up Good night The man departed and Wharton going to the window which opened on a balcony looking over saint James Street threw it wide and smoked a cigarette leaning against the wall It was on the whole a fine night and warm though the nip of the east wind was not yet out of the air In the street below there was still a good deal of movement for it was only just past midnight and the clubs were not yet empty To his right the turreted gate house of the Palace with its clock rose dark against a sky covered with light windy cloud Beyond it his eye sought instinctively for the Clock Tower which stood to night dull and beaconless like some one in a stupid silence That light of the sitting House had become to him one of the standing pleasures of life He had never yet been honestly glad of its extinction I m a precious raw hand he confessed to himself with a shake of the head as he stood there smoking And it can t last nothing does Presently he laid down his cigarette a moment on the edge of the balcony and coming back into the room opened a drawer searched a little and finally took out a letter He stooped over the lamp to read it It was the letter which Marcella Boyce had written him some two or three days after the breach of her engagement That fact was barely mentioned at the beginning of it without explanation or comment of any kind Then the letter continued I have never yet thanked you as I ought for all that you have done and attempted through these many weeks But for them it must have been plain to us both that we could never rightly meet again I am very destitute just now and I cling to self respect as though it were the only thing left me But that scene in the past which put us both wrong with honour and conscience has surely been wiped out thought suffered away I feel that I dare now say to you as I would to any other company worker and company thinker if in the future you ever want my work if you can set me with others to any task that wants doing and that I could do ask me and I am not likely to refuse But for the present I am going quite away into another world I have been more ill than I have ever been in my life this last few days and they are all even my father ready to agree with me that I must go As soon as I am a little stronger I am to have a year s training at a London hospital and then I shall probably live for a while in town and nurse This scheme occurred to me as I came back with the wife from seeing Hurd the day before the execution I knew then that all was over for me at Mellor As for the wretched break down of everything of all my schemes and friendships here I had better not speak of it I feel that I have given these village folk whom I had promised to help one more reason to despair of life It is not pleasant to carry such a thought away with one But if the tool breaks and blunts how can the task be done It can be of no use till it has been re set I should like to know how your plans prosper But I shall see your paper and follow what goes on in Parliament For the present I want neither to write nor get letters They tell me that as a probationer I shall spend my time at first in washing glasses and polishing bath taps on which my mind rests If you come across my friends of whom I have spoken to you Louis Anthony and Edith Craven and could make any use of Louis for the Labour Clarion I should be grateful I hear they have had bad times of late and Louis has engaged himself and wants to be married You remember I told you how we worked at the South Kensington classes together and how they made me a Venturist Yours very truly MARCELLA BOYCE Wharton laid down the letter making a wry mouth over some of its phrases Put us both wrong with honour and conscience One more reason for despair of life All was over for me at Mellor dear dear how women like the big words the emphatic pose All those little odds and ends of charities that absurd straw plaiting scheme Well perhaps one could hardly expect her to show a sense of humour just then But why does nature so often leave it out in these splendid creatures Hullo he added as he bent over the table to look for a pen why didn t that idiot give me these For there under an evening paper which he had not touched lay a pile of unopened letters His servant had forgotten to point them out to him On the top was a letter on which Wharton pounced at once It was addressed in a bold inky hand and he took it to be from Nehemiah Wilkins M P his former colleague at the Birmingham Labour Congress of late a member of the Labour Clarion staff and as such a daily increasing plague and anxiety to the Clarion s proprietor However the letter was not from Wilkins It was from the secretary of a Midland trades union with whom Wharton had already been in communication The union was recent and represented the as yet feeble organisation of a metal industry in process of transition from the home workshop to the full factory or Great Industry stage The conditions of work were extremely bad and grievances many wages were low and local distress very great The secretary a young man of ability and enthusiasm wrote to Wharton to say that certain alterations in the local payment lists lately made by the employers amounted to a reduction of wages that the workers beginning to feel the heartening effects of their union were determined not to submit that bitter and even desperate agitation was spreading fast and that a far reaching strike was imminent Could they count on the support of the Clarion The Clarion had already published certain letters on the industry from a Special Commissioner letters which had drawn public attention and had been eagerly read in the district itself Would the Clarion now go in for them Would mister Wharton personally support them in or out of Parliament and get his friends to do the same To which questions couched in terms extremely flattering to the power of the Clarion and its owner the secretary appended a long and technical statement of the situation Wharton looked up from the letter with a kindling eye He foresaw an extremely effective case both for the newspaper and the House of Commons One of the chief capitalists involved was a man called Denny who had been long in the House for whom the owner of the Clarion entertained a strong personal dislike Denny had thwarted him vexatiously had perhaps even made him ridiculous on one or two occasions and Wharton saw no reason whatever for forgiving one s enemies until like Narvaez one had shot them all There would be much satisfaction in making Denny understand who were his masters And with these motives there mingled a perfectly genuine sympathy with the

none	none	in question and a desire to see them righted Somebody must be sent down at once he said to himself I suppose he added with discontent it must be Wilkins For the man who had written the articles for the Labour Clarion as Special Commissioner had some three weeks before left England to take command of a colonial newspaper Still pondering he took up the other letters turned them over childishly pleased for the thousandth time by the M P on each envelope and the number and variety of his correspondence and eagerly chose out three one from his bankers one from his Lincolnshire agent and one from the Clarion office undoubtedly this time in Wilkins s hand He read them grew a little pale swore under his breath and angrily flinging the letters away from him he took up his cigarette again and thought The letter from his bankers asked his attention in stiff terms to a largely overdrawn account and entirely declined to advance a sum of money for which he had applied to them without the guarantee of two substantial names in addition to his own The letter from his agent warned him that the extraordinary drought of the past six weeks together with the general agricultural depression would certainly mean a large remission of rents at the June quarter day and also informed him that the holders of his company operative farm would not be able to pay their half yearly interest on the capital advanced to them by the landlord As to the third letter it was in truth much more serious than the two others Wilkins the passionate and suspicious workman of great natural ability who had been in many ways a thorn in Wharton s side since the beginning of his public career was now member for a mining constituency His means of support were extremely scanty and at the opening of the new Parliament Wharton had offered him well paid work on the Clarion newspaper It had seemed to the proprietor of the Clarion a way of attaching a dangerous man to himself perhaps also of controlling him Wilkins had grudgingly accepted understanding perfectly well what was meant Since then the relation between the two men had been one of perpetual friction Wilkins s irritable pride would yield nothing either in the House or in the Clarion office to Wharton s university education and class advantages while Wharton watched with alarm the growing influence of this insubordinate and hostile member of his own staff on those labour circles from which the Clarion drew its chief support In the letter he had just read Wilkins announced to the proprietor of the Clarion that in consequence of the scandalous mismanagement of that paper s handling of a certain trade

none	none	which had just closed he Wilkins could no longer continue to write for it and begged to terminate his engagement at once there being no formal agreement between himself and Wharton as to length of notice on either side A lively attack on the present management and future prospects of the Clarion followed together with the threat that the writer would do what in him lay henceforward to promote the cause of a certain rival organ lately started among such working men as he might be able to influence Brute jealous impracticable brute exclaimed Wharton aloud as he stood chafing and smoking by the window All the difficulties which this open breach was likely to sow in his path stood out before him in clear relief Personal leadership there is the whole problem he said to himself in moody despair Can I like Parnell make a party and keep it together Can I through the Clarion and through influence outside the House coerce the men in the House If so we can do something and Lady Cradock will no longer throw me her smiles If not the game is up both for me and for them They have no cohesion no common information no real power Without leaders they are a mere set of half educated firebrands whom the trained mind of the country humours because it must and so far as they have brute force behind them Without leadership I am a mere unit of the weakest group in the House Yet by Jove it looks as though I had not the gifts And he looked back with passionate chagrin on the whole course of his connection with Wilkins his unavailing concessions and small humiliations his belief in his own tact and success all the time that the man dealt with was really slipping out of his hands Damn the fellow he said at last flinging his cigarette away Well that s done with All the same he would have liked that Midland job He has been hankering after a strike there for some time and might have ranted as he pleased I shall have the satisfaction of informing him he has lost his opportunity Now then who to send By Jove what about Miss Boyce s friend He stood a moment twisting the quill pen he had taken up then he hastily found a sheet of paper and wrote Dear Miss Boyce It is more than a year since I have heard of you and I have been wondering with much interest lately whether you have really taken up a nursing life You remember speaking to me of your friends the Cravens I come across them sometimes at the Venturist meetings and have always admired their ability Last year I could do nothing practical to meet your wishes This year however there is an opening on the Clarion and I should like to discuss it with you Are you in town or to be found I could come any afternoon next week early I go down to the House at four or on Saturdays But I should like it to be Tuesday or Wednesday that I might try and persuade you to come to our Eight Hours debate on Friday night It would interest you and I think I could get you a seat We Labour members are like the Irishmen we can always get our friends in I must send this round by Mellor so it may not reach you till Tuesday Perhaps you will kindly telegraph The Clarion matter is pressing Yours sincerely H S WHARTON When he had finished he lingered a moment over the letter the play of conflicting motives and memories bringing a vague smile to the lips Reverie however was soon dispersed He recollected his other correspondents and springing up he began to pace his room gloomily thinking over his money difficulties which were many He and his mother had always been in want of money ever since he could remember Lady Mildred would spend huge sums on her various crotchets and campaigns and then subside for six months into wretched lodgings in a back street of Southsea or Worthing while the Suffolk house was let and her son mostly went abroad This perpetual worry of needy circumstances had always indeed sat lightly on Wharton He was unmarried and so far scarcity had generally passed into temporary comfort before he had time to find it intolerable But now the whole situation was becoming more serious In the first place his subscriptions and obligations as a member of Parliament and as one of the few propertied persons in a moneyless movement were considerable Whatever Socialism might make of money in the future he was well aware that money in the present was no less useful to a Socialist politician than to any one else In the next place the starting and pushing of the Clarion newspaper originally purchased by the help of a small legacy from an uncle had enormously increased the scale of his money transactions and the risks of life How was it that with all his efforts the Clarion was not making but losing money During the three years he had possessed it he had raised it from the position of a small and foul mouthed print indifferently nourished on a series of small scandals to that of a Labour organ of some importance He had written a weekly signed article for it which had served from the beginning to bring both him and the paper into notice he had taken pains with the organisation and improvement of the staff above all he had spent a great deal more money upon it in the way of premises and appliances than he had been as it turned out in any way justified in spending Hence indeed these tears Rather more than a year before while the Clarion was still enjoying a first spurt of success and notoriety he had with a certain recklessness which belonged to his character invested in new and costly machinery and had transferred the paper to larger offices All this had been done on borrowed money Then for some reason or other the Clarion had ceased to answer to the spur had indeed during the past eight months been flagging heavily The outside world was beginning to regard the Clarion as an important paper Wharton knew all the time that its advertisements were falling off and its circulation declining Why Who can say If it is true that books have their fates it is still more true of newspapers Was it that a collectivist paper the rival organ mentioned by Wilkins recently started by a group of young and outrageously clever Venturists and more closely in touch than the Clarion with two or three of the great unions had filched the Clarion s ground Or was it simply that as Wharton put it to himself in moments of rage and despondency the majority of working men are either sots or block heads and will read and support nothing but the low racing or police court news which is all their intelligences deserve Few people had at the bottom of their souls a more scornful distrust of the masses than the man whose one ambition at the present moment was to be the accepted leader of English labour Finally his private expenditure had always been luxurious and he was liable it will be seen to a kind of debt that is not easily kept waiting On the whole his bankers had behaved to him with great indulgence He fretted and fumed turning over plan after plan as he walked his curly head sunk in his shoulders his hands behind his back Presently he stopped absently in front of the inner wall of the room where above a heavy rosewood bookcase brought from his Lincolnshire house a number of large framed photographs were hung close together His eye caught one and brightened With an impatient gesture like that of a reckless boy he flung his thoughts away from him If ever the game becomes too tiresome here why the next steamer will take me out of it What a gorgeous time we had on that glacier He stood looking at a splendid photograph of a glacier in the Thibetan Himalayas where in the year following his mother s death he had spent four months with an exploring party The plate had caught the very grain and glisten of the snow the very sheen and tint of the ice He could feel the azure of the sky the breath of the mountain wind The man seated on the ladder over that bottomless crevasse was himself And there were the guides two from Chamounix one from Grindelwald and that fine young fellow the son of the elder Chamounix guide whom they had lost by a stone shower on that nameless peak towering to the left of the glacier Ah those had been years of life those Wanderjahre He ran over the photographs with a kind of greed his mind meanwhile losing itself in covetous memories of foamy seas of long low tropical shores with their scattered palms of superb rivers sweeping with sound and fury round innumerable islands of great buildings ivory white amid the wealth of creepers which had pulled them into ruin vacant now for ever of the voice of man and ringed by untrodden forests Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay he thought Ah but how much did the man who wrote that know about Cathay And with his hands thrust into his pockets he stood lost awhile in a flying dream that defied civilisation and its cares How well how indispensable to remember that beyond these sweltering streets where we choke and swarm Cathay stands always waiting Somewhere while we toil in the gloom and the crowd there is air there is sea the joy of the sun the life of the body so good so satisfying This interminable ethical or economical battle these struggles selfish or altruistic in which we shout ourselves hoarse to no purpose why they could be shaken off at a moment s notice However he turned on his heel suppose we try a few other trifles first What time those fellows won t have gone to bed yet He took out his watch then extinguished his candles and made his way to the street A hundred yards or so away from his own door he stopped before a well known fashionable club extremely small and extremely select where his mother s brother the peer of the family had introduced him when he was young and tender and his mother s relations still cherished hopes of snatching him as a brand from the burning The front rooms of the club were tolerably full still He passed on to the back A door keeper stationed in the passage stepped back and silently opened a door It closed instantly behind him and Wharton found himself in a room with some twenty other young fellows playing baccarat piles of shining money on the tables the electric lamps hung over each lighting every detail of the scene with the same searching disenchanting glare I say cried a young dark haired fellow like a dishevelled Lord Byron Here comes the Labour leader make room And amid laughter and chaffing he was drawn down to the baccarat table where a new deal was just beginning He felt in his pockets for money his eyes intent and shining followed every motion of the dealer s hand For three years now ever since his return from his travels the gambler s passion had been stealing on him Already this season he had lost and won on the whole lost large sums And the fact was so far absolutely unknown except to the men with whom he played in this room CHAPTER III If yer goin downstairs Nuss you d better take that there scuttle with yer for the coals is gittin low an it ull save yer a journey Marcella looked with amusement at her adviser a small bandy legged boy in shirt and knickerbockers with black Jewish eyes in a strongly featured face He stood leaning on the broom he had just been wielding his sleeves rolled up to the shoulder showing his tiny arms his expression sharp and keen as a hawk s Well Benny then you look after your mother while I m gone and don t let any one in but the doctor And Marcella turned for an instant towards the bed whereon lay a sick woman too feeble apparently to speak or move I aint a goin ter said the boy shortly beginning to sweep again with energy an if this ere baby cries give it the bottle I s pose No certainly not said Marcella firmly it has just had one You sweep away Benny and let the baby alone Benny looked a trifle wounded but recovered himself immediately and ran a general s eye over Marcella who was just about to leave the room Now look ere Nuss he said in a tone of pitying remonstrance yer never a goin down to that ere coal cellar without a light Yer ll ave to come runnin up all them stairs again sure as I m alive yer will And darting to a cupboard he pulled out a grimy candlestick with an end of dip and some matches disposed of them at the bottom of the coal scuttle that Marcella carried over her left arm and then still masterfully considering her let her go Marcella groped her way downstairs The house was one of a type familiar all over the poorer parts of West Central London the eighteenth century house inhabited by law or fashion in the days of doctor Johnson now parcelled out into insanitary tenements miserably provided with air water and all the necessaries of life but still showing in its chimney piece or its decaying staircase signs of the graceful domestic art which had ruled at the building and fitting of it Marcella however had no eye whatever at the moment for the panelling on the staircase or the delicate ironwork of the broken balustrade Rather it seemed to her as she looked into some of the half open doors of the swarming rooms she passed or noticed with disgust the dirt and dilapidation of the stairs and the evil smells of the basement that the house added one more to the standing shames of the district an opinion doubly strong in her when at last she emerged from her gropings among the dens of the lower regions and began to toil upstairs again with her filled kettle and coal scuttle The load was heavy even for her young strength and she had just passed a sleepless night The evening before she had been sent for in haste to a woman in desperate illness She came and found a young Jewess with a ten days old child beside her struggling with her husband and two women friends in a state of raging delirium The room was full to suffocation of loud tongued large eyed Jewesses all taking turns at holding the patient and chattering or quarrelling between their turns It had been Marcella s first and arduous duty to get the place cleared and she had done it without ever raising her voice or losing her temper for an instant The noisy pack had been turned out the most competent woman among them chosen to guard the door and fetch and carry for the nurse while Marcella set to work to wash her patient and remake the bed as best she could in the midst of the poor thing s wild shrieks and wrestlings It was a task to test both muscular strength and moral force to their utmost After her year s training Marcella took it simply in the day s work Some hours of intense effort and strain then she and the husband looked down upon the patient a woman of about six and twenty plunged suddenly in narcotic sleep her matted black hair which Marcella had not dared to touch lying in wild waves on the clean bed clothes and night gear that her nurse had extracted from this neighbour and that she could hardly have told how Ach mein Gott mein Gott said the husband rising and shaking himself He was a Jew from German Poland and unlike most of his race a huge man with the make and the muscles of a prize fighter Yet after the struggle of the last two hours he was in a bath of perspiration You will have to send her to the infirmary if this comes on again said Marcella The husband stared in helpless misery first at his wife then at the nurse You will not go away mees he implored you will not leaf me alone Wearied as she was Marcella could have smiled at the abject giant No I will stay with her till the morning and till the doctor comes You had better go to bed It was close on three o clock The man demurred a little but he was in truth too worn out to resist He went into the back room and lay down with the children Then Marcella was left through the long summer dawn alone with her patient Her quick ear caught every sound about her the heavy breaths of the father and children in the back room the twittering of the sparrows the first cries about the streets the first movements in the crowded house Her mind all the time was running partly on contrivances for pulling the woman through for it was what a nurse calls a good case one that rouses all her nursing skill and faculty partly on the extraordinary misconduct of the doctor to whose criminal neglect and mismanagement of the case she hotly attributed the whole of the woman s illness and partly in deep swift sinkings of meditative thought on the strangeness of the fact that she should be there at all sitting in this chair in this miserable room keeping guard over this Jewish mother and her child The year in hospital had rushed dreamless sleep by night exhausting fatigue of mind and body by day A hospital nurse if her work seizes her as it had seized Marcella never thinks of herself Now for some six or seven weeks she had been living in rooms as a district nurse under the control of a central office and superintendent Her work lay in the homes of the poor and was of the most varied kind The life was freer more elastic allowed room at last to self consciousness But now the night was over The husband had gone off to work at a factory near whence he could be summoned at any moment the children had been disposed of to missus Levi the helpful neighbour she herself had been home for an hour to breakfast and dress had sent to the office asking that her other cases might be attended to and was at present in sole charge with Benny to help her waiting for the doctor When she reached the sick room again with her burdens she found Benjamin sitting pensive with the broom across his knees Well Benny she said as she entered how have you got on Yer can t move the dirt on them boards with sweepin said Benny looking at them with disgust an I ain t a goin to try it no more You re about right there Benny said Marcella mournfully as she inspected them well we ll get missus Levi to come in and scrub as soon as your mother can bear it She stepped up to the bed and looked at her patient who seemed to be passing into a state of restless prostration more or less under the influence of morphia Marcella fed her with strong beef tea made by herself during the night and debated whether she should give brandy No either the doctor would come directly or she would send for him She had not seen him yet and her lip curled at the thought of him He had ordered a nurse the night before but had not stayed to meet her and Marcella had been obliged to make out his instructions from the husband as best she could Benny looked up at her with a wink as she went back to the fire I didn t let none o them in he said jerking his thumb over his shoulder They come a whisperin at the door an a rattlin ov the handle as soon as ever you gone downstairs But I tole em just to take theirselves off an as ow you didn t want em Sillies And taking a crust smeared with treacle out of his pocket Benny returned with a severe air to the sucking of it Marcella laughed Clever Benny she said patting his head but why aren t you at school sir Benjamin grinned Ow d yer s pose my ma s goin to git along without me to do for er and the babby he replied slily Well Benny you ll have the Board officer down on you At this the urchin laughed out Why e wor here last week Ee can t be troublin isself about this ere bloomin street ev ery day in the week There was a sharp knock at the door The doctor she said as her face dismissed the frolic brightness which had stolen upon it for a moment Run away Benny Benny opened the door looked the doctor coolly up and down and then withdrew to the landing where his sisters were waiting to play with him The doctor a tall man of thirty with a red blurred face and a fair moustache walked in hurriedly and stared at the nurse standing by the fire You come from the saint Martin s Association Marcella stiffly replied He took her temperature chart from her hand and asked her some questions about the night staring at her from time to time with eyes that displeased her Presently she came to an account of the condition in which she had found her patient The edge on the words for all their professional quiet was unmistakable She saw him flush He moved towards the bed and she went with him The woman moaned as he approached her He set about his business with hands that shook Marcella decided at once that he was not sober and watched his proceedings with increasing disgust and amazement Presently she could bear it no longer I think she said touching his arm that you had better leave it to me and go away He drew himself up with a start which sent the things he held flying and faced her fiercely What do you mean he said don t you know your place The girl was very white but her eyes were scornfully steady Yes I know my place Then with a composure as fearless as it was scathing she said what she had to say She knew and he could not deny that he had endangered his patient s life She pointed out that he was in a fair way to endanger it again Every word she said lay absolutely within her sphere as a nurse His cloudy brain cleared under the stress of it Then his eyes flamed his cheeks became purple and Marcella thought for an instant he would have struck her Finally he turned down his shirt cuffs and walked away You understand he said thickly turning upon her with his hat in his hand that I shall not attend this case again till your Association can send me a nurse that will do as she is told without insolence to the doctor I shall now write a report to your superintendent As you please said Marcella quietly And she went to the door and opened it He passed her sneering A precious superior lot you lady nurses think yourselves I dare say I d sooner have one old gamp than the whole boiling of you Marcella eyed him sternly her nostrils tightening Will you go she said He gave her a furious glance and plunged down the stairs outside breathing threats Marcella put her hand to her head a moment and drew a long breath There was a certain piteousness in the action a consciousness of youth and strain Then she saw that the landing and the stairs above were beginning to fill with dark haired Jewesses eagerly peering and talking In another minute or two she would be besieged by them She called sharply Benny Instantly Benny appeared from the landing above elbowing the Jewesses to right and left What is it you want Nuss No she don t want none o you there And Benjamin darted into the room and would have slammed the door in all their faces but that Marcella said to him Let in missus Levi please The kind neighbour who had been taking care of the children was admitted and then the key was turned Marcella scribbled a line on a half sheet of paper and with careful directions despatched Benny with it I have sent for a new doctor she explained still frowning and white to missus Levi That one was not fit The woman s olive skinned face lightened all over Thanks to the Lord she said throwing up her hands But how in the world did you do t miss There isn t a single soul in this house that doesn t go all of a tremble at the sight of im Yet all the women has im when they re ill bound to They thinks he must be clever cos he s such a brute I do believe sometimes it s that He is a brute Marcella was bending over her patient trying so far as she could to set her straight and comfortable again But the woman had begun to mutter once more words in a strange dialect that Marcella did not understand and could no longer be kept still The temperature was rising again and another fit of delirium was imminent Marcella could only hope that she and missus Levi between them would be able to hold her till the doctor came When she had done all that was in her power she sat beside the poor tossing creature controlling and calming her as best she could while missus Levi poured into her shrinking ear the story of the woman s illness and of doctor Blank s conduct of it Marcella s feeling as she listened was made up of that old agony of rage and pity The sufferings of the poor because they were poor these things often still darkened earth and heaven for her That wretch would have been quite capable no doubt of conducting himself decently and even competently if he had been called to some supposed lady in one of the well to do squares which made the centre of this poor and crowded district Hullo nurse said a cheery voice you seem to have got a bad case The sound was as music in Marcella s ears The woman she held was fast becoming unmanageable had just shrieked first for poison then for a knife to kill herself with and could hardly be prevented by the combined strength of her nurse and missus Levi now from throwing herself madly out of bed and now from tearing out her black hair in handfuls The doctor a young Scotchman with spectacles and stubbly red beard came quickly up to the bed asked Marcella a few short questions shrugged his shoulders over her dry report of doctor Blank s proceedings then took out a black case from his pocket and put his morphia syringe together For a long time no result whatever could be obtained by any treatment The husband was sent for and came trembling imploring doctor and nurse in the intervals of his wife s paroxysms not to leave him alone Marcella absorbed in the tragic horror of the case took no note of the passage of time Everything that the doctor suggested she carried out with a deftness a tenderness a power of mind which keenly affected his professional sense Once the poor mother left unguarded for an instant struck out with a wild right hand The blow caught Marcella on the cheek and she drew back with a slight involuntary cry You are hurt said doctor Angus running up to her No no she said smiling through the tears that the shock had called into her eyes and putting him rather impatiently aside it is nothing You said you wanted some fresh ice And she went into the back room to get it The doctor stood with his hands in his pockets studying the patient You will have to send her to the infirmary he said to the husband there is nothing else for it Marcella came back with the ice and was able to apply it to the head The patient was quieter was in fact now groaning herself into a fresh period of exhaustion The doctor s sharp eyes took note of the two figures the huddled creature on the pillows and the stately head bending over her with the delicately hollowed cheek whereon the marks of those mad fingers stood out red and angry He had already had experience of this girl in one or two other cases Well he said taking up his hat it is no good shilly shallying I will go and find doctor Swift doctor Swift was the parish doctor When he had gone the big husband broke down and cried with his head against the iron of the bed close to his wife He put his great hand on hers and talked to her brokenly in their own patois They had been eight years married and she had never had a day s serious illness till now Marcella s eyes filled with tears as she moved about the room doing various little tasks At last she went up to him Won t you go and have some dinner she said to him kindly There s Benjamin calling you and she pointed to the door of the back room where stood Benny his face puckered with weeping forlornly holding out a plate of fried fish in the hope of attracting his father s attention The man who in spite of his size and strength was in truth childishly soft and ductile went as he was bid and Marcella and missus Levi set about doing what they could to prepare the wife for her removal Presently parish doctor and sanitary inspector appeared strange and peremptory invaders who did but add to the terror and misery of the husband Then at last came the ambulance and doctor Angus with it The patient now once more plunged in narcotic stupor was carried downstairs by two male nurses doctor Angus presiding Marcella stood in the doorway and watched the scene the gradual disappearance of the helpless form on the stretcher with its fevered face under the dark mat of hair the figures of the straining men heavily descending step by step their heads and shoulders thrown out against the dirty drabs and browns of the staircase the crowd of Jewesses on the stairs and landing craning their necks gesticulating and talking so that doctor Angus could hardly make his directions heard angrily as he bade them stand back and on the top stair the big husband following the form of his departing and unconscious wife with his eyes his face convulsed with weeping the whimpering children clinging about his knees How hot it was how stifling the staircase smelt and how the sun beat down from that upper window on the towzled unkempt women with their large eyed children CHAPTER IV Marcella on her way home turned into a little street leading to a great block of model dwellings which rose on the right hand side and made everything else the mews entrance opposite the lines of squalid shops on either side look particularly small and dirty The sun was beating fiercely down and she was sick and tired As she entered the iron gate of the dwellings and saw before her the large asphalted court round which they ran blazing heat on one side of it and on the other some children playing cricket against the wall with chalk marks for wickets she was seized with depression The tall yet mean buildings the smell of dust and heat the general impression of packed and crowded humanity these things instead of offering her rest only continued and accented the sense of strain called for more endurance more making the best of it But she found a tired smile for some of the children who ran up to her and then she climbed the stairs of the E block and opened the door of her own tenement number ten In number nine lived Minta Hurd and her children who had joined Marcella in London some two months before In sets seven and eight on either side of Marcella and the Hurds lived two widows each with a family who were mostly out charing during the day Marcella s Association allowed its District Nurses to live outside the home of the district on certain conditions which had been fulfilled in Marcella s case by her settlement next door to her old friends in these buildings which were inhabited by a very respectable though poor class Meanwhile the trustees of the buildings had allowed her to make a temporary communication between her room and the Hurds so that she could either live her own solitary and independent life or call for their companionship as she pleased As she shut her door behind her she found herself in a little passage or entry To the left was her bedroom Straight in front of her was the living room with a small close range in it and behind it a little back kitchen The living room was cheerful and even pretty Her art student s training showed itself The cheap blue and white paper the couple of oak flap tables from a broker s shop in Marchmont Street the two or three cane chairs with their bright chintz cushions the Indian rug or two on the varnished boards the photographs and etchings on the walls the books on the tables there was not one of these things that was not in its degree a pleasure to her young senses that did not help her to live her life This afternoon as she opened the door and looked in the pretty colours and forms in the tiny room were as water to the thirsty Her mother had sent her some flowers the day before There they were on the tables great bunches of honey suckles of blue bells and Banksia roses And over the mantelpiece was a photograph of the place where such flowers as Mellor possessed mostly grew the unkempt lawn the old fountain and grey walls of the Cedar Garden The green blind over the one window which looked into the court had been drawn down against the glare of the sun as though by a careful hand Beside a light wooden rocking chair which was Marcella s favourite seat a tray of tea things had been put out Marcella drew a long breath of comfort as she put down her bag Now can I wait for my tea till I have washed and dressed She argued with herself an instant as though she had been a greedy child then going swiftly into the back kitchen she opened the door between her rooms and the Hurds Minta A voice responded Minta make me some tea and boil an egg there s a good soul I will be back directly And in ten minutes or so she came back again into the sitting room daintily fresh and clean but very pale She had taken off her nurse s dress and apron and had put on something loose and white that hung about her in cool folds But Minta Hurd who had just brought in the tea looked at her disapprovingly Whatever are you so late for she asked a little peevishly You ll get ill if you go missing your dinner I couldn t help it Minta it was such a bad case missus Hurd poured out the tea in silence unappeased Her mind was constantly full of protest against this nursing Why should Miss Boyce do such funny things why should she live as she did at all Their relation to each other was a curious one Marcella knowing that the life of Hurd s widow at Mellor was gall and bitterness had sent for her at the moment that she herself was leaving the hospital offering her a weekly sum in return for a little cooking and house service Minta already possessed a weekly pension coming from a giver unknown to her It was regularly handed to her by mister Harden and she could only imagine that one of the gentlemen who had belonged to the Hurd Reprieve Committee and had worked so hard for Jim was responsible for it out of pity for her and her children The payment offered her by Miss Boyce would defray the expense of London house rent the children s schooling and leave a trifle over Moreover she was pining to get away from Mellor Her first instinct after her husband s execution had been to hide herself from all the world But for a long time her precarious state of health and her dependence first on Marcella then on Mary Harden made it impossible for her to leave the village It was not till Marcella s proposal came that her way was clear She sold her bits of things at once took her children and went up to Brown s buildings Marcella met her with the tenderness the tragic tremor of feeling from which the peasant s wife shrank anew bewildered as she had often shrunk from it in the past Jim s fate had made her an old woman at thirty two She was now a little shrivelled consumptive creature with almost white hair and a face from which youth had gone unless perhaps there were some traces of it in the still charming eyes and small open mouth But these changes had come upon her she knew not why as the result of blows she felt but had never reasoned about Marcella s fixed mode of conceiving her and her story caused her from the beginning of their fresh acquaintance a dumb irritation and trouble she could never have explained It was so tragic reflective exacting It seemed to ask of her feelings that she could not have to expect from her expression that was impossible And it stood also between her and the friends and distractions that she would like to have Why shouldn t that queer man mister Strozzi who lived down below and whose name she could not pronounce come and sit sometimes of an evening and amuse her and the children He was a Professor of Elocution and said and sung comic pieces He was very civil and obliging too she liked him Yet Miss Boyce was evidently astonished that she could make friends with him and Minta perfectly understood the lift of her dark eyebrows whenever she came in and found him sitting there Meanwhile Marcella had expected her with emotion and had meant through this experiment to bring herself truly near to the poor Minta must not call her Miss Boyce but by her name which however Minta reddening had declared she could never do Her relation to Marcella was not to be that of servant in any sense but of friend and sister and on her and her children Marcella had spent from the beginning a number of new womanish wiles which strangely enough this hard strenuous life had been developing in her She would come and help put the children to bed she would romp with them in their night gowns she would bend her imperious head over the anxious endeavour to hem a pink cotton pinafore for Daisy or dress a doll for the baby But the relation jarred and limped perpetually and Marcella wistfully thought it her fault Just now however as she sat gently swaying backwards and forwards in the rocking chair enjoying her tea her mood was one of nothing but content Oh Minta give me another cup I want to have a sleep so badly and then I am going to see Miss Hallin and stay to supper with them Well you mustn t go out in them nursin things again said Minta quickly I ve put you in some lace in your black dress an it looks beautiful Oh thank you Minta but that black dress always seems to me too smart to walk about these streets in It s just nice said Minta with decision It s just what everybody that knows you what your mamma would like to see you in I can t abide them nursin clothes nasty things I declare cried Marcella laughing but outraged I never like myself so well in anything Minta was silent but her small mouth took an obstinate look What she really felt was that it was absurd for ladies to wear caps and aprons and plain black bonnets when there was no need for them to do anything of the kind Whatever have you been doing to your cheek she exclaimed suddenly as Marcella handed her the empty cup to take away Marcella explained shortly and Minta looked more discontented than ever A lot of low people as ought to look after themselves that was how in her inmost mind she generally defined Marcella s patients She had been often kind and soft to her neighbours at Mellor but these dirty crowded Londoners were another matter Where is Daisy asked Marcella as Minta was going away with the tea she must have come back from school Here I am said Daisy with a grin peeping in through the door of the back kitchen Mother baby s woke up Come here you monkey said Marcella come and go to sleep with me Have you had your tea Yes lots said Daisy climbing up into Marcella s lap Are you going to be asleep a long time No only a nap Oh Daisy I m so tired Come and cuddlie a bit If you don t go to sleep you know you can slip away I shan t wake The child a slight red haired thing with something of the ethereal charm that her dead brother had possessed settled herself on Marcella s knees slipped her left thumb into her mouth and flung her other arm round Marcella s neck They had often gone to sleep so missus Hurd came back drew down the blind further threw a light shawl over them both and left them An hour and a half later Minta came in again as she had been told Daisy had slipped away but Marcella was still lying in the perfect gentleness and relaxation of sleep You said I was to come and wake you said Minta drawing up the blind but I don t believe you re a bit fit to be going about Here s some hot water and there s a letter just come Marcella woke with a start Minta put the letter on her knee and dream and reality flowed together as she saw her own name in Wharton s handwriting She read the letter then sat flushed and thinking for a while with her hands on her knees A little while later she opened the Hurds front door Minta I am going now I shall be back early after supper for I haven t written my report There now you look something like said Minta scanning her approvingly the wide hat and pretty black dress Shall Daisy run out with that telegram No thanks I shall pass the post Good bye And she stooped and kissed the little withered woman She wished ardently wished that Minta would be more truly friends with her After a brisk walk through the June evening she stopped still within the same district at the door of a house in a long old fashioned street wherein the builder was busy on either hand since most of the long leases had just fallen in But the house she entered was still untouched She climbed a last century staircase adorned with panels of stucco work slender Italianate reliefs of wreaths ribbons and medallions on a pale green ground The decoration was clean and cared for the house in good order Eighty years ago it was the home of a famous judge who entertained in its rooms the legal and literary celebrities of his day Now it was let out to professional people in lodgings or unfurnished rooms Edward Hallin and his sister occupied the top floor Miss Hallin a pleasant looking plain woman of about thirty five came at once in answer to Marcella s knock and greeted her affectionately Edward Hallin sprang up from a table at the further end of the room You are so late Alice and I had made up our minds you had forgotten us I didn t get home till four and then I had to have a sleep she explained half shyly What you haven t been night nursing Yes for once Alice tell them to bring up supper and let s look after her He wheeled round a comfortable chair to the open window the charming circular bow of last century design which filled up the end of the room and gave it character The window looked out on a quiet line of back gardens such as may still be seen in Bloomsbury with fine plane trees here and there just coming into full leaf and beyond them the backs of another line of houses in a distant square with pleasant irregularities of old brickwork and tiled roof The mottled trunks of the planes their blackened twigs and branches their thin beautiful leaves the forms of the houses beyond rose in a charming medley of line against the blue and peaceful sky No near sound was to be heard only the distant murmur that no Londoner escapes and some of the British Museum pigeons were sunning themselves on the garden wall below Within the Hallins room was spacious and barely furnished The walls indeed were crowded with books and broken where the books ceased by photographs of Italy and Greece but of furniture proper there seemed to be little beside Hallin s large writing table facing the window and a few chairs placed on the blue drugget which brother and sister had chosen with a certain anxiety dreading secretly lest it should be a piece of self indulgence to buy what pleased them both so much On one side of the fireplace was Miss Hallin s particular corner her chair the table that held her few special books her work basket with its knitting her accounts There in the intervals of many activities she sat and worked or read always cheerful and busy and always watching over her brother I wish said Hallin with some discontent when Marcella had settled herself that we were going to be alone to night that would have rested you more Why who is coming said Marcella a little flatly She had certainly hoped to find them alone Your old friend Frank Leven is coming to supper When he heard you were to be here he vowed that nothing could or should keep him away Then after supper one or two people asked if they might come in There are some anxious things going on He leant his head on his hand for a moment with a sigh then forcibly wrenched himself from what were evidently recurrent thoughts Do tell me some more of what you are doing he said bending forward to her You don t know how much I have thought of what you have told me already I m doing just the same she said laughing Don t take so much interest in it It s the fashion just now to admire nurses but it s ridiculous We do our work like other people sometimes badly sometimes well And some of us wouldn t do it if we could help it She threw out the last words with a certain vehemence as though eager to get away from any sentimentalism about herself Hallin studied her kindly Is this miscellaneous work a relief to you after hospital he asked For the present It is more exciting and one sees more character But there are drawbacks In hospital everything was settled for you every hour was full and there were always orders to follow And the off times were no trouble I never did anything else but walk up and down the Embankment if it was fine or go to the National Gallery if it was wet And it was the monotony you liked She made a sign of assent Strange said Hallin who could ever have foreseen it She flushed You might have foreseen it I think she said not without a little impatience But I didn t like it all at once I hated a great deal of it If they had let me alone all the time to scrub and polish and wash the things they set me to at first I thought I should have been quite happy To see my table full of glasses without a spot and my brass taps shining made me as proud as a peacock But then of course I had to learn the real work and that was very odd at first How Morally She nodded laughing at her own remembrances Yes it seemed to me all topsy turvy I thought the Sister at the head of the ward rather a stupid person If I had seen her at Mellor I shouldn t have spoken two words to her And here she was ordering me about rating me as I had never rated a house maid laughing at me for not knowing this or that and generally making me feel that a raw probationer was one of the things of least account in the whole universe I knew perfectly well that she had said to herself Now then I must take that proud girl down a peg or she will be no use to anybody and I had somehow to put up with it Drastic said Hallin laughing did you comfort yourself by reflecting that it was everybody s fate Her lip twitched with amusement Not for a long time I used to have the most absurd ideas sometimes looking back I can hardly believe it perhaps it was partly a queer state of nerves When I was at school and got in a passion I used to try and overawe the girls by shaking my Speaker great uncle in their faces And so in hospital it would flash across me sometimes in a plaintive sort of way that they couldn t know that I was Miss Boyce of Mellor and had been mothering and ruling the whole of my father s village or they wouldn t treat me so Mercifully I held my tongue But one day it came to a crisis I had had to get things ready for an operation and had done very well doctor Marshall had paid me even a little compliment all to myself But then afterwards the patient was some time in coming to and there had to be hot water bottles I had them ready of course but they were too hot and in my zeal and nervousness I burnt the patient s elbow in two places Oh the fuss and the scolding and the humiliation When I left the ward that evening I thought I would go home next day But you didn t If I could have sat down and thought it out I should probably have gone But I couldn t think it out I was too dead tired That is the chief feature of your first months in hospital the utter helpless fatigue at night You go to bed aching and you wake up aching If you are healthy as I was it doesn t hurt you but when your time comes to sleep sleep you must Even that miserable night my head was no sooner on the pillow than I was asleep and next morning there was all the routine as usual and the dread of being a minute late on duty Then when I got into the ward the Sister looked at me rather queerly and went out of her way to be kind to me Oh I was so grateful to her I could have brushed her boots or done any other menial service for her with delight And then somehow I pulled through The enormous interest of the work seized me I grew ambitious they pushed me on rapidly everybody seemed suddenly to become my friend instead of my enemy and I ended by thinking the hospital the most fascinating and engrossing place in the whole world A curious experience said Hallin I suppose you had never obeyed any one in your life before Not since I was at school and then not much Hallin glanced at her as she lay back in her chair How richly human the face had grown It was as forcible as ever in expression and colour but that look which had often repelled him in his first acquaintance with her as of a hard speculative eagerness more like the ardent boy than the woman had very much disappeared It seemed to him absorbed in something new something sad and yet benignant informed with all the pathos and the pain of growth How long have you been at work to day he asked her I went at eleven last night I came away at four this afternoon Hallin exclaimed You had food Do you think I should let myself starve with my work to do she asked him with a shade of scorn and her most professional air And don t suppose that such a case occurs often It is a very rare thing for us to undertake night nursing at all Can you tell me what the case was She told him vaguely describing also in a few words her encounter with doctor Blank I suppose he will make a fuss she said with a restless look and that I shall be blamed I should think your second doctor will take care of that said Hallin I don t know I couldn t help it But it is one of our first principles not to question a doctor And last week too I got the Association into trouble A patient I had been nursing for weeks and got quite fond of had to be removed to hospital She asked me to cut her hair It was matted dreadfully and would have been cut off directly she got to the ward So I cut it left her all comfortable and was to come back at one to meet the doctor and help get her off When I came I found the whole court in an uproar The sister of the woman who had been watching for me stood on the doorstep and implored me to go away The husband had gone out of his senses with rage because I had cut his wife s hair without his consent He ll murder you Nuss said the sister if he sees you Don t come in he s mad he s been going round on is ands and knees on the floor Hallin interrupted with a shout of laughter Marcella laughed too but to his amazement he saw that her hand shook and that there were tears in her eyes It s all very well she said with a sigh but I had to come away in disgrace all the street looking on And he made such a fuss at the office as never was It was unfortunate we don t want the people set against the nurses And now doctor Blank I seem to be always getting into scrapes It is different from hospital where everything is settled for one Hallin could hardly believe his ears Such womanish terrors and depressions from Marcella Boyce Was she after all too young for the work or was there some fret of the soul reducing her natural force He felt an unwonted impulse of tenderness towards her such as one might feel towards a tired child and set himself to cheer and rest her He had succeeded to some extent when he saw her give a little start and following her eyes he perceived that unconsciously his arm which was resting on the table had pushed into her view a photograph in a little frame which had been hitherto concealed from her by a glass of flowers He would have quietly put it out of sight again but she sat up in her chair Will you give it me she said putting out her hand He gave it her at once Alice brought it home from Miss Raeburn the other day His aunt made him sit to one of the photographers who are always besieging public men We thought it good It is very good she said after a pause Is the hair really as grey as that She pointed to it Quite I am very glad that he is going off with Lord Maxwell to Italy It will be ten days break for him at any rate His work this last year has been very heavy He has had his grandfather s to do really as well as his own and this Commission has been a stiff job too I am rather sorry that he has taken this new post What post Didn t you hear They have made him Under secretary to the Home Department So that he is now in the Government She put back the photograph and moved her chair a little so as to see more of the plane trees and the strips of sunset cloud How is Lord Maxwell she asked presently Much changed It might end in a sudden break up at any time Hallin saw a slight contraction pass over her face He knew that she had always felt an affection for Lord Maxwell Suddenly Marcella looked hastily round her Miss Hallin was busy with a little servant at the other end of the room making arrangements for supper Tell me she said bending over the arm of her chair and speaking in a low eager voice he is beginning to forget it Hallin looked at her in silence but his half sad half ironic smile suggested an answer from which she turned away If he only would she said speaking almost to herself with a kind of impatience He ought to marry for everybody s sake I see no sign of his marrying at present said Hallin drily He began to put some papers under his hand in order There was a cold dignity in his manner which she perfectly understood Ever since that day that never forgotten day when he had come to her the morning after her last interview with Aldous Raeburn come with reluctance and dislike because Aldous had asked it of him and had gone away her friend more drawn to her more touched by her than he had ever been in the days of the engagement their relation on this subject had been the same His sweetness and kindness to her his influence over her life during the past eighteen months had been very great In that first interview the object of which had been to convey to her a warning on the subject of the man it was thought she might allow herself to marry something in the manner with which he had attempted his incredibly difficult task its simplicity its delicate respect for her personality its suggestion of a character richer and saintlier than anything she had yet known and unconsciously revealing itself under the stress of emotion this something had suddenly broken down his pale proud companion had to his own great dismay brought her to tears and to such confidences such indirect askings for help and understanding as amazed them both Experiences of this kind were not new to him His life consecrated to ideas devoted to the wresting of the maximum of human service from a crippling physical weakness the precarious health itself which cut him off from a hundred ordinary amusements and occupations and especially cut him off from marriage together with the ardent temperament the charm the imaginative insight which had been his cradle gifts these things ever since he was a lad had made him again and again the guide and prop of natures stronger and stormier than his own Often the unwilling guide for he had the half impatient breathless instincts of the man who has set himself a task and painfully doubts whether he will have power and time to finish it The claims made upon him seemed to him often to cost him physical and brain energy he could ill spare But his quick tremulous sympathy rendered him really a defenceless prey in such matters Marcella threw herself upon him as others had done and there was no help for it Since their first memorable interview at long intervals he had written to her and she to him Of her hospital life till to night she had never told him much Her letters had been the passionate outpourings of a nature sick of itself and for the moment of living full of explanations which really explained little full too of the untaught pangs and questionings of a mind which had never given any sustained or exhaustive effort to any philosophical or social question and yet was in a sense tortured by them all athirst for an impossible justice and aflame for ideals mocked first and above all by the writer s own weakness and defect Hallin had felt them interesting sad and in a sense fine but he had never braced himself to answer them without groans There were so many other people in the world in the same plight Nevertheless all through the growth of friendship one thing had never altered between them from the beginning Hallin s irrevocable judgment of the treatment she had bestowed on Aldous Raeburn Never throughout the whole course of their acquaintance had he expressed that judgment to her in so many words Notwithstanding she knew perfectly well both the nature and the force of it It lay like a rock in the stream of their friendship The currents of talk might circle round it imply it glance off from it they left it unchanged At the root of his mind towards her at the bottom of his gentle sensitive nature there was a sternness which he often forgot she never This hard fact in their relation had insensibly influenced her greatly was constantly indeed working in and upon her especially since the chances of her nursing career had brought her to settle in this district within a stone s throw of him and his sister so that she saw them often and intimately But it worked in different ways Sometimes as to night it evoked a kind of defiance A minute or two after he had made his remark about Aldous she said to him suddenly I had a letter from mister Wharton to day He is coming to tea with me to morrow and I shall probably go to the House on Friday with Edith Craven to hear him speak Hallin gave a slight start at the name Then he said nothing but went on sorting some letters of the day into different heaps His silence roused her irritation Do you remember she said in a low energetic voice that I told you I could never be ungrateful never forget what he had done Yes I remember he said not without a certain sharpness of tone You spoke of giving him help if he ever asked it of you has he asked it She explained that what he seemed to be asking was Louis Craven s help and that his overtures with regard to the Labour Clarion were particularly opportune seeing that Louis was pining to be able to marry and was losing heart hope and health for want of some fixed employment She spoke warmly of her friends and their troubles and Hallin s inward distaste had to admit that all she said was plausible Since the moment in that strange talk which had drawn them together when she had turned upon him with the passionate cry I see what you mean perfectly but I am not going to marry mister Wharton so don t trouble to warn me for the matter of that he has warned me himself but my gratitude he has earned and if he asks for it I will never deny it him since that moment there had been no word of Wharton between them At the bottom of his heart Hallin distrusted her and was ashamed of himself because of it His soreness and jealousy for his friend knew no bounds If that were to come on again he was saying to himself now as she talked to him I could not bear it I could not forgive her He only wished that she would give up talking about Wharton altogether But on the contrary she would talk of him and with a curious persistence She must needs know what Hallin thought of his career in Parliament of his prospects of his powers as a speaker Hallin answered shortly like some one approached on a subject for which he cares nothing Yet of course it is not that it is injustice she said to herself with vehemence He must care they are his subjects his interests too But he will not look at it dispassionately because So they fell out with each other a little and the talk dragged Yet all the while Marcella s inner mind was conscious of quite different thoughts How good it was to be here in this room beside these two people She must show herself fractious and difficult with Hallin sometimes it was her nature But in reality that slight and fragile form that spiritual presence were now shrined in the girl s eager reverence and affection She felt towards him as many a Catholic has felt towards his director though the hidden yearning to be led by him was often oddly covered as now by an outer self assertion Perhaps her quarrel with him was that he would not lead her enough would not tell her precisely enough what she was to do with herself CHAPTER V While she and Hallin were sitting thus momentarily out of tune with each other the silence was suddenly broken by a familiar voice I say Hallin is this all right The words came from a young man who having knocked unheeded opened the door and cautiously put in a curly head Frank is that you Come in cried Hallin springing up Frank Leven came in and at once perceived the lady sitting in the window Well I am glad he cried striding across the room and shaking Hallin s hand by the way Miss Boyce I thought none of your friends were ever going to get a sight of you again Why what He drew back scanning her a gay look of quizzing surprise on his fair boy s face He expected me in cap and apron said Marcella laughing or means to pretend he did I expected a sensation And here you are just as you were only twice as I say Hallin doesn t she look well this in a stage aside to Hallin while the speaker was drawing off his gloves and still studying Marcella Well I think she looks tired said Hallin with a little attempt at a smile but turning away Everybody felt a certain tension a certain danger even in the simplest words and Miss Hallin s call to supper was very welcome The frugal meal went gaily The chattering Christchurch boy brought to it a breath of happy careless life to which the three others over driven and over pressed all of them responded with a kind of eagerness Hallin especially delighted in him and would have out all his budget his peacock s pride at having been just put into the Varsity eleven his cricket engagements for the summer his rows with his dons above all his lasting amazement that he should have just scraped through his Mods I thought those Roman emperors would have done for me he declared with a child s complacency Brutes I couldn t remember them I learnt them up and down backwards and forwards but it was no good they nearly dished me Yet it comes back to me said Hallin slily that when a certain person was once asked to name the winner of the Derby in some obscure year he began at the beginning and gave us all of them from first to last without a hitch The winner of the Derby said the lad eagerly bending forward with his hands on his knees why I should rather think so That isn t memory that s knowledge Goodness who s this The last remark was addressed sotto voce to Marcella Supper was just over and the two guests with Hallin had returned to the window while Miss Hallin stoutly refusing their help herself cleared the table and set all straight Hallin hearing a knock had gone to the door while Leven was speaking Four men came crowding in all of them apparently well known both to Hallin and his sister The last two seemed to be workmen the others were Bennett Hallin s old and tried friend among the Labour leaders and Nehemiah Wilkins M P Hallin introduced them all to Marcella and Leven but the new comers took little notice of any one but their host and were soon seated about him discussing a matter already apparently familiar to them and into which Hallin had thrown himself at once with that passionate directness which in the social and speculative field replaced his ordinary gentleness of manner He seemed to be in strong disagreement with the rest a disagreement which troubled himself and irritated them Marcella watched them with quick curiosity from the window where she was sitting and would have liked to go forward to listen But Frank Leven turned suddenly round upon her with sparkling eyes Oh I say don t go Do come and sit here with me a bit Oh isn t it rum isn t it rum Look at Hallin those are the people whom he cares to talk to That s a shoemaker that man to the left really an awfully cute fellow and this man in front I think he told me he was a mason a Socialist of course would like to string me up to morrow Did you ever see such a countenance Whenever that man begins I think we must be precious near to shooting And he s pious too would pray over us first and shoot us afterwards which isn t the case I understand with many of em Then the others you know them That s Bennett regular good fellow always telling his pals not to make fools of themselves for which of course they love him no more than they are obliged And Wilkins oh Wilkins he chuckled they say it ll come to a beautiful row in the House before they ve done between him and my charming cousin Harry Wharton My father says he backs Wilkins Then suddenly the lad recollected himself and his clear cheek coloured a little after a hasty glance at his companion He fell to silence and looking at his boots Marcella wondered what was the matter with him Since her flight from Mellor she had lived so to speak with her head in the sand She herself had never talked directly of her own affairs to anybody Her sensitive pride did not let her realise that notwithstanding all the world was aware of them I don t suppose you know much about your cousin she said to him with a little scorn Well I don t want to said the lad that s one comfort But I don t know anything about anything Miss Boyce He plunged his head in his hands and Marcella looking at him saw at once that she was meant to understand she had woe and lamentation beside her Her black eyes danced with laughter At Mellor she had been several times his confidante The handsome lad was not apparently very fond of his sisters and had taken to her from the beginning To night she recognised the old symptoms What you have been getting into scrapes again she said how many since we met last There you make fun of it he said indignantly from behind his fingers you re like all the rest Marcella teased him a little more till at last she was astonished by a flash of genuine wrath from the hastily uncovered eyes If you re only going to chaff a fellow let s go over there and talk And yet I did want to tell you about it you were awfully kind to me down at home I want to tell you and I don t want to tell you perhaps I oughtn t to tell you you ll think me a brute I dare say an ungentlemanly brute for speaking of it at all and yet somehow The boy crimson bit his lips Marcella arrested and puzzled laid a hand on his arm She had been used to these motherly ways with him at Mellor on the strength of her seniority so inadequately measured by its two years or so of time I won t laugh she said tell me No really shall I Whereupon there burst forth a history precisely similar it seemed to some half dozen others she had already heard from the same lips A pretty girl or rather an exquisite creature met at the house of some relation in Scotland met again at the Boats at Oxford and yet again at Commemoration balls Nuneham picnics and the rest adored and adorable yet of course a sphinx born for the torment of men taking her haughty way over a prostrate sex kind to day cruel to morrow not to be won by money yet naturally not to be won without it possessed like Rose Aylmer of every virtue every grace whether of form or family yet making nothing but a devastating and death dealing use of them how familiar it all was and how many more of them there seemed to be in the world on a man s reckoning than on a woman s And you know said the lad eagerly though she s so frightfully pretty well frightfully fetching rather and well dressed and all the rest of it she isn t a bit silly not one of your empty headed girls not she She s read a lot of things a lot I m sure Miss Boyce he looked at her confidently if you were to see her you d think her awfully clever And yet she s so little and so dainty and she dances my goodness you should see her dance skirt dance I mean Letty Lind isn t in it She s good too awfully good I think her mother s a most dreadful old bore well no I didn t mean that of course I didn t mean that but she s fussy you know and invalidy and has to be wrapped up in shawls and dragged about in bath chairs and Betty s an angel to her she is really though her mother s always snapping her head off And as to the poor Something in his tone in the way he had of fishing for her approval sent Marcella into a sudden fit of laughter Then she put out a hand to restrain this plunging lover Look here do come to the point have you proposed to her I should rather think I have said the boy fervently About once a week since Christmas Of course she s played with me that sort always does but I think I might really have a chance with her if it weren t for her mother horrible old no of course I don t mean that But now it comes in what I oughtn t to tell you I know I oughtn t to tell you I m always making a beastly mess of it It s because I can t help talking of it And shaking his curly head in despair he once more plunged his red cheeks into his hands and fell abruptly silent Marcella coloured for sympathy I really wish you wouldn t talk in riddles she said What is the matter with you of course you must tell me Well I know you won t mind cried the lad emerging As if you could mind But it sounds like my impudence to be talking to you about about You see he blurted out she s going to Italy with the Raeburns She s a connection of theirs somehow and Miss Raeburn s taken a fancy to her lately and her mother s treated me like dirt ever since they asked her to go to Italy and naturally a fellow sees what that means and what her mother s after I don t believe Betty would he s too old for her isn t he Oh my goodness this time he smote his knee in real desperation now I have done it I m simply bursting always with the thing I d rather cut my head off than say Why they make em like me I don t know You mean said Marcella with impatience that her mother wants her to marry mister Raeburn He looked round at his companion She was lying back in a deep chair her hands lightly clasped on her knee Something in her attitude in the pose of the tragic head in the expression of the face stamped to night with a fatigue which was also a dignity struck a real compunction into his mood of vanity and excitement He had simply not been able to resist the temptation to talk to her She reminded him of the Raeburns and the Raeburns were in his mind at the present moment by day and by night He knew that he was probably doing an indelicate and indiscreet thing but all the same his boyish egotism would not be restrained from the headlong pursuit of his own emotions There was in him too such a burning curiosity as to how she would take it what she would say Now however he felt a genuine shrinking His look changed Drawing his chair close up to her he began a series of penitent and self contradictory excuses which Marcella soon broke in upon I don t know why you talk like that she said looking at him steadily Do you suppose I can go on all my life without hearing mister Raeburn s name mentioned And don t apologise so much It really doesn t matter what I suppose that you think about my present state of mind It is very simple I ought never to have accepted mister Raeburn I behaved badly I know it and everybody knows it Still one has to go on living one s life somehow The point is that I am rather the wrong person for you to come to just now for if there is one thing I ardently wish about mister Raeburn it is that he should get himself married Frank Leven looked at her in bewildered dismay I never thought of that he said Well you might mightn t you For another short space there was silence between them while the rush of talk in the centre of the room was still loud and unspent Then she rated herself for want of sympathy Frank sat beside her shy and uncomfortable his confidence chilled away So you think Miss Raeburn has views she asked him smiling and in her most ordinary voice The boy s eye brightened again with the implied permission to go on chattering I know she has Betty s brother as good as told me that she and missus Macdonald that s Betty s mother she hasn t got a father had talked it over And now Betty s going with them to Italy and Aldous is going too for ten days and when I go to the Macdonalds missus Macdonald treats me as if I were a little chap in jackets and Betty worries me to death It s sickening And how about mister Raeburn Oh Aldous seems to like her very much he said despondently She s always teasing and amusing him When she s there she never lets him alone She harries him out She makes him read to her and ride with her She makes him discuss all sorts of things with her you d never think Aldous would discuss her lovers and her love affairs and being in love it s extraordinary the way she drives him round At Easter she and her mother were staying at the Court and one night Betty told me she was bored to death It was a very smart party but everything was so flat and everybody was so dull So she suddenly got up and ran across to Aldous Now look here mister Aldous she said this ll never do you ve got to come and dance with me and push those chairs and tables aside I can fancy the little stamp she d give and make those other people dance too And she made him she positively made him Aldous declared he didn t dance and she wouldn t have a word of it And presently she got to all her tricks skirt dancing and the rest of it and of course the evening went like smoke Marcella s eyes unusually wide open were somewhat intently fixed on the speaker And mister Raeburn liked it she asked in a tone that sounded incredulous Didn t he just She told me they got regular close friends after that and he told her everything oh well said the lad embarrassed and clutching at his usual formula of course I didn t mean that And she s fearfully flattered you can see she is and she tells me that she adores him that he s the only great man she s ever known that I m not fit to black his boots and ought to be grateful whenever he speaks to me and all that sort of rot And now she s going off with them I shall have to shoot myself I declare I shall Well not yet said Marcella in a soothing voice the case isn t clear enough Wait till they come back Shall we move I m going over there to listen to that talk But first come and see me whenever you like three to four point thirty Brown s Buildings Maine Street and tell me how this goes on She spoke with a careless lightness laughing at him with a half sisterly freedom She had risen from her seat and he whose thoughts had been wrapped up for months in one of the smallest of the sex was suddenly struck with her height and stately gesture as she moved away from him By Jove Why didn t she stick to Aldous he said to himself discontentedly as his eyes followed her It was only her cranks and of course she ll get rid of them Just like my luck Meanwhile Marcella took a seat next to Miss Hallin who looked up from her knitting to smile at her The girl fell into the attitude of listening but for some minutes she was not listening at all She was reflecting how little men knew of each other even the most intimate friends and trying to imagine what Aldous Raeburn would be like married to such a charmer as Frank had sketched His friendship for her meant of course the attraction of contraries one of the most promising of all possible beginnings On the whole she thought Frank s chances were poor Then unexpectedly her ear was caught by Wharton s name and she discovered that what was going on beside her was a passionate discussion of his present position and prospects in the Labour party a discussion however mainly confined to Wilkins and the two workmen Bennett had the air of the shrewd and kindly spectator who has his own reasons for treating a situation with reserve and Hallin was lying back in his chair flushed and worn out The previous debate which had now merged in these questions of men and personalities had made him miserable he had no heart for anything more Miss Hallin observed him anxiously and made restless movements now and then as though she had it in her mind to send all her guests away The two Socialist workmen were talking strongly in favour of an organised and distinct Labour party and of Wharton s leadership They referred constantly to Parnell and what he had clone for those Irish fellows The only way to make Labour formidable in the House was to learn the lesson of Unionism and of Parnellism to act together and strike together to make of the party a two handed engine ready to smite Tory and Liberal impartially To this end a separate organisation separate place in the House separate Whips they were ready nay clamorous for them all And they were equally determined on Harry Wharton as a leader They spoke of the Clarion with enthusiasm and declared that its owner was already an independent power and was moreover as straight as he was sharp The contention and the praise lashed Wilkins into fury After making one or two visible efforts at a sarcastic self control which came to nothing he broke out into a flood of invective which left the rest of the room staring Marcella found herself indignantly wondering who this big man with his fierce eyes long puffy cheeks coarse black hair and North country accent might be Why did he talk in this way with these epithets this venom It was intolerable Hallin roused himself from his fatigue to play the peace maker But some of the things Wilkins had been saying had put up the backs of the two workmen and the talk flamed up unmanageably Wilkins s dialect getting more pronounced with each step of the argument Well if I d ever ha thowt that I war coomin to Lunnon to put myself and my party oonder the heel o Muster Harry Wharton I d ha stayed at home I tell tha cried Wilkins slapping his knee If it s to be the People s party why in the name o God must yo put a yoong ripstitch like yon at the head of it a man who ll just mak use of us all you an me and ivery man Jack of us for his own advancement an ull kick us down when he s done with us Why shouldn t he What is he Is he a man of us bone of our bone He s a landlord and an aristocrat I tell tha What have the likes of him ever been but thorns in our side When have the landlords ever gone with the people Have they not been the blight and the curse of the country for hun erds of years And you re goin to tell me that a man bred out o them living on his rent and interest grinding the faces of the poor I ll be bound if the truth were known as all the rest of them do is goin to lead me an those as ll act with me to the pullin down of the landlords Why are we to go lickspittlin to any man of his sort to do our work for us Let him go to his own class I m told mister Wharton is mighty fond of countesses and they of him or let him set up as the friend of the working man just as he likes I m quite agreeable I shan t make any bones about takin his vote but I m not goin to make him master over me and give him the right to speak for my mates in the House of Commons I d cut my hand off fust Leven grinned in the background Bennett lay back in his chair with a worried look Wilkins s crudities were very distasteful to him both in and out of the House The younger of the Socialist workmen a mason with a strong square face incongruously lit somehow with the eyes of the religious dreamer looked at Wilkins contemptuously There s none of you in the House will take orders he said quickly and that s the ruin of us We all know that Where do you think we d have been in the struggle with the employers if we d gone about our business as you re going about yours in the House of Commons I m not saying we shouldn t organise said Wilkins fiercely What I m sayin is get a man of the working class a man who has the wants of the working class a man whom the working class can get a hold on to do your business for you and not any bloodsucking landlord or capitalist It s a slap i the face to ivery honest working man i the coontry to mak a Labour party and put Harry Wharton at t head of it The young Socialist looked at him askance Of course you d like it yourself was what he was thinking But they ll take a man as can hold his own with the swells and quite right too And if mister Wharton is a landlord he s a good sort exclaimed the shoemaker a tall lean man in a well brushed frock coat There s many on us knows as have been to hear him speak what he s tried to do about the land and the company operative farming E s straight is mister Wharton We aven t got Socialism yet an it isn t is fault bein a landlord Ee was born it I tell tha he s playin for his own hand said Wilkins doggedly the red spot deepening on his swarthy cheek he s runnin that paper for his own hand Haven t I had experience of him I know it And I ll prove it some day He s one for featherin his own nest is mister Wharton and when he s doon it by makkin fools of us he ll leave us to whistle for any good we re iver likely to get out o him He go agen the landlords when it coom to the real toossle I know em I tell tha I know em A woman s voice clear and scornful broke into the talk It s a little strange to think isn t it that while we in London go on groaning and moaning about insanitary houses and making our small attempts here and there half of the country poor of England have been re housed in our generation by these same landlords no fuss about it and rents for five roomed cottages somewhere about one and fourpence a week Hallin swung his chair round and looked at the speaker amazed Wilkins also stared at her under his eyebrows He did not like women least of all ladies He gruffly replied that if they had done anything like as much as she said which he begged her pardon but he didn t believe it was done for the landlords own purposes either to buy off public opinion or just for show and aggrandisement People who had prize pigs and prize cattle must have prize cottages of course with a race of slaves inside em Marcella bright eyed erect her thin right hand hanging over her knee went avengingly into facts the difference between landlords villages and open villages the agrarian experiments made by different great landlords the advantage to the community even from the Socialist point of view of a system which had preserved the land in great blocks for the ultimate use of the State as compared with a system like the French which had for ever made Socialism impossible Hallin s astonishment almost swept away his weariness Where in the world did she get it all from and is she standing on her head or am I After an animated little debate in which Bennett and the two workmen joined while Wilkins sat for the most part in moody contemptuous silence and Marcella her obstinacy roused carried through her defence of the landlords with all a woman s love of emphasis and paradox everybody rose simultaneously to say good night You ought to come and lead a debate down at our Limehouse club said Bennett pleasantly to Marcella as she held out her hand to him you d take a lot of beating Yet I m a Venturist you know she said laughing I am He shook his head laughed too and departed When the four had gone Marcella turned upon Hallin Are there many of these Labour members like that Her tone was still vibrating and sarcastic He s not much of a talker our Nehemiah said Hallin smiling but he has the most extraordinary power as a speaker over a large popular audience that I have ever seen The man s honesty is amazing it s his tempers and his jealousies get in his way You astonished him but for the matter of that you astonished Frank and me still more And as he fell back into his chair Marcella caught a flash of expression a tone that somehow put her on her defence I was not going to listen to such unjust stuff without a word Politics is one thing slanderous abuse is another she said throwing back her head with a gesture which instantly brought back to Hallin the scene in the Mellor drawing room when she had denounced the game laws and Wharton had scored his first point He was silent feeling a certain inner exasperation with women and their ways She only did it to annoy cried Frank Leven because she knows it teases We know very well what she thinks of us But where did you get it all from Miss Boyce I just wish you d tell me There s a horrid Radical in the House I m always having rows with and upon my word I didn t know there was half so much to be said for us Marcella flushed Never mind where I got it she said In reality of course it was from those Agricultural Reports she had worked through the year before under Wharton s teaching with so much angry zest and to such different purpose When the door closed upon her and upon Frank Leven who was to escort her home Hallin walked quickly over to the table and stood looking for a moment in a sort of bitter reverie at Raeburn s photograph His sister followed him and laid her hand on his shoulder Do go to bed Edward I am afraid that talk has tired you dreadfully It would be no good going to bed dear he said with a sigh of exhaustion I will sit and read a bit and see if I can get myself into sleeping trim But you go Alice good night When she had gone he threw himself into his chair again with the thought She must contradict here as she contradicted there She and justice If she could have been just to a landlord for one hour last year He spent himself for a while in endless chains of recollection oppressed by the clearness of his own brain and thirsting for sleep Then from the affairs of Raeburn and Marcella he passed with a fresh sense of strain and effort to his own That discussion with those four men which had filled the first part of the evening weighed upon him in his weakness of nerve so that suddenly in the phantom silence of the night all life became an oppression and a terror and rest either to night or in the future a thing never to be his He had come to the moment of difficulty of tragedy in a career which so far in spite of all drawbacks of physical health and cramped activities had been one of singular happiness and success Ever since he had discovered his own gifts as a lecturer to working men content cheerfulness nay a passionate interest in every hour had been quite compatible for him with all the permanent limitations of his lot The study of economical and historical questions the expression through them of such a hunger for the building of a city of God among men as few are capable of the evidence not to be ignored even by his modesty and perpetually forthcoming over a long period of time that he had the power to be loved the power to lead among those toilers of the world on whom all his thoughts centred these things had been his joy and had led him easily through much self denial to the careful husbanding of every hour of strength and time in the service of his ideal end And now he had come upon opposition the first cooling of friendships the first distrust of friends that he had ever known Early in the spring of this year a book called To morrow and the Land had appeared in London written by a young London economist of great ability and dealing with the nationalisation of the land It did not offer much discussion of the general question but it took up the question as it affected England specially and London in particular It showed or tried to show in picturesque detail what might be the consequences for English rural or municipal life of throwing all land into a common or national stock of expropriating the landlords and transferring all rent to the people to the effacement of taxation and the indefinite enrichment of the common lot The book differed from Progress and Poverty which also powerfully and directly affected the English working class in that it suggested a financial scheme of great apparent simplicity and ingenuity for the compensation of the landlords it was shorter and more easily to be grasped by the average working man and it was written in a singularly crisp and taking style and by the help of a number of telling illustrations borrowed directly from the circumstances of the larger English towns especially of London treated with abundant humour The thing had an enormous success in popular phrase caught on Soon Hallin found that all the more active and intelligent spirits in the working class centres where he was in vogue as a lecturer were touched nay possessed by it The crowd of more or less socialistic newspapers which had lately sprung up in London were full of it the working men s clubs rang with it It seemed to him a madness an infection and it spread like one The book had soon reached an immense sale and was in every one s hands To Hallin a popular teacher interested above all in the mingled problems of ethics and economics such an incident was naturally of extreme importance But he was himself opposed by deepest conviction intellectual and moral to the book and its conclusions The more its success grew the more eager and passionate became his own desire to battle with it His platform of course was secured to him his openings many Hundreds and thousands of men all over England were keen to know what he had to say about the new phenomenon And he had been saying his say throwing into it all his energies all his finest work With the result that for the first time in eleven years he felt his position in the working class movement giving beneath his feet and his influence beginning to drop from his hand Coldness in place of enthusiasm critical aloofness in place of affection readiness to forget and omit him in matters where he had always hitherto belonged to the inner circle and the trusted few these bitter ghosts with their hard unfamiliar looks had risen of late in his world of idealist effort and joy and had brought with them darkness and chill He could not give way for he had a singular unity of soul it had been the source of his power and every economical or social conviction was in some way bound up with the moral and religious passion which was his being his inmost nature And his sensitive state of nerve and brain his anchorite s way of life did not allow him the distractions of other men The spread of these and other similar ideas seemed to him a question of the future of England and he had already begun to throw himself into the unequal struggle with a martyr s tenacity and with some prescience of the martyr s fate Even Bennett As he sat there alone in the dim lamp light his head bent over his knees his hands hanging loosely before him he thought bitterly of the defection of that old friend who had stood by him through so many lesser contests It was impossible that Bennett should think the schemes of that book feasible Yet he was one of the honestest of men and within a certain range one of the most clear headed As for the others they had been all against him Intellectually their opinion did not matter to him but morally it was so strange to him to find himself on the side of doubt and dissent while all his friends were talking language which was almost the language of a new faith He had various lecturing engagements ahead connected with this great debate which was now surging throughout the Labour world of London He had accepted them with eagerness in these weary night hours he looked forward to them with terror seeing before him perpetually thousands of hostile faces living in a nightmare of lost sympathies and broken friendships Oh for sleep for the power to rest to escape this corrosion of an ever active thought which settled and reconciled nothing The tragedy of life lies in the conflict between the creative will of man and the hidden wisdom of the world which seems to thwart it These words written by one whose thought had penetrated deep into his own rang in his ears as he sat brooding there Not the hidden fate or the hidden evil but the hidden wisdom Could one die and still believe it Yet what else was the task of faith CHAPTER VI
6189_21305_000001_000000	train-clean-360	 So I understand you wish me to go down at once said Louis Craven This is Friday say Monday 
none	none	Wharton nodded He and Craven were sitting in Marcella s little sitting room 
6189_21305_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Their hostess and Edith Craven had escaped through the door in the back kitchen communicating with the Hurds tenement so that the two men might be left alone a while 
none	none	The interview between them had gone smoothly and Louis Craven had accepted immediate employment on the Labour Clarion as the paper s correspondent in the Midlands with special reference to the important strike just pending 
6189_21305_000002_000004	train-clean-360	Wharton whose tendency in matters of business was always to go rather further than he had meant to go for the sake generally of making an impression on the man with whom he was dealing had spoken of a two years engagement and had offered two hundred a year 
6189_21305_000002_000005	train-clean-360	So far as that went Craven was abundantly satisfied 
none	none	And I understand from you he said that the paper goes in for the strike that you will fight it through 
6189_21305_000004_000000	train-clean-360	He fixed his penetrating greenish eyes on his companion 
6189_21305_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Louis Craven was now a tall man with narrow shoulders a fine oval head and face delicate features and a nervous look of short sight producing in appearance and manner a general impression of thin grace and of a courtesy which was apt to pass unaccountably into sarcasm 
6189_21305_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Wharton had never felt himself personally at ease with him either now or in the old days of Venturist debates 
6189_21305_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly we shall fight it through Wharton replied with emphasis I have gone through the secretary s statement which I now hand over to you and I never saw a clearer case 
6189_21305_000005_000001	train-clean-360	The poor wretches have been skinned too long it is high time the public backed them up 
6189_21305_000005_000002	train-clean-360	There are two of the masters in the House 
6189_21305_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Denny I should say belonged quite to the worst type of employer going 
6189_21305_000006_000000	train-clean-360	He spoke with light venom buttoning his coat as he spoke with the air of the busy public man who must not linger over an appointment 
6189_21305_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Denny said Craven musing yes Denny is a hard man but a just one according to his lights 
6189_21305_000007_000001	train-clean-360	There are plenty worse than he 
6189_21305_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Wharton was disagreeably reminded of the Venturist habit of never accepting anything that was said quite as it stood of not even in small things swearing to the words of anybody 
6189_21305_000008_000001	train-clean-360	He was conscious of the quick passing feeling that his judgment with regard to Denny ought to have been enough for Craven 
6189_21305_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 One thing more said Craven suddenly as Wharton looked for his stick you see there is talk of arbitration 
6189_21305_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes I know said Wharton impatiently a mere blind 
6189_21305_000010_000001	train-clean-360	The men have been done by it twice before 
6189_21305_000010_000002	train-clean-360	They get some big wig from the neighbourhood not in the trade indeed but next door to it and of course the award goes against the men 
6189_21305_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Then the paper will not back arbitration 
6189_21305_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Craven took out a note book 
6189_21305_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 No The quarrel itself is as plain as a pikestaff 
6189_21305_000013_000001	train-clean-360	The men are asking for a mere pittance and must get it if they are to live 
6189_21305_000013_000002	train-clean-360	It s like all these home industries abominably ground down 
6189_21305_000013_000003	train-clean-360	We must go for them 
6189_21305_000013_000004	train-clean-360	I mean to go for them hot and strong 
none	none	Poor devils 
6189_21305_000013_000006	train-clean-360	did you read the evidence in that Bluebook last year 
none	none	Arbitration 
6189_21305_000013_000008	train-clean-360	no indeed let them live first 
6189_21305_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Craven looked up absently 
6189_21305_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 And I think he said you gave me mister Thorpe s address mister Thorpe was the secretary 
6189_21305_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Again Wharton gulped down his annoyance 
6189_21305_000016_000001	train-clean-360	If he chose to be expansive it was not for Craven to take no notice 
6189_21305_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Craven however except in print where he could be as vehement as anybody else never spoke but in the driest way of those workman s grievances which in reality burnt at the man s heart 
none	none	A deep disdain for what had always seemed to him the cheapest form of self advertisement held him back It was this dryness combined with an amazing disinterestedness which had so far stood in his way 
6189_21305_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Wharton repeated the address following it up by some rather curt directions as to the length and date of articles to which Craven gave the minutest attention 
6189_21305_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 May we come in said Marcella s voice 
none	none	By all means said Wharton with a complete change of tone
6189_21305_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 Business is up and I am off 
6189_21305_000021_000000	train-clean-360	He took up his hat as he spoke 
none	none	Not at all 
6189_21305_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Tea is just coming without which no guest departs said Marcella taking as she spoke a little tray from the red haired Daisy who followed her and motioning to the child to bring the tea table 
6189_21305_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Wharton looked at her irresolute 
none	none	He had spent half an hour with her tete a tete before Louis Craven arrived and he was really due at the House 
6189_21305_000023_000002	train-clean-360	But now that she was on the scene again he did not find it so easy to go away 
6189_21305_000023_000003	train-clean-360	How astonishingly beautiful she was even in this disguise 
6189_21305_000023_000004	train-clean-360	She wore her nurse s dress for her second daily round began at half past four and her cloak bonnet and bag were lying ready on a chair beside her 
6189_21305_000023_000005	train-clean-360	The dress was plain brown holland with collar and armlets of white linen but to Wharton s eye the dark Italian head and the long slenderness of form had never shown more finely 
6189_21305_000023_000006	train-clean-360	He hesitated and stayed 
none	none	All well said Marcella in a half whisper as she passed Louis Craven on her way to get some cake 
6189_21305_000025_000000	train-clean-360	He nodded and smiled and she went back to the tea table with an eye all gaiety pleased with herself and everybody else 
6189_21305_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The quarter of an hour that followed went agreeably enough 
6189_21305_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Wharton sat among the little group far too clever to patronise a cat let alone a Venturist but none the less master and conscious master of the occasion because it suited him to take the airs of equality 
6189_21305_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Craven said little but as he lounged in Marcella s long cane chair with his arms behind his head his serene and hazy air showed him contented and Marcella talked and laughed with the animation that belongs to one whose plots for improving the universe have at least temporarily succeeded Or did it betray perhaps a woman s secret consciousness of some presence beside her more troubling and magnetic to her than others 
6189_21305_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Well then Friday said Wharton at last when his time was more than spent You must be there early for there will be a crush 
6189_21305_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Miss Craven comes too 
none	none	Excellent 
6189_21305_000027_000003	train-clean-360	I will tell the doorkeeper to look out for you Good bye good bye 
6189_21305_000028_000000	train-clean-360	And with a hasty shake of the hand to the Cravens and one more keen glance first at Marcella and then round the little workman s room in which they had been sitting he went 
6189_21305_000029_000000	train-clean-360	He had hardly departed before Anthony Craven the lame elder brother who must have passed him on the stairs appeared 
6189_21305_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Well any news he said as Marcella found him a chair 
6189_21305_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 All right said Louis whose manner had entirely changed since Wharton had left the room 
6189_21305_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 I am to go down on Monday to report the Damesley strike that is to be 
6189_21305_000031_000002	train-clean-360	A month s trial and then a salary two hundred a year 
6189_21305_000031_000003	train-clean-360	Oh it ll do 
6189_21305_000032_000000	train-clean-360	He fidgeted and looked away from his brother as though trying to hide his pleasure 
6189_21305_000032_000001	train-clean-360	But in spite of him it transformed every line of the pinched and worn face 
6189_21305_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 And you and Anna will walk to the Registry Office next week said Anthony sourly as he took his tea 
6189_21305_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 It can t be next week said Edith Craven s quiet voice interposing Anna s got to work out her shirt making time 
none	none	She only left the tailoresses and began this new business ten days ago 
6189_21305_000034_000002	train-clean-360	And she was to have a month at each 
6189_21305_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Marcella s lifted eyebrows asked for explanations 
none	none	She had not yet seen Louis s betrothed but she was understood to be a character and a better authority on many Labour questions than he 
6189_21305_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Louis explained that Anna was exploring various sweated trades for the benefit of an East End newspaper 
6189_21305_000036_000001	train-clean-360	She had earned fourteen shillings her last week at tailoring but the feat had exhausted her so much that he had been obliged to insist on two or three days respite before moving on to shirts 
6189_21305_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Shirts were now brisk and the hours appallingly long in this heat 
6189_21305_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 It was on shirts they made acquaintance said Edith pensively 
6189_21305_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 Louis was lodging on the second floor she in the third floor back and they used to pass on the stairs 
6189_21305_000037_000002	train-clean-360	One day she heard him imploring the little slavey to put some buttons on his shirts 
none	none	The slavey tossed her head and said she d see about it 
6189_21305_000037_000004	train-clean-360	When he d gone out Anna came downstairs calmly demanded his shirts and having the slavey under her thumb got them walked off with them and mended them all 
6189_21305_000037_000005	train-clean-360	When Louis came home he discovered a neat heap reposing on his table 
6189_21305_000037_000006	train-clean-360	Of course he wept whatever he may say 
6189_21305_000037_000007	train-clean-360	But next morning Miss Anna found her shoes outside her door blacked as they had never been blacked before with a note inside one of them 
6189_21305_000037_000008	train-clean-360	Affecting wasn t it 
6189_21305_000037_000009	train-clean-360	Thenceforward as long as they remained in those lodgings Anna mended and Louis blacked Naturally Anthony and I drew our conclusions 
none	none	Marcella laughed
6189_21305_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 You must bring her to see me she said to Louis 
6189_21305_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 I will said Louis with some perplexity if I can get hold of her But when she isn t stitching she s writing or trying to set up Unions She does the work of six 
none	none	She ll earn nearly as much as I do when we re married 
6189_21305_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Oh we shall swim 
6189_21305_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Anthony surveyed his radiant aspect so unlike the gentle or satirical detachment which made his ordinary manner with a darkening eye as though annoyed by his effusion 
6189_21305_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Two hundred a year he said slowly about what mister Harry Wharton spends on his clothes I should think 
6189_21305_000042_000001	train-clean-360	The Labour men tell me he is superb in that line 
none	none	And for the same sum that he spends on his clothes he is able to buy you Louis body and soul and you seem inclined to be grateful
6189_21305_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind said Louis recklessly 
none	none	He didn t buy some one else and I am grateful
6189_21305_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 No by Heaven you shan t be said Anthony with a fierce change of tone 
none	none	You the dependent of that charlatan 
6189_21305_000044_000002	train-clean-360	I don t know how I m to put up with it 
6189_21305_000044_000003	train-clean-360	You know very well what I think of him and of your becoming dependent on him 
6189_21305_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Marcella gave an angry start 
6189_21305_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Louis protested 
6189_21305_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Nonsense said Anthony doggedly you ll have to bear it from me I tell you unless you muzzle me too with an Anna 
none	none	But I don t see why I should bear it said Marcella turning upon him
6189_21305_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 I think you know that I owe mister Wharton a debt 
6189_21305_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Please remember it 
6189_21305_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Anthony looked at her an instant in silence 
6189_21305_000048_000001	train-clean-360	A question crossed his mind concerning her 
none	none	Then he made her a little clumsy bow
6189_21305_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 I am dumb he said 
6189_21305_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 My manners you perceive are what they always were 
6189_21305_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you mean by such a remark cried Marcella fuming 
6189_21305_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 How can a man who has reached the position he has in so short a time in so many different worlds be disposed of by calling him an ugly name 
6189_21305_000050_000002	train-clean-360	It is more than unjust it is absurd 
6189_21305_000050_000003	train-clean-360	Besides what can you know of him 
6189_21305_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 You forget said Anthony as he calmly helped himself to more bread and butter that it is some three years since Master Harry Wharton joined the Venturists and began to be heard of at all 
6189_21305_000051_000001	train-clean-360	I watched his beginnings and if I didn t know him well my friends and Louis s did And most of them as he knows have pretty strong opinions by now about the man 
6189_21305_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Come come Anthony said Louis nobody expects a man of that type to be the pure eyed patriot 
none	none	But neither you nor I can deny that he has done some good service 
6189_21305_000052_000002	train-clean-360	Am I asked to take him to my bosom 
6189_21305_000052_000003	train-clean-360	Not at all He proposes a job to me and offers to pay me 
6189_21305_000052_000004	train-clean-360	I like the job and mean to use him and his paper both to earn some money that I want and do a bit of decent work 
none	none	You use Harry Wharton said the cripple with a sarcasm that brought the colour to Louis s thin cheek and made Marcella angrier than before 
6189_21305_000053_000001	train-clean-360	She saw nothing in his attack on Wharton except personal prejudice and ill will 
none	none	It was natural enough that a man of Anthony Craven s type poor unsuccessful and embittered should dislike a popular victorious personality
6189_21305_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Suppose we leave mister Wharton alone she said with emphasis and Anthony making her a little proud gesture of submission threw himself back in his chair and was silent 
6189_21305_000055_000000	train-clean-360	It had soon become evident to Marcella upon the renewal of her friendship with the Cravens that Anthony s temper towards all men especially towards social reformers and politicians had developed into a mere impotent bitterness 
6189_21305_000055_000001	train-clean-360	While Louis had renounced his art and devoted himself to journalism unpaid public work and starvation that he might so throw himself the more directly into the Socialist battle Anthony had remained an artist mainly employed as before in decorative design 
none	none	Yet he was probably the more fierce Venturist and anticapitalist of the two 
6189_21305_000055_000003	train-clean-360	Only what with Louis was an intoxication of hope was on the whole with Anthony a counsel of despair 
6189_21305_000055_000004	train-clean-360	He loathed wealth more passionately than ever but he believed less in the working man less in his kind 
6189_21305_000055_000005	train-clean-360	Rich men must cease to exist but the world on any terms would probably remain a sorry spot 
none	none	In the few talks that he had had with Marcella since she left the hospital she had allowed him to gather more or less clearly though with hardly a mention of Aldous Raeburn s name what had happened to her at Mellor 
6189_21305_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Anthony Craven thought out the story for himself finding it a fit food for a caustic temper 
6189_21305_000056_000002	train-clean-360	Poor devil the lover 
6189_21305_000056_000003	train-clean-360	To fall a victim to enthusiasms so raw so unprofitable from any point of view was hard And as to this move to London he thought he foresaw the certain end of it 
6189_21305_000056_000004	train-clean-360	At any rate he believed in her no more than before 
6189_21305_000056_000005	train-clean-360	But her beauty was more marked than ever and would of course be the dominant factor in her fate 
6189_21305_000056_000006	train-clean-360	He was thankful at any rate that Louis in this two years interval had finally transferred his heart elsewhere 
none	none	After watching his three companions for a while he broke in upon their chat with an abrupt What is this job Louis I told you 
6189_21305_000059_000001	train-clean-360	I am to investigate report and back up the Damesley strike or rather the strike that begins at Damesley next week 
6189_21305_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 No chance said Anthony shortly the masters are too strong 
none	none	I had a talk with Denny yesterday The Denny he meant however was not Wharton s colleague in the House but his son a young man who beginning life as the heir of one of the most stiff backed and autocratic of capitalists had developed socialist opinions renounced his father s allowance and was now a member of the intellectual proletariat as they have been called the free lances of the Collectivist movement 
6189_21305_000061_000001	train-clean-360	He had lately joined the Venturists 
6189_21305_000061_000002	train-clean-360	Anthony had taken a fancy to him 
6189_21305_000061_000003	train-clean-360	Louis as yet knew little or nothing of him 
6189_21305_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah well he said in reply to his brother I don t know 
none	none	I think the Clarion can do something The press grows more and more powerful in these things And he repeated some of the statements that Wharton had made that Wharton always did make in talking of the Clarion as to its growth under his hands and increasing influence in Labour disputes
6189_21305_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Bunkum interrupted Anthony drily pure bunkum 
none	none	My own belief is that the Clarion is a rotten property and that he knows it 
6189_21305_000065_000000	train-clean-360	At this both Marcella and Louis laughed out 
6189_21305_000065_000001	train-clean-360	Extravagance after a certain point becomes amusing 
6189_21305_000065_000002	train-clean-360	They dropped their vexation and Anthony for the next ten minutes had to submit to the part of the fractious person whom one humours but does not argue with 
6189_21305_000065_000003	train-clean-360	He accepted the part saying little his eager feverish eyes full of hostility glancing from one to the other 
6189_21305_000066_000000	train-clean-360	However at the end Marcella bade him a perfectly friendly farewell 
6189_21305_000066_000001	train-clean-360	It was always in her mind that Anthony Craven was lame and solitary and her pity no less than her respect for him had long since yielded him the right to be rude 
none	none	How are you getting on he said to her abruptly as he dropped her hand Oh very well my superintendent leaves me almost alone now which is a compliment 
6189_21305_000068_000001	train-clean-360	There is a parish doctor who calls me my good woman and a sanitary inspector who tells me to go to him whenever I want advice Those are my chief grievances I think 
6189_21305_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 And you are as much in love with the poor as ever 
6189_21305_000070_000000	train-clean-360	She stiffened at the note of sarcasm and a retaliatory impulse made her say 
6189_21305_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 I see a great deal more happiness than I expected 
none	none	He laughed
6189_21305_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 How like a woman 
6189_21305_000073_000001	train-clean-360	A few ill housed villagers made you a democrat 
6189_21305_000073_000002	train-clean-360	A few well paid London artisans will carry you safely back to your class 
6189_21305_000073_000003	train-clean-360	Your people were wise to let you take this work 
none	none	Do you suppose I nurse none but well paid artisans she asked him mocking And I didn t say money or comfort did I but happiness As for my democracy you are not perhaps the best judge 
6189_21305_000075_000000	train-clean-360	She stood resting both hands on a little table behind her in an attitude touched with the wild freedom which best became her a gleam of storm in her great eyes 
6189_21305_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 Why are you still a Venturist he asked her abruptly 
6189_21305_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 Because I have every right to be 
6189_21305_000077_000001	train-clean-360	I joined a society pledged to work for a better future According to my lights I do what poor work I can in that spirit 
none	none	You are not a Socialist Half the things you say or imply show it And we are Socialists 
6189_21305_000079_000000	train-clean-360	She hesitated looking at him steadily 
6189_21305_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 No so far as Socialism means a political system the trampling out of private enterprise and competition and all the rest of it I find myself slipping away from it more and more 
6189_21305_000080_000001	train-clean-360	No as I go about among these wage earners the emphasis do what I will comes to lie less and less on possession more and more on character 
6189_21305_000080_000002	train-clean-360	I go to two tenements in the same building 
6189_21305_000080_000003	train-clean-360	One is Hell the other Heaven 
none	none	Why 
6189_21305_000080_000005	train-clean-360	Both belong to well paid artisans with equal opportunities 
6189_21305_000080_000006	train-clean-360	Both so far as I can see might have a decent and pleasant life of it 
6189_21305_000080_000007	train-clean-360	But one is a man the other with all his belongings will soon be a vagabond 
6189_21305_000080_000008	train-clean-360	That is not all I know oh don t trouble to tell me so but it is more than I thought 
6189_21305_000080_000009	train-clean-360	No my sympathies in this district where I work are not so much with the Socialists that I know here saving your presence but with the people for instance that slave at Charity Organisation and get all the abuse from all sides 
6189_21305_000081_000000	train-clean-360	Anthony laughed scornfully 
6189_21305_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 It is always the way with a woman he said she invariably prefers the tinkers to the reformers 
6189_21305_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 And as to your Socialism she went on unheeding the thought of many days finding defiant expression it seems to me like all other interesting and important things destined to help something else Christianity begins with the poor and division of goods it becomes the great bulwark of property and the feudal state 
6189_21305_000083_000001	train-clean-360	The Crusades they set out to recover the tomb of the Lord what they did was to increase trade and knowledge 
6189_21305_000083_000002	train-clean-360	And so with Socialism 
none	none	It talks of a new order what it will do is to help to make the old sound 
6189_21305_000084_000000	train-clean-360	Anthony clapped her ironically 
none	none	Excellent

6189_21305_000086_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile Louis stood behind with his hands on his sides a smile in his blinking eyes 
6189_21305_000086_000001	train-clean-360	He really had a contempt for what a handsome half taught girl of twenty three might think 
6189_21305_000086_000002	train-clean-360	Anthony only pretended or desired to have it 
6189_21305_000087_000000	train-clean-360	Nevertheless Louis said good bye to his hostess with real and for him rare effusion 
6189_21305_000087_000001	train-clean-360	Two years before for the space of some months he had been in love with her 
6189_21305_000087_000002	train-clean-360	That she had never responded with anything warmer than liking and comradeship he knew and his Anna now possessed him wholly 
none	none	But there was a deep and gentle chivalry at the bottom of all his stern social faiths and the woman towards whom he had once felt as he had towards Marcella Boyce could never lose the glamour lent her by that moment of passionate youth 
6189_21305_000087_000004	train-clean-360	And now so kindly so eagerly she had given him his Anna 
6189_21305_000088_000000	train-clean-360	When they were all gone Marcella threw herself into her chair a moment to think 
none	none	Her wrath with Anthony was soon dismissed 
6189_21305_000088_000002	train-clean-360	But Louis s thanks had filled her with delicious pleasure 
6189_21305_000088_000003	train-clean-360	Her cheek her eye had a child s brightness 
6189_21305_000088_000004	train-clean-360	The old passion for ruling and influencing was all alive and happy 
none	none	I will see it is all right she was saying to herself I will look after them What she meant was I will see that mister Wharton looks after them and through the link of thought memory flew quickly back to that tete a tete with him which had preceded the Cravens arrival 
6189_21305_000091_000000	train-clean-360	How changed he was yet how much the same 
6189_21305_000091_000001	train-clean-360	He had not sat beside her for ten minutes before each was once more vividly specially conscious of the other 
6189_21305_000091_000002	train-clean-360	She felt in him the old life and daring the old imperious claim to confidence to intimacy on the other hand a new atmosphere a new gravity which suggested growing responsibilities the difficulties of power a great position everything fitted to touch such an imagination as Marcella s which whatever its faults was noble both in quality and range 
none	none	The brow beneath the bright chestnut curls had gained lines that pleased her lines that a woman marks because she thinks they mean experience an I mastery 
6189_21305_000092_000000	train-clean-360	Altogether to have met him again was pleasure to think of him was pleasure to look forward to hearing him speak in Parliament was pleasure so too was his new connection with her old friends 
6189_21305_000092_000001	train-clean-360	And a pleasure which took nothing from self respect which was open honourable eager 
none	none	As for that ugly folly of the past she frowned at the thought of it only to thrust the remembrance passionately away That he should remember or allude to it would put an end to friendship 
6189_21305_000092_000003	train-clean-360	Otherwise friends they would and should be and the personal interest in his public career should lift her out of the cramping influences that flow from the perpetual commerce of poverty and suffering 
none	none	Why not 
6189_21305_000092_000005	train-clean-360	Such equal friendships between men and women grow more possible every day 
6189_21305_000092_000006	train-clean-360	While as for Hallin s distrust and Anthony Craven s jealous hostility why should a third person be bound by either of them 
6189_21305_000092_000007	train-clean-360	Could any one suppose that such a temperament as Wharton s would be congenial to Hallin or to Craven or to yet another person of whom she did not want to think 
6189_21305_000092_000008	train-clean-360	Besides who wished to make a hero of him 
6189_21305_000092_000009	train-clean-360	It was the very complexity and puzzle of the character that made its force 
6189_21305_000093_000000	train-clean-360	So with a reddened cheek she lost herself a few minutes in this pleasant sense of a new wealth in life and was only roused from the dreamy running to and fro of thought by the appearance of Minta who came to clear away the tea 
6189_21305_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 Why it is close on the half hour cried Marcella springing up Where are my things 
6189_21305_000095_000000	train-clean-360	She looked down the notes of her cases satisfied herself that her bag contained all she wanted and then hastily tied on her bonnet and cloak 
6189_21305_000096_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly the room was empty for Minta had just gone away with the tea by a kind of subtle reaction the face in that photograph on Hallin s table flashed into her mind its look the grizzled hair 
6189_21305_000096_000001	train-clean-360	With an uncontrollable pang of pain she dropped her hands from the fastenings of her cloak and wrung them together in front of her a dumb gesture of contrition and of grief 
none	none	She she talk of social reform and character she give her opinion as of right on points of speculation and of ethics she whose main achievement so far had been to make a good man suffer 
6189_21305_000097_000001	train-clean-360	Something belittling and withering swept over all her estimate of herself all her pleasant self conceit 
none	none	Quietly with downcast eyes she went her way CHAPTER VII Her first case was in Brown s Buildings itself a woman suffering from bronchitis and heart complaint and tormented besides by an ulcerated foot which Marcella had now dressed daily for some weeks She lived on the top floor of one of the easterly blocks with two daughters and a son of eighteen When Marcella entered the little room it was as usual spotlessly clean and smelt of flowers The windows were open and a young woman was busy shirt ironing on a table in the centre of the room Both she and her mother looked up with smiles as Marcella entered Then they introduced her with some ceremony to a lady who was sitting beside the patient a long faced melancholy woman employed at the moment in marking linen handkerchiefs which she did with extraordinary fineness and delicacy The patient and her daughter spoke of Marcella to their friend as the young person but all with a natural courtesy and charm that could not have been surpassed Marcella knelt to undo the wrappings of the foot The woman a pale transparent creature winced painfully as the dressing was drawn off but between each half stifled moan of pain she said something eager and grateful to her nurse I never knew any one Nurse do it as gentle as you or I do take it kind of you Nurse to do it so slow oh there were a young person before you or hasn t she got nice hands missus Burton they don t never seem to jar yer Poor foot but I think it is looking better said Marcella getting up at last from her work when all was clean and comfortable and she had replaced the foot on the upturned wooden box that supported it for its owner was not in bed but sitting propped up in an old armchair And how is your cough missus Jervis Oh it s very bad nights said missus Jervis mildly disturbs Emily dreadful But I always pray every night when she lifts me into bed as I may be took before the morning an God ull do it soon Mother cried Emily pausing in her ironing you know you oughtn t to say them things missus Jervis looked at her with a sly cheerfulness Her emaciated face was paler than usual because of the pain of the dressing but from the frail form there breathed an indomitable air of life a gay courage indeed which had already struck Marcella with wonder Well yer not to take em to heart Em ly It ull be when it will be for the Lord likes us to pray but He ll take his own time an she s got troubles enough of her own Nurse D yer see as she s leff off her ring Marcella looked at Emily s left hand while the girl flushed all over and ironed with a more fiery energy than before I ve eerd such things of im Nurse this last two days she said with low vehemence as I m never goin to wear it again It ud burn me Emily was past twenty Some eighteen months before this date she had married a young painter After nearly a year of incredible misery her baby was born It died and she very nearly died also owing to the brutal ill treatment of her husband As soon as she could get on her feet again she tottered home to her widowed mother broken for the time in mind and body and filled with loathing of her tyrant He made no effort to recover her and her family set to work to mend if they could what he had done The younger sister of fourteen was earning seven shillings a week at paper bag making the brother a lad of eighteen had been apprenticed by his mother at the cost of heroic efforts some six years before to the leather currying trade in a highly skilled branch of it and was now taking sixteen shillings a week with the prospect of far better things in the future He at once put aside from his earnings enough to teach Emily the shirt ironing denying himself every indulgence till her training was over Then they had their reward Emily s colour and spirits came back her earnings made all the difference to the family between penury and ease while she and her little sister kept the three tiny rooms in which they lived and waited on their invalid mother with exquisite cleanliness and care Marcella stood by the ironing table a moment after the girl s speech Poor Emily she said softly laying her hand on the ringless one that held down the shirt on the board Emily looked up at her in silence But the girl s eyes glowed with things unsaid and inexpressible the eternal passion eternal pain which in half the human race have no voice He was a very rough man was Em ly s husband said missus Jervis in her delicate thoughtful voice a very uncultivated man Marcella turned round to her startled and amused by the adjective But the other two listeners took it quite quietly It seemed to them apparently to express what had to be said It s a sad thing is want of edication missus Jervis went on in the same tone Now there s that lady there with a little courtly wave of her hand towards missus Burton she can t read yer know Nurse and I m that sorry for her But I ve been reading to her an Emily just while my cough s quiet one of my ole tracks She held up a little paper covered tract worn with use It was called A Pennorth of Grace or a Pound of Works Marcella looked at it in respectful silence as she put on her cloak Such things were not in her line I do love a track said missus Jervis pensively That s why I don t like these buildings so well as them others Em ly Here you never get no tracks and there what with one person and another there was a new one most weeks But her voice dropped and she looked timidly first at her friend and then at Marcella she isn t a Christian Nurse Isn t it sad missus Burton a woman of a rich mahogany complexion with a black front and a mouth which turned down decisively at the corners looked up from her embroidery with severe composure No Nurse I m not a Christian she said in the tone of one stating a disagreeable fact for which they are noways responsible My brother is and my sisters real good Christian people One of my sisters married a gentleman up in Wales She as two servants an fam ly prayers reg lar But I ve never felt no call and I tell em I can t purtend An missus Jervis here she don t seem to make me see it no different She held her head erect however as though the unusually high sense of probity involved was after all some consolation missus Jervis looked at her with pathetic eyes But Emily coloured hotly Emily was a churchwoman Of course you re a Christian missus Burton she said indignantly What she means Nurse is she isn t a member of any chapel like mother But she s been baptised and confirmed for I asked her And of course she s a Christian Em ly said missus Jervis with energy Emily looked round trembling The delicate invalid was sitting bolt upright her eyes sparkling a spot of red on either hollow cheek The glances of the two women crossed there seemed to be a mute struggle between them Then Emily laid down her iron stepped quickly across to her mother and kneeling beside her threw her arms around her Have it your own way mother she said while her lip quivered I wasn t a goin to cross you missus Jervis laid her waxen cheek against her daughter s tangle of brown hair with a faint smile while her breathing which had grown quick and panting gradually subsided Emily looked up at Marcella with a terrified self reproach They all knew that any sudden excitement might kill out the struggling flame of life You ought to rest a little missus Jervis said Marcella with gentle authority You know the dressing must tire you though you won t confess it Let me put you comfortable There aren t the pillows easier so Now rest and good bye But missus Jervis held her while Emily slipped away I shall rest soon she said significantly An it hurts me when Emily talks like that It s the only thing that ever comes atween us She thinks o forms an ceremonies an I think o grace Her old woman s eyes so clear and vivid under the blanched brow searched Marcella s face for sympathy But Marcella stood shy and wondering in the presence of words and emotions she understood so little So narrow a life in these poor rooms under these crippling conditions of disease and all this preoccupation with this passion over the things not of the flesh the thwarted cabined flesh but of the spirit wonderful On coming out from Brown s Buildings she turned her steps reluctantly towards a street some distance from her own immediate neighbourhood where she had a visit to pay which filled her with repulsion and an unusual sense of helplessness A clergyman who often availed himself of the help of the saint Martin s nurses had asked the superintendent to undertake for him a difficult case Would one of their nurses go regularly to visit a certain house ostensibly for the sake of a little boy of five just come back from the hospital who required care at home for a while really for the sake of his young mother who had suddenly developed drinking habits and was on the road to ruin Marcella happened to be in the office when the letter arrived She somewhat unwillingly accepted the task and she had now paid two or three visits always dressing the child s sore leg and endeavouring to make acquaintance with the mother But in this last attempt she had not had much success missus Vincent was young and pretty with a flighty restless manner She was always perfectly civil to Marcella and grateful to her apparently for the ease she gave the boy But she offered no confidences the rooms she and her husband occupied showed them to be well to do Marcella had so far found them well kept and though the evil she was sent to investigate was said to be notorious she had as yet discovered nothing of it for herself It seemed to her that she must be either stupid or that there must be something about her which made missus Vincent more secretive with her than with others and neither alternative pleased her To day however as she stopped at the Vincents door she noticed that the doorstep which was as a rule shining white was muddy and neglected Then nobody came to open though she knocked and rang repeatedly At last a neighbour who had been watching the strange nurse through her own parlour window came out to the street I think miss she said with an air of polite mystery as you d better walk in missus Vincent asn t been enjyin very good ealth this last few days Marcella turned the handle found it yielded and went in It was after six o clock and the evening sun streamed in through a door at the back of the house But in the Vincents front parlour the blinds were all pulled down and the only sound to be heard was the fretful wailing of a child Marcella timidly opened the sitting room door The room at first seemed to her dark Then she perceived missus Vincent sitting by the grate and the two children on the floor beside her The elder the little invalid was simply staring at his mother in a wretched silence but the younger the baby of three was restlessly throwing himself hither and thither now pulling at the woman s skirts now crying lustily now whining in a hungry voice for Mama din din Mama din din missus Vincent neither moved nor spoke even when Marcella came in She sat with her hands hanging over her lap in a desolation incapable of words She was dirty and unkempt the room was covered with litter the breakfast things were still on the table and the children were evidently starving Marcella seized with pity and divining what had happened tried to rouse and comfort her But she got no answer Then she asked for matches missus Vincent made a mechanical effort to find them but subsided helpless with a shake of the head At last Marcella found them herself lit a tire of some sticks she discovered in a cupboard and put on the kettle Then she cut a slice of bread and dripping for each of the children the only eatables she could find and after she had dressed Bertie s leg she began to wash up the tea things and tidy the room not knowing very well what to be at but hoping minute by minute to get missus Vincent to speak to her In the midst of her labours an elderly woman cautiously opened the door and beckoned to her Marcella went out into the passage I m her mother miss I eered you were ere an I follered yer Oh such a business as we ad er usband an me a gettin of er ome last night There s a neighbour come to me an she says missus Lucas there s your daughter a drinkin in that public ouse an if I was you I d go and fetch her out for she s got a lot o money an she s treatin everybody all round An Charlie that s er usband ee come along too an between us we got holt on her An iver sence we brought her ome last night she set there in that cheer an niver a word to nobody Not to me t any rate nor the chillen I believe er usband an er ad words this mornin But she won t tell me nothin She sits there just heart broke the woman put up her apron to her eyes and began crying She ain t eatin nothink all day an I dursen t leave the ouse out o me sight I lives close by miss for fear of er doing erself a mischief How long has she been like this said Marcella drawing the door cautiously to behind her About fourteen month said the woman hopelessly An none of us knows why She was such a neat pretty girl when she married im an ee such a steady fellow An I ve done my best I ve talked to er an I ve id er at an her walking things an taken er money out of er pockets An bless yer she s been all right now for seven weeks till last night Oh deary deary me whatever ull become o them er an im an the children The tears coursed down the mother s wrinkled face Leave her to me a little longer said Marcella softly but come back to me in about half an hour and don t let her be alone The woman nodded and went away missus Vincent turned quickly round as Marcella came back again and spoke for the first time That was my mother you were talkin to Yes said Marcella quietly as she took the kettle off the fire Now I do want you to have a cup of tea missus Vincent Will you if I make it The poor creature did not speak but she followed Marcella s movements with her weary eyes At last when Marcella knelt down beside her holding out a cup of tea and some bread and butter she gave a sudden cry Marcella hastily put down what she carried lest it should be knocked out of her hand He struck me this morning Charlie did the first time in seven years Look here She pulled up her sleeve and on her white delicate arm she showed a large bruise As she pointed to it her eyes filled with miserable tears her lips quivered anguish breathed in every feature Yet even in this abasement Marcella was struck once more with her slim prettiness her refined air This woman drinking and treating in a low public house at midnight rescued thence by a decent husband She soothed her as best she could but when she had succeeded in making the wretched soul take food and so in putting some physical life into her she found herself the recipient of an outburst of agony before which she quailed The woman clung to her moaning about her husband about the demon instinct that had got hold of her she hardly knew how by means it seemed originally of a few weeks of low health and small self indulgences and she felt herself powerless to fight about the wreck she had brought upon her home the shame upon her husband who was the respected well paid foreman of one of the large shops of the neighbourhood All through it came back to him We had words Nurse this morning when he went out to his work He said he d nearly died of shame last night that he couldn t bear it no more that he d take the children from me And I was all queer in the head still and I sauced him and then he looked like a devil and he took me by the arm and threw me down as if I d been a sack An he never never touched me before in all his life An he s never come in all day An perhaps I shan t ever see him again An last time but it wasn t so bad as this he said he d try an love me again if I d behave An he did try and I tried too But now it s no good an perhaps he ll not come back Oh what shall I do what shall I do she flung her arms above her head Won t anybody find him won t anybody help me She dropped a hand upon Marcella s arm clutching it her wild eyes seeking her companion s But at the same moment with the very extremity of her own emotion a cloud of impotence fell upon Marcella She suddenly felt that she could do nothing that there was nothing in her adequate to such an appeal nothing strong enough to lift the weight of a human life thus flung upon her She was struck with a dryness a numbness that appalled her She tried still to soothe and comfort but nothing that she said went home took hold Between the feeling in her heart which might have reached and touched this despair and the woman before her there seemed to be a barrier she could not break Or was it that she was really barren and poor in soul and had never realised it before A strange misery rose in her too as she still knelt tending and consoling but with no efficacy no power At last missus Vincent sank into miserable quiet again The mother came in and silently began to put the children to bed Marcella pressed the wife s cold hand and went out hanging her head She had just reached the door when it opened and a man entered A thrill passed through her at the sight of his honest haggard face and this time she found what to say I have been sitting by your wife mister Vincent She is very ill and miserable and very penitent You will be kind to her The husband looked at her and then turned away God help us he said and Marcella went without another word and with that same wild unaccustomed impulse of prayer rilling her being which had first stirred in her at Mellor at the awful moment of Hurd s death She was very silent and distracted at tea and afterwards saying that she must write some letters and reports she shut herself up and bade good night to Minta and the children But she did not write or read She hung at the window a long time watching the stars come out as the summer light died from the sky and even the walls and roofs and chimneys of this interminable London spread out before her took a certain dim beauty And then slipping down on the floor with her head against a chair an attitude of her stormy childhood she wept with an abandonment and a passion she had not known for years She thought of missus Jervis the saint so near to death so satisfied with grace so steeped in the heavenly life then of the poor sinner she had just left and of the agony she had no power to stay Both experiences had this in common that each had had some part in plunging her deeper into this darkness of self contempt What had come to her Daring the past weeks there had been something wrestling in her some new birth some conviction of sin as missus Jervis would have said As she looked back over all her strenuous youth she hated it What was wrong with her Her own word to Anthony Craven returned upon her mocked her made now a scourge for her own pride not a mere measure of blame for others Aldous Raeburn her father and mother her poor one and all rose against her plucked at her reproached her Aye what indeed are wealth and poverty cried a voice which was the voice of them all what are opinions what is influence beauty cleverness what is anything worth but character but soul And character soul can only be got by self surrender and self surrender comes not of knowledge but of love A number of thoughts and phrases hitherto of little meaning to her floated into her mind sank and pressed there That strange word grace for instance A year ago it would not have smitten or troubled her After her first inevitable reaction against the evangelical training of her school years the rebellious cleverness of youth had easily decided that religion was played out that Socialism and Science were enough for mankind But nobody could live in hospital nobody could go among the poor nobody could share the thoughts and hopes of people like Edward Hallin and his sister without understanding that it is still here in the world this grace that sustaineth however variously interpreted still living and working as it worked of old among the little Galilean towns in Jerusalem in Corinth To Edward Hallin it did not mean the same perhaps as it meant to the hard worked clergymen she knew or to missus Jervis But to all it meant the motive power of life something subduing transforming delivering something that to night she envied with a passion and a yearning that amazed herself How many things she craved as an eager child craves them First some moral change she knew not what then Aldous Raeburn s pardon and friendship then and above all the power to lose herself the power to love Dangerous significant moment in a woman s life moment at once of despair and of illusion CHAPTER VIII Wharton was sitting in a secluded corner of the library of the House of Commons He had a number of loose sheets of paper on a chair beside him and others in his hand and on his knee It was Friday afternoon questions were going on in the House and he was running rapidly for the last time through the notes of his speech pencilling here and there and every now and then taking up a volume of Hansard that lay near that he might verify a quotation An old county member with a rugged face and eye glasses who had been in Parliament for a generation came to the same corner to look up a speech He glanced curiously at Wharton with whom he had a familiar House of Commons acquaintance Nervous eh he said as he put on his eye glasses to inspect first Wharton then the dates on the backs of the Reports Wharton put his papers finally together and gave a long stretch Not particularly Well it s a beastly audience said the other carrying off his book Wharton lost apparently in contemplation of the ceiling fell into a dreamy attitude But his eye saw nothing of the ceiling and was not at all dreamy He was not thinking of his speech nor of the other man s remark He was thinking of Marcella Boyce When he left her the other day he had been conscious only more vividly and intensely more possessively as it were than she of the same general impression that had been left upon her A new opening for pleasure their meeting presented itself to him too in the same way What had he been about all this time Forget such a creature Why it was the merest wantonness As if such women with such a brow such vitality such a gait passed in every street What possessed him now was an imperious eagerness to push the matter to recover the old intimacy and as to what might come out of it let the gods decide He could have had but a very raw appreciation of her at Mellor It seemed to him that she had never forced him to think of her then in absence as he had thought of her since the last meeting As for the nursing business and the settlement in Brown s Buildings it was of course mere play acting No doubt when she emerged she would be all the more of a personage for having done it But she must emerge soon To rule and shine was as much her metier as it was the metier of a bricklayer s labourer to carry hods By George what would not Lady Selina give for beauty of such degree and kind as that They must be brought together He already foresaw that the man who should launch Marcella Boyce in London would play a stroke for himself as well as for her And she must be launched in London Let other people nurse and pitch their tents in little workmen s flats and live democracy instead of preaching it Her fate was fixed for her by her physique Il ne faut pas sortir de son caractere The sight of Bennett approaching distracted him Bennett s good face showed obvious vexation He sticks to it he said as Wharton jumped up to meet him Talks of his conscience and a lot of windy stuff He seems to have arranged it with the Whips I dare say he won t do much harm Except to himself said Wharton with dry bitterness Goodness let s leave him alone He and Bennett lingered a few minutes discussing points of tactics Wilkins had of course once more declared himself the enfant terrible of a party which though still undefined was drawing nearer day by day to organised existence and separate leadership The effect of to night s debate might be of far reaching importance Wharton s Resolution pledging the House to a Legal Eight Hours Day for all trades came at the end of a long and varied agitation was at the moment in clear practical relation to labour movements all over the country and had in fact gained greatly in significance and interest since it was first heard of in public owing to events of current history Workable proposals a moderate tone and the appearance at any rate of harmony and a united front among the representatives of labour if so much at least could be attained to night both Wharton and Bennett believed that not only the cause itself but the importance of the Labour party in the House would be found to have gained enormously I hope I shall get my turn before dinner said Bennett as he was going I want badly to get off for an hour or so The division won t be till half past ten at earliest Wharton stood for a moment in a brown study with his hands in his pockets after Bennett left him It was by no means wholly clear to him what line Bennett would take with regard to one or two points After a long acquaintance with the little man Wharton was not always nor indeed generally at his ease with him Bennett had curious reserves As to his hour off Wharton felt tolerably certain that he meant to go and hear a famous Revivalist preacher hold forth at a public hall not far from the House The streets were full of placards Well to every man his own excitements What time He looked first at his watch then at the marked question paper Bennett had left behind him The next minute he was hurrying along passages and stairs with his springing boyish step to the Ladies Gallery The magnificent doorkeeper saluted him with particular deference Wharton was in general a favourite with officials The two ladies are come sir You ll find them in the front oh not very full yet sir will be directly Wharton drew aside the curtain of the Gallery and looked in Yes there was the dark head bent forward pressed indeed against the grating which closes the front of the den into which the House of Commons puts its ladies as though its owner were already absorbed in what was passing before her She looked up with an eager start as she heard his voice in her ear Oh now come and tell us everything and who everybody is Why don t we see the Speaker and which is the Government side oh yes I see And who s this speaking now Why I thought you knew everything said Wharton as with a greeting to Miss Craven he slipped in beside them and took a still vacant chair for an instant How shall I instruct a Speaker s great niece Why of course I feel as if the place belonged to me said Marcella impatiently but that somehow doesn t seem to help me to people s names Where s mister Gladstone Oh I see Look look Edith he s just come in oh don t be so superior though you have been here before you couldn t tell me heaps of people Her voice had a note of joyous excitement like a child s That s because I m short sighted said Edith Craven calmly but it s no reason why you should show me mister Gladstone Oh my dear my dear do be quiet Now mister Wharton where are the Irishmen Oh I wish we could have an Irish row And where do you sit I see and there s mister Bennett and that black faced man mister Wilkins I met at the Hallins you don t like him do you she said drawing back and looking at him sharply Who Wilkins Perhaps you d better ask me that question later on said Wharton with a twist of the lip he s going to do his best to make a fool of himself and us to night we shall see It s kind of you to wish us an Irish row considering that if I miss my chance to night I shall never get another Then for heaven s sake don t let s wish it she said decidedly Oh that s the Irish Secretary answering now is it a pause Dear me how civil everybody is I don t think this is a good place for a Democrat mister Wharton I find myself terribly in love with the Government But who s that She craned her neck Wharton was silent The next instant she drew hurriedly back I didn t see she murmured it s so confusing A tall man had risen from the end of the Government bench and was giving an answer connected with the Home Secretary s department For the first time since their parting in the Mellor drawing room Marcella saw Aldous Raeburn She fell very silent and leant back in her chair Yet Wharton s quick glance perceived that she both looked and listened intently so long as the somewhat high pitched voice was speaking He does those things very well he said carelessly judging it best to take the bull by the horns Never a word too much they don t get any change out of him Do you see that old fellow in the white beard under the gallery He is one of the chartered bores When he gets up to night the House will dine I shall come up and look for you and hand you over to a friend if I may a Staffordshire member who has his wife here missus Lane I have engaged a table and I can start with you Unfortunately I mustn t be long out of the House as it s my motion but they will look after you The girls glanced a little shyly at each other Nothing had been said about dining but Wharton took it for granted and they yielded It was Marcella s day off and she was a free woman Good bye then he said getting up I shall be on in about twenty minutes Wish me well through Marcella looked round and smiled But her vivacity had been quenched for the moment and Wharton departed not quite so well heartened for the fray as he could have wished to be It was hard luck that the Raeburn ghost should walk this particular evening Marcella bent forward again when he had gone and remained for long silent looking down into the rapidly filling House Aldous Raeburn was lying back on the Treasury bench his face upturned She knew very well that it was impossible he should see her yet every now and then she shrank a little away as though he must The face looked to her older and singularly blanched but she supposed that must be the effect of the light for she noticed the same pallor in many others All that my life can do to pour good measure down running over into yours I vowed you then The words stole into her memory throbbing there like points of pain Was it indeed this man under her eyes so listless so unconscious who had said them to her with a passion of devotion it shamed her to think of And now never so much as an ordinary word of friendship between them again On the broad seas of life enisled separate estranged for ever It was like the touch of death the experience brought with it such a chill such a sense of irreparable fact of limitations never to be broken through Then she braced herself The things that are behind must be left To have married him after all would have been the greatest wrong Nor in one sense was what she had done irreparable She chose to believe Frank Leven rather than Edward Hallin Of course he must and should marry It was absurd to suppose that he should not No one had a stronger sense of family than he And as for the girl the little dancing flirting girl why the thing happened every day His wife should not be too strenuous taken up with problems and questions of her own She should cheer amuse distract him Marcella endeavoured to think of it all with the dry common sense her mother would have applied to it One thing at least was clear to her the curious recognition that never before had she considered Aldous Raeburn in and for himself as an independent human being He was just a piece of furniture in my play last year she said to herself with a pang of frank remorse He was well quit of me But she was beginning to recover her spirits and when at last Raeburn after a few words with a minister who had just arrived disappeared suddenly behind the Speaker s chair the spectacle below her seized her with the same fascination as before The House was filling rapidly Questions were nearly over and the speech of the evening on which considerable public expectation both inside and outside Parliament had been for some time concentrated was fast approaching Peers were straggling into the gallery the reporters were changing just below her and some crack hands among them who had been lounging till now were beginning to pay attention and put their paper in order The Irish benches the Opposition the Government all were full and there was a large group of members round the door There he is cried Marcella involuntarily with a pulse of excitement as Wharton s light young figure made its way through the crowd He sat down on a corner seat below the gangway and put on his hat In five minutes more he was on his feet speaking to an attentive and crowded House in a voice clear a little hard but capable of the most accomplished and subtle variety which for the first moment sent a shudder of memory through Marcella Then she found herself listening with as much trepidation and anxiety as though some personal interest and reputation depended for her too on the success of the speech Her mind was first invaded by a strong an irritable sense of the difficulty of the audience How was it possible for any one unless he had been trained to it for years to make any effect upon such a crowd so irresponsive individualist unfused so lacking as it seemed to the raw spectator in the qualities and excitements that properly belong to multitude Half the men down below under their hats seemed to her asleep the rest indifferent And were those languid indistinguishable murmurs what the newspapers call cheers But the voice below flowed on point after point came briskly out the atmosphere warmed and presently this first impression passed into one wholly different nay at the opposite pole Gradually the girl s ardent sense informed perhaps more richly than most women s with the memories of history and literature for in her impatient way she had been at all times a quick omnivorous reader awoke to the peculiar conditions the special thrill attaching to the place and its performers The philosopher derides it the man of letters out of the House talks of it with a smile as a Ship of Fools both when occasion offers passionately desire a seat in it each would give his right hand to succeed in it Why Because here after all is power here is the central machine Here are the men who both by their qualities and their defects are to have for their span of life the leading or the wrecking of this great fate bearing force this weary Titan we call our country Here things are not only debated but done lamely or badly perhaps but still done which will affect our children s children which link us to the Past which carry us on safely or dangerously to a Future only the gods know And in this passage this chequered doubtful passage from thinking to doing an infinite savour and passion of life is somehow disengaged It penetrates through the boredom through all the failure public and personal it enwraps the spectacle and the actors it carries and supports patriot and adventurer alike Ideas perceptions of this kind the first chill over stole upon and conquered Marcella Presently it was as though she had passed into Wharton s place was seeing with his eyes feeling with his nerves It would be a success this speech it was a success The House was gained was attentive A case long familiar to it in portions and fragments which had been spoilt by violence and discredited by ignorance was being presented to it with all the resources of a great talent with brilliancy moderation practical detail moderation above all From the slight historical sketch with which the speech opened of the English working day the causes and the results of the Factory Acts through the general description of the present situation of the workman s present hours opportunities and demands the growth of the desire for State control the machinery by which it was to be enforced and the effects it might be expected to have on the workman himself on the great army of the unemployed on wages on production and on the economic future of England the speaker carried his thread of luminous speech without ever losing his audience for an instant At every point he addressed himself to the smoothing of difficulties to the propitiation of fears and when after the long and masterly handling of detail he came to his peroration to the bantering of capitalist terrors to the vindication of the workman s claim to fix the conditions of his labour and to the vision lightly and simply touched of the regenerate working home of the future inhabited by free men dedicated to something beyond the first brutal necessities of the bodily life possessed indeed of its proper share of the human inheritance of leisure knowledge and delight the crowded benches before and behind him grudged him none of it The House of Commons is not tolerant of flights except from its chartered masters But this young man had earned his flight and they heard him patiently For the rest the Government had been most attractively wooed and the Liberal party in the midst of much plain speaking had been treated on the whole with a deference and a forbearance that had long been conspicuously lacking in the utterances of the Labour men The mildest mannered man et cetera said a smiling member of the late Government to a companion on the front Opposition bench as Wharton sat down amid the general stir and movement which betoken the break up of a crowded House and the end of a successful speech which people are eager to discuss in the lobbies A fine performance eh Great advance on anything last year Bears about as much relation to facts as I do to the angels growled the man addressed What as bad as that said the other laughing Look they have put up old Denny I think I shall stay and hear him And he laid down his hat again which he had taken up Meanwhile Marcella in the Ladies Gallery had thrown herself back in her chair with a long breath How can one listen to anything else she said and for a long time she sat staring at the House without hearing a word of what the very competent caustic and well informed manufacturer on the Government side was saying Every dramatic and aesthetic instinct she possessed and she was full of them had been stirred and satisfied by the speech and the speaker But more than that He had spoken for the toiler and the poor his peroration above all had contained tones and accents which were in fact the products of something perfectly sincere in the speaker s motley personality and this girl who in her wild way had given herself to the poor had followed him with all her passionate heart Yet at the same time with an amount of intellectual dissent every now and then as to measures and methods a scepticism of detail which astonished herself A year before she had been as a babe beside him whether in matters of pure mind or of worldly experience Now she was for the first time conscious of a curious growth independence But the intellectual revolt such as it was was lost again as soon as it arose in the general impression which the speech had left upon her in this warm quickening of the pulses this romantic interest in the figure the scene the young emerging personality Edith Craven looked at her with wondering amusement She and her brothers were typical Venturists a little cynical therefore towards all the world friend or foe A Venturist is a Socialist minus cant and a cause which cannot exist at all without a passion of sentiment lays it down through him as a first law that sentiment in public is the abominable thing Edith Craven thought that after all Marcella was little less raw and simple now than she had been in the old days There said Marcella with relief that s done Now who s this That man Wilkins Her tone showed her disgust Wilkins had sprung up the instant Wharton s Conservative opponent had given the first decisive sign of sitting down Another man on the same side was also up but Wilkins black and frowning held his own stubbornly and his rival subsided With the first sentences of the new speech the House knew that it was to have an emotion and men came trooping in again And certainly the short stormy utterance was dramatic enough Dissent on the part of an important north country Union from some of the most vital machinery of the bill which had been sketched by Wharton personal jealousy and distrust of the mover of the resolution denial of his representative place and sneers at his kid gloved attempts to help a class with which he had nothing to do the most violent protest against the servility with which he had truckled to the now effete party of free contract and political enfranchisement and the most passionate assertion that between any Labour party worthy of the name and either of the great parties of the past there lay and must lie a gulf of hatred unfathomable and unquenchable till Labour had got its rights and landlord employer and dividend hunter were trampled beneath its heel all these ugly or lurid things emerged with surprising clearness from the torrent of north country speech For twenty minutes Nehemiah Wilkins rioted in one of the best times of his life That he was an orator thousands of working men had borne him witness again and again and in his own opinion he had never spoken better The House at first enjoyed its sensation Then as the hard words rattled on it passed easily into the stage of amusement Lady Cradock s burly husband bent forward from the front Opposition bench caught Wharton s eye and smiled as though to say What you haven t even been able to keep up appearances so far And Wilkins s final attack upon the Liberals who after ruining their own chances and the chances of the country were now come cap in hand to the working man whining for his support as their only hope of recovery was delivered to a mocking chorus of laughter and cheers in the midst of which with an angry shake of his great shoulders he flung himself down on his seat Meanwhile Wharton who had spent the first part of Wilkins s speech in a state of restless fidget his hat over his eyes was alternately sitting erect with radiant looks or talking rapidly to Bennett who had come to sit beside him The Home Secretary got up after Wilkins had sat down and spent a genial forty minutes in delivering the Government non possumus couched of course in the tone of deference to King Labour which the modern statesman learns at his mother s knee but enlivened with a good deal of ironical and effective perplexity as to which hand to shake and whose voice to follow and winding up with a tribute of compliment to Wharton mixed with some neat mock condolence with the Opposition under the ferocities of some others of its nominal friends Altogether the finished performance of the old stager the habitue While it was going on Marcella noticed that Aldous Raeburn had come back again to his seat next to the Speaker who was his official chief Every now and then the Minister turned to him and Raeburn handed him a volume of Hansard or the copy of some Parliamentary Return whence the great man was to quote Marcella watched every movement then from the Government bench her eye sped across the House to Wharton sitting once more buried in his hat his arms folded in front of him A little shiver of excitement ran through her The two men upon whom her life had so far turned were once more in presence of pitted against each other and she once more looking on When the Home Secretary sat down the House was growing restive with thoughts of dinner and a general movement had begun when it was seen that Bennett was up Again men who had gone out came back and those who were still there resigned themselves Bennett was a force in the House a man always listened to and universally respected and the curiosity felt as to the relations between him and this new star and would be leader had been for some time considerable When Bennett sat down the importance of the member for West Brookshire both in the House and in the country had risen a hundred per cent A man who over a great part of the north was in labour concerns the unquestioned master of many legions and whose political position had hitherto been one of conspicuous moderation even to his own hurt had given Wharton the warmest possible backing had endorsed his proposals to their most contentious and doubtful details and in a few generous though still perhaps ambiguous words had let the House see what he personally thought of the services rendered to labour as a whole during the past five years and to the weak and scattered group of Labour members in particular since his entrance into Parliament by the young and brilliant man beside him Bennett was no orator He was a plain man ennobled by the training of religious dissent at the same time indifferently served often by an imperfect education But the very simplicity and homeliness of its expression gave additional weight to this first avowal of a strong conviction that the time had come when the Labour party must have separateness and a leader if it were to rise out of insignificance to this frank renunciation of whatever personal claims his own past might have given him and to the promise of unqualified support to the policy of the younger man in both its energetic and conciliatory aspects He threw out a little not unkindly indignation if one may be allowed the phrase in the direction of Wilkins who in the middle of the speech abruptly walked out and before he sat down the close attention the looks the cheers the evident excitement of the men sitting about him amongst whom were two thirds of the whole Labour representation in Parliament made it clear to the House that the speech marked an epoch not only in the career of Harry Wharton but in the parliamentary history of the great industrial movement The white bearded bore under the gallery whom Wharton had pointed out to Marcella got up as Bennett subsided The house streamed out like one man Bennett exhausted by the heat and the effort mopped his brow with his red handkerchief and in the tension of fatigue started as he felt a touch upon his arm Wharton was bending over to him perfectly white with a lip he in vain tried to steady I can t thank you he said I should make a fool of myself Bennett nodded pleasantly and presently both were pressing into the out going crowd avoiding each other with the ineradicable instinct of the Englishman Wharton did not recover his self control completely till after an ordeal of talk and handshaking in the lobby he was on his way to the Ladies Gallery Then in a flash he found himself filled with the spirits the exhilaration of a schoolboy This wonderful experience behind him and upstairs waiting for him those eyes that face How could he get her to himself somehow for a moment and dispose of that Craven girl Well he said to her joyously as she turned round in the darkness of the Gallery But she was seized with sudden shyness and he felt rather than saw the glow of pleasure and excitement which possessed her Don t let s talk here she said Can t we go out I am melted Yes of course Come on to the terrace It s a divine evening and we shall find our party there Well Miss Craven were you interested Edith smiled demurely I thought it a good debate she said Confound these Venturist prigs was Wharton s inward remark as he led the way CHAPTER IX How enchanting cried Marcella as they emerged on the terrace and river shore and sky opened upon them in all the thousand tinted light and shade of a still and perfect evening Oh how hot we were and how badly you treat us in those dens Those confident eyes of Wharton s shone as they glanced at her She wore a pretty white dress of some cotton stuff it seemed to him he remembered it of old and on the waving masses of hair lay a little bunch of black lace that called itself a bonnet with black strings tied demurely under the chin The abundance of character and dignity in the beauty which yet to night was so young and glowing the rich arresting note of the voice the inimitable carriage of the head Wharton realised them all at the moment with peculiar vividness because he felt them in some sort as additions to his own personal wealth To night she was in his power his possession The terrace was full of people and alive with a Babel of talk Yet as he carried his companions forward in search of missus Lane he saw that Marcella was instantly marked Every one who passed them or made way for them looked and looked again The girl absorbed in her pleasant or agitating impressions knew nothing of her own effect She was drinking in the sunset light the poetic mystery of the river the lovely line of the bridge the associations of the place where she stood of this great building overshadowing her Every now and then she started in a kind of terror lest some figure in the dusk should be Aldous Raeburn then when a stranger showed himself she gave herself up again to her young pleasure in the crowd and the spectacle But Wharton knew that she was observed Wharton caught the whisper that followed her His vanity already so well fed this evening took the attention given to her as so much fresh homage to itself and she had more and more glamour for him in the reflected light of this publicity this common judgment Ah here are the Lanes he said detecting at last a short lady in black amid a group of men Marcella and Edith were introduced Then Edith found a friend in a young London member who was to be one of the party and strolled off with him till dinner should be announced I will just take Miss Boyce to the end of the terrace said Wharton to mister Lane we shan t get anything to eat yet awhile What a crowd The Alresfords not come yet I see Lane shrugged his shoulders as he looked round Raeburn has a party to night And there are at least three or four others besides ourselves I should think food and service will be equally scarce Wharton glanced quickly at Marcella But she was talking to missus Lane and had heard nothing Let me just show you the terrace he said to her No chance of dinner for another twenty minutes They strolled away together As they moved along a number of men waylaid the speaker of the night with talk and congratulations glancing the while at the lady on his left But presently they were away from the crowd which hung about the main entrance to the terrace and had reached the comparatively quiet western end where were only a few pairs and groups walking up and down Shall I see mister Bennett she asked him eagerly as they paused by the parapet looking down upon the grey brown water swishing under the fast incoming tide I want to I asked him to dine but he wouldn t He has gone to a prayer meeting at least I guess so There is a famous American evangelist speaking in Westminster to night I am as certain as I ever am of anything that Bennett is there dining on Moody and Sankey Men are a medley don t you think So you liked his speech How coolly you ask she said laughing Did you He was silent a moment his smiling gaze fixed on the water Then he turned to her How much gratitude do you think I owe him As much as you can pay she said with emphasis I never heard anything more complete more generous So you were carried away She looked at him with a curious sudden gravity a touch of defiance No neither by him nor by you I don t believe in your Bill and I am sure you will never carry it Wharton lifted his eyebrows Perhaps you ll tell me where you are he said that I may know how to talk When we last discussed these things at Mellor I think you were a Socialist What does it matter what I was last year she asked him gaily yet with a final inflection of the voice which was not gay I was a baby Now perhaps I have earned a few poor little opinions but they are a ragged bundle and I have never any time to sort them Have you left the Venturists No but I am full of perplexities and the Cravens I see will soon be for turning me out You understand I know some working folk now So you did last year No she insisted shaking her head that was all different But now I am in their world I live with them and they talk to me One evening in the week I am at home for all the people I know in our Buildings men and women missus Hurd you know who I mean her brow contracted a moment she comes with her sewing to keep me company so does Edith Craven and sometimes the little room is packed The men smoke when we can have the windows open and I believe I shall soon smoke too it makes them talk better We get all sorts Socialists Conservatives Radicals And you don t think much of the Socialists Well they are the interesting dreamy fellows she said laughing who don t save and muddle their lives And as for argument the Socialist workman doesn t care twopence for facts that don t suit him It s superb the way he treats them I should like to know who does care said Wharton with a shrug Then he turned with his back to the parapet the better to command her He had taken off his hat for coolness and the wind played with the crisp curls of hair But tell me he went on who has been tampering with you Is it Hallin You told me you saw him often Perhaps But what if it s everything living saving your presence A year ago at any rate the world was all black or white to me Now I lie awake at night puzzling my head about the shades between which makes the difference A compulsory Eight Hours Day for all men in all trades Her note of scorn startled him You know you won t get it And all the other big exasperating things you talk about public organisation of labour and the rest you won t get them till all the world is a New Jerusalem and when the world is a New Jerusalem nobody will want them Wharton made her an ironical bow Nicely said though we have heard it before Upon my word you have marched or Edward Hallin has carried you So now you think the poor are as well off as possible in the best of all possible worlds is that the result of your nursing You agree with Denny in fact the man who got up after me His tone annoyed her Then suddenly the name suggested to her a recollection that brought a frown That was the man then you attacked in the Clarion this morning Ah you read me said Wharton with sudden pleasure Yes that opened the campaign As you know of course Craven has gone down and the strike begins next week Soon we shall bring two batteries to bear he letting fly as correspondent and I from the office I enjoyed writing that article So I should think she said drily all I know is it made one reader passionately certain that there was another side to the matter There may not be I dare say there isn t but on me at least that was the effect Why is it she broke out with vehemence that not a single Labour paper is ever capable of the simplest justice to an opponent You think any other sort of paper is any better he asked her scornfully I dare say not But that doesn t matter to me it is we who talk of justice of respect and sympathy from man to man and then we go and blacken the men who don t agree with us whole classes that is to say of our fellow countrymen not in the old honest slashing style Tartuffes that we are but with all the delicate methods of a new art of slander pursued almost for its own sake We know so much better always than our opponents we hardly condescend even to be angry One is only sorry obliged to punish like the priggish governess of one s childhood In spite of himself Wharton flushed My best thanks he said Anything more I prefer to take my drubbing all at once She looked at him steadily Why did you write or allow that article on the West Brookshire landlords two days ago Wharton started Well wasn t it true No she said with a curling lip and I think you know it wasn t true What as to the Raeburns Upon my word I should have imagined he said slowly that it represented your views at one time with tolerable accuracy Her nerve suddenly deserted her She bent over the parapet and taking up a tiny stone that lay near she threw it unsteadily into the river He saw the hand shake Look here he said turning round so that he too leant over the river his arms on the parapet his voice close to her ear Are you always going to quarrel with me like this Don t you know that there is no one in the world I would sooner please if I could She did not speak In the first place he said laughing as to my speech do you suppose that I believe in that Bill which I described just now I don t know she said indignantly once more playing with the stones on the wall It sounded like it That is my gift my little carillon as Renan would say But do you imagine I want you or any one else to tell me that we shan t get such a Bill for generations Of course we shan t Then why do you make farcical speeches bamboozling your friends and misleading the House of Commons He saw the old storm signs with glee the lightning in the eye the rose on the cheek She was never so beautiful as when she was angry Because my dear lady we must generate our force Steam must be got up I am engaged in doing it We shan t get a compulsory eight hours day for all trades but in the course of the agitation for that precious illusion and by the help of a great deal of beating of tom toms and gathering of clans we shall get a great many other things by the way that we do want Hearten your friends and frighten your enemies there is no other way of scoring in politics and the particular score doesn t matter Now don t look at me as if you would like to impeach me or I shall turn the tables I am still fighting for my illusions in my own way you it seems have given up yours But for once he had underrated her sense of humour She broke into a low merry laugh which a little disconcerted him You mock me he said quickly think me insincere unscrupulous Well I dare say But you have no right to mock me Last year again and again you promised me guerdon Now it has come to paying and I claim His low distinct voice in her ear had a magnetising effect upon her She slowly turned her face to him overcome by yet fighting against memory If she had seen in him the smallest sign of reference to that scene she hated to think of he would have probably lost this hold upon her on the spot But his tact was perfect She saw nothing but a look of dignity and friendship which brought upon her with a rush all those tragic things they had shared and fought through purifying things of pity and fear which had so often seemed to her the atonement for the washing away of that old baseness He saw her face tremble a little Then she said proudly I promised to be grateful So I am No no he said still in the same low tone You promised me a friend Where is she She made no answer Her hands were hanging loosely over the water and her eyes were fixed on the haze opposite whence emerged the blocks of the great hospital and the twinkling points of innumerable lamps But his gaze compelled her at last and she turned back to him He saw an expression half hostile half moved and pressed on before she could speak Why do you bury yourself in that nursing life he said drily It is not the life for you it does not fit you in the least You test your friends she cried her cheek flaming again at the provocative change of voice What possible right have you to that remark I know you and I know the causes you want to serve You can t serve them where you are Nursing is not for you you are wanted among your own class among your equals among the people who are changing and shaping England It is absurd You are masquerading She gave him a little sarcastic nod Thank you I am doing a little honest work for the first time in my life He laughed It was impossible to tell whether he was serious or posing You are just what you were in one respect terribly in the right Be a little humble to night for a change Come condescend to the classes Do you see mister Lane calling us And in fact mister Lane with his arm in the air was eagerly beckoning to them from the distance Do you know Lady Selina Farrell he asked her as they walked quickly back to the dispersing crowd No who is she Wharton laughed Providence should contrive to let Lady Selina overhear that question once a week in your tone Well she is a personage Lord Alresford s daughter unmarried rich has a salon or thinks she has manipulates a great many people s fortunes and lives or thinks she does which after all is what matters to Lady Selina She wants to know you badly Do you think you can be kind to her There she is you will let me introduce you She dines with us In another moment Marcella had been introduced to a tall fair lady in a very fashionable black and pink bonnet who held out a gracious hand I have heard so much of you said Lady Selina as they walked along the passage to the dining room together It must be so wonderful your nursing Marcella laughed rather restively No I don t think it is she said there are so many of us Oh but the things you do mister Wharton told me so interesting Marcella said nothing and as to her looks the passage was dark Lady Selina thought her a very handsome but very gauche young woman Still gauche or no she had thrown over Aldous Raeburn and thirty thousand a year an act which as Lady Selina admitted put you out of the common run Do you know most of the people dining she enquired in her blandest voice But no doubt you do You are a great friend of mister Wharton s I think He stayed at our house last year said Marcella abruptly No I don t know anybody Then shall I tell you It makes it more interesting doesn t it It ought to be a pleasant little party And the great lady lightly ran over the names It seemed to Marcella that most of them were very smart or very important Some of the smart names were vaguely known to her from Miss Raeburn s talk of last year and besides there were a couple of Tory Cabinet ministers and two or three prominent members It was all rather surprising At dinner she found herself between one of the Cabinet ministers and the young and good looking private secretary of the other Both men were agreeable and very willing besides to take trouble with this unknown beauty The minister who knew the Raeburns very well was discussing with himself all the time whether this was indeed the Miss Boyce of that story His suspicion and curiosity were at any rate sufficiently strong to make him give himself much pains to draw her out Her own conversation however was much distracted by the attention she could not help giving to her host and his surroundings Wharton had Lady Selina on his right and the young and distinguished wife of Marcella s minister on his left At the other end of the table sat missus Lane doing her duty spasmodically to Lord Alresford who still in a blind old age gave himself all the airs of the current statesman and possible premier But the talk on the whole was general a gay and careless give and take of parliamentary social and racing gossip the ball flying from one accustomed hand to another And Marcella could not get over the astonishment of Wharton s part in it She shut her eyes sometimes for an instant and tried to see him as her girl s fancy had seen him at Mellor the solitary eccentric figure pursued by the hatreds of a renounced Patricianate bringing the enmity of his own order as a pledge and offering to the Plebs he asked to lead Where even was the speaker of an hour ago Chat of Ascot and of Newmarket discussion with Lady Selina or with his left hand neighbour of country house sets with a patter of names which sounded in her scornful ear like a paragraph from the World above all a general air of easy comradeship which no one at this table at any rate seemed inclined to dispute with every exclusiveness and every amusement of the idle rich whereof in the popular idea he was held to be one of the very particular foes No doubt as the dinner moved on this first impression changed somewhat She began to distinguish notes that had at first been lost upon her She caught the mocking ambiguous tone under which she herself had so often fumed she watched the occasional recoil of the women about him as though they had been playing with some soft pawed animal and had been suddenly startled by the gleam of its claws These things puzzled partly propitiated her But on the whole she was restless and hostile How was it possible from such personal temporising such a frittering of the forces and sympathies to win the single mindedness and the power without which no great career is built She wanted to talk with him reproach him Well I must go worse luck said Wharton at last laying down his napkin and rising Lane will you take charge I will join you outside later If he ever finds us said her neighbour to Marcella I never saw the place so crowded It is odd how people enjoy these scrambling meals in these very ugly rooms Marcella smiling looked down with him over the bare coffee tavern place in which their party occupied a sort of high table across the end while two other small gatherings were accommodated in the space below Are there any other rooms than this she asked idly One more said a young man across the table who had been introduced to her in the dusk outside and had not yet succeeded in getting her to look at him as he desired But there is another big party there to night Raeburn you know he went on innocently addressing the minister he has got the Winterbournes and the Macdonalds quite a gathering rather an unusual thing for him The minister glanced quickly at his companion But she had turned to answer a question from Lady Selina and thenceforward till the party rose she gave him little opportunity of observing her As the outward moving stream of guests was once more in the corridor leading to the terrace Marcella hurriedly made her way to missus Lane I think she said I am afraid we ought to be going my friend and I Perhaps mister Lane perhaps he would just show us the way out we can easily find a cab There was an imploring urgent look in her face which struck missus Lane But mister Lane s loud friendly voice broke in from behind My dear Miss Boyce we can t possibly allow it no no just half an hour while they bring us our coffee to do your homage you know to the terrace and the river and the moon And then if you don t want to go back to the House for the division we will see you safely into your cab Look at the moon and the tide they had come to the wide door opening on the terrace aren t they doing their very best for you Marcella looked behind her in despair Where was Edith Far in the rear and fully occupied apparently with two or three pleasant companions She could not help herself She was carried on with mister Lane chatting beside her though the sight of the shining terrace with its moonlit crowd of figures breathed into her a terror and pain she could hardly control Come and look at the water she said to mister Lane I would rather not walk up and down if you don t mind He thought she was tired and politely led her through the sitting or promenading groups till once more she was leaning over the parapet now trying to talk now to absorb herself in the magic of bridge river and sky but in reality listening all the time with a shrinking heart for the voices and the footfalls that she dreaded Lady Winterbourne above all How unlucky It was only that morning that she had received a forwarded letter from that old friend asking urgently for news and her address Well how did you like the speech to night the speech said mister Lane a genial Gladstonian member more heavily weighted with estates than with ideas It was splendid wasn t it in the way of speaking Speeches like that are a safety valve that s my view of it Have em out all these ideas get em discussed with a good humoured shake of the head for emphasis Does nobody any harm and may do good I can tell you Miss Boyce the House of Commons is a capital place for taming these clever young men you must give them their head and they make excellent fellows after a bit Why who s this My dear Lady Winterbourne this is a sight for sair een And the portly member with great effusion grasped the hand of a stately lady in black whose abundant white hair caught the moonlight Marcella cried a woman s voice Yes there he was close behind Lady Winterbourne In the soft darkness he and his party had run upon the two persons talking over the wall without an idea a suspicion She hurriedly withdrew herself from Lady Winterbourne hesitated a second then held out her hand to him The light was behind him She could not see his face in the darkness but she was suddenly and strangely conscious of the whole scene of the great dark building with its lines of fairy lit gothic windows the blue gulf of the river crossed by lines of wavering light the swift passage of a steamer with its illuminated saloon and crowded deck of the wonderful mixture of moonlight and sunset in the air and sky of this dark figure in front of her Their hands touched Was there a murmured word from him She did not know she was too agitated too unhappy to hear it if there was She threw herself upon Lady Winterbourne in whom she divined at once a tremor almost equal to her own Oh do come with me come away I want to talk to you she said incoherently under her breath drawing Lady Winterbourne with a strong hand Lady Winterbourne yielded bewildered and they moved along the terrace Oh my dear my dear cried the elder lady to think of finding you here How astonishing how how dreadful No I don t mean that Of course you and he must meet but it was only yesterday he told me he had never seen you again since and it gave me a turn I was very foolish just now There now stay here a moment and tell me about yourself And again they paused by the river the girl glancing nervously behind her as though she were in a company of ghosts Lady Winterbourne recovered herself and Marcella looking at her saw the old tragic severity of feature and mien blurred with the same softness the same delicate tremor Marcella clung to her with almost a daughter s feeling She took up the white wrinkled hand as it lay on the parapet and kissed it in the dark so that no one saw I am glad to see you again she said passionately so glad Lady Winterbourne was surprised and moved But you have never written all these months you unkind child And I have heard so little of you your mother never seemed to know When will you come and see me or shall I come to you I can t stay now for we were just going my daughter Ermyntrude Welwyn has to take some one to a ball How strange she broke off how very strange that you and he should have met to night He goes off to Italy to morrow you know with Lord Maxwell Yes I had heard said Marcella more steadily Will you come to tea with me next week Oh I will write And we must go too where can my friend be She looked round in dismay and up and down the terrace for Edith I will take you back to the Lanes anyway said Lady Winterbourne or shall we look after you No no Take me back to the Lanes Mamma are you coming said a voice like a softened version of Lady Winterbourne s Then something small and thin ran forward and a girl s voice said piteously Dear Lady Winterbourne my frock and my hair take so long to do I shall be cross with my maid and look like a fiend Ermyntrude will be sorry she ever knew me Do come Don t cry Betty I certainly shan t take you if you do said Lady Ermyntrude laughing Mamma is this Miss Boyce your Miss Boyce She and Marcella shook hands and they talked a little Lady Ermyntrude under cover of the darkness looking hard and curiously at the tall stranger whom as it happened she had never seen before Marcella had little notion of what she was saying She was far more conscious of the girlish form hanging on Lady Winterbourne s arm than she was of her own words of Betty s beautiful soft eyes also shyly and gravely fixed upon herself under that marvellous cloud of fair hair the long pointed chin the whimsical little face Well none of you are any good said Betty at last in a tragic voice I shall have to walk home my own poor little self and ask a p leeceman mister Raeburn He disengaged himself from a group behind and came with no alacrity Betty ran up to him mister Raeburn Ermyntrude and Lady Winterbourne are going to sleep here if you don t mind making arrangements But I want a hansom At that very moment Marcella caught sight of Edith strolling along towards her with a couple of members and chatting as though the world had never rolled more evenly Oh there she is there is my friend cried Marcella to Lady Winterbourne Good night good night She was hurrying off when she saw Aldous Raeburn was standing alone a moment The exasperated Betty had made a dart from his side to collect another straying member of the party An impulse she could not master scattered her wretched discomfort even her chafing sense of being the observed of many eyes She walked up to him Will you tell me about Lord Maxwell she said in a tremulous hurry I am so sorry he is ill I hadn t heard I She dared not look up Was that his voice answering Thank you We have been very anxious about him but the doctors to day give a rather better report We take him abroad to morrow Marcella at last cried Edith Craven catching hold of her friend you lost me Oh nonsense it was all the other way But look there is mister Wharton coming out I must go come and say good night everybody is departing Aldous Raeburn lifted his hat Marcella felt a sudden rush of humiliation pain sore resentment That cold strange tone those unwilling words She had gone up to him as undisciplined in her repentance as she had been in aggression full of a passionate yearning to make friends somehow to convey to him that she was sorry in the old child s phrase which her self willed childhood had used so little There could be no misunderstanding possible He of all men knew best how irrevocable it all was But why when life has brought reflection and you realise at last that you have vitally hurt perhaps maimed another human being should it not be possible to fling conventions aside and go to that human being with the frank confession which by all the promises of ethics and religion ought to bring peace peace and a soothed conscience But she had been repulsed put aside so she took it and by one of the kindest and most generous of men She moved along the terrace in a maze seeing nothing biting her lip to keep back the angry tears All that obscure need that new stirring of moral life within her which had found issue in this little futile advance towards a man who had once loved her and could now it seemed only despise and dislike her was beating and swelling stormlike within her She had taken being loved so easily so much as a matter of course How was it that it hurt her now so much to have lost love and power and consideration She had never felt any passion for Aldous Raeburn had taken him lightly and shaken him off with a minimum of remorse Yet to night a few cold words from him the proud manner of a moment had inflicted a smart upon her she could hardly bear They had made her feel herself so alone unhappy uncared for But on the contrary she must be happy must be loved To this and this only had she been brought by the hard experience of this strenuous year Oh missus Lane be an angel exclaimed Wharton s voice Just one turn five minutes The division will be called directly and then we will all thank our stars and go to bed In another instant he was at Marcella s side bare headed radiant reckless even as he was wont to be in moments of excitement He had seen her speak to Raeburn as he came out on the terrace but his mind was too full for any perception of other people s situations even hers He was absorbed with himself and with her as she fitted his present need The smile of satisfied vanity of stimulated ambition was on his lips and his good humour inclined him more than ever to Marcella and the pleasure of a woman s company He passed with ease from triumph to homage his talk now audacious now confiding offered her a deference a flattery to which as he was fully conscious the events of the evening had lent a new prestige She too in his eyes had triumphed had made her mark His ears were full of the comments made upon her to night by the little world on the terrace If it were not for money hateful money what more brilliant wife could be desired for any rising man So the five minutes lengthened into ten and by the time the division was called and Wharton hurried off Marcella soothed taken out of herself rescued from the emptiness and forlornness of a tragic moment had given him more conscious cause than she had ever given him yet to think her kind and fair CHAPTER X My dear Ned do be reasonable Your sister is in despair and so am I Why do you torment us by staying on here in the heat and taking all these engagements which you know you are no more fit for than A sick grasshopper laughed Hallin Healthy wretch Did Heaven give you that sun burn only that you might come home from Italy and twit us weaklings Do you think I want to look as rombustious as you Nothing too much my good friend Aldous looked down upon the speaker with an anxiety quite untouched by Hallin s chaff Miss Hallin tells me he persisted that you are wearing yourself out with this lecturing campaign that you don t sleep and that she is more unhappy about you than she has been for months Why not give it up now rest and begin again in the winter Hallin smiled a little as he sat with the tips of his fingers lightly joined in front of him I doubt whether I shall live through the winter he said quietly Raeburn started Hallin in general spoke of his health when he allowed it to be mentioned at all in the most cheerful terms Why you should behave as though you wished to make such a prophecy true I can t conceive he said in impatient pain Hallin offered no immediate answer and Raeburn who was standing in front of him leaning against the wood work of the open window looked unhappily at the face and form of his friend In youth that face had possessed a Greek serenity and blitheness dependent perhaps on its clear aquiline feature the steady transparent eyes coeli lucida templa the fresh fairness of the complexion and the boyish brow under its arch of pale brown hair And to stronger men there had always been something peculiarly winning in the fragile grace of figure and movements suggesting as they did sad and perpetual compromise between the spirit s eagerness and the body s weakness Don t make yourself unhappy my dear boy said Hallin at last putting up a thin hand and touching his friend I shall give up soon Moreover it will give me up Workmen want to do something else with their evenings in July than spend them in listening to stuffy lectures I shall go to the Lakes But there are a few engagements still ahead and I confess I am more restless than I used to be The night cometh when no man can work They fell into a certain amount of discursive talk of the political situation working class opinion and the rest Raeburn had been alive now for some time to a curious change of balance in his friend s mind Hallin s buoyant youth had concerned itself almost entirely with positive crusades and enthusiasms Of late he seemed rather to have passed into a period of negations of strong opposition to certain current isms and faiths and the happy boyish tone of earlier years had become the stormy note of men contention tost which belongs indeed as truly to such a character as the joy of young ideals He had always been to some extent divided from Raeburn and others of his early friends by his passionate democracy his belief in and trust of the multitude For Hallin the divine originating life was realised and manifested through the common humanity and its struggle as a whole for Raeburn only in the best of it morally or intellectually the rest remaining an inscrutable problem which did not indeed prevent faith but hung upon it like a dead weight Such divisions however are among the common divisions of thinking men and had never interfered with the friendship of these two in the least But the developing alienation between Hallin and hundreds of his working men friends was of an infinitely keener and sorer kind Since he had begun his lecturing and propagandist life Socialist ideas of all kinds had made great way in England And on the whole as the prevailing type of them grew stronger Hallin s sympathy with them had grown weaker and weaker Property to him meant self realisation and the abuse of property was no more just ground for a crusade which logically aimed at doing away with it than the abuse of other human powers or instincts would make it reasonable to try and do away with say love or religion To give property and therewith the fuller human opportunity to those that have none was the inmost desire of his life And not merely common property though like all true soldiers of the human cause he believed that common property will be in the future enormously extended but in the first place and above all to distribute the discipline and the trust of personal and private possession among an infinitely greater number of hands than possess them already And that not for wealth s sake though a more equal distribution of property and therewith of capacity must inevitably tend to wealth but for the soul s sake and for the sake of that continuous appropriation by the race of its moral and spiritual heritage How is it to be done Hallin like many others would have answered For England mainly by a fresh distribution of the land Not of course by violence which only means the worst form of waste known to history but by the continuous pressure of an emancipating legislation relieving land from shackles long since struck off other kinds of property by the assertion within a certain limited range of communal initiative and control and above all by the continuous private effort in all sorts of ways and spheres of men of good will For all sweeping uniform schemes he had the natural contempt of the student or the moralist To imagine that by nationalising sixty annual millions of rent for instance you could make England a city of God was not only a vain dream but a belittling of England s history and England s task A nation is not saved so cheaply and to see those energies turned to land nationalisation or the scheming of a Collectivist millennium which might have gone to the housing educating and refining of English men women and children of to day to moralising the employer s view of his profit and the landlord s conception of his estate filled him with a growing despair The relation of such a habit of life and mind to the Collectivist and Socialist ideas now coming to the front in England as in every other European country is obvious enough To Hallin the social life the community was everything yet to be a Socialist seemed to him more and more to be a traitor He would have built his state on the purified will of the individual man and could conceive no other foundation for a state worth having But for purification there must be effort and for effort there must be freedom Socialism as he read it despised and decried freedom and placed the good of man wholly in certain external conditions It was aiming at a state of things under which the joys and pains the teaching and the risks of true possession were to be for ever shut off from the poor human will which yet according to him could never do without them if man was to be man So that he saw it all sub specie aeternitatis as a matter not of economic theory but rather of religion Raeburn as they talked shrank in dismay from the burning intensity of mood underlying his controlled speech He spoke for instance of Bennett s conversion to Harry Wharton s proposed bill or of the land nationalising scheme he was spending all his slender stores of breath and strength in attacking not with anger or contempt but with a passionate sorrow which seemed to Raeburn preposterous intolerable to be exhausting in him the very springs and sources of a too precarious life There rose in Aldous at last an indignant protest which yet could hardly find itself words What help to have softened the edge and fury of religious war only to discover new antagonisms of opinion as capable of devastating heart and affections as any homoousion of old Had they not already cost him love Were they also in another fashion to cost him his friend Ah dear old fellow enough said Hallin at last take me back to Italy You have told me so little such a niggardly little I told you that we went and I came back in a water spout said Aldous the first rain in Northern Italy for four months worse luck Rain at Reggio rain at Parma At Lodi rain Piacenza rain that might about stand for my diary except for one radiant day when my aunt Betty Macdonald and I descended on Milan and climbed the Duomo Did Miss Betty amuse you Aldous laughed Well at least she varied the programme The greater part of our day in Milan Aunt Neta and I spent in rushing after her like its tail after a kite First of all she left us in the Duomo Square running like a deer and presently to Aunt Neta s horror we discovered that she was pursuing a young Italian officer in a blue cloak When we came up with the pair she was inquiring in her best Italian where the Signor got his cloak because positively she must have one like it and he cap in hand was explaining to the Signorina that if she would but follow him round the corner to his military tailor s she could be supplied on the spot So there we all went Miss Betty insisting You can imagine Aunt Neta She bought a small shipload of stuff and then positively skipped for joy in the street outside the amazed officer looking on And as for her career over the roof of the Duomo the agitation of it nearly brought my aunt to destruction and even I heaved a sigh of relief when I got them both down safe Is the creature all tricks said Hallin with a smile As you talk of her to me I get the notion of a little monkey just cut loose from a barrel organ Oh but the monkey has so much heart said Aldous laughing again as every one was apt to laugh who talked about Betty Macdonald and it makes friends with every sick and sorry creature it comes across especially with old maids It amounts to genius Betty s way with old maids You should see her in the middle of them in the hotel salon at night a perfect ring of them and the men outside totally neglected and out of temper I have never seen Betty yet in a room with somebody she thought ill at ease or put in the shade a governess or a schoolgirl or a lumpish boy that she did not devote herself to that somebody It is a pretty instinct I have often wondered whether it is nature or art He fell silent still smiling Hallin watched him closely Perhaps the thought which had risen in his mind revealed itself by some subtle sign or other to Aldous For suddenly Raeburn s expression changed the over strenuous harassed look which of late had somewhat taken the place of his old philosopher s quiet reappeared I did not tell you Hallin he began in a low voice raising his eyes to his friend that I had seen her again Hallin paused a moment Then he said No I knew she went to the House to hear Wharton s speech and that she dined there I supposed she might just have come across you but she said nothing Of course I had no idea said Aldous suddenly Lady Winterbourne and I came across her on the terrace Then I saw she was with that man s party She spoke to me afterwards I believe now she meant to be kind his voice showed the difficulty he had in speaking at all but I saw him coming up to talk to her I am ashamed to think of my own manner but I could not help myself His face and eye took as he spoke a peculiar vividness and glow Raeburn had not for months mentioned to him the name of Marcella Boyce but Hallin had all along held two faiths about the matter first that Aldous was still possessed by a passion which had become part of his life secondly that the events of the preceding year had produced in him an exceedingly bitter sense of ill usage of a type which Hallin had not perhaps expected Did you see anything to make you suppose he asked quietly after a pause that she is going to marry him No no Aldous repeated slowly but she is clearly on friendly perhaps intimate terms with him And just now of course she is more likely to be influenced by him than ever He made a great success of a kind in the House a fortnight ago People seem to think he may come rapidly to the front So I understand I don t believe it The jealousies that divide that group are too unmanageable If he were a Parnell But he lacks just the qualities that matter the reticence the power of holding himself aloof from irrelevant things and interests the hard self concentration Aldous raised his shoulders I don t imagine there is any lack of that But certainly he holds himself aloof from nothing and nobody I hear of him everywhere What among the smart people Aldous nodded A change of policy by all accounts said Hallin musing He must do it with intention He is not the man to let himself be be Capua ed all at once Oh dear no said Aldous drily He does it with intention Nobody supposes him to be the mere toady All the same I think he may very well overrate the importance of the class he is trying to make use of and its influence Have you been following the strike leaders in the Clarion No cried Hallin flushing I would not read them for the world I might not be able to go on giving to the strike Aldous fell silent and Hallin presently saw that his mind had harked back to the one subject that really held the depths of it The truest friendship Hallin believed would be never to speak to him of Marcella Boyce never to encourage him to dwell upon her or upon anything connected with her But his yearning sympathetic instinct would not let him follow his own conviction Miss Boyce you know has been here two or three times while you have been away he said quickly as he got up to post a letter Aldous hesitated then he said Do you gather that her nursing life satisfies her Hallin made a little face Since when has she become a person likely to be satisfied with anything She devotes to it a splendid and wonderful energy When she comes here I admire her with all my heart and pity her so much that I could cry over her Aldous started I don t know what you mean he said as he too rose and laid his hand on Hallin s for a moment But don t tell me It s best for me not to talk of her If she were associated in my mind with any other man than Wharton I think somehow I could throw the whole thing off But this this He broke off then resumed while he pretended to look for a parcel he had brought with him by way of covering an agitation he could not suppress A person you and I know said to me the other day It may sound unromantic but I could never think of a woman who had thrown me over except with ill will The word astonished me but sometimes I understand it I find myself full of anger to the most futile the most ridiculous degree He drew himself up nervously already scorning his own absurdity his own breach of reticence Hallin laid his hands on the taller man s shoulders and there was a short pause Never mind old fellow said Hallin simply at last as his hands dropped let s go and do our work What is it you re after I forget Aldous found his packet and his hat explaining himself again meanwhile in his usual voice He had dropped in on Hallin for a morning visit meaning to spend some hours before the House met in the investigation of some small workshops in the neighbourhood of Drury Lane The Home Office had been called upon for increased inspection and regulation there had been a great conflict of evidence and Aldous had finally resolved in his student s way to see for himself the state of things in two or three selected streets It was a matter on which Hallin was also well informed and felt strongly They stayed talking about it a few minutes Hallin eagerly directing Raeburn s attention to the two or three points where he thought the Government could really do good Then Raeburn turned to go I shall come and drag you out to morrow afternoon he said as he opened the door You needn t said Hallin with a smile in fact don t I shall have my jaunt Whereby Aldous understood that he would be engaged in his common Saturday practice of taking out a batch of elder boys or girls from one or other of the schools of which he was manager for a walk or to see some sight If it s your boys he said protesting you re not fit for it Hand them over to me Nothing of the sort said Hallin gaily and turned him out of the room Raeburn found the walk from Hallin s Bloomsbury quarters to Drury Lane hot and airless The planes were already drooping and yellowing in the squares the streets were at their closest and dirtiest and the traffic of Holborn and its approaches had never seemed to him more bewildering in its roar and volume July was in and all freshness had already disappeared from the too short London summer For Raeburn on this particular afternoon there was a curious forlornness in the dry and tainted air His slack mood found no bracing in the sun or the breeze Everything was or seemed distasteful to a mind out of tune whether this work he was upon which only yesterday had interested him considerably or his Parliamentary occupations or some tiresome estate business which would have to be looked into when he got home He was oppressed too by the last news of his grandfather The certainty that this dear and honoured life with which his own had been so closely intertwined since his boyhood was drawing to its close weighed upon him now heavily and constantly The loss itself would take from him an object on which affection checked and thwarted elsewhere was still free to spend itself in ways peculiarly noble and tender and as for those other changes to which the first great change must lead his transference to the Upper House and the extension for himself of all the ceremonial side of life he looked forward to them with an intense and resentful repugnance as to aggravations perversely thrust on him from without of a great and necessary grief Few men believed less happily in democracy than Aldous Raeburn on the other hand few men felt a more steady distaste for certain kinds of inequality He was to meet a young inspector at the corner of Little Queen Street and they were to visit together a series of small brush drawing and box making workshops in the Drury Lane district to which the attention of the Department had lately been specially drawn Aldous had no sooner crossed Holborn than he saw his man waiting for him a tall strip of a fellow with a dark bearded face and a manner which shyness had made a trifle morose Aldous however knew him to be not only a capital worker but a man of parts and had got much information and some ideas out of him already mister Peabody gave the under secretary a slight preoccupied smile in return for his friendly greeting and the two walked on together talking The inspector announced that he proposed to take his companion first of all to a street behind Drury Lane of which many of the houses were already marked for demolition a black street bearing a peculiarly vile reputation in the neighbourhood It contained on the whole the worst of the small workshops which he desired to bring to Raeburn s notice besides a variety of other horrors social and sanitary After ten minutes walking they turned into the street With its condemned houses many of them shored up and windowless its narrow roadway strewn with costers refuse it was largely inhabited by costers frequenting Covent Garden Market its filthy gutters and broken pavements it touched indeed a depth of sinister squalor beyond most of its fellows The air was heavy with odours which in this July heat seemed to bear with them the inmost essences of things sickening and decaying and the children squatting or playing amid the garbage of the street were further than most of their kind from any tolerable human type A policeman was stationed near the entrance of the street After they had passed him mister Peabody ran back and said a word in his ear I gave him your name he said briefly in answer to Raeburn s interrogative look when he returned and told him what we were after The street is not quite as bad as it was and there are little oases of respectability in it you would never expect But there is plenty of the worst thieving and brutality left in it still Of course now you see it at its dull moment To night the place will swarm with barrows and stalls all the people will be in the street and after dark it will be as near pandemonium as may be I happen to know the School Board visitor of these parts and a City Missionary too who is afraid of nothing And standing still a moment pointing imperceptibly to right and left he began in his shy monotonous voice to run through the inhabitants of some of the houses and a few typical histories This group was mainly peopled by women of the very lowest class and their bullies that is to say the men who aided them in plundering sometimes in murdering the stranger who fell into their claws in that house a woman had been slowly done to death by her husband and his brutal brothers under every circumstance of tragic horror in the next a case of flagrant and revolting cruelty to a pair of infant children had just been brought to light In addition to its vice and its thievery the wretched place was of course steeped in drink There were gin palaces at all the corners the women drank in proportion to their resources as badly as the men and the children were fed with the stuff in infancy and began for themselves as early as they could beg or steal a copper of their own When the dismal catalogue was done they moved on towards the further end of the street and a house on the right hand side Behind the veil of his official manner Aldous s shrinking sense took all it saw and heard as fresh food for a darkness and despondency of soul already great enough But his companion a young enthusiast secretly very critical of big wigs was conscious only of the trained man of affairs courteous methodical and well informed putting a series of preliminary questions with unusual point and rapidity Suddenly under the influence of a common impression both men stood still and looked about them There was a stir in the street Windows had been thrown open and scores of heads were looking out People emerged from all quarters seemed to spring from the ground or drop from the skies and in a few seconds as it were the street so dead alive before was full of a running and shouting crowd It s a fight said Peabody as the crowd came up with them Listen Shrieks of the most ghastly and piercing note rang through the air The men and women who rushed past the two strangers hustling them yet too excited to notice them were all making for a house some ten or twelve yards in front of them to their left Aldous had turned white It is a woman he said after an instant s listening and it sounds like murder You go back for that policeman And without another word he threw himself on the crowd forcing his way through it by the help of arms and shoulders which in years gone by had done good service for the Trinity Eight Drink sodden men and screaming women gave way before him He found himself at the door of the house hammering upon it with two or three other men who were there before him The noise from within was appalling cries groans uproar all the sounds of a deadly struggle proceeding apparently on the second floor of the house Then came a heavy fall then the sound of a voice different in quality and accent from any that had gone before crying piteously and as though in exhaustion Help Almost at the same moment the door which Aldous and his companions were trying to force was burst open from within and three men seemed to be shot out from the dark passage inside two wrestling with the third a wild beast in human shape maddened apparently with drink and splashed with blood Ee s done for her shouted one of the captors an for the Sister too The Sister shrieked a woman behind Aldous it s the nuss he means I sor her go in when I wor at my window half an hour ago Oh yer blackguard you and she would have fallen upon the wretch in a frenzy had not the bystanders caught hold of her Stand back cried a policeman Three of them had come up at Peabody s call The man was instantly secured and the crowd pushed back Aldous was already upstairs Which room he asked of a group of women crying and cowering on the first landing for all sounds from above had ceased Third floor front cried one of them We all of us begged and implored of that young person sir not to go a near him Didn t we Betsy didn t we Doll Aldous ran up On the third floor the door of the front room was open A woman lay on the ground apparently beaten to death By her side torn dishevelled and gasping knelt Marcella Boyce Two or three other women were standing by in helpless terror and curiosity Marcella was bending over the bleeding victim before her Her own left arm hung as though disabled by her side but with the right hand she was doing her best to staunch some of the bleeding from the head Her bag stood open beside her and one of the chattering women was handing her what she asked for The sight stamped itself in lines of horror on Raeburn s heart In such an exaltation of nerve she could be surprised at nothing When she saw Raeburn enter the room she did not even start I think she said as he stooped down to her speaking with pauses as though to get her breath he has killed her But there is a chance Are the police there and a stretcher Two constables entered as she spoke and the first of them instantly sent his companion back for a stretcher Then noticing Marcella s nursing dress and cloak he came up to her respectfully Did you see it miss I I tried to separate them she replied still speaking with the same difficulty while she silently motioned to Aldous who was on the other side of the unconscious and apparently dying woman to help her with the bandage she was applying But he was such a great powerful brute Aldous hating the clumsiness of his man s fingers knelt down and tried to help her Her trembling hand touched mingled with his I was downstairs she went on while the constable took out his note book attending a child that s ill when I heard the screams They were on the landing he had turned her out of the room then rushed after her I think to throw her downstairs I stopped that Then he took up something oh there it is She shuddered pointing to a broken piece of a chair which lay on the floor He was quite mad with drink I couldn t do much Her voice slipped into a weak piteous note Isn t your arm hurt said Aldous pointing to it It s not broken it s wrenched I can t use it There that s all we can do till she gets to hospital Then she stood up pale and staggering and asked the policeman if he could put on a bandage The man had got his ambulance certificate and was proud to say that he could She took a roll out of her bag and quietly pointed to her arm He did his best not without skill and the deep line of pain furrowing the centre of the brow relaxed a little Then she sank down on the floor again beside her patient gazing at the woman s marred face indescribably patient in its deep unconsciousness at the gnarled and bloodstained hands with their wedding ring at the thin locks of torn grey hair with tears that ran unheeded down her cheeks in a passion of anguished pity which touched a chord of memory in Raeburn s mind He had seen her look so once before beside Minta Hurd on the day of Hurd s capture At the same moment he saw that they were alone The policeman had cleared the room and was spending the few minutes that must elapse before his companion returned with the stretcher in taking the names and evidence of some of the inmates of the house on the stairs outside You can t do anything more said Aldous gently bending over her Won t you let me take you home you want it sorely The police are trained to these things and I have a friend here who will help They will remove her with every care he will see to it Then for the first time her absorption gave way She remembered who he was where they were how they had last met And with the remembrance came an extraordinary leap of joy flashing through pain and faintness She had the childish feeling that he could not look unkindly at her anymore after this When at the White House she had got herself into disgrace and could not bring her pride to ask pardon she would silently set up a headache or a cut finger that she might be pitied and so perforce forgiven The same tacit thought was in her mind now No after this he must be friends with her I will just help to get her downstairs she said but with a quivering appealing accent and so they fell silent Aldous looked round the room at the miserable filthy garret with its begrimed and peeling wall paper its two or three broken chairs its heap of rags across two boxes that served for a bed its empty gin bottles here and there all the familiar one might almost say conventionalised signs of human ruin and damnation then at this breathing death between himself and her Perhaps his strongest feeling was one of fierce and natural protest against circumstance against her mother against a reckless philanthropy that could thus throw the finest and fragilest things of a poorly furnished world into such a hopeless struggle with devildom I have been here several times before she said presently in a faint voice and there has never been any trouble By day the street is not much worse than others though of course it has a bad name There is a little boy on the next floor very ill with typhoid Many of the women in the house are very good to him and his mother This poor thing used to come in and out when I was nursing him Oh I wish I wish they would come she broke off in impatience looking at the deathly form every moment is of importance As Aldous went to the door to see if the stretcher was in sight it opened and the police came in Marcella herself helpless directed the lifting of the bloodstained head the police obeyed her with care and skill Then Raeburn assisted in the carrying downstairs and presently the police with their burden and accompanied apparently by the whole street were on their way to the nearest hospital Then Aldous to his despair and wrath saw that an inspector of police who had just come up was talking to Marcella no doubt instructing her as to how and where she was to give her evidence She was leaning against the passage wall supporting her injured arm with her hand and seemed to him on the point of fainting Get a cab at once will you he said peremptorily to Peabody then going up to the inspector he drew him forward They exchanged a few words the inspector lifted his cap and Aldous went back to Marcella There is a cab here he said to her Come please directly They will not trouble you any more for the present He led her out through the still lingering crowd and put her into the cab As they drove along he felt every jolt and roughness of the street as though he were himself in anguish She was some time before she recovered the jar of pain caused her by the act of getting into the cab Her breath came fast and he could see that she was trying hard to control herself and not to faint He too restrained himself so far as not to talk to her But the exasperation the revolt within was in truth growing unmanageably Was this what her new career her enthusiasms meant or might mean Twenty three in the prime of youth of charm Horrible unpardonable waste He could not bear it could not submit himself to it Oh let her marry Wharton or any one else so long as it were made impossible for her to bruise and exhaust her young bloom amid such scenes such gross physical abominations Amazing how meanly passionately timorous the man of Raeburn s type can be for the woman He himself may be morally ever a fighter and feel the glow the stern joy of the fight But she let her leave the human brute and his unsavoury struggle alone It cannot be borne it was never meant that she should dip her delicate wings of her own free will at least in such a mire of blood and tears It was the feeling that had possessed him when missus Boyce told him of the visit to the prison the night in the cottage In her whirl of feverish thought she divined him very closely Presently as he watched her hating the man for driving and the cab for shaking he saw her white lips suddenly smile I know she said rousing herself to look at him you think nursing is all like that I hope not he said with effort trying to smile too I never saw a fight before she said shutting her eyes again Nobody is ever rude to us I often pine for experiences How like her old wild tone His rigid look softened involuntarily Well you have got one now he said bending over to her Does your arm hurt you much Yes but I can bear it What vexes me is that I shall have to give up work for a bit mister Raeburn Yes His heart beat We may meet often mayn t we at Lady Winterbourne s or in the country Couldn t we be friends You don t know how often She turned away her weary head a moment gathered strength to begin again how often I have regretted last year I see now that I behaved more unkindly her voice was almost a whisper than I thought then But it is all done with couldn t we just be good friends understand each other perhaps better than we ever did She kept her eyes closed shaken with alternate shame and daring As for him he was seized with overpowering dumbness and chill What was really in his mind was the Terrace was Wharton s advancing figure But her state the moment coerced him We could not be anything but friends he said gently but with astonishing difficulty and then could find nothing more to say She knew his reserve however and would not this time be repelled She put out her hand No she said looking at it and withdrawing it with a shudder oh no Then suddenly a passion of tears and trembling overcame her She leant against the side of the cab struggling in vain to regain her self control gasping incoherent things about the woman she had not been able to save He tried to soothe and calm her his own heart wrung But she hardly heard him At last they turned into Maine Street and she saw the gateway of Brown s Buildings Here we are she said faintly summoning all her will do you know you will have to help me across that court and upstairs then I shan t be any more trouble So leaning on Raeburn s arm Marcella made her slow progress across the court of Brown s Buildings and through the gaping groups of children Then at the top of her flight of steps she withdrew herself from him with a wan smile Now I am home she said Good bye Aldous looked round him well at Brown s Buildings as he departed Then he got into a hansom and drove to Lady Winterbourne s house and implored her to fetch and nurse Marcella Boyce using her best cleverness to hide all motion of his in the matter After which he spent poor Aldous one of the most restless and miserable nights of his life CHAPTER XI Marcella was sitting in a deep and comfortable chair at the open window of Lady Winterbourne s drawing room The house in James Street Buckingham Gate looked out over the exercising ground of the great barracks in front and commanded the greenery of saint James s Park to the left The planes lining the barrack railings were poor wilted things and London was as hot as ever Still the charm of these open spaces of sky and park after the high walls and innumerable windows of Brown s Buildings was very great Marcella wanted nothing more but to lie still to dally with a book to dream as she pleased and to be let alone Lady Winterbourne and her married daughter Lady Ermyntrude were still out engaged in the innumerable nothings of the fashionable afternoon Marcella had her thoughts to herself But they were not of a kind that any one need have wished to share In the first place she was tired of idleness In the early days after Lady Winterbourne had carried her off the soft beds and sofas the trained service and delicate food of this small but luxurious house had been so pleasant to her that she had scorned herself for a greedy Sybaritic temper delighted by any means to escape from plain living But she had been here a fortnight and was now pining to go back to work Her mood was too restless and transitional to leave her long in love with comfort and folded hands She told herself that she had no longer any place among the rich and important people of this world far away beyond these parks and palaces in the little network of dark streets she knew lay the problems and the cares that were really hers through which her heart was somehow wrestling must somehow wrestle its passionate way But her wrenched arm was still in a sling and was moreover under going treatment at the hands of a clever specialist and she could neither go home as her mother had wished her to do nor return to her nursing a state of affairs which of late had made her a little silent and moody On the whole she found her chief pleasure in the two weekly visits she paid to the woman whose life it now appeared she had saved probably at some risk of her own The poor victim would go scarred and maimed through what remained to her of existence But she lived and as Marcella and Lady Winterbourne and Raeburn had abundantly made up their minds would be permanently cared for and comforted in the future Alas there were many things that stood between Marcella and true rest She had been woefully disappointed nay wounded as to the results of that tragic half hour which for the moment had seemed to throw a bridge of friendship over those painful estranging memories lying between her and Aldous Raeburn He had called two or three times since she had been with Lady Winterbourne he had done his best to make her inevitable appearance as a witness in the police court as easy to her as possible the man who had stood by her through such a scene could do no less in common politeness and humanity But each time they met his manner had been formal and constrained there had been little conversation and she had been left to the bitterness of feeling that she had made a strange if not unseemly advance of which he must think unkindly since he had let it count with him so little Childishly angrily she wanted him to be friends Why shouldn t he He would certainly marry Betty Macdonald in time whatever mister Hallin might say Then why not put his pride away and be generous Their future lives must of necessity touch each other for they were bound to the same neighbourhood the same spot of earth She knew herself to be her father s heiress Mellor must be hers some day and before that day whenever her father s illness of which she now understood the incurable though probably tedious nature should reach a certain stage she must go home and take up her life there again Why embitter such a situation make it more difficult for everybody concerned Why not simply bury the past and begin again In her restlessness she was inclined to think herself much wiser and more magnanimous than he Meanwhile in the Winterbourne household she was living among people to whom Aldous Raeburn was a dear and familiar companion who admired him with all their hearts and felt a sympathetic interest alike in his private life and his public career Their circle too was his circle and by means of it she now saw Aldous in his relations to his equals and colleagues whether in the Ministry or the House The result was a number of new impressions which she half resented as we may resent the information that some stranger will give us upon a subject we imagined ourselves better acquainted with than anybody else The promise of Raeburn s political position struck her quick mind with a curious surprise She could not explain it as she had so often tacitly explained his place in Brookshire by the mere accidents of birth After all aristocratic as we still are no party can now afford to choose its men by any other criterion than personal profitableness And a man nowadays is in the long run personally profitable far more by what he is than by what he has so far at least has progress brought us She saw then that this quiet strong man with his obvious defects of temperament and manner had already gained a remarkable degree of consideration using the word in its French sense among his political contemporaries He was beginning to be reckoned upon as a man of the future by an inner circle of persons whose word counted and carried while yet his name was comparatively little known to the public Marcella indeed had gathered her impression from the most slight and various sources mostly from the phrases the hints the manner of men already themselves charged with the most difficult and responsible work of England Above all things did she love and admire power the power of personal capacity It had been the secret it was still half the secret of Wharton s influence with her She saw it here under wholly different conditions and accessories She gave it recognition with a kind of unwillingness All the same Raeburn took a new place in her imagination Then apart from the political world and its judgments the intimacy between him and the Winterbourne family showed her to him in many new aspects To Lady Winterbourne his mother s dear and close friend he was almost a son and nothing could be more charming than the affectionate and playful tolerance with which he treated her little oddities and weaknesses And to all her children he was bound by the memories and kindnesses of many years He was the godfather of Lady Ermyntrude s child the hero and counsellor of the two sons who were both in Parliament and took his lead in many things while there was no one with whom Lord Winterbourne could more comfortably discuss county or agricultural affairs In the old days Marcella had somehow tended to regard him as a man of few friends And in a sense it was so He did not easily yield himself and was often thought dull and apathetic by strangers But here amid these old companions his delicacy and sweetness of disposition had full play and although now that Marcella was in their house he came less often and was less free with them than usual she saw enough to make her wonder a little that they were all so kind and indulgent to her seeing that they cared so much for him and all that affected him Well she was often judged humbled reproached Yet there was a certain irritation in it Was it all her own fault that in her brief engagement she had realised him so little Her heart was sometimes oddly sore her conscience full of smart but there were moments when she was as combative as ever Nor had certain other experiences of this past fortnight been any more soothing to this sore craving sense of hers It appeared very soon that nothing would have been easier for her had she chosen than to become the lion of the later season The story of the Batton Street tragedy had of course got into the papers and had been treated there with the usual adornments of the New Journalism The world which knew the Raeburns or knew of them comparatively a large world fell with avidity on the romantic juxtaposition of names To lose your betrothed as Aldous Raeburn had lost his and then to come across her again in this manner and in these circumstances there was a dramatic neatness about it to which the careless Fate that governs us too seldom attains London discussed the story a good deal and would have liked dearly to see and to exhibit the heroine missus Lane in particular the hostess of the House of Commons dinner felt that she had claims and was one of the first to call at Lady Winterbourne s and see her guest She soon discovered that Marcella had no intention whatever of playing the lion and must in fact avoid excitement and fatigue But she had succeeded in getting the girl to come to her once or twice of an afternoon to meet two or three people It was better for the wounded arm that its owner should walk than drive and missus Lane lived at a convenient distance at a house in Piccadilly just across the Green Park Here then as in James Street Marcella had met in discreet succession a few admiring and curious persons and had tasted some of the smaller sweets of fame But the magnet that drew her to the Lanes house had been no craving for notoriety at the present moment she was totally indifferent to what perhaps constitutionally she might have liked the attraction had been simply the occasional presence there of Harry Wharton He excited puzzled angered and commanded her more than ever She could not keep herself away from the chance of meeting him And Lady Winterbourne neither knew him nor apparently wished to know him a fact which probably tended to make Marcella obstinate Yet what pleasure had there been after all in these meetings Again and again she had seen him surrounded there by pretty and fashionable women with some of whom he was on amazingly easy terms while with all of them he talked their language and so far as she could see to a great extent lived their life The contradiction of the House of Commons evening returned upon her perpetually She thought she saw in many of his new friends a certain malicious triumph in the readiness with which the young demagogue had yielded to their baits No doubt they were at least as much duped as he Like Hallin she did not believe that at bottom he was the man to let himself be held by silken bonds if it should be to his interest to break them But meanwhile his bearing among these people the claims they and their amusement made upon his time and his mind seemed to this girl who watched them with her dark astonished eyes a kind of treachery to his place and his cause It was something she had never dreamed of and it roused her contempt and irritation Then as to herself He had been all eagerness in his enquiries after her from missus Lane and he never saw her in the Piccadilly drawing room that he did not pay her homage often with a certain extravagance a kind of appropriation which missus Lane secretly thought in bad taste and Marcella sometimes resented On the other hand things jarred between them frequently From day to day he varied She had dreamt of a great friendship but instead it was hardly possible to carry on the thread of their relation from meeting to meeting with simplicity and trust On the Terrace he had behaved or would have behaved if she had allowed him as a lover When they met again at missus Lane s he would be sometimes devoted in his old paradoxical flattering vein sometimes she thought even cool Nay once or twice he was guilty of curious little neglects towards her generally in the presence of some great lady or other On one of these occasions she suddenly felt herself flushing from brow to chin at the thought He does not want any one to suppose for a moment that he wishes to marry me It had taken Wharton some difficult hours to subdue in her the effects of that one moment s fancy Till then it is the simple truth to say that she had never seriously considered the possibility of marrying him When it did enter her mind she saw that it had already entered his and that he was full of doubts The perception had given to her manner an increasing aloofness and pride which had of late piqued Wharton into efforts from which vanity and indeed something else could not refrain if he was to preserve his power So she was sitting by the window this afternoon in a mood which had in it neither simplicity nor joy She was conscious of a certain dull and baffled feeling a sense of humiliation which hurt Moreover the scene of sordid horror she had gone through haunted her imagination perpetually She was unstrung and the world weighed upon her the pity the ugliness the confusion of it The muslin curtain beside her suddenly swelled out in a draught of air and she put out her hand quickly to catch the French window lest it should swing to Some one had opened the door of the room Did I blow you out of window said a girl s voice and there behind her in a half timid attitude stood Betty Macdonald a vision of white muslin its frills and capes a little tossed by the wind the pointed face and golden hair showing small and elf like under the big shady hat Oh do come in said Marcella shyly Lady Winterbourne will be in directly So Panton told me said Betty sinking down on a high stool beside Marcella s chair and taking off her hat and Panton doesn t tell me any stories now I ve trained him I wonder how many he tells in the day Don t you think there will be a special little corner of purgatory for London butlers I hope Panton will get off easy Then she laid her sharp chin on her tiny hand and studied Marcella Miss Boyce was in the light black dress that Minta approved her pale face and delicate hands stood out from it with a sort of noble emphasis When Betty had first heard of Marcella Boyce as the heroine of a certain story she had thought of her as a girl one would like to meet if only to prick her somehow for breaking the heart of a good man Now that she saw her close she felt herself near to falling in love with her Moreover the incident of the fight and of Miss Boyce s share in it had thrilled a creature all susceptibility and curiosity and the little merry thing would sit hushed looking at the heroine of it awed by the thought of what a girl only two years older than herself must have already seen of sin and tragedy envying her with all her heart and by contrast honesty despising for the moment that very happy and popular person Betty Macdonald Do you like being alone she asked Marcella abruptly Marcella coloured Well I was just getting very tired of my own company she said I was very glad to see you come in Were you said Betty joyously with a little gleam in her pretty eyes Then suddenly the golden head bent forward May I kiss you she said in the wistfullest eagerest voice Marcella smiled and laying her hand on Betty s shyly drew her That s better said Betty with a long breath That s the second milestone the first was when I saw you on the Terrace Couldn t you mark all your friendships by little white stones I could But the horrid thing is when you have to mark them back again Nobody ever did that with you Because I have no friends said Marcella quickly then when Betty clapped her hands in amazement at such a speech she added quickly with a smile except a few I make poultices for There said Betty enviously to think of being really wanted for poultices or anything I never was wanted in my life When I die they ll put on my poor little grave She s buried here that hizzie Betty She did na gude so don t ee fret ye oh there they are she ran to the window Lady Winterbourne and Ermyntrude Doesn t it make you laugh to see Lady Winterbourne doing her duties She gets into her carriage after lunch as one might mount a tumbril I expect to hear her tell the coachman to drive to the scaffold at Hyde Park Corner She looks the unhappiest woman in England and all the time Ermyntrude declares she likes it and wouldn t do without her season for the world She gives Ermyntrude a lot of trouble but she is a dear a naughty dear and mothers are such a chance Ermyntrude where did you get that bonnet You got it without me and my feelings won t stand it Lady Ermyntrude and Betty threw themselves on a sofa together chattering and laughing Lady Winterbourne came up to Marcella and enquired after her She was still slowly drawing off her gloves when the drawing room door opened again Tea Panton said Lady Winterbourne without turning her head and in the tone of Lady Macbeth But the magnificent butler took no notice Lady Selina Farrell he announced in a firm voice Lady Winterbourne gave a nervous start then with the air of a person cut out of wood made a slight advance and held out a limp hand to her visitor Won t you sit down she said Anybody who did not know her would have supposed that she had never seen Lady Selina before In reality she and the Alresfords were cousins But she did not like Lady Selina and never took any pains to conceal it a fact which did not in the smallest degree interfere with the younger lady s performance of her family duties Lady Selina found a seat with easy aplomb put up her bejewelled fingers to draw off her veil and smilingly prepared herself for tea She enquired of Betty how she was enjoying herself and of Lady Ermyntrude how her husband and baby in the country were getting on without her The tone of this last question made the person addressed flush and draw herself up It was put as banter but certainly conveyed that Lady Ermyntrude was neglecting her family for the sake of dissipations Betty meanwhile curled herself up in a corner of the sofa letting one pretty foot swing over the other and watching the new comer with a malicious eye which instantly and gleefully perceived that Lady Selina thought her attitude ungraceful Marcella of course was greeted and condoled with Lady Selina however had seen her since the tragedy and then Lady Winterbourne after every item of her family news and every symptom of her own and her husband s health had been rigorously enquired into began to attempt some feeble questions of her own how for instance was Lord Alresford s gout Lady Selina replied that he was well but much depressed by the political situation No doubt Ministers had done their best but he thought two or three foolish mistakes had been made during the session Certain blunders ought at all hazards to have been avoided He feared that the party and the country might have to pay dearly for them But he had done his best Lady Winterbourne whose eldest son was a junior whip had been the recipient since the advent of the new Cabinet of so much rejoicing over the final exclusion of that vain old idiot Alresford from any further chances of muddling a public department that Lady Selina s talk made her at once nervous and irritable She was afraid of being indiscreet yet she longed to put her visitor down In her odd disjointed way too she took a real interest in politics Her craving idealist nature mated with a cheery sportsman husband who laughed at her yet had made her happy was always trying to reconcile the ends of eternal justice with the measures of the Tory party It was a task of Sisyphus but she would not let it alone I do not agree with you she said with cold shyness in answer to Lady Selina s concluding laments I am told our people say we are doing very well except that the session is likely to be dreadfully long Lady Selina raised both her eyebrows and her shoulders Dear Lady Winterbourne you really mean it she said with the indulgent incredulity one shows to the simple minded But just think The session will go on every one says till quite the end of September Isn t that enough of itself to make a party discontented All our big measures are in dreadful arrears And my father believes so much of the friction might have been avoided He is all in favour of doing more for Labour He thinks these Labour men might have been easily propitiated without anything revolutionary It s no good supposing that these poor starving people will wait for ever Oh said Lady Winterbourne and sat staring at her visitor To those who knew its author well the monosyllable could not have been more expressive Lady Winterbourne s sense of humour had no voice but inwardly it was busy with Lord Alresford as the friend of the poor Alresford the narrowest and niggardliest tyrant alive so far as his own servants and estate were concerned And as to Lady Selina it was well known to the Winterbourne cousinship that she could never get a maid to stay with her six months What did you think of mister Wharton s speech the other night said Lady Selina bending suavely across the tea table to Marcella It was very interesting said Marcella stiffly perfectly conscious that the name had pricked the attention of everybody in the room and angry with her cheeks for reddening Wasn t it said Lady Selina heartily You can t do those things of course But you should show every sympathy to the clever enthusiastic young men the men like that shouldn t you That s what my father says He says we ve got to win them We ve got somehow to make them feel us their friends or we shall all go to ruin They have the voting power and we are the party of education of refinement If we can only lead that kind of man to see the essential justice of our cause and at the same time give them our help in reason show them we want to be their friends wouldn t it be best I don t know whether I put it rightly you know so much about these things But we can t undo sixty seven can we We must get round it somehow mustn t we And my father thinks Ministers so unwise But perhaps and Lady Selina drew herself back with a more gracious smile than ever I ought not to be saying these things to you of course I know you used to think us Conservatives very bad people but mister Wharton tells me perhaps you don t think quite so hardly of us as you used Lady Selina s head in its Paris bonnet fell to one side in a gentle interrogative sort of way Something roused in Marcella Our cause she repeated while the dark eye dilated I wonder what you mean Well I mean said Lady Selina seeking for the harmless word in the face of this unknown explosive looking girl I mean of course the cause of the educated of the people who have made the country I think said Marcella quietly you mean the cause of the rich don t you Marcella cried Lady Winterbourne catching at the tone rather than words I thought you didn t feel like that any more not about the distance between the poor and the rich and our tyranny and its being hopeless and the poor always hating us I thought you changed And forgetting Lady Selina remembering only the old talks at Mellor Lady Winterbourne bent forward and laid an appealing hand on Marcella s arm Marcella turned to her with an odd look If you only knew she said how much more possible it is to think well of the rich when you are living amongst the poor Ah you must be at a distance from us to do us justice enquired Lady Selina settling her bracelets with a sarcastic lip I must said Marcella looking however not at her but at Lady Winterbourne But then you see she caressed her friend s hand with a smile it is so easy to throw some people into opposition Dreadfully easy sighed Lady Winterbourne The flush mounted again in the girl s cheek She hesitated then felt driven to explanations You see oddly enough she pointed away for an instant to the north east through the open window it s when I m over there among the people who have nothing that it does me good to remember that there are persons who live in James Street Buckingham Gate My dear I don t understand said Lady Winterbourne studying her with her most perplexed and tragic air Well isn t it simple said Marcella still holding her hand and looking up at her It comes I suppose of going about all day in those streets and houses among people who live in one room with not a bit of prettiness anywhere and no place to be alone in or to rest in I come home and gloat over all the beautiful dresses and houses and gardens I can think of But don t you hate the people that have them said Betty again on her stool chin in hand No it doesn t seem to matter to me then what kind of people they are And I don t so much want to take from them and give to the others I only want to be sure that the beauty and the leisure and the freshness are some where not lost out of the world How strange in a life like yours that one should think so much of the ugliness of being poor more than of suffering or pain said Betty musing Well in some moods you do I do said Marcella and it is in those moods that I feel least resentful of wealth If I say to myself that the people who have all the beauty and the leisure are often selfish and cruel after all they die out of their houses and their parks and their pictures in time like the shell fish out of its shell The beauty and the grace which they created or inherited remain And why should one be envious of them personally They have had the best chances in the world and thrown them away are but poor animals at the end At any rate I can t hate them they seem to have a function when I am moving about Drury Lane she added with a smile But how can one help being ashamed said Lady Winterbourne as her eyes wandered over her pretty room and she felt herself driven somehow into playing devil s advocate No No said Marcella eagerly don t be ashamed As to the people who make beauty more beautiful who share it and give it I often feel as if I could say to them on my knees Never never be ashamed merely of being rich of living with beautiful things and having time to enjoy them One might as well be ashamed of being strong rather than a cripple or having two eyes rather than one Oh but my dear cried Lady Winterbourne piteous and bewildered when one has all the beauty and the freedom and other people must die without any Oh I know I know said Marcella with a quick gesture of despair that s what makes the world the world And one begins with thinking it can be changed that it must and shall be changed that everybody could have wealth could have beauty and rest and time to think that is to say if things were different if one could get Socialism if one could beat down the capitalist if one could level down and level up till everybody had two hundred l a year One turns and fingers the puzzle all day long It seems so near coming right one guesses a hundred ways in which it might be done Then after a while one stumbles upon doubt one begins to see that it never will never can come right not in any mechanical way of that sort that that isn t what was meant Her voice dropped drearily Betty Macdonald gazed at her with a girl s nascent adoration Lady Winterbourne was looking puzzled and unhappy but absorbed like Betty in Marcella Lady Selina studying the three with smiling composure was putting on her veil with the most careful attention to fringe and hairpins As for Ermyntrude she was no longer on the sofa she had risen noiselessly finger on lip almost at the beginning of Marcella s talk to greet a visitor She and he were standing at the back of the room in the opening of the conservatory unnoticed by any of the group in the bow window Don t you think said Lady Selina airily her white fingers still busy with her bonnet that it would be a very good thing to send all the Radicals the well to do Radicals I mean to live among the poor It seems to teach people such extremely useful things Marcella straightened herself as though some one had touched her impertinently She looked round quickly I wonder what you suppose it teaches Well said Lady Selina a little taken aback and hesitating well I suppose it teaches a person to be content and not to cry for the moon You think said Marcella slowly that to live among the poor can teach any one any one that s human to be content Her manner had the unconscious intensity of emphasis the dramatic force that came to her from another blood than ours Another woman could hardly have fallen into such a tone without affectation without pose At this moment certainly Betty who was watching her acquitted her of either and warmly thought her a magnificent creature Lady Selina s feeling simply was that she had been roughly addressed by her social inferior She drew herself up As I understand you she said stiffly you yourself confessed that to live with poverty had led you to think more reasonably of wealth Suddenly a movement of Lady Ermyntrude s made the speaker turn her head She saw the pair at the end of the room looked astonished then smiled Why mister Raeburn where have you been hiding yourself during this great discussion Most consoling wasn t it on the whole to us West End people She threw back a keen glance at Marcella Lady Ermyntrude and Raeburn came forward I made him be quiet said Ermyntrude not looking however quite at her ease it would have been a shame to interrupt I think so indeed said Lady Selina with emphasis Good bye dear Lady Winterbourne good bye Miss Boyce You have comforted me very much Of course one is sorry for the poor but it is a great thing to hear from anybody who knows as much about it as you do that after all it is no crime to possess a little She stood smiling looking from the girl to the man then escorted by Raeburn in his very stiffest manner she swept out of the room When Aldous came back with a somewhat slow and hesitating step he approached Marcella who was standing silent by the window and asked after the lame arm He was sorry he said to see that it was still in its sling His tone was a little abrupt Only Lady Winterbourne saw the quick nervousness of the eyes Oh thank you said Marcella coldly I shall get back to work next week She stooped and took up her book I must please go and write some letters she said in answer to Lady Winterbourne s flurried look And she walked away Betty and Lady Ermyntrude also went to take off their things Aldous said Lady Winterbourne holding out her hand to him He took it glanced unwillingly at her wistful agitated face pressed the hand and let it go Isn t it sad said his old friend unable to help herself to see her battling like this with life with thought all alone Isn t it sad Aldous Yes he said Then after a pause Why doesn t she go home My patience gives out when I think of missus Boyce Oh it isn t missus Boyce s fault said Lady Winterbourne hopelessly And I don t know why one should be sorry for her particularly why one should want her to change her life again She does it splendidly Only I never never feel that she is a bit happy in it It was Hallin s cry over again He said nothing for a moment then he forced a smile Well neither you nor I can help it can we he said The grey eyes looked at her steadily bitterly Lady Winterbourne with the sensation of one who looking for softness has lit on granite changed the subject Meanwhile Marcella upstairs was walking restlessly up and down She could hardly keep herself from rushing off back to Brown s Buildings at once He in the room while she was saying those things Lady Selina s words burnt in her ears Her morbid irritable sense was all one vibration of pride and revolt Apology appeal under the neatest comedy guise Of course now that Lord Maxwell was dying and the ill used suitor was so much the nearer to his earldom A foolish girl had repented her of her folly was anxious to make those concerned understand what more simple Her nerves were strained and out of gear Tears came in a proud passionate gush and she must needs allow herself the relief of them Meanwhile Lady Selina had gone home full of new and uncomfortable feelings She could not get Marcella Boyce out of her head neither as she had just seen her under the wing of that foolish woman Madeleine Winterbourne nor as she had seen her first on the terrace with Harry Wharton It did not please Lady Selina to feel herself in any way eclipsed or even rivalled by such an unimportant person as this strange and ridiculous girl Yet it crossed her mind with a stab as she lay resting on the sofa in her little sitting room before dinner that never in all her thirty five years had any human being looked into her face with the same alternations of eagerness and satisfied pleasure she had seen on Harry Wharton s as he and Miss Boyce strolled the terrace together nor even with such a look as that silly baby Betty Macdonald had put on as she sat on the stool at the heroine s feet There was to be a small dinner party at Alresford House that night Wharton was to be among the guests He was fast becoming one of the habitues of the house and would often stay behind to talk to Lady Selina when the guests were gone and Lord Alresford was dozing peacefully in a deep arm chair Lady Selina lay still in the evening light and let her mind which worked with extraordinary shrewdness and force in the grooves congenial to it run over some possibilities of the future She was interrupted by the entrance of her maid who with the quickened breath and heightened colour she could not repress when speaking to her formidable mistress told her that one of the younger housemaids was very ill Lady Selina enquired found that the doctor who always attended the servants had been sent for and thought that the illness might turn to rheumatic fever Oh send her off to the hospital at once said Lady Selina Let missus Stewart see doctor Briggs first thing in the morning and make arrangements You understand The girl hesitated and the candles she was lighting showed that she had been crying If your ladyship would but let her stay she said timidly we d all take our turns at nursing her She comes from Ireland perhaps you ll remember my lady She s no friends in London and she s frightened to death of going to the hospital That s nonsense said Lady Selina sternly Do you think I can have all the work of the house put out because some one is ill She might die even one never knows Just tell missus Stewart to arrange with her about her wages and to look out for somebody else at once The girl s mouth set sullenly as she went about her work put out the shining satin dress the jewels the hairpins the curling irons the various powders and cosmetics that were wanted for Lady Selina s toilette and all the time there was ringing in her ears the piteous cry of a little Irish girl clinging like a child to her only friend O Marie dear Marie do get her to let me stay I ll do everything the doctor tells me I ll make haste and get well I ll give no trouble And it s all along of the work and the damp up in these rooms the doctor said so An hour later Lady Selina was in the stately drawing room of Alresford House receiving her guests She was out of sorts and temper and though Wharton arrived in due time and she had the prospect to enliven her during dinner when he was of necessity parted from her by people of higher rank of a tete a tete with him before the evening was over the dinner went heavily The Duke on her right hand and the Dean on her left were equally distasteful to her Neither food nor wine had savour and once when in an interval of talk she caught sight of her father s face and form at the further end growing more vacant and decrepit week by week she was seized with a sudden angry pang of revolt and repulsion Her father wearied and disgusted her Life was often triste and dull in the great house Yet when the old man should have found his grave she would be a much smaller person than she was now and the days would be so much the more tedious Wharton too showed less than his usual animation She said to herself at dinner that he had the face of a man in want of sleep His young brilliant look was somewhat tarnished and there was worry in the restless eye And indeed she knew that things had not been going so favourably for him in the House of late that the stubborn opposition of the little group of men led by Wilkins was still hindering that concentration of the party and definition of his own foremost place in it which had looked so close and probable a few weeks before She supposed he had been exhausting himself too over that shocking Midland strike The Clarion had been throwing itself into the battle of the men with a monstrous violence for which she had several times reproached him When all the guests had gone but Wharton and Lord Alresford duly placed for the sake of propriety in his accustomed chair was safely asleep Lady Selina asked what was the matter Oh the usual thing he said as he leant against the mantelpiece beside her The world s a poor place and my doll s stuffed with sawdust Did you ever know any doll that wasn t She looked up at him a moment without speaking Which means she said that you can t get your way in the House No said Wharton meditatively looking down at his boots No not yet You think you will get it some day He raised his eyes Oh yes he said oh dear yes some day She laughed You had better come over to us Well there is always that to think of isn t there You can t deny you want all the new blood you can get If you only understood your moment and your chance she said quickly you would make the opportunity and do it at once He looked at her aggressively How easy it comes to you Tories to rat he said Thank you it only means that we are the party of common sense Well I have been talking to your Miss Boyce He started Where At Lady Winterbourne s Aldous Raeburn was there Your beautiful Socialist was very interesting and rather surprising She talked of the advantages of wealth said she had been converted by living among the poor had changed her mind in fact on many things We were all much edified including mister Raeburn How long do you suppose that business will remain off To my mind I never saw a young woman more eager to undo a mistake Then she added slowly The accounts of Lord Maxwell get more and more unsatisfactory Wharton stared at her with sparkling eyes How little you know her he said not without a tone of contempt Oh very well said Lady Selina with the slightest shrug of her white shoulders He turned to the mantelpiece and began to play with some ornaments upon it Tell me what she said he enquired presently Lady Selina gave her own account of the conversation Wharton recovered himself Dear me he said when she stopped Yes well we may see another act Who knows Well good night Lady Selina She gave him her hand with her usual aristocrat s passivity and he went But it was late indeed that night before she ceased to speculate on what the real effect of her words had been upon him As for Wharton on his walk home he thought of Marcella Boyce and of Raeburn with a certain fever of jealous vanity which was coming he told himself dangerously near to passion He did not believe Lady Selina but nevertheless he felt that her news might drive him into rash steps he could ill afford and had indeed been doing his best to avoid Meanwhile it was clear to him that the mistress of Alresford House had taken an envious dislike to Marcella How plain she had looked to night in spite of her gorgeous dress and how intolerable Lord Alresford grew CHAPTER XII But what right had Wharton to be thinking of such irrelevant matters as women and love making at all He had spoken of public worries to Lady Selina In reality his public prospects in themselves were if anything improved It was his private affairs that were rushing fast on catastrophe and threatening to drag the rest with them He had never been so hard pressed for money in his life In the first place his gambling debts had mounted up prodigiously of late His friends were tolerant and easy going But the more tolerant they were the more he was bound to frequent them And his luck for some time had been monotonously bad Before long these debts must be paid and some of them to a figure he shrank from dwelling upon were already urgent Then as to the Clarion it became every week a heavier burden The expenses of it were enormous the returns totally inadequate Advertisements were falling off steadily and whether the working cost were cut down or whether a new and good man like Louis Craven whose letters from the strike district were being now universally read were put on the result financially seemed to be precisely the same It was becoming even a desperate question how the weekly expenses were to be met so that Wharton s usual good temper now deserted him entirely as soon as he had crossed the Clarion threshold bitterness had become the portion of the staff and even the office boys walked in gloom Yet at the same time withdrawing from the business was almost as difficult as carrying it on There were rumours in the air which had already seriously damaged the paper as a saleable concern Wharton indeed saw no prospect whatever of selling except at ruinous loss Meanwhile to bring the paper to an abrupt end would have not only precipitated a number of his financial obligations it would have been politically a dangerous confession of failure made at a very critical moment For what made the whole thing the more annoying was that the Clarion had never been so important politically never so much read by the persons on whom Wharton s parliamentary future depended as it was at this moment The advocacy of the Damesley strike had been so far a stroke of business for Wharton as a Labour Member It was now the seventh week of the strike and Wharton s leaders Craven s letters from the seat of war and the Clarion strike fund which articles and letters had called into existence were as vigorous as ever The struggle itself had fallen into two chapters In the first the metal workers concerned both men and women had stood out for the old wages unconditionally and had stoutly rejected all idea of arbitration At the end of three or four weeks however when grave suffering had declared itself among an already half starved population the workers had consented to take part in the appointment of a board of conciliation This board including the workmen s delegates overawed by the facts of foreign competition as they were disclosed by the masters recommended terms which would have amounted to a victory for the employers The award was no sooner known in the district than the passionate indignation of the great majority of the workers knew no bounds Meetings were held everywhere the men s delegates at the board were thrown over and Craven who with his new wife was travelling incessantly over the whole strike area wrote a letter to the Clarion on the award which stated the men s case with extreme ability was immediately backed up by Wharton in a tremendous leader and was received among the strikers with tears almost of gratitude and enthusiasm Since then all negotiations had been broken off The Clarion had gone steadily against the masters against the award against further arbitration The theory of the living wage of which more recent days have heard so much was preached in other terms but with equal vigour and the columns of the Clarion bore witness day by day in the long lists of subscriptions to the strike fund to the effects of its eloquence on the hearts and pockets of Englishmen Meanwhile there were strange rumours abroad It was said that the trade was really on the eve of a complete and striking revolution in its whole conditions could this labour war be only cleared out of the way The smaller employers had been for long on the verge of ruin and the larger men so report had it were scheming a syndicate on the American plan to embrace the whole industry cut down the costs of production and regulate the output But for this large capital would be wanted Could capital be got The state of things in the trade according to the employers had been deplorable for years a large part of the market had been definitely forfeited so they declared for good to Germany and Belgium It would take years before even a powerful syndicate could work itself into a thoroughly sound condition Let the men accept the award of the conciliation board let there be some stable and reasonable prospect of peace between masters and men say for a couple of years and a certain group of bankers would come forward and all would be well The men under the syndicate would in time get more than their old wage But the award first otherwise the plan dropped and the industry must go its own way to perdition Will you walk into my parlour said Wharton scornfully to the young Conservative member who with a purpose was explaining these things to him in the library of the House of Commons the merest trap and of course the men will see it so Who is to guarantee them even the carrying through much less the success of your precious syndicate And in return for your misty millennium two years hence the men are to join at once in putting the employers in a stronger position than ever Thank you The rent of ability in the present state of things is no doubt large But in this particular case the Clarion will go on doing its best I promise you to nibble some of it away The Conservative member rose in indignation I should be sorry to have as many starving people on my conscience as you ll have before long he said as he took up his papers At that moment Denny s rotund and square headed figure passed along the corridor to which the library door stood open Well if I thrive upon it as well as Denny does I shall do returned Wharton with his usual caustic good humour as his companion departed And it delighted him to think as he walked home that Denny who had again of late made himself particularly obnoxious in the House of Commons on two or three occasions to the owner of the Clarion had probably instigated the quasi overtures he had just rejected and must be by now aware of their result Then he sent for Craven to come and confer with him Craven accordingly came up from the Midlands pale thin and exhausted with the exertions and emotions of seven weeks incessant labour Yet personally Wharton found him as before dry and unsympathetic and disliked him and his cool ambiguous manner more than ever As to the strike however they came to a complete understanding The Clarion or rather the Clarion fund which was doing better and better held the key of the whole situation If that fund could be maintained the men could hold out In view of the possible formation of the syndicate Craven denounced the award with more fierceness than ever maintaining the redoubled importance of securing the men s terms before the syndicate was launched Wharton promised him with glee that he should be supported to the bitter end If that is to say a proviso he did not discuss with Craven the Clarion itself could be kept going In August a large sum obtained two years before on the security of new plant would fall due The time for repayment had already been extended and Wharton had ascertained that no further extension was possible Well bankruptcy would be a piquant interlude in his various social and political enterprises How was it to be avoided He had by now plenty of rich friends in the City or elsewhere but none as he finally decided likely to be useful to him at the present moment For the amount of money that he required was large larger indeed than he cared to verify with any strictness and the security that he could offer almost nil As to friends in the City indeed the only excursion of a business kind that he had made into those regions since his election was now adding seriously to his anxieties might very well turn out unless the matter were skilfully managed to be one of the blackest spots on his horizon In the early days of his parliamentary life when again mostly for the Clarion s sake money happened to be much wanted he had become director of what promised to be an important company through the interest and good nature of a new and rich acquaintance who had taken a liking to the young member The company had been largely boomed and there had been some very profitable dealing in the original shares Wharton had made two or three thousand pounds and contributed both point and finish to some of the early prospectuses Then after six months he had withdrawn from the Board under apprehensions that had been gradually realised with alarming accuracy Things indeed had been going very wrong indeed there were a number of small investors and the annual meeting of the company to be held now in some ten days promised a storm Wharton discovered partly to his own amazement for he was a man who quickly forgot that during his directorate he had devised or sanctioned matters that were not at all likely to commend themselves to the shareholders supposing the past were really sifted The ill luck of it was truly stupendous for on the whole he had kept himself financially very clean since he had become a member having all through a jealous eye to his political success As to the political situation nothing could be at once more promising or more anxious An important meeting of the whole Labour group had been fixed for August ten by which time it was expected that a great measure concerning Labour would be returned from the House of Lords with highly disputable amendments The last six weeks of the session would be in many ways more critical for Labour than its earlier months had been and it would be proposed by Bennett at the meeting on the tenth to appoint a general chairman of the party in view of a campaign which would fill the remainder of the session and strenuously occupy the recess That Bennett would propose the name of the member for West Brookshire was perfectly well known to Wharton and his friends That the nomination would meet with the warmest hostility from Wilkins and a small group of followers was also accurately forecast To this day then Wharton looked forward as to the crisis of his parliamentary fortunes All his chances financial or social must now be calculated with reference to it Every power whether of combat or finesse that he commanded must be brought to bear upon the issue What was however most remarkable in the man and the situation at the moment was that through all these gathering necessities he was by no means continuously anxious or troubled in his mind During these days of July he gave himself indeed whenever he could to a fatalist oblivion of the annoyances of life coupled with a passionate pursuit of all those interests where his chances were still good and the omens still with him Especially during the intervals of ambition intrigue journalism and unsuccessful attempts to raise money had he meditated the beauty of Marcella Boyce and the chances and difficulties of his relation to her As he saw her less he thought of her more instinctively looking to her for the pleasure and distraction that life was temporarily denying him elsewhere At the same time curiously enough the stress of his financial position was reflected even in what to himself at any rate he was boldly beginning to call his passion for her It had come to his knowledge that mister Boyce had during the past year succeeded beyond all expectation in clearing the Mellor estate He had made skilful use of a railway lately opened on the edge of his property had sold building land in the neighbourhood of a small country town on the line within a convenient distance of London had consolidated and improved several of his farms and relet them at higher rents was in fact according to Wharton s local informant in a fair way to be some day if he lived quite as prosperous as his grandfather in spite of old scandals and invalidism Wharton knew or thought he knew that he would not live and that Marcella would be his heiress The prospect was not perhaps brilliant but it was something it affected the outlook Although however this consideration counted it was to do him justice Marcella the creature herself that he desired But for her presence in his life he would probably have gone heiress hunting with the least possible delay As it was his growing determination to win her together with his advocacy of the Damesley workers amply sufficed during the days that followed his evening talk with Lady Selina to maintain his own illusions about himself and so to keep up the zest of life Yes to master and breathe passion into Marcella Boyce might safely be reckoned on he thought to hurry a man s blood And after it had gone so far between them after he had satisfied himself that her fancy her temper her heart were all more or less occupied with him was he to see her tamely recovered by Aldous Raeburn by the man whose advancing parliamentary position was now adding fresh offence to the old grievance and dislike No not without a dash a throw for it For a while after Lady Selina s confidences jealous annoyance together with a certain reckless state of nerves turned him almost into the pining lover For he could not see Marcella She came no more to missus Lane and the house in James Street was not open to him He perfectly understood that the Winterbournes did not want to know him At last missus Lane a shrewd little woman with a half contemptuous liking for Wharton let him know on the strength of a chance meeting with Lady Ermyntrude that the Winterbournes would be at the Masterton party on the twenty sixth They had persuaded Miss Boyce to stay for it and she would go back to her work the Monday after Wharton carelessly replied that he did not know whether he would be able to put in an appearance at the Mastertons He might be going out of town missus Lane looked at him and said Oh really with a little laugh Lady Masterton was the wife of the Colonial Secretary and her grand mansion in Grosvenor Square was the principal rival to Alresford House in the hospitalities of the party Her reception on July twenty five was to be the last considerable event of a protracted but now dying season Marcella detained in James Street day after day against her will by the weakness of the injured arm and the counsels of her doctor had at last extracted permission to go back to work on the twenty seventh and to please Betty Macdonald she had promised to go with the Winterbournes to the Masterton party on the Saturday Betty s devotion shyly as she had opened her proud heart to it had begun to mean a good deal to her There was balm in it for many a wounded feeling and besides there was the constant half eager half painful interest of watching Betty s free and childish ways with Aldous Raeburn and of speculating upon what would ultimately come out of them So when Betty first demanded to know what she was going to wear and then pouted over the dress shown her Marcella submitted humbly to being freshened up at the hands of Lady Ermyntrude s maid bought what Betty told her and stood still while Betty who had a genius for such things chattered and draped and suggested I wouldn t make you fashionable for the world cried Betty with a mouthful of pins laying down masterly folds of lace and chiffon the while over the white satin with which Marcella had provided her What was it Worth said to me the other day Ce qu on porte Mademoiselle O pas grand chose presque pas de corsage et pas du tout de manches No that kind of thing wouldn t suit you But distinguished you shall be if I sit up all night to think it out In the end Betty was satisfied and could hardly be prevented from hugging Marcella there and then out of sheer delight in her own handiwork when at last the party emerged from the cloak room into the Mastertons crowded hall Marcella too felt pleasure in the reflections of herself as they passed up the lavishly bemirrored staircase The chatter about dress in which she had been living for some days had amused and distracted her for there were great feminine potentialities in her though for eighteen months she had scarcely given what she wore a thought and in her pre nursing days had been wont to waver between a kind of proud neglect which implied the secret consciousness of beauty and an occasional passionate desire to look well So that she played her part to night very fairly pinched Betty s arm to silence the elf s tongue and held herself up as she was told that Betty s handiwork might look its best But inwardly the girl s mood was very tired and flat She was pining for her work pining even for Minta Hurd s peevish look and the children to whom she was so easily an earthly providence In spite of the gradual emptying of London Lady Masterton s rooms were very full Marcella found acquaintances Many of the people whom she had met at missus Lane s the two Cabinet Ministers of the House of Commons dinner mister Lane himself all were glad or eager to recall themselves to her as she stood by Lady Winterbourne or made her way half absently through the press She talked without shyness she had never been shy and was perhaps nearer now to knowing what it might mean than she had been as a schoolgirl but without heart her black eye wandering meanwhile as though in quest There was a gay sprinkling of uniforms in the crowd for the Speaker was holding a levee and as it grew late his guests began to set towards Lady Masterton Betty who had been turning up her nose at the men she had so far smiled upon all of whom she declared were either bald or seventy was a little propitiated by the uniforms otherwise she pronounced the party very dull Well upon my word she cried suddenly in a tone that made Marcella turn upon her The child was looking very red and very upright was using her fan with great vehemence and Frank Leven was humbly holding out his hand to her I don t like being startled said Betty pettishly Yes you did startle me you did you did And then you begin to contradict before I ve said a word I m sure you ve been contradicting all the way upstairs and why don t you say How do you do to Miss Boyce Frank looking very happy but very nervous paid his respects rather bashfully to Marcella she laughed to see how Betty s presence subdued him and then gave himself up wholly to Betty s tender mercies Marcella observed them with an eager interest she could not wholly explain to herself It was clear that all thought of anything or anybody else had vanished for Frank Leven at the sight of Betty Marcella guessed indeed knew that they had not met for some little time and she was touched by the agitation and happiness on the boy s handsome face But Betty what was the secret of her kittenish teasing ways or was there any secret She held her little head very high and chattered very fast but it was not the same chatter that she gave to Marcella nor so far as Marcella could judge to Aldous Raeburn New elements of character came out in it It was self confident wilful imperious Frank was never allowed to have an opinion was laughed at before his words were out of his mouth was generally heckled played with and shaken in a way which seemed alternately to enrage and enchant him In the case of most girls such a manner would have meant encouragement but as it was Betty no one could be sure The little thing was a great puzzle to Marcella who had found unexpected reserves in her She might talk of her love affairs to Aldous Raeburn she had done nothing of the sort with her new friend And in such matters Marcella herself was far more reserved than most modern women Betty cried Lady Winterbourne I am going on into the next room Then in a lower tone she said helplessly to Marcella Do make her come on Marcella perceived that her old friend was in a fidget Stooping her tall head she said with a smile But look how she is amusing herself My dear that s just it If you only knew how her mother tiresome woman has talked to me And the young man has behaved so beautifully till now has given neither Ermyntrude nor me any trouble Was that why Betty was leading him such a life Marcella wondered then suddenly was seized with a sick distaste for the whole scene for Betty s love affairs for her own interest in them for her own self and personality above all Her great black eyes gazed straight before them unseeing over the crowd the diamonds the lights her whole being gave itself to a quick blind wrestle with some vague overmastering pain some despair of life and joy to which she could give no name She was roused by Betty s voice mister Raeburn will you tell me who people are mister Leven s no more use than my fan Just imagine I asked him who that lady in the tiara is and he vows he doesn t know Why it just seems that when you go to Oxford you leave the wits you had before behind And then of course Betty affected a delicate hesitation there s the difficulty of being quite sure that you ll ever get any new ones But there look I m in despair she s vanished and I shall never know One moment said Raeburn smiling and I will take you in pursuit She has only gone into the tea room His hand touched Marcella s Just a little better he said with a sudden change of look in answer to Lady Winterbourne s question The account to night is certainly brighter They begged me not to come or I should have been off some days ago And next week I am thankful to say they will be home Why should she be standing there so inhumanly still and silent Marcella asked herself Why not take courage again join in talk show sympathy But the words died on her lips After to night thank heaven she need hardly see him again He asked after herself as usual Then just as he was turning away with Betty he came back to her unexpectedly I should like to tell you about Hallin he said gently His sister writes to me that she is happier about him and that she hopes to be able to keep him away another fortnight They are at Keswick For an instant there was pleasure in the implication of common ground a common interest here if no where else Then the pleasure was lost in the smart of her own strange lack of self government as she made a rather stupid and awkward reply Raeburn s eyes rested on her for a moment There was in them a flash of involuntary expression which she did not notice for she had turned away which no one saw except Betty Then the child followed him to the tea room a little pale and pensive Marcella looked after them In the midst of the uproar about her the babel of talk fighting against the Hungarian band which was playing its wildest and loudest in the tea room she was overcome by a sudden rush of memory Her eyes were tracing the passage of those two figures through the crowd the man in his black court suit stooping his refined and grizzled head to the girl beside him or turning every now and then to greet an acquaintance with the manner cordial and pleasant yet never quite gay even when he smiled that she Marcella had begun to notice of late as a new thing the girl lifting her small face to him the gold of her hair showing against his velvet sleeve But the inward sense was busy with a number of other impressions past and as it now seemed incredible The little scene when Aldous had given her the pearls returned so long ago why she could see the fire blazing in the Stone Parlour feel his arm about her the drive home after the Gairsley meeting that poignant moment in his sitting room the night of the ball his face his anxious tender face as she came down the wide stairs of the Court towards him on that terrible evening when she pleaded with him and his grandfather in vain had these things incidents relations been ever a real part of the living world Impossible Why there he was not ten yards from her and yet more irrevocably separate from her than if the Sahara stretched between them The note of cold distance in his courteous manner put her further from him than the merest stranger Marcella felt a sudden terror rush through her as she blindly followed Lady Winterbourne her limbs trembled under her she took advantage of a conversation between her companion and the master of the house to sink down for a moment on a settee where she felt out of sight and notice What was this intolerable sense of loss and folly this smarting emptiness this rage with herself and her life She only knew that whereas the touch the eye of Aldous Raeburn had neither compelled nor thrilled her so long as she possessed his whole heart and life now that she had no right to either look or caress now that he had ceased even to regard her as a friend and was already perhaps making up that loyal and serious mind of his to ask from another woman the happiness she had denied him now when it was absurdly too late she could Could what Passionate wilful creature that she was with that breath of something wild and incalculable surging through the inmost places of the soul she went through a moment of suffering as she sat pale and erect in her corner brushed against by silks and satins chattered across by this person and that such as seemed to bruise all the remaining joy and ease out of life But only a moment Flesh and blood rebelled She sprang up from her seat told herself that she was mad or ill caught sight of mister Lane coming towards them and did her best by smile and greeting to attract him to her You look very white my dear Miss Boyce said that cheerful and fatherly person Is it that tiresome arm still Now don t please go and be a heroine any more CHAPTER XIII Meanwhile in the tea room Betty was daintily sipping her claret cup while Aldous stood by her No said Betty calmly looking straight at the lady in the tiara who was standing by the buffet she s not beautiful and I ve torn my dress running after her There s only one beautiful person here to night Aldous found her a seat and took one himself beside her in a corner out of the press But he did not answer her remark Don t you think so mister Aldous said Betty persisting but with a little flutter of the pulse You mean Miss Boyce he said quietly as he turned to her Of course cried Betty with a sparkle in her charming eyes what is it in her face It excites me to be near her One feels that she will just have lived twice as much as the rest of us by the time she comes to the end You don t mind my talking of her mister Aldous There was an instant s silence on his part Then he said in a constrained voice looking away from his companion I don t mind it but I am not going to pretend to you that I find it easy to talk of her It would be a shame of you to pretend anything said Betty fervently after all I ve told you I confessed all my scrapes to you turned out all my rubbish bag of a heart well nearly all she checked herself with a sudden flush And you ve been as kind to me as any big brother could be But you re dreadfully lofty mister Aldous You keep yourself to yourself I don t think it s fair Aldous laughed My dear Miss Betty haven t you found out by now that I am a good listener and a bad talker I don t talk of myself or he hesitated the things that have mattered most to me because in the first place it doesn t come easy to me and in the next I can t you see discuss my own concerns without discussing other people s Oh good gracious said Betty what you must have been thinking about me I declare I ll never tell you anything again and beating her tiny foot upon the ground she sat scarlet looking down at it Aldous made all the smiling excuses he could muster He had found Betty a most beguiling and attaching little companion both at the Court in the Easter recess and during the Italian journey Her total lack of reserve or what appeared so had been first an amazement to him and then a positive pleasure and entertainment To make a friend of him difficult and scrupulous as he was and now more than ever a woman must be at the cost of most of the advances But after the first evening with him Betty had made them in profusion without the smallest demur though perfectly well aware of her mother s ambitions There was a tie of cousinship between them and a considerable difference of age Betty had decided at once that a mother was a dear old goose and that great friends she and Aldous Raeburn should be and in a sense great friends they were Aldous was still propitiating her when Lady Winterbourne came into the tea room followed by Marcella The elder lady threw a hurried and not very happy glance at the pair in the corner Marcella appeared to be in animated talk with a young journalist whom Raeburn knew and did not look their way Just one thing said Betty bending forward and speaking eagerly in Aldous s ear It was all a mistake wasn t it Now I know her I feel sure it was You don t you don t really think badly of her Aldous heard her unwillingly He was looking away from her towards the buffet when she saw a change in the eyes a tightening of the lip a something keen and hostile in the whole face Perhaps Miss Boyce will be less of a riddle to all of us before long he said hastily as though the words escaped him Shall we get out of this very uncomfortable corner Betty looked where he had looked and saw a young man greeting Marcella with a manner so emphatic and intimate that the journalist had instantly moved out of his way The young man had a noticeable pile of fair curls above a very white and rounded forehead Who is that talking to Miss Boyce she asked of Aldous I have seen him but I can t remember the name That is mister Wharton the member for one of our divisions said Aldous as he rose from his chair Betty gave a little start and her brow puckered into a frown As she too rose she said resentfully to Aldous Well you have snubbed me As usual he could not find the effective or clever thing to say I did not mean to he replied simply but Betty glancing at him saw something in his face which gripped her heart A lump rose in her throat Do let s go and find Ermyntrude she said But Wharton had barely begun his talk with Marcella when a gentleman on his way to the buffet with a cup to set down touched him on the arm Wharton turned in some astonishment and annoyance He saw a youngish good looking man well known to him as already one of the most important solicitors in London largely trusted by many rich or eminent persons May I have a word with you presently said mister Pearson in a pleasant undertone I have something of interest to say to you and it occurred to me that I might meet you to night Excuse my interrupting you He glanced with admiration at Marcella who had turned away Wharton had a momentary qualm Then it struck him that mister Pearson s manner was decidedly friendly In a moment he said We might find a corner I think in that further room He made a motion of the head towards a little boudoir which lay beyond the tea room mister Pearson nodded and passed on Wharton returned to Marcella who had fallen back on Frank Leven At the approach of the member for West Brookshire Lady Winterbourne and her daughter had moved severely away to the further end of the buffet A tiresome man wants me on business for a moment he said then he dropped his voice a little but I have been looking forward to this evening this chance for days shall I find you here again in five minutes Marcella who had flushed brightly said that would depend on the time and Lady Winterbourne He hurried away with a little gesture of despair Frank followed him with a sarcastic eye Any one would think he was prime minister already I never met him yet anywhere that he hadn t some business on hand Why does he behave as though he had the world on his shoulders Your real swells always seem to have nothing to do Do you know so many busy people Marcella asked him sweetly Oh you shan t put me down Miss Boyce said the boy sulkily thrusting his hands into his pockets I am going to work like blazes this winter if only my dons will let a fellow alone I say isn t she ripping to night Betty And pulling his moustache in helpless jealousy and annoyance he stared at the Winterbourne group across the room which had been now joined by Aldous Raeburn and Betty standing side by side What do you want me to say said Marcella with a little cold laugh I shall make you worse if I praise her Please put my cup down At the same moment she saw Wharton coming back to her mister Pearson behind him smiling and gently twirling the seals of his watch chain She was instantly struck by Wharton s look of excitement and by the manner in which with a momentary glance aside at the Winterbourne party he approached her There is such a charming little room in there he said stooping his head to her and so cool after this heat Won t you try it The energy of his bright eye took possession of her He led the way she followed Her dress almost brushed Aldous Raeburn as she passed He took her into a tiny room There was no one else there and he found a seat for her by an open window where they were almost hidden from view by a stand of flowers As he sat down again by her she saw that a decisive moment had come and blanched almost to the colour of her dress Oh what to do Her heart cried out vaguely to some power beyond itself for guidance then gave itself up again to the wayward thirst for happiness He took her hand strongly in both his own and bending towards her as she sat bowered among the scent and colours of the flowers he made her a passionate declaration From the first moment that he had seen her under the Chiltern beeches so he vowed he had felt in her the supreme incomparable attraction which binds a man to one woman and one only His six weeks under her father s roof had produced in him feelings which he knew to be wrong without thereby finding in himself any power to check them They had betrayed him into a mad moment which he had regretted bitterly because it had given her pain Otherwise his voice dropped and shook his hand pressed hers I lived for months on the memory of that one instant But he had respected her suffering her struggle her need for rest of mind and body For her sake he had gone away into silence he had put a force upon himself which had alone enabled him to get through his parliamentary work Then with his first sight of her in that little homely room and dress so changed but so lovely everything admiration passion had revived with double strength Since that meeting he must have often puzzled her as he had puzzled himself His life had been a series of perplexities He was not his own master he was the servant of a cause in which however foolishly a mocking habit might have led him at times to be little his own enthusiasms and hers his life and honour were engaged and this cause and his part in it had been for long hampered and all his clearness of vision and judgment dimmed by the pressure of a number of difficulties and worries he could not have discussed with her worries practical and financial connected with the Clarion with the experiments he had been carrying out on his estate and with other troublesome matters He had felt a thousand times that his fortunes political or private were too doubtful and perilous to allow him to ask any woman to share them Then again he had seen her and his resolution his scruple had melted in his breast Well there were still troubles in front But he was no longer cowed by them In spite of them he dared now to throw himself at her feet to ask her to come and share a life of combat and of labour to bring her beauty and her mind to the joint conduct of a great enterprise To her a man might show his effort and his toil from her he might claim a sympathy it would be vain to ask of any smaller woman Then suddenly he broke down Speech seemed to fail him Only his eyes more intense and piercing under their straight brows than she had ever known them beseeched her his hand sought hers She meanwhile sat in a trance of agitation mistress neither of reason nor of feeling She felt his spell as she had always done The woman in her thrilled at last to the mere name and neighbourhood of love The heart in her cried out that pain and loss could only be deadened so the past could only be silenced by filling the present with movement and warm life Yet what tremors of conscience what radical distrust of herself and him And the first articulate words she found to say to him were very much what she had said to Aldous so long ago only filled with a bitterer and more realised content After all what do we know of each other You don t know me not as I am And I feel Doubts he said smiling Do you imagine that that seems anything but natural to me I can have none but you After all we are not quite boy and girl you and I we have lived both of us But ask yourself has not destiny brought us together Think of it all Their eyes met again Hers sank under the penetration the flame of his Yet throughout he was conscious of the doorway to his right of the figures incessantly moving across it His own eloquence had convinced and moved himself abundantly Yet as he saw her yielding he was filled with the strangest mixture of passion and a sort of disillusion almost contempt If she had turned from him with the dignity worthy of that head and brow it flashed across him that he could have tasted more of the abandonment of love have explored his own emotion more perfectly Still the situation was poignant enough in one sense complete Was Raeburn still there in that next room My answer he said to her pressing her hand as they sat in the shelter of the flowers For he was aware of the practical facts the hour the place if she was not She roused herself I can t she said making a movement to rise which his strong grasp however prevented I can t answer you to night mister Wharton I should have much to think over so much It might all look quite different to me You must give me time To morrow he said quietly No she said impetuously not to morrow I go back to my work and I must have quiet and time In a fortnight not before I will write Oh impossible he said with a little frown And still holding her he drew her towards him His gaze ran over the face the warm whiteness under the lace of the dress the beautiful arms She shrank from it feeling a sudden movement of dislike and fear but before she could disengage herself he had pressed his lips on the arm nearest to him I gave you no leave she said passionately under her breath as he let her go He met her flashing look with tender humbleness Marcella The word was just breathed into the air She wavered yet a chill had passed over her She could not recover the moment of magic Not to morrow she repeated steadily though dreading lest she should burst into tears and not till I see clearly till I can She caught her breath Now I am going back to Lady Winterbourne CHAPTER XIV For some hours after he reached his own room Wharton sat in front of his open window sunk in the swift rushing of thought as a bramble sways in a river The July night first paled then flushed into morning the sun rose above the empty street and the light mists enwrapping the great city before he threw himself on his bed exhausted enough at last to fall into a restless sleep The speculation of those quick pulsed hours was in the end about equally divided between Marcella and the phrases and turns of his interview with mister Pearson It was the sudden leap of troubled excitement stirred in him by that interview heightened by the sight of Raeburn that had driven him past recall by the most natural of transitions into his declaration to Marcella But he had no sooner reached his room than at first with iron will he put the thought of Marcella of the scene which had just passed away from him His pulses were still quivering No matter It was the brain he had need of He set it coolly and keenly to work mister Pearson Well mister Pearson had offered him a bribe there could be no question as to that His clear sense never blinked the matter for an instant Nor had he any illusions as to his own behaviour Even now he had no further right to the sleep of the honest man Let him realise however what had happened He had gone to Lady Masterton s party in the temper of a man who knows that ruin is upon him and determined like the French criminal to exact his cigar and eau de vie before the knife falls Never had things looked so desperate never had all resource seemed to him so completely exhausted Bankruptcy must come in the course of a few weeks his entailed property would pass into the hands of a receiver and whatever recovery might be ultimately possible by the end of August he would be for the moment socially and politically undone There could be no question of his proposing seriously to Marcella Boyce Nevertheless he had gone to Lady Masterton s on purpose to meet her and his manner on seeing her had asserted precisely the same intimate claim upon her which during the past six weeks had alternately attracted and repelled her Then mister Pearson had interrupted Wharton shutting his eyes could see the great man lean against the window frame close to the spot where a quarter of an hour later Marcella had sat among the flowers the dapper figure the long fair moustaches the hand playing with the eye glass I have been asked er er What a conceited manner the fellow had to get some conversation with you mister Wharton on the subject of the Damesley strike You give me leave Whereupon in less than ten minutes the speaker had executed an important commission and in offering Wharton a bribe of the most bare faced kind had also found time for supplying him with a number of the most delicate and sufficient excuses for taking it The masters in fact sent an embassy They fully admitted the power of the Clarion and its owner No doubt it would not be possible for the paper to keep up its strike fund indefinitely there were perhaps already signs of slackening Still it had been maintained for a considerable time and so long as it was reckoned on in spite of the wide spread misery and suffering now prevailing the men would probably hold out In these circumstances the principal employers concerned had thought it best to approach so formidable an opponent and to put before him information which might possibly modify his action They had authorised mister Pearson to give him a full account of what was proposed in the way of re organisation of the trade including the probable advantages which the work people themselves would be likely to reap from it in the future mister Pearson ran in a few sentences through the points of the scheme Wharton stood about a yard away from him his hands in his pockets a little pale and frowning looking intently at the speaker Then mister Pearson paused and cleared his throat Well that was the scheme His principals believed that when both it and the employers determination to transfer their business to the Continent rather than be beaten by the men were made fully known to the owner of the Clarion it must affect his point of view mister Pearson was empowered to give him any details he might desire Meanwhile so confident were they in the reasonableness of the case that they even suggested that the owner of the Clarion himself should take part in the new Syndicate On condition of his future company operation it being understood that the masters took their stand irrevocably on the award the men at present responsible for the formation of the Syndicate proposed to allot mister Wharton ten Founder s Shares in the new undertaking Wharton sitting alone recalling these things was conscious again of that start in every limb that sudden rush of blood to the face as though a lash had struck him For in a few seconds his mind took in the situation Only the day before a city acquaintance had said to him If you and your confounded paper were out of the way and this thing could be placed properly on the market there would be a boom in it at once I am told that in twenty four hours the Founder s Shares would be worth two thousand l apiece There was a pause of silence Then Wharton threw a queer dark look at the solicitor and was conscious that his pulse was thumping There can be no question I think mister Pearson between you and me as to the nature of such a proposal as that My dear sir mister Pearson had interrupted hastily let me above all ask you to take time time enough at any rate to turn the matter well over in your mind The interests of a great many people besides yourself are concerned Don t give me an answer to night it is the last thing I desire I have thrown out my suggestion Consider it To morrow is Sunday If you are disposed to carry it further come and see me Monday morning that s all I will be at your service at any hour and I can then give you a much more complete outline of the intentions of the Company Now I really must go and look for missus Pearson s carriage Wharton followed the great man half mechanically across the little room his mind in a whirl of mingled rage and desire Then suddenly he stopped his companion Has George Denny anything to do with this proposal mister Pearson mister Pearson paused with a little air of vague cogitation George Denny mister George Denny the member for Westropp I have had no dealings whatever with that gentleman in the matter Wharton let him pass Then as he himself entered the tea room he perceived the bending form of Aldous Raeburn chatting to Lady Winterbourne on his right and that tall whiteness close in front waiting for him His brain cleared in a flash He was perfectly conscious that a bribe had just been offered him of the most daring and cynical kind and that he had received the offer in the tamest way An insult had been put upon him which had for ever revealed the estimate held of him by certain shrewd people for ever degraded him in his own eyes Nevertheless he was also conscious that the thing was done The bribe would be accepted the risk taken So far as his money matters were concerned he was once more a free man The mind had adjusted itself reached its decision in a few minutes And the first effect of the mingled excitement and self contempt which the decision brought with it had been to drive him into the scene with Marcella Instinctively he asked of passion to deliver him quickly from the smart of a new and very disagreeable experience Well why should he not take these men s offer He was as much convinced as they that this whole matter of the strike had of late come to a deadlock So long as the public would give the workers passionately certain of the justice of their own cause and filled with new ambitions after more decent living would hold out On the other hand he perfectly understood that the masters had also in many ways a strong case that they had been very hard hit by the strike and that many of them would rather close their works or transfer them bodily to the Continent than give way Some of the facts Pearson had found time to mention had been certainly new and striking At the same time he never disguised from himself for an instant that but for a prospective twenty thousand l the facts concerned would not have affected him in the least Till to night it had been to his interest to back the strike and to harass the employers Now things were changed and he took a curious satisfaction in the quick movements of his own intelligence as his thought rapidly sketched the curve the Clarion would have to take and the arguments by which he would commend it As to his shares they would be convertible of course into immediate cash Some man of straw would be forthcoming to buy what he would possess in the name of another man of straw It was not supposed he took for granted by the men who had dared to tempt him that he would risk his whole political reputation and career for anything less than a bird in the hand Well what were the chances of secrecy Naturally they stood to lose less by disclosure a good deal than he did And Denny one of the principal employers was his personal enemy He would be likely enough for the present to keep his name out of the affair But no man of the world could suppose that the transaction would pass without his knowledge Wharton s own hasty question to mister Pearson on the subject seemed to himself now in cold blood a remarkably foolish one He walked up and down thinking this point out It was the bitter pill of the whole affair In the end with a sudden recklessness of youth and resource he resolved to dare it There would not be much risk Men of business do not as a rule blazon their own dirty work and public opinion would be important to the new Syndicate Some risk of course there would be Well his risks as they stood were pretty considerable He chose the lesser not without something of a struggle some keen personal smart He had done a good many mean and questionable things in his time but never anything as gross as this The thought of what his relation to a certain group of men to Denny especially would be in the future stung sharply But it is the part of the man of action to put both scruple and fear behind him on occasion His career was in question Craven Well Craven would be a difficulty He would telegraph to him first thing in the morning before the offices closed and see him on Monday For Marcella s sake the man must be managed somehow And Marcella How should she ever know ever suspect She already disliked the violence with which the paper had supported the strike He would find no difficulty whatever in justifying all that she or the public would see to her Then insensibly he let his thoughts glide into thinking of the money Presently he drew a sheet of paper towards him and covered it with calculations as to his liabilities By George how well it worked out By the time he threw it aside and walked to the window for air he already felt himself a bona fide supporter of the Syndicate the promoter in the public interest of a just and well considered scheme Finally with a little joyous energetic movement which betrayed the inner man he flung down his cigarette and turned to write an ardent letter to Marcella while the morning sun stole into the dusty room Difficult of course Both now and in the future It would take him half his time yet and he could ill afford it to bring her bound and captive He recognised in her the southern element so strangely mated with the moral English temper Yet he smiled over it The subtleties of the struggle he foresaw enchanted him And she would be mastered In this heightened state of nerve his man s resolution only rose the more fiercely to the challenge of her resistance Nor should she cheat him with long delays His income would be his own again and life decently easy He already felt himself the vain showman of her beauty A thought of Lady Selina crossed his mind producing amusement and compassion indulgent amusement such as the young man is apt to feel towards the spinster of thirty five who pays him attention A certain sense of re habilitation too which at the moment was particularly welcome For no doubt he might have married her and her fortune had he so chosen As it was why didn t she find some needy boy to take pity on her There were plenty going and she must have abundance of money Old Alresford too was fast doddering off the stage and then where would she be without Alresford House or Busbridge or those various other pedestals which had hitherto held her aloft Early on Sunday morning Wharton telegraphed to Craven directing him to come up at once for consultation The rest of the day the owner of the Clarion spent pleasantly on the river with missus Lane and a party of ladies including a young Duchess who was pretty literary and socialistic At night he went down to the Clarion office and produced a leader on the position of affairs at Damesley which to the practised eye contained one paragraph but one only wherein the dawn of a new policy might have been discerned Naturally the juxtaposition of events at the moment gave him considerable anxiety He knew very well that the Damesley bargain could not be kept waiting The masters were losing heavily every day and were not likely to let him postpone the execution of his part of the contract for a fortnight or so to suit his own convenience It was like the sale of an old master His influence must be sold now at the ripe moment or not at all At the same time it was very awkward In one short fortnight the meeting of the party would be upon him Surrender on the Damesley question would give great offence to many of the Labour members It would have to be very carefully managed very carefully thought out By eleven o clock on Monday he was in mister Pearson s office After the first involuntary smile concealed by the fair moustaches and instantly dismissed with which the eminent lawyer greeted the announcement of his visitor s name the two augurs carried through their affairs with perfect decorum Wharton realised indeed that he was being firmly handled mister Pearson gave the Clarion a week in which to accomplish its retreat and drop its strike fund And the fund was to be checked as soon as possible A little later when Wharton abruptly demanded a guarantee of secrecy mister Pearson allowed himself his first visible smile My dear sir are such things generally made public property I can give you no better assurance than you can extract yourself from the circumstances As to writing well I should advise you very strongly against anything of the sort A long experience has convinced me that in any delicate negotiation the less that is written the better Towards the end Wharton turned upon his companion sharply and asked How did you discover that I wanted money mister Pearson lifted his eyebrows pleasantly Most of the things in this world mister Wharton that one wants to know can be found out Now I have no wish to hurry you not in the least but I may perhaps mention that I have an important appointment directly Don t you think we might settle our business Wharton was half humorously conscious of an inward leap of fury with the necessities which had given this man to whom he had taken an instantaneous dislike the power of dealing thus summarily with the member for West Brookshire However there was no help for it he submitted and twenty minutes afterwards he left Lincoln s Inn carrying documents in the breast pocket of his coat which when brought under his bankers notice would be worth to him an immediate advance of some eight thousand pounds The remainder of the purchase money for his shares would be paid over to him as soon as his part of the contract had been carried out He did not however go to his bank but straight to the Clarion office where he had a mid day appointment with Louis Craven At first sight of the tall narrow shouldered form and anxious face waiting for him in his private room Wharton felt a movement of ill humour Craven had the morning s Clarion in his hand This cannot mean he said when they had exchanged a brief salutation that the paper is backing out He pointed to the suspicious paragraph in Wharton s leader his delicate features quivering with an excitement he could ill repress Well let us sit down and discuss the thing said Wharton closing the door that s what I wired to you for He offered Craven a cigarette which was refused took one himself and the two men sat confronting each other with a writing table between them Wharton was disagreeably conscious at times of the stiff papers in his coat pocket and was perhaps a little paler than usual Otherwise he showed no trace of mental disturbance and Craven himself jaded and sleepless was struck with a momentary perception of his companion s boyish good looks the tumbling curls that Wharton straightened now and then the charming blue eyes the athlete s frame Any stranger would have taken Craven for the older man in reality it was the other way The conversation lasted nearly an hour Craven exhausted both argument and entreaty though when the completeness of the retreat resolved upon had been disclosed to him the feeling roused in him was so fierce that he could barely maintain his composure He had been living among scenes of starvation and endurance which to his mind had all the character of martyrdom These men and women were struggling for two objects the power to live more humanly and the free right of combination to both of which if need were he would have given his own life to help them without an instant s hesitation Behind his blinking manner he saw everything with the idealist s intensity the reformer s passion To be fair to an employer was not in his power To spend his last breath were it called for in the attempt to succour the working man against his capitalist oppressors would have seemed to him the merest matter of course And his mental acuteness was quite equal to his enthusiasm and far more evident In his talk with Wharton he for a long time avoided as before out of a certain inner disdain the smallest touch of sentiment He pointed out what indeed Wharton well knew that the next two or three weeks of the strike would be the most critical period in its history that if the work people could only be carried through them they were almost sure of victory He gave his own reasons for believing that the employers could ultimately be coerced he offered proof of yielding among them proof also that the better men in their ranks were fully alive to and ashamed of the condition of the workers As to the Syndicate he saw no objection to it provided the workers claims were first admitted Otherwise it would only prove a more powerful engine of oppression Wharton s arguments may perhaps be left to the imagination He would have liked simply to play the proprietor and the master to say This is my decision those are my terms take my work or leave it But Craven was Miss Boyce s friend he was also a Venturist Chafing under both facts Wharton found that he must state his case And he did state it with his usual ability He laid great stress on information from a private source which I cannot disregard to the effect that if the resistance went on the trade would be broken up that several of the largest employers were on the point of making arrangements for Italian factories I know he said finally that but for the Clarion the strike would drop Well I have come to the conclusion that the responsibility is too heavy I shall be doing the men themselves more harm than good There is the case in a nutshell We differ I can t help that The responsibility is mine Craven rose with a quick nervous movement The prophet spoke at last You understand he said laying a thin hand on the table that the condition of the workers in this trade is infamous that the award and your action together plunge them back into a state of things which is a shame and a curse to England Wharton made no answer He too had risen and was putting away some papers in a drawer A tremor ran through Craven s tall frame and for an instant as his eye rested on his companion the idea of foul play crossed his mind He cast it out that he might deal calmly with his own position Of course you perceive he said as he took up his hat that I can no longer on these terms remain the Clarion s correspondent Somebody else must be found to do this business I regret your decision immensely said Wharton with perfect suavity but of course I understand it I trust however that you will not leave us altogether I can give you plenty of work that will suit you Here for instance he pointed to a pile of Blue Books from the Labour Commission lying on the table are a number of reports that want analysing and putting before the public You could do them in town at your leisure Craven struggled with himself His first instinct was to fling the offer in Wharton s face Then he thought of his wife of the tiny new household just started with such small happy self denying shifts of the woman s inevitable lot of the hope of a child Thank you he said in a husky voice I will consider I will write Wharton nodded to him pleasantly and he went The owner of the Clarion drew a long breath Now I think on the whole it would serve my purpose best to sit down and write to her after that It would be well that my account should come first A few hours later after an interview with his bankers and a further spell of letter writing Wharton descended the steps of his club in a curious restless state The mortgage on the Clarion had been arranged for his gambling debts settled and all his other money matters were successfully in train Nevertheless the exhilaration of the morning had passed into misgiving and depression Vague presentiments hung about him all day whether in the House of Commons or elsewhere and it was not till he found himself on his legs at a crowded meeting at Rotherhithe violently attacking the Government Bill and the House of Lords that he recovered that easy confidence in the general favourableness of the universe to Harry Wharton and Harry Wharton s plans which lent him so much of his power A letter from Marcella written before she had received either of his reached him at the House just before he started for his meeting A touching letter yet with a certain resolution in it which disconcerted him Forget if you will everything that you said to me last night It might be I believe it would be best for us both But if you will not if I must give my answer then as I said I must have time It is only quite recently that I have realised the enormity of what I did last year I must run no risks of so wrenching my own life or another s a second time Not to be sure is for me torment Why perfect simplicity of feeling which would scorn the very notion of questioning itself seems to be beyond me I do not know That it is so fills me with a sort of shame and bitterness But I must follow my nature So let me think it out I believe you know for one thing that your cause your life work attracts me strongly I should not any longer accept all you say as I did last year But mere opinion matters infinitely less to me than it did I can imagine now agreeing with a friend in everything except opinion All that would matter to me now would be to feel that your heart was wholly in your work in your public acts so that I might still admire and love all that I might differ from But there for we must be frank with each other is just my difficulty Why do you do so many contradictory things Why do you talk of the poor of labour of self denial and live whenever you can with the idle rich people who hate all three in their hearts You talk their language you scorn what they scorn or so it seems you accept their standards Oh to the really consecrate in heart and thought I could give my life so easily so slavishly even There is no one weaker than I in the world I must have strength to lean upon and a strength pure at the core that I can respect and follow Here in this nursing life of mine I go in and out among people to the best of whom life is very real and simple and often of course very sad And I am another being in it from what I was at Lady Winterbourne s Everything looks differently to me No no you must please wait till the inner voice speaks so that I can hear it plainly for your sake at least as much as for mine If you persisted in coming to see me now I should have to put an end to it all Strange is the modern woman thought Wharton to himself not without sharp pique as he pondered that letter in the course of his drive home from the meeting I talk to her of passion and she asks me in return why I do things inconsistent with my political opinions puts me through a moral catechism in fact What is the meaning of it all confound it her state of mind and mine Is the good old ars amandi perishing out of the world Let some Stendhal come and tell us why But he sat up to answer her and could not get free from an inward pleading or wrestle with her which haunted him through all the intervals of these rapid days Life while they lasted was indeed a gymnast s contest of breath and endurance The Clarion made its retreat in Wharton s finest style and the fact rang through labouring England The strike leaders came up from the Midlands Wharton had to see them He was hotly attacked in the House privately and even publicly by certain of his colleagues Bennett showed concern and annoyance Meanwhile the Conservative papers talked the usual employers political economy and the Liberal papers whose support of the strike had been throughout perfunctory and of no particular use to themselves or to other people took a lead they were glad to get and went in strongly for the award Through it all Wharton showed extraordinary skill The columns of the Clarion teemed with sympathetic appeals to the strikers flanked by long statements of hard fact the details of foreign competition and the rest the plans of the masters freely supplied him by mister Pearson With Bennett and his colleagues in the House he took a bold line admitted that he had endangered his popularity both inside Parliament and out of it at a particularly critical moment and implied though he did not say that some men were still capable of doing independent things to their own hurt Meanwhile he pushed a number of other matters to the front both in the paper and in his own daily doings He made at least two important speeches in the provinces in the course of these days on the Bill before the House of Lords he asked questions in Parliament on the subject of the wages paid to Government employes and he opened an attack on the report of a certain Conservative Commission which had been rousing the particular indignation of a large mass of South London working men At the end of ten days the strike was over the workers sullen and enraged had submitted and the plans of the Syndicate were in all the papers Wharton looking round him realised to his own amazement that his political position had rather gained than suffered The general impression produced by his action had been on the whole that of a man strong enough to take a line of his own even at the risk of unpopularity There was a new tone of respect among his opponents and resentful as some of the Labour members were Wharton did not believe that what he had done would ultimately damage his chances on the tenth at all He had vindicated his importance and he held his head high adopting towards his chances of the leadership a strong and careless tone that served him well Meanwhile there were of course clever people behind the scenes who looked on and laughed But they held their tongues and Wharton who had carefully avoided the mention of names during the negotiations with Pearson did his best to forget them He felt uncomfortable indeed when he passed the portly Denny in the House or in the street Denny had a way of looking at the member for West Brookshire out of the corner of a small slit like eye He did it more than usual during these days and Wharton had only to say to himself that for all things there is a price which the gods exact Wilkins since the first disclosure of the Clarion change of policy had been astonishingly quiet Wharton had made certain of violent attack from him On the contrary Wilkins wore now in the House a subdued and pre occupied air that escaped notice even with his own party in the general fulness of the public mind A few caustic north countryisms on the subject of the Clarion and its master did indeed escape him now and then and were reported from mouth to mouth but on the whole he lay very low Still whether in elation or anxiety Wharton seemed to himself throughout the whole period to be a fighter straining every muscle his back to the wall and his hand against every man There at the end of the fortnight stood the three goal posts that must be passed in victory or defeat the meeting that would for the present decide his parliamentary prospects his interview with Marcella and the confounded annual meeting of the People s Banking Company with all its threatened annoyances He became indeed more and more occupied with this latter business as the days went on But he could see no way of evading it He would have to fight it luckily now he had the money The annual meeting took place two days before that fixed for the committee of the Labour party Wharton was not present at it and in spite of ample warning he gave way to certain lively movements of disgust and depression when at his club he first got hold of the evening papers containing the reports His name of course figured amply in the denunciations heaped upon the directors of all dates the sums which he with others were supposed to have made out of the first dealings with the shares on the Stock Exchange were freely mentioned and the shareholders as a body had shown themselves most uncomfortably violent He at once wrote off a letter to the papers disclaiming all responsibility for the worst irregularities which had occurred and courting full enquiry a letter which as usual both convinced and affected himself Then he went restless and fuming down to the House Bennett passed him in the lobby with an uneasy and averted eye Whereupon Wharton seized upon him carried him into the Library and talked to him till Bennett who in spite of his extraordinary shrewdness and judgment in certain departments was a babe in matters of company finance wore a somewhat cheered countenance They came out into the lobby together Wharton holding his head very high I shall deal with the whole thing in my speech on Thursday he said aloud as they parted Bennett gave him a friendly nod and smile There was in this little man with his considerable brain and his poet s heart something of the imperishable child Like a wholesome child he did not easily think evil his temper towards all men even the owners of way leaves and mining royalties was optimist He had the most naive admiration for Wharton s ability and for the academic attainments he himself secretly pined for and to the young complex personality itself he had taken from the beginning an unaccountable liking The bond between the two though incongruous and recent was real Wharton was as glad of Bennett s farewell kindness as Bennett had been of the younger man s explanations So that during that day and the next Bennett went about contradicting championing explaining while Wharton laden with parliamentary business vivid unabashed and resourceful let it be known to all whom it concerned that in his solicitor s opinion he had a triumphant answer to all charges and that meanwhile no one could wonder at the soreness of those poor devils of shareholders The hours passed on Wednesday was mainly spent by Wharton in a series of conferences and intrigues either at the House or at his club when he drove home exhausted at night he believed that all was arranged the train irrevocably laid and his nomination to the chairmanship of the party certain Wilkins and six or seven others would probably prove irreconcilable but the vehemence and rancour shown by the great Nehemiah during the summer in the pursuit of his anti Wharton campaign had to some extent defeated themselves A personal grudge in the hands of a man of his type is not a formidable weapon Wharton would have felt perfectly easy on the subject but for some odd bits of manner on Wilkins s part during the last forty eight hours whenever in fact the two men had run across each other in the House marked by a sort of new and insolent good humour that puzzled him But there is a bravado of defeat Yes he thought Wilkins was disposed of From his present point of ease debts paid banker propitiated income assured it amazed him to look back on his condition of a fortnight before Had the Prince of Darkness himself offered such a bargain it must have been accepted After all his luck had held Once get through this odious company business as to which with a pleasing consciousness of turning the tables he had peremptorily instructed mister Pearson himself and the barque of his fortunes was assured Then with a quick turn of the mind he threw the burden of affairs from him His very hopefulness and satisfaction had softened his mood There stole upon him the murmurs and voices of another world of thought a world well known to his versatility by report though he had as a rule small inclination to dwell therein But he was touched and shaken to night by his own achievement The heavenly powers had been unexpectedly kind to him and he was half moved to offer them something in return Do as you are done by that was an ethic he understood And in moments of feeling he was as ready to apply it to great Zeus himself as to his friends or enemies in the House of Commons He had done this doubtful thing but why should it ever be necessary for him to do another Vague philosophic yearnings after virtue moderation patriotism crossed his mind The Pagan ideal sometimes smote and fired him the Christian never He could still read his Plato and his Cicero whereas gulfs of unfathomable distaste rolled between him and the New Testament Perhaps the author of all authors for whom he had most relish was Montaigne He would have taken him down to night had there been nothing more kindling to think of Marcella ah Marcella He gave himself to the thought of her with a new and delightful tenderness which had in it elements of compunction After those disagreeable paragraphs in the evening papers he had instantly written to her Every public man he had said to her finding instinctively the note of dignity that would appeal to her is liable at some period of his career to charges of this sort They are at once exaggerated and blackened because he is a public man To you I owe perfect frankness and you shall have it Meanwhile I do not ask I know that you will be just to me and put the matter out of your thoughts till I can discuss it with you Two days more till I see your face The time is long To this there had been no answer Her last letter indeed had rung sadly and coldly No doubt Louis Craven had something to do with it It would have alarmed him could he simply have found the time to think about it Yet she was ready to see him on the eleventh and his confidence in his own powers of managing fate was tougher than ever What pleasant lies he had told her at Lady Masterton s Well What passion ever yet but had its subterfuges One more wrestle and he would have tamed her to his wish wild falcon that she was Then pleasure and brave living And she also should have her way She should breathe into him the language of those great illusions he had found it of late so hard to feign with her and they two would walk and rule a yielding world together Action passion affairs life explored and exploited and at last que la mort me treuve plantant mes choulx mais nonchalant d elle et encore plus de mon jardin imparfaict He declaimed the words of the great Frenchman with something of the same temper in which the devout man would have made an act of faith Then with a long breath and a curious emotion he went to try and sleep himself into the new day CHAPTER XV The following afternoon about six o clock Marcella came in from her second round After a very busy week work happened to be slack and she had been attending one or two cases in and near Brown s Buildings rather because they were near than because they seriously wanted her She looked to see whether there was any letter or telegram from the office which would have obliged her to go out again Nothing was to be seen and she put down her bag and cloak childishly glad of the extra hour of rest She was indeed pale and worn The moral struggle which had filled the past fortnight from end to end had deepened all the grooves and strained the forces of life and the path though glimmering was not wholly plain A letter lay unfinished in her drawer if she sent it that night there would be little necessity or inducement for Wharton to climb those stairs on the morrow Yet if he held her to it she must see him As the sunset and the dusk crept on she still sat silent and alone sunk in a depression which showed itself in every line of the drooping form She was degraded in her own eyes The nature of the impulses which had led her to give Wharton the hold upon her she had given him had become plain to her What lay between them and the worst impulses that poison the lives of women but differences of degree of expression After those wild hours of sensuous revolt a kind of moral terror was upon her What had worked in her What was at the root of this vehemence of moral reaction this haunting fear of losing for ever the best in life self respect the comradeship of the good communion with things noble and unstained which had conquered at last the mere woman the weakness of vanity and of sex She hardly knew Only there was in her a sort of vague thankfulness for her daily work It did not seem to be possible to see one s own life solely under the aspects of selfish desire while hands and mind were busy with the piteous realities of sickness and of death From every act of service from every contact with the patience and simplicity of the poor something had spoken to her that divine ineffable something for ever set in the world like beauty like charm for the winning of men to itself Follow truth it said to her in faint mysterious breathings the truth of your own heart The sorrow to which it will lead you is the only joy that remains to you Suddenly she looked round her little room with a rush of tenderness The windows were open to the evening and the shouts of children playing in the courtyard came floating up A bowl of Mellor roses scented the air the tray for her simple meal stood ready and beside it a volume of The Divine Comedy one of her mother s very rare gifts to her in her motherless youth for of late she had turned thirstily to poetry There was a great peace and plainness about it all and besides touches of beauty tokens of the soul Her work spoke in it called to her promised comfort and ennobling She thought with yearning too of her parents of the autumn holiday she was soon to spend with them Her heart went out sorely to all the primal claims upon it Nevertheless clear as was the inner resolution the immediate future filled her with dread Her ignorance of herself her excitable folly had given Wharton rights which her conscience admitted He would not let her go without a struggle and she must face it As to the incidents which had happened during the fortnight Louis Craven s return and the scandal of the People s Banking Company they had troubled and distressed her but it would not be true to say that they had had any part in shaping her slow determination Louis Craven was sore and bitter She was very sorry for him and his reports of the Damesley strikers made her miserable But she took Wharton s leaders in the Clarion for another equally competent opinion on the same subject and told herself that she was no judge As for the Company scandal she had instantly and proudly responded to the appeal of his letter and put the matter out of her thoughts till at least he should give his own account So much at any rate she owed to the man who had stood by her through the Hurd trial Marcella Boyce would not readily believe in his dishonour She did not in fact believe it In spite of later misgivings the impression of his personality as she had first conceived it in the early days at Mellor was still too strong No rather she had constantly recollected throughout the day what was going on in Parliament These were for him testing and critical hours and she felt a wistful sympathy Let him only rise to his part take up his great task An imperious knocking on her thin outer door roused her She went to open it and saw Anthony Craven the perspiration standing on his brow his delicate cripple s face white and fierce I want to talk to you he said without preface Have you seen the afternoon papers No she said in astonishment I was just going to send for them What is wrong He followed her into the sitting room without speaking and then he unfolded the Pall Mall he had in his hand and pointed to a large print paragraph on the central page with a shaking hand Marcella read EXCITING SCENES IN THE HOUSE MEETING OF THE LABOUR MEMBERS A committee of the Labour representatives in Parliament met this afternoon at two o clock for the purpose of electing a chairman and appointing whips to the party thus constituting a separate parliamentary group Much interest was felt in the proceedings which it was universally supposed would lead to the appointment of mister H S Wharton the member for West Brookshire as chairman and leader of the Labour party The excitement of the meeting and in the House may be imagined when after a short but very cordial and effective speech from mister Bennett the member for North Whinwick in support of mister Wharton s candidature mister Wilkins the miner s member for Derlingham rose and made a series of astounding charges against the personal honour of the member for West Brookshire Put briefly they amount to this that during the recent strike at Damesley the support of the Clarion newspaper of which mister Wharton is owner and practically editor was bought by the employers in return for certain shares in the new Syndicate that the money for these shares which is put as high as twenty thousand l had already gone into mister Wharton s private pocket and that the change of policy on the part of the Clarion which led to the collapse of the strike was thus entirely due to what the Labour members can only regard under the circumstances as a bribe of a most disgraceful kind The effect produced has been enormous The debate is still proceeding and reporters have been excluded But I hope to send a fuller account later Marcella dropped the paper from her hand What does it mean she said to her companion Precisely what it says replied Anthony with a nervous impatience he could not repress Now he added as his lameness forced him to sit down will you kindly allow me some conversation with you It was you practically who introduced Louis to that man You meant well to Louis and mister Wharton has been your friend We therefore feel that we owe you some explanation For that paragraph he pointed to the paper is substantially Louis s doing and mine Yours she said mechanically But Louis has been going on working for the paper I persuaded him I know It was not we who actually discovered the thing But we set a friend to work Louis has had his suspicions all along And at last by the merest chance we got the facts Then he told the story staring at her the while with his sparkling eyes his thin invalid s fingers fidgeting with his hat If there was in truth any idea in his mind that the relations between his companion and Harry Wharton were more than those of friendship it did not avail to make him spare her in the least He was absorbed in vindictive feeling which applied to her also He might say for form s sake that she had meant well but in fact he regarded her at this moment as a sort of odious Canidia whose one function had been to lure Louis to misfortune Cut off himself by half a score of peculiarities physical and other from love pleasure and power Anthony Craven s whole affections and ambitions had for years centred in his brother And now Louis was not only violently thrown out of employment but compromised by the connection with the Clarion was moreover saddled with a wife and in debt So that his explanation was given with all the edge he could put upon it Let her stop him if she pleased but she did not stop him The facts were these Louis had indeed been persuaded by Marcella for the sake of his wife and bread and butter to go on working for the Clarion as a reviewer But his mind was all the time feverishly occupied with the apostasy of the paper and its causes Remembering Wharton s sayings and letters throughout the struggle he grew less and less able to explain the incident by the reasons Wharton had himself supplied and more and more convinced that there was some mystery behind He and Anthony talked the matter over perpetually One evening Anthony brought home from a meeting of the Venturists that George Denny the son of one of the principal employers in the Damesley trade whose name he had mentioned once before in Marcella s ears Denny was by this time the candidate for a Labour constituency an ardent Venturist and the laughing stock of his capitalist family with whom however he was still on more or less affectionate terms His father thought him an incorrigible fool and his mother wailed over him to her friends But they were still glad to see him whenever he would condescend to visit them and all friction on money matters was avoided by the fact that Denny had for long refused to take any pecuniary help from his father and was nevertheless supporting himself tolerably by lecturing and literature Denny was admitted into the brothers debate and had indeed puzzled himself a good deal over the matter already He had taken a lively interest in the strike and the articles in the Clarion which led to its collapse had seemed to him both inexplicable and enraging After his talk with the Cravens he went away determined to dine at home on the earliest possible opportunity He announced himself accordingly in Hertford Street was received with open arms and then deliberately set himself at dinner and afterwards to bait his father on social and political questions which as a rule were avoided between them Old Denny fell into the trap lost his temper and self control completely and at a mention of Harry Wharton skilfully introduced at the precisely right moment as an authority on some matter connected with the current Labour programme he threw himself back in his chair with an angry laugh Wharton Wharton You quote that fellow to me Why shouldn t I said the son quietly Because my good sir he s a rogue that s all a common rogue from my point of view even still more from yours I know that any vile tale you can believe about a Labour leader you do father said George Denny with dignity Whereupon the older man thrust his hand into his coat pocket and drawing out a small leather case in which he was apt to carry important papers about with him extracted from it a list containing names and figures and held it with a somewhat tremulous hand under his son s eyes Read it sir and hold your tongue Last week my friends and I bought that man and his precious paper for a trifle of twenty thousand l or thereabouts It paid us to do it and we did it I dare say you will think the preceding questionable In my eyes it was perfectly legitimate a piece of bonne guerre The man was ruining a whole industry Some of us had taken his measure had found out too by good luck that he was in sore straits for money mortgages on the paper gambling debts and a host of other things discovered a shrewd man to play him and made our bid He rose to it like a gudgeon gave us no trouble whatever I need not say of course he added looking up at his son that I have shown you that paper in the very strictest confidence But it seemed to me it was my duty as a father to warn you of the nature of some of your associates I understand said George Denny as after a careful study of the paper which contained for the help of the writer s memory a list of the sums paid and founders shares allotted to the various promoters of the new Syndicate he restored it to its owner Well I father have this to say in return I came here to night in the hope of getting from you this very information and in the public interest I hold myself not only free but bound to make public use of it at the earliest possible opportunity The family scene may be imagined But both threats and blandishments were entirely lost upon the son There was in him an idealist obstinacy which listened to nothing but the cry of a cause and he declared that nothing would or should prevent him from carrying the story of the bribe direct to Nehemiah Wilkins Wharton s chief rival in the House and so saving the country and the Labour party from the disaster and disgrace of Wharton s leadership There was no time to lose the party meeting in the House was only two days off At the end of a long struggle which exhausted everybody concerned and was carried on to a late hour of the night Denny pere influenced by a desire to avoid worse things conscious too of the abundant evidence he possessed of Wharton s acceptance and private use of the money and probably when it came to the point not unwilling under compulsion to tumble such a hero from his pedestal actually wrote under his son s advice a letter to Wilkins It was couched in the most cautious language and professed to be written in the interests of Wharton himself to put an end to certain ugly and unfounded rumours that have been brought to my knowledge The negotiation itself was described in the driest business terms mister Wharton upon cause shown consented to take part in the founding of the Syndicate and in return for his assistance was allotted ten founders shares in the new company The transaction differed in nothing from those of ordinary business a last sentence slily added by the Socialist son and innocently accepted by one of the shrewdest of men After which Master George Denny scarcely slept and by nine o clock next morning was in a hansom on his way to Wilkins s lodgings in Westminster The glee of that black bearded patriot hardly needs description He flung himself on the letter with a delight and relief so exuberant that George Denny went off to another more phlegmatic member of the anti Wharton cave with entreaties that an eye should be kept on the member for Derlingham lest he should do or disclose anything before the dramatic moment Then he himself spent the next forty eight hours in ingenious efforts to put together certain additional information as to the current value of founders shares in the new company the nature and amount of Wharton s debts and so on Thanks to his father s hints he was able in the end to discover quite enough to furnish forth a supplementary statement So that when the tenth arrived the day rose upon a group of men breathlessly awaiting a play within a play with all their parts rehearsed and the prompter ready Such in substance was Anthony s story So carried away was he by the excitement and triumph of it that he soon ceased to notice what its effect might be upon his pale and quick breathing companion And now what has happened she asked him abruptly when at last he paused Why you saw he said in astonishment pointing to the evening paper at least the beginning of it Louis is at the House now I expect him every moment He said he would follow me here Marcella pressed her hands upon her eyes a moment as though in pain Anthony looked at her with a tardy prick of remorse I hear Louis s knock he said springing up May I let him in And without waiting for reply he hobbled as fast as his crutch would carry him to the outer door Louis came in Marcella rose mechanically He paused on the threshold his short sight trying to make her out in the dusk Then his face softened and quivered He walked forward quickly I know you have something to forgive us he said and that this will distress you But we could not give you warning Everything was so rapid and the public interests involved so crushing He was flushed with vengeance and victory but as he approached her his look was deprecating almost timid Only the night before Anthony for the first time had suggested to him an idea about her He did not believe it had had no time in truth to think of it in the rush of events But now he saw her the doubt pulled at his heart Had he indeed stabbed the hand that had tried to help him Anthony touched him impatiently on the arm What has happened Louis I have shown Miss Boyce the first news It is all over said Louis briefly The meeting was breaking up as I came away It had lasted nearly five hours There was a fierce fight of course between Wharton and Wilkins Then Bennett withdrew his resolution refused to be nominated himself nearly broke down in fact they say he had always been attached to Wharton and had set his heart upon making him leader and finally after a long wrangle Molloy was appointed chairman of the party Good cried Anthony not able to suppress the note of exultation Louis did not speak He looked at Marcella Did he defend himself she asked in a low sharp voice Louis shrugged his shoulders Oh yes He spoke but it did him no good Everybody agreed that the speech was curiously ineffective One would have expected him to do it better But he seemed to be knocked over He said of course that he had satisfied himself and given proof in the paper that the strike could not be maintained and that being so he was free to join any syndicate he pleased But he spoke amid dead silence and there was a general groan when he sat down Oh it was not this business only Wilkins made great play in part of his speech with the Company scandal too It is a complete smash all round Which he will never get over said Marcella quickly Not with our men What he may do elsewhere is another matter Anthony has told you how it came out She made a sign of assent She was sitting erect and cold her hands round her knees I did not mean to keep anything from you he said in a low voice bending to her I know you admired him that he had given you cause But my mind has been on fire ever since I came back from those Damesley scenes She offered no reply Silence fell upon all three for a minute or two and in the twilight each could hardly distinguish the others Every now and then the passionate tears rose in Marcella s eyes her heart contracted That very night when he spoke to her when he used all those big words to her about his future those great ends for which he had claimed her woman s help he had these things in his mind I think said Louis Craven presently touching her gently on the arm he had tried once in vain to attract her attention I think I hear some one asking for you outside on the landing missus Hurd seems to be bringing them in As he spoke Anthony suddenly sprang to his feet and the outer door opened Louis cried Anthony it is he Are yer at home miss said Minta Hurd putting in her head I can hardly see it s so dark Here s a gentleman wants to see you As she spoke Wharton passed her and stood arrested by the sight of the three figures At the same moment missus Hurd lit the gas in the little passage The light streamed upon his face and showed him the identity of the two men standing beside Marcella Never did Marcella forget that apparition the young grace and power of the figure the indefinable note of wreck of catastrophe the Lucifer brightness of the eyes in the set face She moved forward Anthony stopped her Good night Miss Boyce She shook hands unconsciously with him and with Louis The two Cravens turned to the door Wharton advanced into the room and let them pass You have been in a hurry to tell your story he said as Louis walked by him Contemptuous hate breathed from every feature but he was perfectly self controlled Yes said Craven calmly Now it is your turn The door was no sooner shut than Wharton strode forward and caught her hand They have told you everything Ah His eye fell upon the evening paper Letting her go he felt for a chair and dropped into it Throwing himself back his hands behind his head he drew a long breath and his eyes closed For the first time in his life or hers she saw him weak and spent like other men Even his nerve had been worn down by the excitement of these five fighting hours The eyes were lined and hollow the brow contracted the young roundness of the cheek was lost in the general pallor and patchiness of the skin the lower part of the face seemed to have sharpened and lengthened and over the whole had passed a breath of something aging and withering the traces of which sent a shiver through Marcella She sat down near him still in her nurse s cloak one trembling hand upon her lap Will you tell me what made you do this she asked not being able to think of anything else to say He opened his eyes with a start In that instant s quiet the scene he had just lived through had been rushing before him again the long table in the panelled committee room the keen angry faces gathered about it Bennett in his blue tie and shabby black coat the clear moist eyes vexed and miserable Molloy small and wiry business like in the midst of confusion cool in the midst of tumult and Wilkins a black hectoring leviathan thundering on the table as he flung his broad Yorkshire across it or mouthing out Denny s letter in the midst of the sudden electrical silence of some thirty amazed and incredulous hearers Spies yo call us with a finger like a dart threatening the enemy Aye an yo re aboot reet I and my friends we have been trackin and spyin for weeks past We knew those men those starvin women and bairns were bein sold but we couldn t prove it Now we ve come at the how and the why of it And we ll make it harder for men like you to sell em again Yo call it infamy well we call it detection Then rattling on the inner ear came the phrases of the attack which followed on the director of The People s Banking Association the injured innocent of as mean a job as unsavoury a bit of vulturous finance as had cropped into publicity for many a year and finally the last dramatic cry But it s noa matter yo say Mester Wharton has nobbut played his party and the workin man a dirty trick or two an yo mun have a gentleman Noa the workin man isn t fit himself to speak wi his own enemies i th gate yo mun have a gentleman an Mester Wharton he says he ll tak the post an dea his best for yo an remember yo mun have a gentleman Soa now Yes or No wull yo or woan t yo And at that the precipitation of the great unwieldy form half across the table towards Wharton s seat the roar of the speaker s immediate supporters thrown up against the dead silence of the rest As to his own speech he thought of it with a soreness a disgust which penetrated to bones and marrow He had been too desperately taken by surprise had lost his nerve missed the right tone throughout Cool defiance free self justification might have carried him through Instead of which faugh All this was the phantom show of a few seconds thought He roused himself from a miserable reaction of mind and body to attend to Marcella s question Why did I do it he repeated why He broke off pressing both his hands upon his brow Then he suddenly sat up and pulled himself together Is that tea he said touching the tray Will you give me some Marcella went into the back kitchen and called Minta While the boiling water was brought and the tea was made Wharton sat forward with his face on his hands and saw nothing Marcella whispered a word in Minta s ear as she came in The woman paused looked at Wharton whom she had not recognised before in the dark grew pale and Marcella saw her hands shaking as she set the tray in order Wharton knew nothing and thought nothing of Kurd s widow but to Marcella the juxtaposition of the two figures brought a wave of complex emotion Wharton forced himself to eat and drink hardly speaking the while Then when the tremor of sheer exhaustion had to some extent abated he suddenly realised who this was that was sitting opposite to him ministering to him She felt his hand his quick powerful hand on hers To you I owe the whole truth let me tell it She drew herself away instinctively but so softly that he did not realise it He threw himself back once more in the chair beside her one knee over the other the curly head so much younger to night than the face beneath it supported on his arms his eyes closed again for rest and plunged into the story of the Clarion It was admirably told He had probably so rehearsed it to himself several times already He described his action as the result of a double influence working upon him the influence of his own debts and necessities and the influence of his growing conviction that the maintenance of the strike had become a blunder even a misfortune for the people themselves Then just as I was at my wit s end conscious besides that the paper was on a wrong line and must somehow be got out of it came the overtures from the Syndicate I knew perfectly well I ought to have refused them of course my whole career was risked by listening to them But at the same time they gave me assurances that the workpeople would ultimately gain they proved to me that I was helping to extinguish the trade As to the money when a great company has to be launched the people who help it into being get paid for it it is invariable it happens every day I like the system no more than you may do or Wilkins But consider I was in such straits that bankruptcy lay between me and my political future Moreover I had lost nerve sleep balance I was scarcely master of myself when Pearson first broached the matter to me Pearson cried Marcella involuntarily She recalled the figure of the solicitor had heard his name from Frank Leven She remembered Wharton s impatient words There is a tiresome man wants to speak to me on business It was then I that evening Something sickened her Wharton raised himself in his chair and looked at her attentively with his young haggard eyes In the faint lamplight she was a pale vision of the purest and noblest beauty But the lofty sadness of her face filled him with a kind of terror Desire impotent pain violent resolve swept across him He had come to her straight from the scene of his ruin as to the last bulwark left him against a world bent on his destruction and bare henceforward of all delights Well what have you to say to me he said suddenly in a low changed voice as I speak as I look at you I see in your face that you distrust that you have judged me those two men I suppose have done their work Yet from you you of all people I might look not only for justice but I will dare say it for kindness She trembled She understood that he appealed to the days at Mellor and her lips quivered No she exclaimed almost timidly I try to think the best I see the pressure was great And consider please he said proudly what the reasons were for that pressure She looked at him interrogatively a sudden softness in her eyes If at that moment he had confessed himself fully if he had thrown himself upon her in the frank truth of his mixed character and he could have done it with a Rousseau like completeness it is difficult to say what the result of this scene might have been In the midst of shock and repulsion she was filled with pity and there were moments when she was more drawn to his defeat and undoing than she had ever been to his success Yet how question him To do so would be to assume a right which in turn would imply his rights She thought of that mention of gambling debts then of his luxurious habits and extravagant friends But she was silent Only as she sat there opposite to him one slim hand propping the brow her look invited him He thought he saw his advantage You must remember he said with the same self assertive bearing that I have never been a rich man that my mother spent my father s savings on a score of public objects that she and I started a number of experiments on the estate that my expenses as a member of Parliament are very large and that I spent thousands on building up the Clarion I have been ruined by the Clarion by the cause the Clarion supported I got no help from my party where was it to come from They are all poor men I had to do everything myself and the struggle has been more than flesh and blood could bear This year often I have not known how to move to breathe for anxieties of every sort Then came the crisis my work my usefulness my career all threatened The men who hated me saw their opportunity I was a fool and gave it them And my enemies have used it to the bitter end Tone and gesture were equally insistent and strong What he was saying to himself was that with a woman of Marcella s type one must bear it out This moment of wreck was also with him the first moment of all absorbing and desperate desire To win her to wrest her from the Cravens influence that had been the cry in his mind throughout his dazed drive from the House of Commons Her hand in his her strength her beauty the romantic reputation that had begun to attach to her at his command and he would have taken the first step to recovery he would see his way to right himself Ah but he had missed his chance Somehow every word he had been saying rang false to her She could have thrown herself as a saving angel on the side of weakness and disaster which had spoken its proper language and with a reckless and confiding truth had appealed to the largeness of a woman s heart But this patriot ruined so nobly for such disinterested purposes left her cold She began to think even hating herself of the thousands he was supposed to have made in the gambling over that wretched company no doubt for the cause too But before she could say a word he was kneeling beside her Marcella I give me my answer I am in trouble and defeat be a woman and come to me He had her hands She tried to recover them No she said with passionate energy that is impossible I had written to you before you came before I had heard a word of this Please please let me go Not till you explain he said still holding her and roused to a white heat of emotion why is it impossible You said to me once with all your heart that you thanked me that I had taught you helped you You cannot ignore the bond between us And you are free I have a right to say to you you thirst to save to do good come and save a man that cries to you he confesses to you freely enough that he has made a hideous mistake help him to redeem it She rose suddenly with all her strength freeing herself from him so that he rose too and stood glowering and pale When I said that to you she cried I was betraying her voice failed her an instant we were both false to the obligation that should have held us restrained us No no I will never be your wife We should hurt each other poison each other Her eyes shone with wild tears As he stood there before her she was seized with a piteous sense of contrast of the irreparable of what might have been What do you mean he asked her roughly She was silent His passion rose Do you remember he said approaching her again that you have given me cause to hope It is those two fanatics that have changed you possessed your mind She looked at him with a pale dignity My letters must have warned you she said simply If you had come to morrow in prosperity you would have got the same answer at once To day now I have had weak moments because because I did not know how to add pain to pain But they are gone I see my way I do not love you that is the simple the whole truth I could not follow you He stared at her an instant in a bitter silence I have been warned he said slowly but in truth losing control of himself not only by you and I suppose I understand You repent last year Your own letter said as much You mean to recover the ground the place you lost Ah well most natural most fitting When the time comes and my bones are less sore I suppose I shall have my second congratulations ready Meanwhile She gave a low cry and burst suddenly into a passion of weeping turning her face from him But when in pale sudden shame he tried to excuse himself to appease her she moved away with a gesture that overawed him You have not confessed yourself she said and his look wavered under the significance of hers but you drive me to it Yes I repent her breast heaved she caught her breath I have been trying to cheat myself these last few weeks to run away from grief and the other night when you asked me I would have given all I have and am to feel like any happy girl who says Yes to her lover I tried to feel so But even then though I was miserable and reckless I knew in my heart it was impossible If you suppose if you like to suppose that I I have hopes or plans as mean as they would be silly you must of course But I have given no one any right to think so or say so mister Wharton Gathering all her self control she put out her white hand to him Please please say good bye to me It has been hideous vanity and mistake and wretchedness our knowing each other from the beginning I am grateful for all you did I shall always be grateful I hope oh I hope that that you will find a way through this trouble I don t want to make it worse by a word If I could do anything But I can t You must please go It is late I wish to call my friend missus Hurd Their eyes met hers full of a certain stern yet quivering power his strained and bloodshot in his lined young face Then with a violent gesture as though he swept her out of his path he caught up his hat went to the door and was gone She fell on her chair almost fainting and sat there for long in the summer dark covering her face But it was not his voice that haunted her ears You have done me wrong I pray God you may not do yourself a greater wrong in the future Again and again amid the whirl of memory she pressed the sad remembered words upon the inward wound and fever tasting cherishing the smart of them And as her trance of exhaustion and despair gradually left her it was as though she crept close to some dim beloved form in whom her heart knew henceforward the secret and sole companion of its inmost life BOOK IV You and I Why care by what meanders we are here I the centre of the labyrinth Men have died Trying to find this place which we have found CHAPTER I Ah how purely cleanly beautiful was the autumn sunrise After her long hardening to the stale noisomeness of London streets the taint of London air Marcella hung out of her window at Mellor in a thirsty delight drinking in the scent of dew and earth and trees watching the ways of the birds pouring forth a soul of yearning and of memory into the pearly silence of the morning High up on the distant hill to the left beyond the avenue the pale apricots and golds of the newly shorn stubbles caught the mounting light The beeches of the avenue were turning fast and the chestnuts girdling the church on her right hand were already thin enough to let the tower show through That was the bell the old bell given to the church by Hampden s friend John Boyce striking half past five and close upon it came the call of a pheasant in the avenue There he was fine fellow with his silly mincing run redeemed all at once by the sudden whirr of towering flight To day Mary Harden and the Rector would be at work in the church and to morrow was to be the Harvest Festival Was it two years or in an hour or two would she be going with her basket from the Cedar Garden to find that figure in the brown shooting coat standing with the Hardens on the altar steps Alas alas her head dropped on her hands as she knelt by the open window How changed were all the aspects of the world Three weeks before the bell in that little church had tolled for one who in the best way and temper of his own generation had been God s servant and man s friend who had been Marcella s friend and had even in his last days on a word from Edward Hallin sent her an old man s kindly farewell Tell her Lord Maxwell had written with his own hand to Hallin she has taken up a noble work and will make I pray God a noble woman She had I think a kindly liking for an old man and she will not disdain his blessing He had died at Geneva Aldous and Miss Raeburn with him For instead of coming home in August he had grown suddenly worse and Aldous had gone out to him They had brought him to the Court for burial and the new Lord Maxwell leaving his aunt at the Court had almost immediately returned to town because of Edward Hallin s state of health Marcella had seen much of Hallin since he and his sister had come back to London in the middle of August Hallin s apparent improvement had faded within a week or two of his return to his rooms Aldous was at Geneva Miss Hallin was in a panic of alarm and Marcella found herself both nurse and friend Day after day she would go in after her nursing rounds share their evening meal and either write for Hallin or help the sister by the slight extra weight of her professional voice to keep him from writing and thinking He would not himself admit that he was ill at all and his whole energies at the time were devoted to the preparation of a series of three addresses on the subject of Land Reform which were to be delivered in October to the delegates of a large number of working men s clubs from all parts of London So strong was Hallin s position among working men reformers and so beloved had been his personality that as soon as his position towards the new land nationalising movement now gathering formidable strength among the London working men had come to be widely understood a combined challenge had been sent him by some half dozen of the leading Socialist and Radical clubs asking him to give three weekly addresses in October to a congress of London delegates time to be allowed after the lecture for questions and debate Hallin had accepted the invitation with eagerness and was throwing an intensity of labour into the writing of his three lectures which often seemed to his poor sister to be not only utterly beyond his physical strength but to carry with it a note as of a last effort a farewell message such as her devoted affection could ill endure For all the time he was struggling with cardiac weakness and brain irritability which would have overwhelmed any one less accustomed to make his account with illness or to balance against feebleness of body a marvellous discipline of soul Lord Maxwell was still alive and Hallin in the midst of his work was looking anxiously for the daily reports from Aldous living in his friend s life almost as much as in his own handing on the reports too day by day to Marcella with a manner which had somehow slipped into expressing a new and sure confidence in her sympathy when she one evening found Minta Hurd watching for her at the door with a telegram from her mother Your father suddenly worse Please come at once She arrived at Mellor late that same night On the same day Lord Maxwell died Less than a week later he was buried in the little Gairsley church mister Boyce was then alarmingly ill and Marcella sat in his darkened room or in her own all day thinking from time to time of what was passing three miles away of the great house in its mourning of the figures round the grave Hallin of course would be there It was a dripping September day and she passed easily from moments of passionate yearning and clairvoyance to worry herself about the damp and the fatigue that Hallin must be facing Since then she had heard occasionally from Miss Hallin Everything was much as it had been apparently Edward was still hard at work still ill still serene Aldous Miss Hallin could not yet reconcile herself to the new name was alone in the Curzon Street house much occupied and harassed apparently by the legal business of the succession by the election presently to be held in his own constituency and by the winding up of his work at the Home Office He was to resign his under secretaryship but with the new session and a certain rearrangement of offices it was probable that he would be brought back into the Ministry Meanwhile he was constantly with them and she thought that his interest in Edward s work and anxiety about his health were perhaps both good for him as helping to throw off something of his own grief and depression Whereby it will be noticed that Miss Hallin like her brother had by now come to speak intimately and freely to Marcella of her old lover and their friend Now for some days however she had received no letter from either brother or sister and she was particularly anxious to hear For this was the fourth of October and on the second he was to have delivered the first of his addresses How had the frail prophet sped She had her fears For her weekly evenings in Brown s Buildings had shown her a good deal of the passionate strength of feeling developed during the past year in connection with this particular propaganda She doubted whether the London working man at the present moment was likely to give even Hallin a fair hearing on the point However Louis Craven was to be there And he had promised to write even if Susie Hallin could find no time Some report ought to reach Mellor by the evening Poor Cravens The young wife who was expecting a baby had behaved with great spirit through the Clarion trouble and selling their bits of furniture to pay their debts they had gone to lodge near Anthony Louis had got some odds and ends of designing and artistic work to do through his brother s influence and was writing where he could here and there Marcella had introduced them to the Hallins and Susie Hallin was taking a motherly interest in the coming child Anthony in his gloomy way was doing all he could for them But the struggle was likely to be a hard one and Marcella had recognised of late that in Louis as in Anthony there were dangerous possibilities of melancholy and eccentricity Her heart was often sore over their trouble and her own impotence Meantime for some wounds at any rate time had brought swift cautery Not three days after her final interview with Wharton while the catastrophe in the Labour party was still in every one s mouth and the air was full of bitter speeches and recriminations Hallin one evening laid down his newspaper with a sudden startled gesture and then pushed it over to Marcella There in the columns devoted to personal news of various sorts appeared the announcement A marriage has been arranged between mister H S Wharfon M P for West Brookshire and Lady Selina Farrell only surviving daughter of Lord Alresford The ceremony will probably take place somewhere about Easter next Meanwhile mister Wharton whose health has suffered of late from his exertions in and out of the House has been ordered to the East for rest by his medical advisers He and his friend Sir William Ffolliot start for French Cochin China in a few days Their object is to explore the famous ruined temples of Angkor in Cambodia and if the season is favourable they may attempt to ascend the Mekong mister Wharton is paired for the remainder of the session Did you know anything of this said Hallin with that careful carelessness in which people dress a dubious question Nothing she said quietly Then an impulse not to be stood against springing from very mingled depths of feeling drove her on She too put down the paper and laying her finger tips together on her knee she said with an odd slight laugh But I was the last person to know About a fortnight ago mister Wharton proposed to me Hallin sprang from his chair almost with a shout And you refused him She nodded and then was angrily aware that totally against her will or consent and for the most foolish and remote reasons those two eyes of hers had grown moist Hallin went straight over to her Do you mind letting me shake hands with you he said half ashamed of his outburst a dancing light of pleasure transforming the thin face There I am an idiot We won t say a word more except about Lady Selina Have you seen her Three or four times What is she like Marcella hesitated Is she fat and forty said Hallin fervently she beat him Not at all She is very thin thirty five elegant terribly of her own opinion and makes a great parade of papa She looked round at him unsteadily but gaily Oh I see said Hallin with disappointment she will only take care he doesn t beat her which I gather from your manner doesn t matter And her politics Lord Alresford was left out of the Ministry said Marcella slily He and Lady Selina thought it a pity Alresford Alresford Why of course He was Lord Privy Seal in their last Cabinet a narrow minded old stick did a heap of mischief in the Lords Well Hallin pondered a moment Wharton will go over Marcella was silent The tremor of that wrestler s hour had not yet passed away The girl could find no words in which to discuss Wharton himself this last amazing act or its future As for Hallin he sat lost in pleasant dreams of a whitewashed Wharton comfortably settled at last below the gangway on the Conservative side using all the old catch words in slightly different connections and living gaily on his Lady Selina Fragments from the talk of Nehemiah Nehemiah the happy and truculent that new scourge of God upon the parasites of Labour of poor Bennett of Molloy and of various others who had found time to drop in upon him since the Labour smash kept whirling in his mind The same prediction he had just made to Marcella was to be discerned in several of them He vowed to himself that he would write to Raeburn that night congratulate him and the party on the possibility of so eminent a recruit and hint another item of news by the way She had trusted her confidence to him without any pledge an act for which he paid her well thenceforward in the coin of a friendship far more intimate expansive and delightful than anything his sincerity had as yet allowed him to show her But these London incidents and memories near as they were in time looked many of them strangely remote to Marcella in this morning silence When she drew back from the window after darkening the now sun flooded room in a very thorough business like way in order that she might have four or five hours sleep there was something symbolic in the act She gave back her mind her self to the cares the anxieties the remorses of the past three weeks During the night she had been sitting up with her father that her mother might rest Now as she lay down she thought with the sore tension which had lately become habitual to her of her father s state her mother s strange personality her own short comings By the middle of the morning she was downstairs again vigorous and fresh as ever missus Boyce s maid was for the moment in charge of the patient who was doing well missus Boyce was writing some household notes in the drawing room Marcella went in search of her The bare room just as it ever was with its faded antique charm looked bright and tempting in the sun But the cheerfulness of it did but sharpen the impression of that thin form writing in the window missus Boyce looked years older The figure had shrunk and flattened into that of an old woman the hair which two years before had been still young and abundant was now easily concealed under the close white cap she had adopted very soon after her daughter had left Mellor The dress was still exquisitely neat but plainer and coarser Only the beautiful hands and the delicate stateliness of carriage remained sole relics of a loveliness which had cost its owner few pangs to part with Marcella hovered near her a little behind her looking at her from time to time with a yearning compunction which missus Boyce seemed to be aware of and to avoid Mamma can t I do those letters for you I am quite fresh No thank you They are just done When they were all finished and stamped missus Boyce made some careful entries in a very methodical account book and then got up locking the drawers of her little writing table behind her We can keep the London nurse another week I think she said There is no need said Marcella quickly Emma and I could divide the nights now and spare you altogether You see I can sleep at any time Your father seems to prefer Nurse Wenlock said missus Boyce Marcella took the little blow in silence No doubt it was her due During the past two years she had spent two separate months at Mellor she had gone away in opposition to her father s wish and had found herself on her return more of a stranger to her parents than ever mister Boyce s illness involving a steady extension of paralytic weakness with occasional acute fits of pain and danger had made steady though very gradual progress all the time But it was not till some days after her return home that Marcella had realised a tenth part of what her mother had undergone since the disastrous spring of the murder She passed now from the subject of the nurse with a half timid remark about expense Oh the expense doesn t matter said missus Boyce as she stood absently before the lately kindled fire warming her chilled fingers at the blaze Papa is more at ease in those ways Marcella ventured And kneeling down beside her mother she gently chafed one of the cold hands There seems to be enough for what is wanted said missus Boyce bearing the charing with patience Your father I believe has made great progress this year in freeing the estate Thank you my dear I am not cold now And she gently withdrew her hand Marcella indeed had already noticed that there were now no weeds on the garden paths that instead of one gardener there were three that the old library had been decently patched and restored that there was another servant that William grown into a very tolerable footman wore a reputable coat and that a plain but adequate carriage and horse had met her at the station Her pity even understood that part of her father s bitter resentment of his ever advancing disablement came from his feeling that here at last just as death was in sight he that squalid failure Dick Boyce was making a success of something Presently as she knelt before the fire a question escaped her which when it was spoken she half regretted Has papa been able to do anything for the cottages yet I don t think so said missus Boyce calmly After a minute s pause she added That will be for your reign my dear Marcella looked up with a sharp thrill of pain Papa is better mamma and and I don t know what you mean I shall never reign here without you missus Boyce began to fidget with the rings on her thin left hand When Mellor ceases to be your father s it will be yours she said not without a certain sharp decision that was settled long ago I must be free and if you are to do anything with this place you must give your youth and strength to it And your father is not better except for the moment doctor Clarke exactly foretold the course of his illness to me two years ago on my urgent request He may live four months six if we can get him to the South More is impossible There was something ghastly in her dry composure Marcella caught her hand again and leant her trembling young cheek against it I could not live here without you mamma missus Boyce could not for once repress the inner fever which in general her will controlled so well I hardly think it would matter to you so much my dear Marcella shrank I don t wonder you say that she said in a low voice Do you think it was all a mistake mamma my going away eighteen months ago a wrong act missus Boyce grew restless I judge nobody my dear unless I am obliged As you know I am for liberty above all she spoke with emphasis for letting the past alone But I imagine you must certainly have learnt to do without us Now I ought to go to your father But Marcella held her Do you remember in the Purgatorio mamma the lines about the loser in the game When the game of dice breaks up he who lost lingers sorrowfully behind going over the throws and learning by his grief Do you remember missus Boyce looked down upon her involuntarily a little curious a little nervous but assenting It was one of the inconsistencies of her strange character that she had all her life been a persistent Dante student The taste for the most strenuous and passionate of poets had developed in her happy youth it had survived through the loneliness of her middle life Like everything else personal to herself she never spoke of it but the little worn books on her table had been familiar to Marcella from a child E tristo impara repeated Marcella her voice wavering Mamma she laid her face against her mother s dress again I have lost more throws than you think in the last two years Won t you believe I may have learnt a little She raised her eyes to her mother s pinched and mask like face missus Boyce s lips moved as though she would have asked a question But she did not ask it She drew instead the stealthy breath Marcella knew well the breath of one who has measured precisely her own powers of endurance and will not risk them for a moment by any digression into alien fields of emotion Well but one expects persons like you to learn she said with a light cold manner which made the words mere convention There was silence an instant then probably to release herself her hand just touched her daughter s hair Now will you come up in half an hour That was twelve striking and Emma is never quite punctual with his food Marcella went to her father at the hour named She found him in his wheeled chair beside a window opened to the sun and overlooking the Cedar Garden The room in which he sat was the state bedroom of the old house It had a marvellous paper of branching trees and parrots and red robed Chinamen in the taste of the morning room downstairs a carved four post bed a grate adorned with purplish Dutch tiles an array of family miniatures over the mantelpiece and on a neighbouring wall a rack of old swords and rapiers The needlework hangings of the bed were full of holes the seats of the Chippendale chairs were frayed or tattered But none the less the inalienable character and dignity of his sleeping room were a bitter satisfaction to Richard Boyce even in his sickness After all said and done he was king here in his father s and grandfather s place ruling where they ruled and whether they would or no dying where they died with the same family faces to bear him witness from the walls and the same vault awaiting him When his daughter entered he turned his head and his eyes deep and black still as ever but sunk in a yellow relic of a face showed a certain agitation She was disagreeably aware that his thoughts were much occupied with her that he was full of grievance towards her and would probably before long bring the pathos of his situation as well as the weight of his dying authority to bear upon her for purposes she already suspected with alarm Are you a little easier papa she said as she came up to him I should think as a nurse you ought to know better my dear than to ask he said testily When a person is in my condition enquiries of that sort are a mockery But one may be in less or more pain she said gently I hoped doctor Clarke s treatment yesterday might have given you some relief He did not vouchsafe an answer She took some work and sat down by him missus Boyce who had been tidying a table of food and medicine came and asked him if he would be wheeled into another room across the gallery which had been arranged as a sitting room He shook his head irritably I am not fit for it Can t you see And I want to speak to Marcella missus Boyce went away Marcella waited not without a tremor She was sitting in the sun her head bent over the muslin strings she was hemming for her nurse s bonnet The window was wide open outside the leaves under a warm breeze were gently drifting down into the Cedar Garden amid a tangled mass of flowers mostly yellow or purple To one side rose the dark layers of the cedars to the other the grey front of the library wing mister Boyce looked at her with the frown which had now become habitual to him moved his lips once or twice without speaking and at last made his effort I should think Marcella you must often regret by now the step you took eighteen months ago She grew pale How regret it papa she said without looking up Why good God he said angrily I should think the reasons for regret are plain enough You threw over a man who was devoted to you and could have given you the finest position in the county for the most nonsensical reasons in the world reasons that by now I am certain you are ashamed of He saw her wince and enjoyed his prerogative of weakness In his normal health he would never have dared so to speak to her But of late during long fits of feverish brooding intensified by her return home he had vowed to himself to speak his mind Aren t you ashamed of them he repeated as she was silent She looked up I am not ashamed of anything I did to save Hurd if that is what you mean papa mister Boyce s anger grew Of course you know what everybody said She stooped over her work again and did not reply It s no good being sullen over it he said in exasperation I m your father and I m dying I have a right to question you It s my duty to see something settled if I can before I go Is it true that all the time you were attacking Raeburn about politics and the reprieve and what not you were really behaving as you never ought to have behaved with Harry Wharton He gave out the words with sharp emphasis and bending towards her he laid an emaciated hand upon her arm What use is there papa in going back to these things she said driven to bay her colour going and coming I may have been wrong in a hundred ways but you never understood that the real reason for it all was that that I never was in love with mister Raeburn Then why did you accept him He fell back against his pillows with a jerk As to that I will confess my sins readily enough she said while her lip trembled and he saw the tears spring into her eyes I accepted him for what you just now called his position in the county though not quite in that way either He was silent a little then he began again in a voice which gradually became unsteady from self pity Well now look here I have been thinking about this matter a great deal and God knows I ve time to think and cause to think considering the state I m in and I see no reason whatever why I should not try before I die to put this thing straight That man was head over ears in love with you madly in love with you I used to watch him and I know Of course you offended and distressed him greatly He could never have expected such conduct from you or any one else But he s not the man to change round easily or to take up with any one else Now if you regret what you did or the way in which you did it why shouldn t I a dying man may be allowed a little licence I should think give him a hint Papa cried Marcella dropping her work and looking at him with a pale indignant passion which a year ago would have quelled him utterly But he held up his hand Now just let me finish It would be no good my doing a thing of this kind without saying something to you first because you d find it out and your pride would be the ruin of it You always had a demoniacal pride Marcella even when you were a tiny child but if you make up your mind now to let me tell him you regret what you did just that you ll make him happy and yourself for you know very well he s a man of the highest character and your poor father who never did you much harm anyway His voice faltered I d manage it so that there should be nothing humiliating to you in it whatever As if there could be anything humiliating in confessing such a mistake as that besides what is there to be ashamed of You re no pauper I ve pulled Mellor out of the mud for you though you and your mother do give me credit for so precious little He lay back trembling with fatigue yet still staring at her with glittering eyes while his hand on the invalid table fixed to the side of his chair shook piteously Marcella dreaded the effect the whole scene might have upon him but now they were in the midst of it both feeling for herself and prudence for him drove her into the strongest speech she could devise Papa if anything of that sort were done I should take care mister Raeburn knew I had had nothing to do with it in such a way that it would be impossible for him to carry it further Dear papa don t think of such a thing any more Because I treated mister Raeburn unjustly last year are we now to harass and persecute him I would sooner disappear from everybody I know from you and mamma from England and never be heard of again She stopped a moment struggling for composure that she might not excite him too much Besides it would be absurd You forget I have seen a good deal of mister Raeburn lately while I have been with the Winterbournes He has entirely given up all thought of me Even my vanity could see that plainly enough His best friends expect him to marry a bright fascinating little creature of whom I saw a good deal in James Street a Miss Macdonald Miss how much he asked roughly She repeated the name and then dwelt with a certain amount of confusion and repetition upon the probabilities of the matter half conscious all the time that she was playing a part persuading herself and him of something she was not at all clear about in her own inner mind but miserably passionately determined to go through with it all the same He bore with what she said to him half disappointed and depressed yet also half incredulous He had always been obstinate and the approach of death had emphasised his few salient qualities as decay had emphasised the bodily frame He said to himself stubbornly that he would find some way yet of testing the matter in spite of her He would think it out Meanwhile step by step she brought the conversation to less dangerous things and she was finally gliding into some chat about the Winterbournes when he interrupted her abruptly And that other fellow Wharton Your mother tells me you have seen him in London Has he been making love to you Suppose I won t be catechised she said gaily determined to allow no more tragedy of any kind Besides papa you can t read your gossip as good people should mister Wharton s engagement to a certain Lady Selina Farrell a distant cousin of the Winterbournes was announced in several papers with great plainness three weeks ago At that moment her mother came in looking anxiously at them both and half resentfully at Marcella Marcella sore and bruised in every moral fibre got up to go Something in the involuntary droop of her beautiful head as she left the room drew her father s eyes after her and for the time his feeling towards her softened curiously Well she had not made very much of her life so far That old strange jealousy of her ability her beauty and her social place he had once felt so hotly died away He wished her indeed to be Lady Maxwell Yet for the moment there was a certain balm in the idea that she too her mother s daughter with her Merritt blood could be unlucky Marcella went about all day under a vague sense of impending trouble the result no doubt of that intolerable threat of her father s against which she was after all so defenceless But whatever it was it made her all the more nervous and sensitive about the Hallins about her one true friend to whom she was slowly revealing herself even without speech whose spiritual strength had been guiding and training her whose physical weakness had drawn to him the maternal the spending instincts which her nursing life had so richly developed She strolled down the drive to meet the post But there were no letters from London and she came in inclined to be angry indeed with Louis Craven for deserting her but saying to herself at the same time that she must have heard if anything had gone wrong An hour or so later just as the October evening was closing in she was sitting dreaming over a dim wood fire in the drawing room Her father as might have been expected had been very tired and comatose all day Her mother was with him the London nurse was to sit up and Marcella felt herself forlorn and superfluous Suddenly in the silence of the house she heard the front door bell ring There was a step in the hall she sprang up the door opened and William with fluttered emphasis announced Lord Maxwell In the dusk she could just see his tall form the short pause as he perceived her then her hand was in his and the paralysing astonishment of that first instant had disappeared under the grave emotion of his look Will you excuse me he said for coming at this hour But I am afraid you have heard nothing yet of our bad news and Hallin himself was anxious I should come and tell you Miss Hallin could not write and mister Craven I was to tell you had been ill for a week with a chill You haven t then seen any account of the lecture in the papers No I have looked yesterday and to day in our paper but there was nothing Some of the Radical papers reported it I hoped you might have seen it But when we got down here this afternoon and there was nothing from you both Miss Hallin and Edward felt sure you had not heard and I walked over It was a most painful distressing scene and he is very ill But you have brought him to the Court she said trembling lost in the thought of Hallin her quick breath coming and going He was able to bear the journey Will you tell me will you sit down He thanked her hurriedly and took a seat opposite to her within the circle of the firelight so that she saw his deep mourning and the look of repressed suffering The whole thing was extraordinary I can hardly now describe it he said holding his hat in his hands and staring into the fire It began excellently There was a very full room Bennett was in the chair and Edward seemed much as usual He had been looking desperately ill but he declared that he was sleeping better and that his sister and I coddled him Then directly he was well started I felt somehow that the audience was very hostile And he evidently felt it more and more There was a good deal of interruption and hardly any cheers and I saw after a little I was sitting not far behind him that he was discouraged that he had lost touch It was presently clear indeed that the real interest of the meeting lay not in the least in what he had to say but in the debate that was to follow They meant to let him have his hour but not a minute more I watched the men about me and I could see them following the clock thirsting for their turn Nothing that he said seemed to penetrate them in the smallest degree He was there merely as a ninepin to be knocked over I never saw a meeting so possessed with a madness of fanatical conviction it was amazing He paused looking sadly before him She made a little movement and he roused himself instantly It was just a few minutes before he was to sit down I was thankful when suddenly I heard his voice change I do not know now what happened but I believe he completely lost consciousness of the scene before him the sense of strain of exhaustion of making no way must have snapped something He began a sort of confession a reverie in public about himself his life his thoughts his prayers his hopes mostly his religious hopes for the working man for England I never heard anything of the kind from him before you know his reserve It was so intimate so painful oh so painful he drew himself together with an involuntary shudder before this crowd this eager hostile crowd which was only pining for him to sit down to get out of their way The men near me began to look at each other and titter They wondered what he meant by maundering on like that damned canting stuff I heard one man near me call it I tore off a bit of paper and passed a line to Bennett asking him to get hold of Edward to stop it But I think Bennett had rather lost his presence of mind and I saw him look back at me and shake his head Then time was up and they began to shout him down Marcella made an exclamation of horror He turned to her I think it was the most tragic scene I ever saw he said with a feeling as simple as it was intense This crowd so angry and excited without a particle of understanding or sympathy laughing and shouting at him and he in the midst white as death talking this strange nonsense his voice floating in a high key quite unlike itself At last just as I was getting up to go to him I saw Bennett rise But we were both too late He fell at our feet Marcella gave an involuntary sob What a horror she said what a martyrdom It was just that he answered in a low voice It was a martyrdom And when one thinks of the way in which for years past he has held these big meetings in the hollow of his hand and now because he crosses their passion their whim no kindness no patience nothing but a blind hostile fury Yet they thought him a traitor no doubt Oh it was all a tragedy There was silence an instant Then he resumed We got him into the back room Luckily there was a doctor on the platform It was heart failure of course with brain prostration We managed to get him home and Susie Hallin and I sat up He was delirious all night but yesterday he rallied and last night he begged us to move him out of London if we could So we got two doctors and an invalid carriage and by three this afternoon we were all at the Court My aunt was ready for him his sister is there and a nurse Clarke was there to meet him He thinks he cannot possibly live more than a few weeks possibly even a few days The shock and strain have been irreparable Marcella lay back in her chair struggling with her grief her head and face turned away from him her eyes hidden by her handkerchief Then in some mysterious way she was suddenly conscious that Aldous was no longer thinking of Hallin but of her He wants very much to see you he said bending towards her but I know that you have yourself serious illness to nurse Forgive me for not having enquired after mister Boyce I trust he is better She sat up red eyed but mistress of herself The tone had been all gentleness but to her quivering sense some slight indefinable change coldness had passed into it He is better thank you for the present And my mother does not let me do very much We have a nurse too When shall I come He rose Could you come to morrow afternoon There is to be a consultation of doctors in the morning which will tire him About six that was what he said He is very weak but in the day quite conscious and rational My aunt begged me to say how glad she would be He paused An invincible awkwardness took possession of both of them She longed to speak to him of his grandfather but could not find the courage When he was gone she standing alone in the firelight gave one passionate thought to the fact that so in this tragic way they had met again in this room where he had spoken to her his last words as a lover and then steadily she put everything out of her mind but her friend and death CHAPTER II missus Boyce received Marcella s news with more sympathy than her daughter had dared to hope for and she made no remark upon Aldous himself and his visit for which Marcella was grateful to her As they left the dining room after their short evening meal to go up to mister Boyce Marcella detained her mother an instant Mamma will you please not tell papa that that Lord Maxwell came here this afternoon And will you explain to him why I am going there to morrow missus Boyce s fair cheek flushed Marcella saw that she understood If I were you I should not let your father talk to you any more about those things she said with a certain proud impatience If I can help it exclaimed Marcella Will you tell him mamma about mister Hallin and how good he has been to me Then her voice failed her and hurriedly leaving her mother at the top of the stairs she went away by herself to struggle with a grief and smart almost unbearable That night passed quietly at the Court Hallin was at intervals slightly delirious but less so than the night before and in the early morning the young doctor who had sat up with him reported him to Aldous as calmer and a little stronger But the heart mischief was hopeless and might bring the bruised life to an end at any moment He could not however be kept in bed owing to restlessness and difficulty of breathing and by midday he was in Aldous s sitting room drawn close to the window that he might delight his eyes with the wide range of wood and plain that it commanded After a very wet September the October days were now following each other in a settled and sunny peace The great woods of the Chilterns just yellowing towards that full golden moment short like all perfection which only beeches know rolled down the hill slopes to the plain their curving lines cut here and there by straight fir stems drawn clear and dark on the pale background of sky and lowland In the park immediately below the window groups of wild cherry and of a slender leaved maple made spots of flame and amethyst on the smooth falling lawns the deer wandered and fed and the squirrels were playing and feasting among the beech nuts Since Aldous and his poor sister had brought him home from the Bethnal Green hall in which the Land Reform Conference had been held Hallin had spoken little except in delirium and that little had been marked by deep and painful depression But this morning when Aldous was summoned by the nurse and found him propped up by the window in front of the great view he saw gracious signs of change Death indeed already in possession looked from the blue eyes so plainly that Aldous on his first entrance had need of all his own strength of will to keep his composure But with the certainty of that great release and with the abandonment of all physical and mental struggle the struggle of a lifetime Hallin seemed to day to have recovered something of his characteristic serenity and blitheness the temper which had made him the leader of his Oxford contemporaries and the dear comrade of his friend s life When Aldous came in Hallin smiled and lifted a feeble hand towards the park and the woods Could it have greeted me more kindly he said in his whispering voice for the end Aldous sat down beside him pressing his hand and there was silence till Hallin spoke again You will keep this sitting room Aldous Always I am glad I have known you in it so long What good talks we have had here in the old hot days I was hot at least and you bore with me Land Reform Church Reform Wages Reform we have threshed them all out in this room Do you remember that night I kept you up till it was too late to go to bed talking over my Church plans How full I was of it the Church that was to be the people reflecting their life their differences governed by them growing with them You wouldn t join it Aldous our poor little Association Aldous s strong lip quivered Let me think of something I did join in he said Hallin s look shone on him with a wonderful affection Was there anything else you didn t help in I don t remember it I ve dragged you into most things You never minded failure And I have not had so much of it not till this last This has been failure absolute and complete But there was no darkening of expression He sat quietly smiling Do you suppose anybody who could look beyond the moment would dream of calling it failure said Aldous with difficulty Hallin shook his head gently and was silent for a little time gathering strength and breath again I ought to suffer he said presently Last week I dreaded my own feeling if I should fail or break down more than the failure itself But since yesterday last night I have no more regrets I see that my power is gone that if I were to live I could no longer carry on the battle or my old life I am out of touch Those whom I love and would serve put me aside Those who invite me I do not care to join So I drop into the gulf and the pageant rushes on But the curious thing is now I have no suffering And as to the future do you remember Jowett in the Introduction to the Phaedo He feebly pointed to a book beside him which Aldous took up Hallin guided him and he read Most persons when the last hour comes are resigned to the order of nature and the will of God They are not thinking of Dante s Inferno or Paradiso or of the Pilgrim s Progress Heaven and Hell are not realities to them but words or ideas the outward symbols of some great mystery they hardly know what It is so with me said Hallin smiling as at his gesture Aldous laid the book aside yet not quite To my mind that mystery indeed is all unknown and dark but to the heart it seems unveiled with the heart I see A little later Aldous was startled to hear him say very clearly and quickly Do you remember that this is the fifth of October Aldous drew his chair closer that he might not raise his voice Yes Ned Two years wasn t it to day Will you forgive me if I speak of her You shall say anything you will Did you notice that piece of news I sent you in my last letter to Geneva But of course you did Did it please you Yes I was glad of it said Aldous after a pause extremely glad I thought she had escaped a great danger Hallin studied his face closely She is free Aldous and she is a noble creature she has learnt from life and from death this last two years And you still love her Is it right to make no more effort Aldous saw the perspiration standing on the wasted brow would have given the world to be able to content or cheer him yet would not for the world at such a moment be false to his own feeling or deceive his questioner I think it is right he said deliberately for a good many reasons Edward In the first place I have not the smallest cause not the fraction of a cause to suppose that I could occupy with her now any other ground than that I occupied two years ago She has been kind and friendly to me on the whole since we met in London She has even expressed regret for last year meaning of course as I understood for the pain and trouble that may be said to have come from her not knowing her own mind She wished that we should be friends And he turned his head away no doubt I could be in time But you see in all that there is nothing whatever to bring me forward again My fatal mistake last year I think now lay in my accepting what she gave me accepting it so readily so graspingly even That was my fault my blindness and it was as unjust to her as it was hopeless for myself For hers is a nature his eyes came back to his friend his voice took a new force and energy which in love at any rate will give all or nothing and will never be happy itself or bring happiness till it gives all That is what last year taught me So that even if she out of kindness or remorse for giving pain were willing to renew the old tie I should be her worst enemy and my own if I took a single step towards it Marriage on such terms as I was thankful for last year would be humiliation to me and bring no gain to her It will never serve a man with her his voice broke into emotion that he should make no claims Let him claim the uttermost far thing her whole self If she gives it then he may know what love means Hallin had listened intently At Aldous s last words his expression showed pain and perplexity His mind was full of vague impressions memories which seemed to argue with and dispute one of the chief things Aldous had been saying But they were not definite enough to be put forward His sensitive chivalrous sense even in this extreme weakness remembered the tragic weight that attaches inevitably to dying words Let him not do more harm than good He rested a little They brought him food and Aldous sat beside him making pretence to read so that he might be encouraged to rest His sister came and went so did the doctor But when they were once more alone Hallin put out his hand and touched his companion What is it dear Ned Only one thing more before we leave it Is that all that stands between you now the whole You spoke to me once in the summer of feeling angry more angry than you could have believed Of course I felt the same But just now you spoke of its all being your fault Is there anything changed in your mind Aldous hesitated It was extraordinarily painful to him to speak of the past and it troubled him that at such a moment it should trouble Hallin There is nothing changed Ned except that perhaps time makes some difference always I don t want now he tried to smile as I did then to make anybody else suffer for my suffering But perhaps I marvel even more than I did at first that that she could have allowed some things to happen as she did The tone was firm and vibrating and in speaking the whole face had developed a strong animation most passionate and human Hallin sighed I often think he said that she was extraordinarily immature much more immature than most girls of that age as to feeling It was really the brain that was alive Aldous silently assented so much so that Hallin repented himself But not now he said in his eager dying whisper not now The plant is growing full and tall into the richest life Aldous took the wasted hand tenderly in his own There was something inexpressibly touching in this last wrestle of Hallin s affection with another s grief But it filled Aldous with a kind of remorse and with the longing to free him from that as from every other burden in these last precious hours of life And at last he succeeded as he thought in drawing his mind away from it They passed to other things Hallin indeed talked very little more during the day He was very restless and weak but not in much positive suffering Aldous read to him at intervals from Isaiah or Plato the bright sleepless eyes following every word At last the light began to sink The sunset flooded in from the Berkshire uplands and the far Oxford plain and lay in gold and purple on the falling woods and the green stretches of the park The distant edges of hill were extraordinarily luminous and clear and Aldous looking into the west with the eye of one to whom every spot and line were familiar landmarks could almost fancy he saw beyond the invisible river the hill the lovely tree against the western sky which keep for ever the memory of one with whose destiny it had often seemed to him that Hallin s had something in common To him as to Thyrsis the same early joy the same happy quest the same fugitive and gracious light for guide and beacon that does not come with houses or with gold With place with honour and a flattering crew and to him too the same tasked pipe and tired throat the same struggle with the life of men unblest the same impatient tryst with death The lovely lines ran dirge like in his head as he sat sunk in grief beside his friend Hallin did not speak but his eye took note of every change of light of every darkening tone as the quiet English scene with its villages churches and woods withdrew itself plane by plane into the evening haze His soul followed the quiet deer the homing birds loosening itself gently the while from pain and from desire saying farewell to country to the poor to the work left undone and the hopes unrealised to everything except to love It had just struck six when he bent forward to the window beneath which ran the wide front terrace That was her step he said while his face lit up will you bring her here Marcella rang the bell at the Court with a fast beating heart The old butler who came gave what her shrinking sense thought a forbidding answer to her shy greeting of him and led her first into the drawing room A small figure in deep black rose from a distant chair and came forward stiffly Marcella found herself shaking hands with Miss Raeburn Will you sit and rest a little before you go upstairs said that lady with careful politeness or shall I send word at once He is hardly worse but as ill as he can be I am not the least tired said Marcella and Miss Raeburn rang Tell his lordship please that Miss Boyce is here The title jarred and hurt Marcella s ear But she had scarcely time to catch it before Aldous entered a little bent as it seemed to her from his tall erectness and speaking with an extreme quietness even monotony of manner He is waiting for you will you come at once He led her up the central staircase and along the familiar passages walking silently a little in front of her They passed the long line of Caroline and Jacobean portraits in the upper gallery till just outside his own door Aldous paused He ought not to talk long he said hesitating but you will know of course better than any of us I will watch him she said almost inaudibly and he gently opened the door and let her pass shutting it behind her The nurse who was sitting beside her patient got up as Marcella entered and pointed her to a low chair on his further side Susie Hallin rose too and kissed the new comer hurriedly absently without a word lest she should sob Then she and the nurse disappeared through an inner door The evening light was still freely admitted and there were some candles By the help of both she could only see him indistinctly But in her own mind as she sat down she determined that he had not even days to live Yet as she bent over him she saw a playful gleam on the cavernous face You won t scold me said the changed voice you did warn me you and Susie but I was obstinate It was best so She pressed her lips to his hand and was answered by a faint pressure from the cold fingers If I could have been there she murmured No I am thankful you were not And I must not think of it or of any trouble Aldous is very bitter but he will take comfort by and by he will see it and them more justly They meant me no unkindness They were full of an idea as I was When I came back to myself first all was despair I was in a blank horror of myself and life Now it has gone I don t know how It is not of my own will some hand has lifted a weight I seem to float without pain He closed his eyes gathering strength again in the interval by a strong effort of will calling up in the dimming brain what he had to say She meanwhile spoke to him in a low voice mainly to prevent his talking telling him of her father of her mother s strain of nursing of herself she hardly knew what Hew grotesque to be giving him these little bits of news about strangers to him this hovering consecrated soul on the brink of the great secret In the intervals while he was still silent she could not sometimes prevent the pulse of her own life from stirring Her eye wandered round the room Aldous s familiar room There on the writing table with its load of letters and books stood the photograph of Hallin another her own used to stand beside it it was solitary now Otherwise all was just as it had been flowers books newspapers the signs of familiar occupation the hundred small details of character and personality which in estrangement take to themselves such a smarting significance for the sad and craving heart The date the anniversary echoed in her mind Then with a rush of remorseful pain her thoughts came back to the present and to Hallin At the same moment she saw that his eyes were open and fixed upon her with a certain anxiety and expectancy He made a movement as though to draw her towards him and she stooped to him I feel he said as though my strength were leaving me fast Let me ask you one question because of my love for you and him I have fancied of late things were changed Can you tell me will you or is it unfair the words had all their bright natural intonation Is your heart still where it was or could you ever undo the past He held her fast grasping the hand she had given him with unconscious force She had looked up startled her lip trembling like a child s Then she dropped her head against the arm of her chair as though she could not speak He moved restlessly and sighed I should not he said to himself I should not it was wrong The dying are tyrannous He even began a word of sweet apology But she shook her head Don t she said struggling with herself don t say that It would do me good to speak to you An exquisite smile dawned on Hallin s face Then he said confess A few minutes later they were still sitting together She strongly wished to go but he would not yet allow it His face was full of a mystical joy a living faith which must somehow communicate itself in one last sacramental effort How strange that you and I and he should have been so mixed together in this queer life Now I seem to regret nothing I hope everything One more little testimony let me bear the last We disappear one by one into the dark but each may throw his comrades a token before he goes You have been in much trouble of mind and spirit I have seen it Take my poor witness There is one clue one only goodness the surrendered will Everything is there all faith all religion all hope for rich or poor Whether we feel our way through consciously to the Will that asks our will matters little Aldous and I have differed much on this in words never at heart I could use words symbols he cannot and they have given me peace But half my best life I owe to him At this he made a long pause but still through that weak grasp refusing to let her go till all was said Day was almost gone the stars had come out over the purple dusk of the park That Will we reach through duty and pain he whispered at last so faintly she could hardly hear him is the root the source It leads us in living it carries us in death But our weakness and vagueness want help want the human life and voice to lean on to drink from We Christians are orphans without Christ There again what does it matter what we think about him if only we think of him In one such life are all mysteries and all knowledge and our fathers have chosen for us The insistent voice sank lower and lower into final silence though the lips still moved The eyelids too fell Miss Hallin and the nurse came in Marcella rose and stood for one passionate instant looking down upon him Then with a pressure of the hand to the sister beside her she stole out Her one prayer was that she might see and meet no one So soft was her step that even the watching Aldous did not hear her She lifted the heavy latch of the outer door without the smallest noise and found herself alone in the starlight After Marcella left him Hallin remained for some hours in what seemed to those about him a feverish trance He did not sleep but he showed no sign of responsive consciousness In reality his mind all through was full of the most vivid though incoherent images and sensations But he could no longer distinguish between them and the figures and movements of the real people in his room Each passed into and intermingled with the other In some vague eager way he seemed all the time to be waiting or seeking for Aldous There was the haunting impression of some word to say some final thing to do which would not let him rest But something seemed always to imprison him to hold him back and the veil between him and the real Aldous watching beside him grew ever denser At night they made no effort to move him from the couch and the half sitting posture in which he had passed the day Death had come too near His sister and Aldous and the young doctor who had brought him from London watched with him The curtains were drawn back from both the windows and in the clearness of the first autumnal frost a crescent moon hung above the woods the silvery lawns the plain Not long after midnight Hallin seemed to himself to wake full of purpose and of strength He spoke as he thought to Aldous asking to be alone with him But Aldous did not move that sad watching gaze of his showed no change Then Hallin suffered a sudden sharp spasm of anguish and of struggle Three words to say only three words but those he must say He tried again but Aldous s dumb grief still sat motionless Then the thought leapt in the ebbing sense Speech is gone I shall speak no more It brought with it a stab a quick revolt But something checked both and in a final offering of the soul Hallin gave up his last desire What Aldous saw was only that the dying man opened his hand as though it asked for that of his friend He placed his own within those seeking fingers and Hallin s latest movement which death stopped half way was to raise it to his lips So Marcella s confession made in the abandonment the blind passionate trust of a supreme moment bore no fruit It went with Hallin to the grave CHAPTER III I think I saw the letters arrive said missus Boyce to her daughter And Donna Margherita seems to be signalling to us Let me go for them mamma No thank you I must go in And missus Boyce rose from her seat and went slowly towards the hotel Marcella watched her widow s cap and black dress as they passed along the pergola of the hotel garden between bright masses of geraniums and roses on either side They had been sitting in the famous garden of the Cappucini Hotel at Amalfi To Marcella s left far below the high terrace of the hotel the green and azure of the Salernian gulf shone and danced in the sun to her right a wood of oak and arbutus stretched up into a purple cliff a wood starred above with gold and scarlet berries and below with cyclamen and narcissus From the earth under the leafy oaks for the oaks at Amalfi lose and regain their foliage in winter and spring by imperceptible gradations came a moist English smell The air was damp and warm A convent bell tolled from invisible heights above the garden while the olives and vines close at hand were full of the chattering voices of gardeners and children and broken here and there by clouds of pink almond blossom March had just begun and the afternoons were fast lengthening It was little more than a fortnight since mister Boyce s death In the November of the preceding year missus Boyce and Marcella had brought him to Naples by sea and there at a little villa on Posilippo he had drawn sadly to his end It had been a dreary time from which Marcella could hardly hope that her mother would ever fully recover She herself had found in the long months of nursing nursing of which with quiet tenacity she had gradually claimed and obtained her full share a deep moral consolation They had paid certain debts to conscience and they had for ever enshrined her father s memory in the silence of an unmeasured and loving pity But the wife Marcella sorely recognised that to her mother these last days had brought none of the soothing reconciling influences they had involved for herself Between the husband and wife there had been dumb friction and misery surely also a passionate affection to the end The invalid s dependence on her had been abject her devotion wonderful Yet in her close contact with them the daughter had never been able to ignore the existence between them of a wretched though tacit debate reproach on his side self defence or spasmodic effort on hers which seemed to have its origin deep in the past yet to be stimulated afresh by a hundred passing incidents of the present Under the blight of it as under the physical strain of nursing missus Boyce had worn and dwindled to a white haired shadow while he had both clung to life and feared death more than would normally have been the case At the end he had died in her arms his head on her breast she had closed his eyes and performed every last office without a tear nor had Marcella ever seen her weep from then till now The letters she had received mostly Marcella believed from her own family remained unopened in her travelling bag She spoke very little and was constantly restless nor could Marcella as yet form any idea of the future After the funeral at Naples missus Boyce had written immediately to her husband s solicitor for a copy of his will and a statement of affairs She had then allowed herself to be carried off to Amalfi and had there while entirely declining to admit that she was ill been clearly doing her best to recover health and nerve sufficient to come to some decision to grapple with some crisis which Marcella also felt to be impending though as to why it should be impending or what the nature of it might be she could only dread and guess There was much bitter yearning in the girl s heart as she sat breathed on by the soft Italian wind blowing from this enchanted sea The inner cry was that her mother did not love her had never loved her and might even now weird incredible thought be planning to desert her Hallin was dead who else was there that cared for her or thought of her Betty Macdonald wrote often wild schwaermerisch letters Marcella looked for them with eagerness and answered them affectionately But Betty must soon marry and then all that would be at an end Meanwhile Marcella knew well it was Betty s news that made Betty s adoration doubly welcome Aldous Raeburn she never did or could think of him under his new name was apparently in London much occupied in politics and constantly as it seemed in Betty s society What likelihood was there that her life and his would ever touch again She thought often of her confession to Hallin but in great perplexity of feeling She had of course said no word of secrecy to him at the time Such a demand in a man s last hour would have been impossible She had simply followed a certain mystical love and obedience in telling him what he asked to know and in the strong spontaneous impulse had thought of nothing beyond Afterwards her pride had suffered fresh martyrdom Could he with his loving instinct have failed to give his friend some sign If so it had been unwelcome for since the day of Hallin s funeral she and Aldous had been more complete strangers than before Lady Winterbourne Betty Frank Leven had written since her father s death but from him nothing By the way Frank Leven had succeeded at Christmas by old Sir Charles Leven s unexpected death to the baronetcy and estates How would that affect his chances with Betty if indeed there were any such chances left As to her own immediate future Marcella knew from many indications that Mellor would be hers at once But in her general tiredness of mind and body she was far more conscious of the burden of her inheritance than of its opportunities All that vivid castle building gift which was specially hers and would revive was at present in abeyance She had pined once for power and freedom that she might make a Kingdom of Heaven of her own quickly Now power and freedom up to a certain point were about to be put into her hands and instead of plans for acting largely and bountifully on a plastic outer world she was saying to herself hungrily that unless she had something close to her to love and live for she could do nothing If her mother would end these unnatural doubts if she would begin to make friends with her own daughter and only yield herself to be loved and comforted why then it might be possible to think of the village and the straw plaiting Otherwise the girl s attitude as she sat dreaming in the sun showed her despondency She was roused by her mother s voice calling her from the other end of the pergola Yes mamma Will you come in There are some letters It is the will thought Marcella as missus Boyce turned back to the hotel and she followed missus Boyce shut the door of their sitting room and then went up to her daughter with a manner which suddenly struck and startled Marcella There was natural agitation and trouble in it There is something in the will Marcella which will I fear annoy and distress you Your father inserted it without consulting me I want to know what you think ought to be done You will find that Lord Maxwell and I have been appointed joint executors Marcella turned pale Lord Maxwell she said bewildered Lord Maxwell Aldous What do you mean mamma missus Boyce put the will into her hands and pointing the way among the technicalities she had been perusing while Marcella was still lingering in the garden showed her the paragraph in question The words of the will were merely formal I hereby appoint c and no more but in a communication from the family solicitor mister French which missus Boyce silently handed to her daughter after she had read the legal disposition the ladies were informed that mister Boyce had before quitting England written a letter to Lord Maxwell duly sealed and addressed with instructions that it should be forwarded to its destination immediately after the writer s burial Those instructions said mister French I have carried out I understand that Lord Maxwell was not consulted as to his appointment as executor prior to the drawing up of the will But you will no doubt hear from him at once and as soon as we know that he consents to act we can proceed immediately to probate Mamma how could he said Marcella in a low suffocated voice letting will and letter fall upon her knee Did he give you no warning in that talk you had with him at Mellor said missus Boyce after a minute s silence Not the least said Marcella rising restlessly and beginning to walk up and down He spoke to me about wishing to bring it on again asked me to let him write I told him it was all done with for ever As to my own feelings I felt it was no use to speak of them but I thought I believed I had proved to him that Lord Maxwell had absolutely given up all idea of such a thing and that it was already probable he would marry some one else I told him I would rather disappear from every one I knew than consent to it he could only humiliate us all by saying a word And now after that She stopped in her restless walk pressing her hands miserably together What does he want with us and our affairs she broke out He wishes of course to have no more to do with me And now we force him force him into these intimate relations What can papa have said in that letter to him What can he have said Oh it is unbearable Can t we write at once She pressed her hands over her eyes in a passion of humiliation and disgust missus Boyce watched her closely We must wait anyway for his letter she said It ought to be here by to morrow morning Marcella sank on a chair by an open glass door her eyes wandering through the straggling roses growing against the wall of the stone balcony outside to the laughing purples and greens of the sea Of course she said unhappily it is most probable he will consent It would not be like him to refuse But mamma you must write I must write and beg him not to do it It is quite simple We can manage everything for ourselves Oh how could papa she broke out again in a low wail how could he missus Boyce s lips tightened sharply It seemed to her a foolish question She at least had had the experience of twenty years out of which to answer it Death had made no difference She saw her husband s character and her own seared and broken life with the same tragical clearness she felt the same gnawing of an affection not to be plucked out while the heart still beat This act of indelicacy and injustice was like many that had gone before it and there was in it the same evasion and concealment towards herself No matter She had made her account with it all twenty years before What astonished her was that the force of her strong coercing will had been able to keep him for so long within the limits of the smaller and meaner immoralities of this world Have you read the rest of the will she asked after a long pause Marcella lifted it again and began listlessly to go through it Mamma she said presently looking up the colour flushing back into her face I find no mention of you in it throughout There seems to be no provision for you There is none said missus Boyce quietly There was no need I have my own income We lived upon it for years before your father succeeded to Mellor It is therefore amply sufficient for me now You cannot imagine cried Marcella trembling in every limb that I am going to take the whole of my father s estate and leave nothing nothing for his wife It would be impossible unseemly It would be to do me an injustice mamma as well as yourself she added proudly No I think not said missus Boyce with her usual cold absence of emotion You do not yet understand the situation Your father s misfortunes nearly ruined the estate for a time Your grandfather went through great trouble and raised large sums to she paused for the right phrase to free us from the consequences of your father s actions I benefited of course as much as he did Those sums crippled all your grandfather s old age He was a man to whom I was attached whom I respected Mellor I believe had never been embarrassed before Well your uncle did a little towards recovery but on the whole he was a fool Your father has done much more and you no doubt will complete it As for me I have no claim to anything more from Mellor The place itself is again she stopped for a word of which the energy when it came seemed to escape her hateful to me I shall feel freer if I have no tie to it And at last I persuaded your father to let me have my way Marcella rose from her seat impetuously walked quickly across the room and threw herself on her knees beside her mother Mamma are you still determined now that we two are alone in the world to act towards me to treat me as though I were not your daughter not your child at all but a stranger It was a cry of anguish A sudden slight tremor swept over missus Boyce s thin and withered face She braced herself to the inevitable Don t let us make a tragedy of it my dear she said with a light touch on Marcella s hands Let us discuss it reasonably Won t you sit down I am not proposing anything very dreadful But like you I have some interests of my own and I should be glad to follow them now a little I wish to spend some of the year in London to make that perhaps my headquarters so as to see something of some old friends whom I have had no intercourse with for years perhaps also of my relations She spoke of them with a particular dryness And I should be glad after this long time to be somewhat taken out of oneself to read to hear what is going on to feed one s mind a little Marcella looking at her saw a kind of feverish light a sparkling intensity in the pale blue eyes that filled her with amazement What after all did she know of this strange individuality from which her own being had taken its rise The same flesh and blood what an irony of nature Of course continued missus Boyce I should go to you and you would come to me It would only be for part of the year Probably we should get more from each other s lives so As you know I long to see things as they are not conventionally Anyway whether I were there or no you would probably want some companion to help you in your work and plans I am not fit for them And it would be easy to find some one who could act as chaperon in my absence The hot tears sprang to Marcella s eyes Why did you send me away from you mamma all my childhood she cried It was wrong cruel I have no brother or sister And you put me out of your life when I had no choice when I was too young to understand missus Boyce winced but made no reply She sat with her delicate hand across her brow She was the white shadow of her former self but her fragility had always seemed to Marcella more indomitable than anybody else s strength Sobs began to rise in Marcella s throat And now she said in half coherent despair do you know what you are doing You are cutting yourself off from me refusing to have any real bond to me just when I want it most I suppose you think that I shall be satisfied with the property and the power and the chance of doing what I like But she tried her best to gulp back her pain her outraged feeling to speak quietly I am not like that really any more I can take it all up with courage and heart if you will stay with me and let me let me love you and care for you But by myself I feel as if I could not face it I am not likely to be happy for a long time except in doing what work I can It is very improbable that I shall marry I dare say you don t believe me but it is true We are both sad and lonely We have no one but each other And then you talk in this ghastly way of separating from me casting me off Her voice trembled and broke she looked at her mother with a frowning passion missus Boyce still sat silent studying her daughter with a strange brooding eye Under her unnatural composure there was in reality a half mad impatience the result of physical and moral reaction This beauty this youth talk of sadness of finality What folly Still she was stirred undermined in spite of herself There she said with a restless gesture let us please talk of it no more I will come back with you I will do my best We will let the matter of my future settlement alone for some months at any rate if that will satisfy you or be any help to you She made a movement as though to rise from her low chair But the great waters swelled in Marcella swelled and broke She fell on her knees again by her mother and before missus Boyce could stop her she had thrown her young arms close round the thin shrunken form Mother she said Mother be good to me love me you are all I have And she kissed the pale brow and cheek with a hungry almost a violent tenderness that would not be gainsaid murmuring wild incoherent things missus Boyce first tried to put her away then submitted being physically unable to resist and at last escaped from her with a sudden sob that went to the girl s heart She rose went to the window struggled hard for composure and finally left the room But that evening for the first time she let Marcella put her on the sofa tend her and read to her More wonderful still she went to sleep while Marcella was reading In the lamplight her face looked piteously old and worn The girl sat for long with her hands clasped round her knees gazing down upon it in a trance of pain and longing Marcella was awake early next morning listening to the full voice of the sea as it broke three hundred feet below against the beach and rocky walls of the little town She was lying in a tiny white room one of the cells of the old monastery and the sun as it rose above the Salernian mountains the mountains that hold Paestum in their blue and purple shadows danced in gold on the white wall The bell of the cathedral far below tolled the hour She supposed it must be six o clock Two hours more or so and Lord Maxwell s letter might be looked for She lay and thought of it longed for it and for the time of answering it with the same soreness that had marked all the dreams of a restless night If she could only see her father s letter It was inconceivable that he should have mentioned her name in his plea He might have appealed to the old friendship between the families That was possible and would have at any rate an appearance of decency But who could answer for it or for him She clasped her hands rigidly behind her head her brows frowning bending her mind with an intensity of will to the best means of assuring Aldous Raeburn that she and her mother would not encroach upon him She had a perpetual morbid vision of herself as the pursuer attacking him now through his friend now through her father Oh when would that letter come and let her write her own She tried to read but in reality listened for every sound of awakening life in the hotel When at last her mother s maid came in to call her she sprang up with a start Deacon are the letters come There are two for your mother miss none for you Marcella threw on her dressing gown watched her opportunity and slipped in to her mother who occupied a similar cell next door missus Boyce was sitting up in bed with a letter before her her pale blue eyes fixed absently on the far stretch of sea She looked round with a start as Marcella entered The letter is to me of course she said Marcella read it breathlessly Dear missus Boyce I have this morning received from your solicitor mister French a letter written by mister Boyce to myself in November of last year In it he asks me to undertake the office of executor to which I hear from mister French he has named me in his will mister French also enquires whether I shall be willing to act and asks me to communicate with you May I then venture to intrude upon you with these few words mister Boyce refers in his touching letter to the old friendship between our families and to the fact that similar offices have often been performed by his relations for mine or vice versa But no reminder of the kind was in the least needed If I can be of any service to yourself and to Miss Boyce neither your poor husband nor you could do me any greater kindness than to command me I feel naturally some diffidence in the matter I gather from mister French that Miss Boyce is her father s heiress and comes at once into the possession of Mellor She may not of course wish me to act in which case I should withdraw immediately but I sincerely trust that she will not forbid me the very small service I could so easily and gladly render I cannot close my letter without venturing to express the deep sympathy I have felt for you and yours during the past six months I have been far from forgetful of all that you have been going through though I may have seemed so I trust that you and your daughter will not hurry home for any business cause if it is still best for your health to stay in Italy With your instructions mister French and I could arrange everything Believe me Yours most sincerely MAXWELL You will find it difficult my dear to write a snub in answer to that letter said missus Boyce drily as Marcella laid it down Marcella s face was indeed crimson with perplexity and feeling Well we can think it over she said as she went away missus Boyce pondered the matter a good deal when she was left alone The signs of reaction and change in Marcella were plain enough What they precisely meant and how much was another matter As to him Marcella s idea of another attachment might be true or might be merely the creation of her own irritable pride Anyway he was in the mood to write a charming letter missus Boyce s blanched lip had all its natural irony as she thought it over To her mind Aldous Raeburn s manners had always been a trifle too good whether for his own interests or for this wicked world And if he had any idea now of trying again let him for Heaven s sake not be too yielding or too eager It was always the way thought missus Boyce remembering a child in white frock and baby shoes if you wished to make her want anything you had to take it away from her Meanwhile the mere thought that matters might even yet so settle themselves drew from the mother a long breath of relief She had spent an all but sleepless night tormented by Marcella s claim upon her After twenty years of self suppression this woman of forty five naturally able original and independent had seen a glimpse of liberty In her first youth she had been betrayed as a wife degraded as a member of society A passion she could not kill combined with some stoical sense of inalienable obligation had combined to make her both the slave and guardian of her husband up to middle life and her family and personal pride so strong in her as a girl had found its only outlet in this singular estrangement she had achieved between herself and every other living being including her own daughter Now her husband was dead and all sorts of crushed powers and desires mostly of the intellectual sort had been strangely reviving within her Just emerged as she was from the long gloom of nursing she already wished to throw it all behind her to travel to read to make acquaintances she who had lived as a recluse for twenty years There was in it a last clutch at youth at life And she had no desire to enter upon this new existence in comradeship with Marcella They were independent and very different human beings That they were mother and daughter was a mere physical accident Moreover though she was amply conscious of the fine development in Marcella during the past two years it is probable that she felt her daughter even less congenial to her now than of old For the rich emotional nature had as we have seen suffered conviction had turned in the broad sense to religion was more and more sensitive especially since Hallin s death to the spiritual things and symbols in the world At Naples she had haunted churches had read as her mother knew many religious books Now missus Boyce in these matters had a curious history She had begun life as an ardent Christian under evangelical influences Her husband on the other hand at the time she married him was a man of purely sceptical opinions a superficial disciple of Mill and Comte and fond of an easy profanity which seemed to place him indisputably with the superior persons of this world To the amazement and scandal of her friends Evelyn Merritt had not been three months his wife before she had adopted his opinions en bloc and was carrying them out to their logical ends with a sincerity and devotion quite unknown to her teacher Thenceforward her conception of things of which however she seldom spoke had been actively and even vehemently rationalist and it had been one of the chief sorenesses and shames of her life at Mellor that in order to suit his position as country squire Richard Boyce had sunk to what in her eyes were a hundred mean compliances with things orthodox and established Then in his last illness he had finally broken away from her and his own past Evelyn I should like to see a clergyman he had said to her in his piteous voice and I shall ask him to give me the Sacrament She had made every arrangement accordingly but her bitter soul could see nothing in the step but fear and hypocrisy and he knew it And as he lay talking alone with the man whom they had summoned two or three nights before the end she sitting in the next room had been conscious of a deep and smarting jealousy Had not the hard devotion of twenty years made him at least her own And here was this black coated reciter of incredible things stepping into her place Only in death she recovered him wholly No priest interfered while he drew his last breath upon her bosom And now Marcella Yet the girl s voice and plea tugged at her withered heart She felt a dread of unknown softnesses of being invaded and weakened by things in her akin to her daughter and so captured afresh Her mind fell upon the bare idea of a revival of the Maxwell engagement and caressed it Meanwhile Marcella stood dressing by the open window in the sunlight which filled the room with wavy reflections caught from the sea Fishing boats were putting off from the beach three hundred feet below her she could hear the grating of the keels the songs of the boatmen On the little breakwater to the right an artist s white umbrella shone in the sun and a half naked boy poised on the bows of a boat moored beside the painter stood bent in the eager attitude of one about to drop the bait into the blue wave below His brown back burnt against the water Cliff houses sea glowed in warmth and light the air was full of roses and orange blossom and to an English sense had already the magic of summer And Marcella s hands as she coiled and plaited her black hair moved with a new lightness for the first time since her father s death her look had its normal fire crossed every now and then by something that made her all softness and all woman No as her mother said one could not snub that letter or its writer But how to answer it In imagination she had already penned twenty different replies How not to be grasping or effusive and yet to show that you could feel and repay kindness there was the problem Meanwhile from that letter or rather in subtle connection with it her thoughts at last went wandering off with a natural zest to her new realm of Mellor and to all that she would and could do for the dwellers therein CHAPTER IV It was a bleak east wind day towards the end of March Aldous was at work in the library at the Court writing at his grandfather s table where in general he got through his estate and county affairs keeping his old sitting room upstairs for the pursuits that were more particularly his own All the morning he had been occupied with a tedious piece of local business wading through endless documents concerning a dispute between the head master of a neighbouring grammar school and his governing body of which Aldous was one The affair was difficult personal odious To have wasted nearly three hours upon it was to a man of Aldous s type to have lost a day Besides he had not his grandfather s knack in such things and was abundantly conscious of it However there it was a duty which none but he apparently could or would do and he had been wrestling with it With more philosophy than usual too since every tick of the clock behind him bore him nearer to an appointment which whatever it might be would not be tedious At last he got up and went to the window to look at the weather A cutting wind clearly but no rain Then he walked into the drawing room calling for his aunt No one was to be seen either there or in the conservatory and he came back to the library and rang Roberts has Miss Raeburn gone out Yes my lord said the old butler addressed She and Miss Macdonald have gone out driving and I was to tell your lordship that Miss Raeburn would drop Miss Macdonald at Mellor on her way home Is Sir Frank anywhere about He was in the smoking room a little while ago my lord Will you please try and find him Yes my lord Aldous s mouth twitched with impatience as the old servant shut the door How many times did Roberts manage to be lord me in a minute he asked himself yet if I were to remonstrate I suppose I should only make him unhappy And walking again to the window he thrust his hands into his pockets and stood looking out with a far from cheerful countenance One of the things that most tormented him indeed in this recent existence was a perpetual pricking sense of the contrast between this small world of his ancestral possessions and traditions with all its ceremonial and feudal usage and the great rushing world outside it of action and of thought Do what he would he could not un king himself within the limits of the Maxwell estate To the people living upon it he was the man of most importance within their ken was inevitably their potentate and earthly providence He confessed that there was a real need of him if he did his duty But on this need the class practice of generations had built up a deference a sharpness of class distinction which any modern must find more and more irksome in proportion to his modernness What was in Aldous s mind as he stood with drawn brows looking out over the view which showed him most of his domain was a sort of hot impatience of being made day by day in a hundred foolish ways to play at greatness Yet as we know he was no democrat by conviction had no comforting faith in what seemed to him the rule of a multitudinous ignorance Still every sane man of to day knows at any rate that the world has taken the road of democracy and that the key to the future for good or ill lies not in the revolts and speculations of the cultivated few but in the men and movements that can seize the many Aldous s temper was despondently critical towards the majority of these perhaps he had constitutionally little of that poet s sympathy with the crowd as such which had given Hallin his power But at any rate they filled the human stage these men and movements and his mind as a beholder Beside the great world spectacle perpetually in his eye and thought the small old world pomps and feudalisms of his own existence had a way of looking ridiculous to him He constantly felt himself absurd It was ludicrously clear to him for instance that in this kingdom he had inherited it would be thought a huge condescension on his part if he were to ask the secretary of a trades union to dine with him at the Court Whereas in his own honest opinion the secretary had a far more important and interesting post in the universe than he So that in spite of a strong love of family rigidly kept to himself he had very few of the illusions which make rank and wealth delightful On the other hand he had a tyrannous sense of obligation which kept him tied to his place and his work to such work as he had been spending the morning on This sense of obligation had for the present withdrawn him from any very active share in politics He had come to the conclusion early in the year just about the time when owing to some rearrangements in the personnel of the Government the Premier had made him some extremely flattering overtures that he must for the present devote himself to the Court There were extensive changes and reforms going on in different parts of the estate some of the schools which he owned and mainly supported were being rebuilt and enlarged and he had a somewhat original scheme for the extension of adult education throughout the property very much on his mind a scheme which must be organised and carried through by himself apparently if it was to thrive at all Much of this business was very dreary to him some of it altogether distasteful Since the day of his parting with Marcella Boyce his only real pleasures had lain in politics or books Politics just as they were growing absorbing to him must for a while at any rate be put aside and even books had not fared as well as they might have been expected to do in the country quiet Day after day he walked or rode about the muddy lanes of the estate doing the work that seemed to him to be his as best he could yet never very certain of its value rather spending his thoughts more and more with regard to his own place and function in the world on a sort of mental apologetic which was far from stimulating sorely conscious the while of the unmatched charm and effectiveness with which his grandfather had gone about the same business and as lonely at heart as a man can well be the wound of love unhealed the wound of friendship still deep and unconsoled To bring social peace and progress as he understood them to this bit of Midland England a man of first rate capacities was perhaps sacrificing what ambition would have called his opportunities Yet neither was he a hero to himself nor to the Buckinghamshire farmers and yokels who depended on him They had liked the grandfather better and had become stolidly accustomed to the grandson s virtues The only gleam in the grey of his life since he had determined about Christmas time to settle down at the Court had come from mister French s letter That letter together with mister Boyce s posthumous note which contained nothing indeed but a skilful appeal to neighbourliness and old family friendship written in the best style of the ex Balkan Commissioner had naturally astonished him greatly He saw at once what she would perceive in it and turned impatiently from speculation as to what mister Boyce might actually have meant to the infinitely more important matter how she would take her father s act Never had he written anything with greater anxiety than he devoted to his letter to missus Boyce There was in him now a craving he could not stay to be brought near to her again to know how her life was going It had first raised its head in him since he knew that her existence and Wharton s were finally parted and had but gathered strength from the self critical loneliness and tedium of these later months missus Boyce s reply couched in terms at once stately and grateful which accepted his offer of service on her own and her daughter s behalf had given him extraordinary pleasure He turned it over again and again wondering what part or lot Marcella might have had in it attributing to her this cordiality or that reticence picturing the two women together in their black dresses the hotel the pergola the cliff all of which he himself knew well Finally he went up to town saw mister French and acquainted himself with the position and prospects of the Mellor estate feeling himself a sort of intruder yet curiously happy in the business It was wonderful what that poor sickly fellow had been able to do in the last two years yet his thoughts fell rather into amused surmise as to what she would find it in her restless mind to do in the next two years Nevertheless all the time the resolution of which he had spoken to Hallin seemed to himself unshaken He recognised and adored the womanly growth and deepening which had taken place in her he saw that she wished to show him kindness But he thought he could trust himself now and henceforward not to force upon her a renewed suit for which there was in his eyes no real or abiding promise of happiness Marcella and her mother had now been at home some three or four days and he was just about to walk over to Mellor for his first interview with them A great deal of the merely formal business consequent on mister Boyce s death had been already arranged by himself and mister French Yet he had to consult Marcella as to certain investments and in a pleasant though quite formal little note he had that morning received from her she had spoken of asking his advice as to some new plans for the estate It was the first letter she herself had as yet written to him hitherto all his correspondence had been carried on with missus Boyce It had struck him by the way as remarkable that there was no mention of the wife in the will He could only suppose that she was otherwise provided for But there had been some curious expressions in her letters Where was Frank Aldous looked impatiently at the clock as Roberts did not reappear He had invited Leven to walk with him to Mellor and the tiresome boy was apparently not to be found Aldous vowed he would not wait a minute and going into the hall put on coat and hat with most business like rapidity He was just equipped when Roberts somewhat breathless with long searching arrived in time to say that Sir Frank was on the front terrace And there Aldous caught sight of the straight though somewhat heavily built figure in its grey suit with the broad band of black across the arm Hullo Frank I thought you were to look me up in the library Roberts has been searching the house for you You said nothing about the library said the boy rather sulkily and Roberts hadn t far to search I have been in the smoking room till this minute Aldous did not argue the point and they set out It was presently clear to the elder man that his companion was not in the best of tempers The widowed Lady Leven had sent her firstborn over to the Court for a few days that Aldous might have some discussion as to his immediate future with the young man She was a silly frivolous woman but it was clear even to her that Frank was not doing very well for himself in the world and advice she would not have taken from her son s Oxford tutor seemed cogent to her when it came from a Raeburn Do at least for goodness sake get him to give up his absurd plan of going to America she wrote to Aldous if he can t take his degree at Oxford I suppose he must get on without it and certainly his dons seem very unpleasant But at least he might stay at home and do his duty to me and his sisters till he marries instead of going off to the Rockies or some other ridiculous place He really never seems to think of Fanny and Rachel or what he might do to help me to get them settled now that his poor father is gone No certainly the young man was not much occupied with Fanny and Rachel He spoke with ill concealed impatience indeed of both his sisters and his mother If his people would get in the way of everything he wanted to do they needn t wonder if he cut up rough at home For the present it was settled that he should at any rate go back to Oxford till the end of the summer term Aldous heartily pitying the unfortunate dons who might have to do with him but after that he entirely declined to be bound He swore he would not be tied at home like a girl he must and would see the world This in itself from a lad who had been accustomed to regard his home as the centre of all delights and had on two occasions stoutly refused to go with his family to Rome lest he should miss the best month for his father s trout stream was sufficiently surprising However of late some tardy light had been dawning upon Aldous The night after Frank s arrival at the Court Betty Macdonald came down to spend a few weeks with Miss Raeburn being for the moment that lady s particular pet and protegee Frank whose sulkiness during the twenty four hours before she appeared had been the despair of both his host and hostess brightened up spasmodically when he heard she was expected and went fishing with one of the keepers on the morning before her arrival with a fair imitation of his usual spirits But somehow since that first evening though Betty had chattered and danced and frolicked her best though her little figure running up and down the big house gave a new zest to life in it Frank s manners had gone from bad to worse And at last Aldous who had not as yet seen the two much together and was never an observant man in such matters had begun to have an inkling Was it possible that the boy was in love and with Betty He sounded Miss Raeburn found that she did not rise to his suggestion at all was in fact annoyed by it and with the usual stupidity of the clever man failed to draw any reasonable inference from the queerness of his aunt s looks and sighs As to the little minx herself she was inscrutable She teased them all in turns Frank perhaps less than the others Aldous as usual found her a delightful companion She would walk all over the estate with him in the most mannish garments and boots conceivable which only made her childish grace more feminine and more provocative than ever She took an interest in all his tenants she dived into all his affairs she insisted on copying his letters And meanwhile on either side were Miss Raeburn visibly recovering day by day her old cheeriness and bustle and Frank Frank who ate nothing or nothing commensurate to his bulk and if possible said less Aldous had begun to feel that the situation must be probed somehow and had devised this walk indeed with some vague intention of plying remonstrances and enquiries He had an old affection for the boy which Lady Leven had reckoned upon The first difficulty of course was to make him talk at all Aldous tried various sporting gambits with very small success At last by good luck the boy rose to something like animation in describing an encounter he had had the week before with a piebald weasel in the course of a morning s ferreting All at once we saw the creature s head poke out of the hole pure white with a brown patch on it When it saw us back it scooted and we sent in another ferret after the one that was there already My goodness there was a shindy down in the earth you could hear them rolling and kicking like anything We had our guns ready but all of a sudden everything stopped not a sound or a sign of anything We threw down our guns and dug away like blazes Presently we came on the two ferrets gorging away at a dead rabbit nasty little beasts that accounted for them but where on earth was the weasel I really began to think we had imagined the creature when whish came a flash of white lightning and out the thing bolted pure white with a splash of brown its winter coat of course I shot at it but it was no go If I d only put a bag over the hole and not been an idiot I should have caught it The boy swung along busily ruminating for a minute or two and forgetting his trouble I ve seen one something like it before he went on ages ago when I was a little chap and Harry Wharton and I were out rabbiting By the way he stopped short do you see that that fellow s come back I saw the paragraph in the Times this morning said Aldous drily And I ve got a letter from Fanny this morning to say that he and Lady Selina are to be married in July and that she s going about making a martyr and a saint of him talking of the persecution he s had to put up with and the vulgar fellows who couldn t appreciate him and generally making an ass of herself Oh he won t ask any of us to his wedding trust him It is a rum business You know Willie Ffolliot that queer dark fellow that used to be in the tenth Hussars did all those wild things in the Soudan Yes slightly I heard all about it from him He was one of that gambling set at Harry s club there s been all that talk about you know since Harry came to grief Well he was going along Piccadilly one night last summer quite late between eleven and twelve when Harry caught hold of him from behind Willie thought he was out of his mind or drunk He told me he never saw anybody in such a queer state in his life You come along with me said Harry come and talk to me or I shall shoot myself So Willie asked him what was up I m engaged to be married said Harry Whereupon Willie remarked that considering his manner and his appearance he was sorry for the young lady Young said Harry as though he would have knocked him down And then it came out that he had just that moment engaged himself to Lady Selina And it was the very same day that he got into that precious mess in the House the very same night I suppose he went to her to be comforted and thought he d pull something off anyway Why she took him But of course she s no chicken and old Alresford may die any day And about the bribery business I suppose he made her think him an injured innocent Anyway he talked to Willie when they got to his rooms like a raving lunatic and you know he was always such a cool hand Ffolliot he said can you come with me to Siam next week How much said Will I thought you were engaged to Lady Selina Then he swore little oaths and vowed he had told her he must have a year We ll go and explore those temples in Siam he said and then he muttered something about Why should I ever come back Presently he began to talk of the strike and the paper and the bribe and all the rest of it making out a long rigmarole story Oh of course he d done everything for the best trust him and everybody else was a cur and a slanderer And Ffolliot declared he felt quite pulpy the man was such a wreck and he said he d go with him to Siam or anywhere else if he d only cheer up And they got out the maps and Harry began to quiet down and at last Will got him to bed Fanny says Ffolliot reports he had great difficulty in dragging him home However Lady Selina has no luck there he is Oh he will be one of the shining lights of our side before long said Aldous with resignation Since he gave up his seat here there has been some talk of finding him one in the Alresfords neighbourhood I believe But I don t suppose anybody s very anxious for him He is to address a meeting I see on the Tory Labour Programme next week The Clarion I suppose will go round with him Beastly rag said Frank fervently It s rather a queer thing isn t it that such a clever chap as that should have made such a mess of his chances It almost makes one not mind being a fool He laughed but bitterly and at the same moment the cloud that for some twenty minutes or so seemed to have completely rolled away descended again on eye and expression Well there are worse things than being a fool said Aldous with insidious emphasis sulking and shutting up with your best friends for instance Frank flushed deeply and turned upon him with a sort of uncertain fury I don t know what you mean Whereupon Aldous slipped his arm inside the boy s and prepared himself with resignation for the scene that had to be got through somehow when Frank suddenly exclaimed I say there s Miss Boyce Never was a man more quickly and completely recalled from altruism to his own affairs Aldous dropped his companion s arm straightened himself with a thrill of the whole being and saw Marcella some distance ahead of them in the Mellor drive which they had just entered She was stooping over something on the ground and was not apparently aware of their approach A ray of cold sun came out at the moment touched the bending figure and the grass at her feet grass starred with primroses which she was gathering I didn t know you were going to call said Frank bewildered Isn t it too soon And he looked at his companion in astonishment I came to speak to Miss Boyce and her mother on business said Aldous with all his habitual reserve I thought you wouldn t mind the walk back by yourself Business the boy echoed involuntarily Aldous hesitated then said quietly mister Boyce appointed me executor under his will Frank lifted his eyebrows and allowed himself at least an inward By Jove By this time Marcella had caught sight of them and was advancing She was in deep mourning but her hands were full of primroses which shone against the black and the sun penetrating the thin green of some larches to her left danced in her eyes and on a face full of sensitive and beautiful expression They had not met since they stood together beside Hallin s grave This fact was in both their minds Aldous felt it as it were in the touch of her hand What he could not know was that she was thinking quite as much of his letter to her mother and its phrases They stood talking a little in the sunshine Then as Frank was taking his leave Marcella said Won t you wait for for Lord Maxwell in the old library We can get at it from the garden and I have made it quite habitable My mother of course does not wish to see anybody Frank hesitated then pushed by a certain boyish curiosity and by the angry belief that Betty had been carried off by Miss Raeburn and was out of his reach till luncheon time said he would wait Marcella led the way opened the garden door of the lower corridor close to the spot where she had seen Wharton standing in the moonlight on a never to be forgotten night and then ushered them into the library The beautiful old place had been decently repaired though in no sense modernised The roof had no holes and its delicate stucco work formerly stained and defaced by damp had been whitened so that the brown and golden tones of the books in the latticed cases told against it with delightful effect The floor was covered with a cheap matting and there were a few simple chairs and tables A wood fire burnt on the old hearth Marcella s books and work lay about and some shallow earthenware pans filled with home grown hyacinths scented the air What with the lovely architecture of the room itself its size its books and old portraits and the signs it bore of simple yet refined use it would have been difficult to find a gentler mellower place Aldous looked round him with delight I hope to make a village drawing room of it in time she said casually to Frank as she stooped to put a log on the fire I think we shall get them to come as it has a separate door and scraper and mat all to itself Goodness said Frank they won t come It s too far from the village Don t you be so sure said Marcella laughing mister Craven has all sorts of ideas Who s mister Craven Didn t you meet him at my rooms Oh I remember ejaculated the boy a frightful Socialist And his wife s worse said Marcella merrily They ve come down to settle here They re going to help me Then for mercy s sake keep them to yourself cried Frank and don t let them go loose over the county We don t want them at our place Oh your turn will come Lord Maxwell her tone changed became shy and a little grave Shall we go into the Stone Parlour My mother will come down if you wish to see her but she thought that that perhaps we could settle things Aldous had been standing by hat in hand watching her as she chattered to Frank As she addressed him he gave a little start Oh I think we can settle everything he said Well this is rum said Frank to himself as the door closed behind them and instead of betaking himself to the chair and the newspaper with which Marcella had provided him he began to walk excitedly up and down Her father makes him executor he manages her property for her and they behave nicely to each other as though nothing had ever happened at all What the deuce does it mean And all the time Betty why Betty s devoted to him and it s as plain as a pikestaff what that old cat Miss Raeburn is thinking of from morning till night Well I m beat And throwing himself down on a stool by the fire his chin between his hands he stared dejectedly at the burning logs CHAPTER V Meanwhile Marcella and her companion were sitting in the Stone Parlour side by side save for a small table between them which held the various papers Aldous had brought with him At first there had been on her side as soon as they were alone a feeling of stifling embarrassment All the painful proud sensations with which she had received the news of her father s action returned upon her she would have liked to escape she shrank from what once more seemed an encroachment a situation as strange as it was embarrassing But his manner very soon made it impossible indeed ridiculous to maintain such an attitude of mind He ran through his business with his usual clearness and rapidity It was not complicated her views proved to be the same as his and she was empowered to decide for her mother Aldous took notes of one or two of her wishes left some papers with her for her mother s signature and then his work was practically done Nothing throughout could have been more reassuring or more everyday than his demeanour Then indeed when the end of their business interview approached and with it the opportunity for conversation of a different kind both were conscious of a certain tremor To him this old parlour was torturingly full of memories In this very place where they sat he had given her his mother s pearls and taken a kiss in return from the cheek that was once more so near to him With what free and exquisite curves the hair set about the white brow How beautiful was the neck the hand What ripened softened charm in every movement The touching and rebuking thought rose in his mind that from her nursing experience and its frank contact with the ugliest realities of the physical life a contact he had often shrunk from realising there had come to her not so much added strength as a new subtlety and sweetness some delicate vibrating quality that had been entirely lacking to her first splendid youth Suddenly she said to him with a certain hesitation There was one more point I wanted to speak to you about Can you advise me about selling some of those railway shares She pointed to an item in a short list of investments that lay beside them But why said Aldous surprised They are excellent property already and are going up in value Yes I know But I want some ready money immediately more than we have to spend on cottage building in the village I saw a builder yesterday and came to a first understanding with him We are altering the water supply too They have begun upon it already and it will cost a good deal Aldous was still puzzled I see he said But don t you suppose that the income of the estate now that your father has done so much to free it will be enough to meet expenses of that kind without trenching on investments A certain amount of course should be systematically laid aside every year for rebuilding and estate improvements generally Yes but you see I only regard half of the income as mine She looked up with a little smile He was now standing in front of her against the fire his grey eyes which could be as she well knew so cold and inexpressive bent upon her with eager interest Only half the income he repeated Ah he smiled kindly is that an arrangement between you and your mother Marcella let her hand fall with a little despairing gesture Oh no she said oh no Mamma mamma will take nothing from me or from the estate She has her own money and she will live with me part of the year The intonation in the words touched Aldous profoundly Part of the year he said astonished yet not knowing how to question her missus Boyce will not make Mellor her home She would be thankful if she had never seen it said Marcella quickly and she would never see it again if it weren t for me It s dreadful what she went through last year when when I was in London Her voice fell Glancing up at him involuntarily her eye looked with dread for some chill some stiffening in him Probably he condemned her had always condemned her for deserting her home and her parents But instead she saw nothing but sympathy missus Boyce has had a hard life he said with grave feeling Marcella felt a tear leap and furtively raised her handkerchief to brush it away Then with a natural selfishness her quick thought took another turn A wild yearning rose in her mind to tell him much more than she had ever done in old days of the miserable home circumstances of her early youth to lay stress on the mean unhappiness which had depressed her own child nature whenever she was with her parents and had withered her mother s character Secretly passionately she often made the past an excuse Excuse for what For the lack of delicacy and loyalty of the best sort of breeding which had marked the days of her engagement Never never to speak of it with him to pour out everything to ask him to judge to understand to forgive She pulled herself together by a strong effort reminding herself in a flash of all that divided them of womanly pride of Betty Macdonald s presence at the Court of that vain confidence to Hallin of which her inmost being must have been ashamed but that something calming and sacred stole upon her whenever she thought of Hallin lifting everything concerned with him into a category of its own No let her selfish weakness make no fettering claim upon the man before her Let her be content with the friendship she had after all achieved that was now doing its kindly best for her All these images like a tumultuous procession ran through the mind in a moment He thought as she sat there with her bent head the hands clasped round the knee in the way he knew so well that she was full of her mother and found it difficult to put what she felt into words But tell me about your plan he said gently if you will Oh it is nothing she said hurriedly I am afraid you will think it impracticable perhaps wrong It s only this you see as there is no one depending on me as I am practically alone it seemed to me I might make an experiment Four thousand a year is a great deal more than I need ever spend than I ought of course to spend on myself I don t think altogether what I used to think I mean to keep up this house to make it beautiful to hand it on perhaps more beautiful than I found it to those that come after And I mean to maintain enough service in it both to keep it in order and to make it a social centre for all the people about for everybody of all classes so far as I can I want it to be a place of amusement and delight and talk to us all especially to the very poor After all her cheek flushed under the quickening of her thought everybody on the estate in their different degree has contributed to this house in some sense for generations I want it to come into their lives to make it their possession their pride as well as mine But then that isn t all The people here can enjoy nothing use nothing till they have a worthier life of their own Wages here you know are terribly low much lower she added timidly than with you They are as a rule eleven or twelve shillings a week Now there seem to be about one hundred and sixty labourers on the estate altogether in the farmers employment and in our own Some of course are boys and some old men earning a half wage mister Craven and I have worked it out and we find that an average weekly increase of five shillings per head which would give the men of full age and in full work about a pound a week would work out at about two thousand a year She paused a moment trying to put her further statement into its best order Your farmers you know he said smiling after a pause will be your chief difficulty Of course But I thought of calling a meeting of them I have discussed it with mister French of course he thinks me mad but he gave me some advice I should propose to them all fresh leases with certain small advantages that Louis Craven thinks would tempt them at a reduced rental exactly answering to the rise in wages Then in return they must accept a sort of fair wage clause binding them to pay henceforward the standard wage of the estate She looked up her face expressing urgent though silent interrogation You must remember he said quickly that though the estate is recovering and rents have been fairly paid about here during the last eighteen months you may be called upon at any moment to make the reductions which hampered your uncle These reductions will of course fall upon you as before seeing that the farmers in a different way will be paying as much as before Have you left margin enough I think so she said eagerly I shall live here very simply and accumulate all the reserve fund I can I have set all my heart upon it I know there are not many people could do such a thing other obligations would must come first And it may turn out a mistake But whatever happens whatever any of us Socialists or not may hope for in the future here one is with one s conscience and one s money and these people who like oneself have but the one life In all labour it is the modern question isn t it how much of the product of labour the workman can extract from the employer About here there is no union to act for the labourers they have practically no power But in the future we must surely hope they will combine that they will be stronger strong enough to force a decent wage What ought to prevent my free will anticipating a moment since I can do it that we all want to see She spoke with a strong feeling but his ear detected a new note something deeper and wistfuller than of old Well as you say you are for experiments he replied not finding it easy to produce his own judgment quickly Then in another tone it was always Hallin s cry She glanced up at him her lips trembling I know Do you remember how he used to say the big changes may come the big Collectivist changes But neither you nor I will see them I pray not to see them Meanwhile all still hangs upon comes back to the individual Here are you with your money and power there are those men and women whom you can share with in new and honourable ways to day Then she checked herself suddenly But now I want you to tell me will you tell me all the objections you see You must often have thought such things over She was looking nervously straight before her She did not see the flash of half bitter half tender irony that crossed his face Her tone of humility of appeal was so strange to him remembering the past Yes very often he answered Well I think these are the kind of arguments you will have to meet He went through the objections that any economist would be sure to weigh against a proposal of the kind as clearly as he could and at some length but without zest What affected Marcella all through was not so much the matter of what he said as the manner of it It was so characteristic of the two voices in him the voice of the idealist checked and mocked always by the voice of the observer and the student A year before the little harangue would have set her aflame with impatience and wrath Now beneath the speaker she felt and yearned towards the man Yet as to the scheme when all demurs were made she was of the same opinion still His arguments were not new to her the inward eagerness over rode them In my own case he said at last the tone passing instantly into reserve and shyness as always happened when he spoke of himself my own wages are two or three shillings higher than those paid generally by the farmers on the estate and we have a pension fund But so far I have felt the risks of any wholesale disturbance of labour on the estate depending as it must entirely in my case on the individual life and will to be too great to let me go further I sometimes believe that it is the farmers who would really benefit most by experiments of the kind She protested vehemently being at the moment of course not at all in love with mankind in general but only with those members of mankind who came within the eye of imagination He was enchanted to see the old self come out again positive obstinate generous to see the old confident pose of the head the dramatic ease of gesture Meanwhile something that had to be said that must indeed be said if he were to give her serious and official advice pressed uncomfortably on his tongue You know he said not looking at her when at last she had for the moment exhausted argument and prophecy you have to think of those who will succeed you here still more you have to think of marriage before you pledge yourself to the halving of your income Now he must needs look at her intently out of sheer nervousness The difficulty he had had in compelling himself to make the speech at all had given a certain hardness and stiffness to his voice She felt a sudden shock and chill resented what he had dismally felt to be an imperative duty I do not think I have any need to think of it in this connection she said proudly And getting up she began to gather her papers together The spell was broken the charm gone He felt that he was dismissed With a new formality and silence she led the way into the hall he following As they neared the library there was a sound of voices Marcella opened the door in surprise and there on either side of the fire sat Betty Macdonald and Frank Leven That s a mercy cried Betty running forward to Marcella and kissing her I really don t know what would have happened if mister Leven and I had been left alone any longer As for the Kilkenny cats my dear don t mention them The child was flushed and agitated and there was an angry light in her blue eyes Frank looked simply lumpish and miserable Yes here I am said Betty holding Marcella and chattering as fast as possible I made Miss Raeburn bring me over that I might just catch a sight of you She would walk home and leave the carriage for me Isn t it like all the topsy turvy things nowadays When I m her age I suppose I shall have gone back to dolls Please to look at those ponies they re pawing your gravel to bits And as for my watch just inspect it She thrust it reproachfully under Marcella s eyes You ve been such a time in there talking that Sir Frank and I have had time to quarrel for life and there isn t a minute left for anything rational Oh good bye my dear good bye I never kept Miss Raeburn waiting for lunch yet did I mister Aldous and I mustn t begin now Come along mister Aldous You ll have to come home with me I m frightened to death of those ponies You shan t drive but if they bolt I ll give them to you to pull in Dear dear Marcella let me come again soon directly A few more sallies and kisses a few more angry looks at Frank and appeals to Aldous who was much less responsive than usual and the child was seated very erect and rosy on the driving seat of the little pony carriage with Aldous beside her Are you coming Frank said Aldous there s plenty of room His strong brow had a pucker of annoyance As he spoke he looked not at Frank but at Marcella She was standing a trifle back among the shadows of the doorway and her attitude conveyed to him an impression of proud aloofness A sigh that was half pain half resignation passed his lips unconsciously Thank you I ll walk said Frank fiercely Now will you please explain to me why you look like that and talk like that said Marcella with cutting composure when she was once more in the library and Frank crimson to the roots of his hair and saying incoherent things had followed her there I should think you might guess said Frank in reproachful misery as he hung over the fire Not at all said Marcella you are rude to Betty and disagreeable to me by which I suppose that you are unhappy But why should you be allowed to show your feelings when other people don t Frank fairly groaned Well he said making efforts at a tragic calm and looking for his hat you will none of you be troubled with me long I shall go home to morrow and take my ticket for California the day after You said Marcella go to California What right have you to go to California What right Frank stared then he went on impetuously If a girl torments a man as Betty has been tormenting me there is nothing for it I should think but to clear out of the way I am going to clear out of the way whatever anybody says And shoot big game I suppose amuse yourself somehow Frank hesitated Well a fellow can t do nothing he said helplessly I suppose I shall shoot And what right have you to do it Have you any more right than a public official would have to spend public money in neglecting his duties Frank stared at her Well I don t know what you mean he said at last angrily give it up It s quite simple what I mean You have inherited your father s property Your tenants pay you rent that comes from their labour Are you going to make no return for your income and your house and your leisure Ah that s your Socialism cried the young fellow roused by her tone No return Why they have the land If I were a thorough going Socialist said Marcella steadily I should say to you Go The sooner you throw off all ties to your property the sooner you prove to the world that you and your class are mere useless parasites the sooner we shall be rid of you But unfortunately I am not such a good Socialist as that I waver I am not sure of what I wish But one thing I am sure of that unless people like you are going to treat their lives as a profession to take their calling seriously there are no more superfluous drones no more idle plunderers than you in all civilised society Was she pelting him in this way that she might so get rid of some of her own inner smart and restlessness If so the unlucky Frank could not guess it He could only feel himself intolerably ill used He had meant to pour himself out to her on the subject of Betty and his woes and here she was rating him as to his duties of which he had hardly as yet troubled himself to think being entirely taken up either with his grievances or his enjoyments I m sure you know you re talking nonsense he said sulkily though he shrank from meeting her fiery look And if I am idle there are plenty of people idler than me people who live on their money with no land to bother about and nothing to do for it at all On the contrary it is they who have an excuse They have no natural opening perhaps no plain call You have both and as I said before you have no right to take holidays before you have earned them You have got to learn your business first and then do it Give your eight hours day like other people Who are you that you should have all the cake of the world and other people the crusts Frank walked to the window and stood staring out with his back turned to her Her words stung and tingled and he was too miserable to fight I shouldn t care whether it were cake or crusts he said at last in a low voice turning round to her if only Betty would have me Do you think she is any the more likely to have you said Marcella unrelenting if you behave as a loafer and a runaway Don t you suppose that Betty has good reasons for hesitating when she sees the difference between you and and other people Frank looked at her sombrely a queer mixture of expressions on the face in which the maturer man was already to be discerned at war with the powerful young animal I suppose you mean Lord Maxwell There was a pause You may take what I said she said at last looking into the fire as meaning anybody who pays honestly with work and brains for what society has given him as far as he can pay at any rate Now look here said Frank coming dolefully to sit down beside her don t slate me any more I m a bad lot I know well an idle lot I don t think I am a bad lot But it s no good your preaching to me while Betty s sticking pins into me like this Now just let me tell you how she s been behaving Marcella succumbed and heard him He glanced at her surreptitiously from time to time but he could make nothing of her She sat very quiet while he described the constant companionship between Aldous and Betty and the evident designs of Miss Raeburn Just as when he made his first confidences to her in London he was vaguely conscious that he was doing a not very gentlemanly thing But again he was too unhappy to restrain himself and he longed somehow to make an ally of her Well I have only one thing to say she said at last with an odd nervous impatience go and ask her and have done with it She might have some respect for you then No I won t help you but if you don t succeed I ll pity you I promise you that And now you must go away He went feeling himself hardly treated yet conscious nevertheless of a certain stirring of the moral waters which had both stimulus and balm in it She left behind sat quiet in the old library for a few lonely minutes The boy s plight made her alternately scornful and repentant of her sharpness to him As to his report one moment it plunged her in an anguish she dared not fathom the next she was incredulous could not simply make herself take the thing as real But one thing had been real that word from Aldous to her of marriage The nostril dilated the breast heaved as she lost all thought of Frank in a resentful passion that could neither justify nor calm itself It seemed still as though he had struck her Yet she knew well that she had nothing to forgive Next morning she went down to the village meaning to satisfy herself on two or three points connected with the new cottages On the way she knocked at the Rectory garden door in the hope of finding Mary Harden and persuading her to come with her She had not seen much of Mary since their return Still she had had time to be painfully struck once or twice with the white and bloodless look of the Rector s sister and with a certain patient silence about her which seemed to Marcella new Was it the monotony of the life or had both of them been overworking and underfeeding as usual The Rector had received Marcella with his old gentle but rather distant kindness Two years before he had felt strongly about many of her proceedings and had expressed himself frankly enough at least to Mary Now he had put his former disapprovals out of his mind and was only anxious to work smoothly with the owner of Mellor He had a great respect for dignities and she as far as the village was concerned was to be his dignity henceforward Moreover he humbly and truly hoped that she might be able to enlighten him as to a good many modern conceptions and ideas about the poor for which absorbed as he was either in almsgiving of the traditional type or spiritual ministration or sacramental theory he had little time and if the truth were known little affinity In answer to her knock Marcella heard a faint Come in from the interior of the house She walked into the dining room and found Mary sitting by the little table in tears There were some letters before her which she pushed away as Marcella entered but she did not attempt to disguise her agitation What is it dear Tell me said Marcella sitting down beside her and kissing one of the hands she held And Mary told her It was the story of her life a simple tale of ordinary things such as wring the quiet hearts and train the unnoticed saints of this world In her first youth when Charles Harden was for a time doing some divinity lecturing in his Oxford college Mary had gone up to spend a year with him in lodgings Their Sunday teas and other small festivities were frequented by her brother s friends men of like type with himself and most of them either clergymen or about to be ordained Between one of them a young fellow looking out for his first curacy and Mary an attachment had sprung up which Mary could not even now speak of She hurried over it with a trembling voice to the tragedy beyond mister Shelton got his curacy went off to a parish in the Lincolnshire Fens and there was talk of their being married in a year or so But the exposure of a bitter winter s night risked in the struggle across one of the bleakest flats of the district to carry the Sacrament to a dying parishioner had brought on a peculiar and agonising form of neuralgia And from this pain so nobly earned had sprung oh mystery of human fate a morphia habit with all that such a habit means for mind and body It was discovered by the poor fellow s brother who brought him up to London and tried to cure him Meanwhile he himself had written to Mary to give her up I have no will left and am no longer a man he wrote to her It would be an outrage on my part and a sin on yours if we did not cancel our promise Charles who took a hard ascetic view held much the same language and Mary submitted heart broken Then came a gleam of hope The brother s care and affection prevailed there were rumours of great improvement of a resumption of work Just two years ago when you first came here I was beginning to believe she turned away her head to hide the rise of tears that it might still come right But after some six or eight months of clerical work in London fresh trouble developed lung mischief showed itself and the system undermined by long and deep depression seemed to capitulate at once He died last December at Madeira said Mary quietly I saw him before he left England We wrote to each other almost to the end He was quite at peace This letter here was from the chaplain at Madeira who was kind to him to tell me about his grave That was all It was the sort of story that somehow might have been expected to belong to Mary Harden to her round plaintive face to her narrow refined experience and she told it in a way eminently characteristic of her modes of thinking religious or social with old fashioned or conventional phrases which whatever might be the case with other people had lost none of their bloom or meaning for her Marcella s face showed her sympathy They talked for half an hour and at the end of it Mary flung her arms round her companion s neck There she said now we must not talk any more about it I am glad I told you It was a comfort And somehow I don t mean to be unkind but I couldn t have told you in the old days it s wonderful how much better I like you now than I used to do though perhaps we don t agree much better Both laughed though the eyes of both were full of tears Presently they were in the village together As they neared the Hurds old cottage which was now empty and to be pulled down a sudden look of disgust crossed Marcella s face Did I tell you my news of Minta Hurd she said No Mary had heard nothing So Marcella told the grotesque and ugly news as it seemed to her which had reached her at Amalfi Jim Hurd s widow was to be married again to the queer lanky professor of elocution with the Italian name and shifty eye who lodged on the floor beneath her in Brown s Buildings and had been wont to come in of an evening and play comic songs to her and the children Marcella was vehemently sure that he was a charlatan that he got his living by a number of small dishonesties that he had scented Minta s pension But apart from the question whether he would make Minta a decent husband or live upon her and beat her was the fact itself of her re marriage in itself hideous to the girl Marry him she said Marry any one Isn t it incredible They were in front of the cottage Marcella paused a moment and looked at it She saw again in sharp vision the miserable woman fainting on the settle the dwarf sitting handcuffed under the eye of his captors she felt again the rush of that whirlwind of agony through which she had borne the wife s helpless soul in that awful dawn And after that exit with her professor of elocution It made the girl sick to think of And Mary out of a Puseyite dislike of second marriage felt and expressed much the same repulsion Well Minta Hurd was far away and if she had been there to defend herself her powers of expression would have been no match for theirs Nor does youth understand such pleas as she might have urged Will Lord Maxwell continue the pension said Mary Marcella stopped again involuntarily So that was his doing she said I supposed as much You did not know cried Mary in distress Oh I believe I ought not to have said anything about it I always guessed it said Marcella shortly and they walked on in silence Presently they found themselves in front of missus Jellison s very trim and pleasant cottage which lay farther along the common to the left of the road to the Court There was an early pear tree in blossom over the porch and a swelling greenery of buds in the little garden Will you come in said Mary I should like to see Isabella Westall Marcella started at the name How is she she asked Just the same She has never been in her right mind since But she is quite harmless and quiet They found missus Jellison on one side of the fire with her daughter on the other and the little six year old Johnnie playing between them missus Jellison was straw plaiting twisting the straws with amazing rapidity her fingers stained with red from the dye of them Isabella was as usual doing nothing She stared when Marcella and Mary came in but she took no other notice of them Her powerful and tragic face had the look of something originally full of intention from which spirit and meaning had long departed leaving a fine but lifeless outline Marcella had seen it last on the night of the execution in ghastly apparition at Minta Hurd s window when it might have been caught by some sculptor in quest of the secrets of violent expression fixed in clay or marble and labelled Revenge or Passion Its passionless emptiness now filled her with pity and horror She sat down beside the widow and took her hand missus Westall allowed it for a moment then drew her own away suddenly and Marcella saw a curious and sinister contraction of the eyes Ah yo never know how much Isabella unnerstan s an how much she don t missus Jellison was saying to Mary I can t allus make her out but she don t give no trouble An as for that boy he s a chirruper he is He gives em fine times at school he do Miss Barton she ast him in class Thursday bout Ananias and Sappira Johnnie says she whatever made em do sich a wicked thing Well I do n know says he it was jus their nassty good for nothink says he but they was great sillies says he Oh he don t mean no harm lor bless yer the men is all born contrary and they can t help themselves Oh thank yer miss my ealth is pretty tidy though I ave been plagued this winter with a something they call the flenzy I wor very bad Yo go to bed missus Jellison says doctor Sharpe or yo ll know of it But I worn t goin to be talked to by im Why I knowed im when he wor no igher nor Johnnie An I kep puddlin along an one mornin I wor fairly choked an I just crawled into that parlour an I took a sup o brandy out o the bottle she looked complacently at Mary quite conscious that the Rector s sister must be listening to her with disapproving ears an lor bless yer it cut the phlegm it did that very moment My I did cough I drawed it up by the yard I did and I crep back along the wall and yo cud ha knocked me down wi one o my own straws But I ve been better iver since an beginnin to eat my vittles too though I m never no great pecker I ain t not at no time Mary managed to smother her emotions on the subject of the brandy and the old woman chattered on throwing out the news of the village in a series of humorous fragments tinged in general with the lowest opinion of human nature When the girls took leave of her she said slily to Marcella An ow about your plaitin miss though I dessay I m a bold un for astin Marcella coloured Well I ve got it to think about missus Jellison We must have a meeting in the village and talk it over one of these days The old woman nodded in a shrewd silence and watched them depart Wull I reckon Jimmy Gedge ull lasst my time she said to herself with a chuckle If missus Jellison had this small belief in the powers of the new mistress of Mellor over matters which according to her had been settled generations ago by the Lord and natur Marcella certainly was in no mood to contradict her She walked through the village on her return scanning everything about her the slatternly girls plaiting on the doorsteps the children in the lane the loungers round the various publics the labourers old and young who touched their caps to her with a moody and passionate eye Mary she broke out as they neared the Rectory I shall be twenty four directly How much harm do you think I shall have done here by the time I am sixty four Mary laughed at her and tried to cheer her But Marcella was in the depths of self disgust What is wanted really wanted she said with intensity is not my help but their growth How can I make them take for themselves take roughly and selfishly even if they will only take As for my giving what relation has it to anything real or lasting Mary was scandalised I declare you are as bad as mister Craven she said He told Charles yesterday that the curtseys of the old women in the village to him and Charles women old enough to be their grandmothers sickened him of the whole place and that he should regard it as the chief object of his work here to make such things impossible in the future Or perhaps you re still of mister mister Wharton s opinion you ll be expecting Charles and me to give up charity But it s no good my dear We re not advanced and we never shall be At the mention of Wharton Marcella threw her proud head back wave after wave of changing expression passed over the face I often remember the things mister Wharton said in this village she said at last There was life and salt and power in many of them It s not what he said but what he was that one wants to forget They parted presently and Marcella went heavily home The rising of the spring the breath of the April air had never yet been sad and oppressive to her as they were to day CHAPTER VI Oh Miss Boyce may I come in The voice was Frank Leven s Marcella was sitting in the old library alone late on the following afternoon Louis Craven who was now her paid agent and adviser had been with her and she had accounts and estimates before her Come in she said startled a little by Frank s tone and manner and looking at him interrogatively Frank shut the heavy old door carefully behind him Then as he advanced to her she saw that his flushed face wore an expression unlike anything she had yet seen there of mingled joy and fear She drew back involuntarily Is there anything anything wrong No he said impetuously no But I have something to tell you and I don t know how I don t know whether I ought I have run almost all the way from the Court And indeed he could hardly get his breath He took a stool she pushed to him and tried to collect himself She heard her heart beat as she waited for him to speak It s about Lord Maxwell he said at last huskily turning his head away from her to the fire I ve just had a long walk with him Then he left me he had no idea I came on here But something drove me I felt I must come I must tell Will you promise not to be angry with me to believe that I ve thought about it that I m doing it for the best He looked at her nervously If you wouldn t keep me waiting so long she said faintly while her cheeks and lips grew white Well I was mad this morning Betty hasn t spoken to me since yesterday She s been always about with him and Miss Raeburn let me see once or twice last night that she thought I was in the way I never slept a wink last night and I kept out of their sight all the morning Then after lunch I went up to him and I asked him to come for a walk with me He looked at me rather queerly I suppose I was pretty savage Then he said he d come And off we went ever so far across the park And I let out I don t know what I said I suppose I made a beast of myself But anyway I asked him to tell me what he meant and to tell me if he could what Betty meant I said I knew I was a cool hand and he might turn me out of the house and refuse to have anything more to do with me if he liked But I was going to rack and ruin and should never be any good till I knew where I stood and Betty would never be serious and in short was he in love with her himself for any one could see what Miss Raeburn was thinking of The boy gulped down something like a sob and tried to give himself time to be coherent again Marcella sat like a stone When he heard me say that in love with her yourself he stopped dead I saw that I had made him angry What right have you or any one else he said very short to ask me such a question Then I just lost my head and said anything that came handy I told him everybody talked about it which of course was rubbish and at last I said Ask anybody ask the Winterbournes ask Miss Boyce they all think it as much as I do Miss Boyce he said Miss Boyce thinks I want to marry Betty Macdonald Then I didn t know what to say for of course I knew I d taken your name in vain and he sat down on the grass beside a little stream there is in the park and he didn t speak to me for a long time I could see him throwing little stones into the water And at last he called me Frank he said and I went up to him And then The lad seemed to tremble all over He bent forward and laid his hand on Marcella s knee touching her cold ones And then he said I can t understand yet Frank how you or anybody else can have mistaken my friendship for Betty Macdonald At any rate I know there s been no mistake on her part And if you take my advice you ll go and speak to her like a man with all your heart and see what she says You don t deserve her yet that I can tell you As for me I can t describe the look of his face I only know I wanted to go away you and I will be friends for many years I hope so perhaps you may just understand this once for all For me there never has been and there never will be but one woman in the world to love And you know he said after a bit or you ought to know very well who that woman is And then he got up and walked away He did not ask me to come and I felt I dared not go after him And then I lay and thought I remembered being here I thought of what I had said to you of what I had fancied now and then about about you I felt myself a brute all round for what right had I to come and tell you what he told me And yet there it was I had to come And if it was no good my coming why we needn t say anything about it ever need we But but just look here Miss Boyce if you if you could begin over again and make Aldous happy then there d be a good many other people happy too I can tell you that He could hardly speak plainly Evidently there was on him an overmastering impulse of personal devotion gratitude remorse which for the moment even eclipsed his young passion It was but vaguely explained by anything he had said it rested clearly on the whole of his afternoon s experience But neither could Marcella speak and her pallor began to alarm him I say he cried you re not angry with me She moved away from him and with her shaking finger began to cut the pages of a book that lay open on the mantelpiece The little mechanical action seemed gradually to restore her to self control I don t think I can talk about it she said at last with an effort not now Oh I know said Frank in penitence looking at her black dress you ve been upset and had such a lot of trouble But I She laid her hand on his shoulder He thought he had never seen her so beautiful pale as she was I m not the least angry I ll tell you so another day Now are you going to Betty The young fellow sprang up all his expression changing answering to the stimulus of the word They ll be home directly Miss Raeburn and Betty he said steadily buttoning his coat they d gone out calling somewhere Oh she ll lead me a wretched life will Betty before she s done A charming little ghost of a smile crossed Marcella s white lips Probably Betty knows her business she said if she s quite unmanageable send her to me In his general turmoil of spirits the boy caught her hand and kissed it would have liked indeed to kiss her and all the world But she laughed and sent him away and with a sly lingering look at her he departed She sank into her chair and never moved for long The April sun was just sinking behind the cedars and through the open south window of the library came little spring airs and scents of spring flowers There was an endless twitter of birds and beside her the soft chatter of the wood fire An hour before her mood had been at open war with the spring and with all those impulses and yearnings in herself which answered to it Now it seemed to her that a wonderful and buoyant life akin to all the vast stir the sweet revivals of Nature was flooding her whole being She gave herself up to it in a trance interwoven with all the loveliest and deepest things she had ever felt with her memory of Hallin with her new gropings after God Just as the light was going she got up hurriedly and went to her writing table She wrote a little note sat over it a while with her face hidden in her hands then sealed addressed and stamped it She went out herself to the hall to put it in the letter box For the rest of the evening she went about in a state of dream overcome sometimes by rushes of joy which yet had in them exquisite elements of pain hungering for the passage of the hours for sleep that might cancel some of them picturing the road to the Court and Widrington along which the old postman had by now carried her letter the bands of moonlight and shade lying across it the quiet of the budding woods and the spot on the hillside where he had spoken to her in that glowing October It must lie all night in a dull office her letter she was impatient and sorry for it And when he got it it would tell him nothing though she thought it would rather surprise him It was the merest formal request that he would if he could come and see her again the following morning on business During the evening missus Boyce lay on the sofa and read It always still gave the daughter a certain shock of surprise when she saw the slight form resting in this way In words missus Boyce would allow nothing and her calm composure had been unbroken from the moment of their return home though it was not yet two months since her husband s death In these days she read enormously which again was a new trait especially novels She read each through rapidly laid it down without a word of comment and took up another Once or twice but very rarely Marcella surprised her in absent meditation her hand covering the page From the hard satiric brightness of her look on these occasions it seemed probable that she was speculating on the discrepancies between fiction and real life and on the falsity of most literary sentiment To night Marcella sat almost silent she was making a frock for a village child she had carried off from its mother who was very ill and missus Boyce read But as the clock approached ten the time when they generally went upstairs Marcella made a few uncertain movements and finally got up took a stool and sat down beside the sofa An hour later Marcella entered her own room As she closed the door behind her she gave an involuntary sob put down her light and hurrying up to the bed fell on her knees beside it and wept long Yet her mother had not been unkind to her Far from it missus Boyce had praised her in few words but with evident sincerity for the courage that could if necessary put convention aside had spoken of her own relief had said pleasant things of Lord Maxwell had bantered Marcella a little on her social schemes and wished her the independence to stick to them Finally as they got up to go to bed she kissed Marcella twice instead of once and said Well my dear I shall not be in your way to morrow morning I promise you that The speaker s satisfaction was plain yet nothing could have been less maternal The girl s heart when she found herself alone was very sore and the depression of a past which had been so much of a failure so lacking in any satisfied emotion and the sweet preludes of family affection darkened for a while even the present and the future After a time she got up and leaving her room went to sit in a passage outside it It was the piece of wide upper corridor leading to the winding stairs she had descended on the night of the ball It was one of the loneliest and oddest places in the house for it communicated only with her room and the little staircase which was hardly ever used It was indeed a small room in itself and was furnished with a few huge old chairs with moth eaten frames and tattered seats A flowery paper of last century date sprawled over the walls the carpet had many holes in it and the shallow traceried windows set almost flush in the outer surface of the wall were curtainless now as they had been two years before She drew one of the old chairs to a window and softly opened it There was a young moon and many stars seen uncertainly through the rush of April cloud Every now and then a splash of rain moved the creepers and swept across the lawn to be followed by a spell of growing and breathing silence The scent of hyacinths and tulips mounted through the wet air She could see a long ghostly line of primroses from which rose the grey base of the Tudor front checkered with a dim light and shade Beyond the garden with its vague forms of fountain and sun dial the cedars stood watching the little church slept to her left So face to face with Nature the old house and the night she took passionate counsel with herself After to night surely she would be no more lonely She was going for ever from her own keeping to that of another For she never from the moment she wrote her letter had the smallest doubt as to what his answer to her would be never the smallest dread that he would even in the lightest passing impression connect what she was going to do with any thought of blame or wonder Her pride and fear were gone out of her only she dared not think of how he would look and speak when the moment came because it made her sick and faint with feeling How strange to imagine what no doubt would be said and thought about her return to him by the outside world His great place in society his wealth would be the obvious solution of it for many too obvious even to be debated Looking back upon her thoughts of this night in after years she could not remember that the practical certainty of such an interpretation had even given her a moment s pain It was too remote from all her now familiar ways of thinking and his In her early Mellor days the enormous importance that her feverish youth attached to wealth and birth might have been seen in her very attacks upon them Now all her standards were spiritualised She had come to know what happiness and affection are possible in three rooms or two on twenty eight shillings a week and on the other hand her knowledge of Aldous a man of stoical and simple habit thrust with a student s tastes into the position of a great landowner had shown her in the case at least of one member of the rich class how wealth may be a true moral burden and test the source of half the difficulties and pains of half the nobleness also of a man s life Not in mere wealth and poverty she thought but in things of quite another order things of social sympathy and relation alterable at every turn even under existing conditions by the human will lie the real barriers that divide us man from man Had they ever really formed a part of historical time those eight months of their engagement Looking back upon them she saw herself moving about in them like a creature without eyes worked blindfold by a crude inner mechanism that took no account really of impressions from without Yet that passionate sympathy with the poor that hatred of oppression Even these seemed to her to night the blind spasmodic efforts of a mind that all through saw nothing mistook its own violences and self wills for eternal right and was but traitor to what should have been its own first loyalties in seeking to save and reform Was true love now to deliver her from that sympathy to deaden in her that hatred Her whole soul cried out in denial By daily life in natural relations with the poor by a fruitful contact with fact by the clash of opinion in London by the influence of a noble friendship by the education of awakening passion what had once been mere tawdry and violent hearsay had passed into a true devotion a true thirst for social good She had ceased to take a system cut and dried from the Venturists or any one else she had ceased to think of whole classes of civilised society with abhorrence and contempt and there had dawned in her that temper which is in truth implied in all the more majestic conceptions of the State the temper that regards the main institutions of every great civilisation whether it be property or law or religious custom as necessarily in some degree divine and sacred For man has not been their sole artificer Throughout there has been working with him the spark that fires our clay Yes but modification progress change there must be for us as for our fathers Would marriage fetter her It was not the least probable that he and she with their differing temperaments would think alike in the future any more than in the past She would always be for experiments for risks which his critical temper his larger brain would of themselves be slow to enter upon Yet she knew well enough that in her hands they would become bearable and even welcome to him And for himself she thought with a craving remorseful tenderness of that pessimist temper of his towards his own work and function that she knew so well In old days it had merely seemed to her inadequate if not hypocritical She would have liked to drive the dart deeper to make him still unhappier Now would not a wife s chief function be to reconcile him with himself and life to cheer him forward on the lines of his own nature to believe understand help Yet always in the full liberty to make her own sacrifices to realise her own dreamlands She thought with mingled smiles and tears of her plans for this bit of earth that fate had brought under her hand she pledged herself to every man woman and child on it so to live her life that each one of theirs should be the richer for it she set out so far as in her lay to choose equality And beyond Mellor in the great changing world of social speculation and endeavour she prayed always for the open mind the listening heart There is one conclusion one cry I always come back to at last she remembered hearing Hallin say to a young Conservative with whom he had been having a long economic and social argument Never resign yourself that seems to be the main note of it Say if you will believe if you will that human nature being what it is and what so far as we can see it always must be the motives which work the present social and industrial system can never be largely superseded that property and saving luck too struggle success and failure must go on That is one s intellectual conclusion and one has a right to it you and I are at one in it But then on the heels of it comes the moral imperative Hold what you please about systems and movements and fight for what you hold only as an individual never say never think that it is in the order of things in the purpose of God that one of these little ones this Board School child this man honestly out of work this woman sweated out of her life should perish A contradiction or a commonplace you say Well and good The only truths that burn themselves into the conscience that work themselves out through the slow and manifold processes of the personal will into a pattern of social improvement are the contradictions and the commonplaces So here in the dark alone with the haunting uplifting presences of admiration hope and love Marcella vowed within the limits of her personal scope and power never to give up the struggle for a nobler human fellowship the lifelong toil to understand the passionate effort to bring honour and independence and joy to those who had them not But not alone only not alone She had learnt something of the dark aspects the crushing complexity of the world She turned from them to night at last with a natural human terror to hide herself in her own passion to make of love her guide and shelter Her whole rich being was wrought to an intoxication of self giving Oh let the night go faster faster and bring his step upon the road her cry of repentance to his ear I trust I am not late Your clocks I think are ahead of ours You said eleven Aldous advanced into the room with hand outstretched He had been ushered into the drawing room somewhat to his surprise Marcella came forward She was in black as before and pale but there was a knot of pink anemones fastened at her throat which in the play they made with her face and hair gave him a start of pleasure I wanted she said to ask you again about those shares how to manage the sale of them Could you could you give me the name of some one in the City you trust He was conscious of some astonishment Certainly he said If you would rather not entrust it to mister French I can give you the name of the firm my grandfather and I have always employed or I could manage it for you if you would allow me You have quite decided Yes she said mechanically quite And and I think I could do it myself Would you mind writing the address for me and will you read what I have written there She pointed to the little writing table and the writing materials upon it then turned away to the window He looked at her an instant with uneasy amazement He walked up to the table put down his hat and gloves beside it and stooped to read what was written It was in this room you told me I had done you a great wrong But wrongdoers may be pardoned sometimes if they ask it Let me know by a sign a look if I may ask it If not it would be kind to go away without a word She heard a cry But she did not look up She only knew that he had crossed the room that his arms were round her her head upon his breast Marcella wife was all he said and that in a voice so low so choked that she could hardly hear it He held her so for a minute or more she weeping his own eyes dim with tears her cheek laid against the stormy beating of his heart At last he raised her face so that he could see it So this this was what you had in your mind towards me while I have been despairing fighting with myself walking in darkness Oh my darling explain it How can it be Am I real Is this face these lips real he kissed both trembling Oh when a man is raised thus in a moment from torture and hunger to full joy there are no words His head sank on hers and there was silence again while he wrestled with himself At last she looked up smiling You are to please come over here she said and leading him by the hand she took him to the other side of the room That is the chair you sat in that morning Sit down He sat down wondering and before he could guess what she was going to do she had sunk on her knees beside him I am going to tell you she said a hundred things I never told you before You are to hear me confess you are to give me penance you are to say the hardest things possible to me If you don t I shall distrust you She smiled at him again through her tears Marcella he cried in distress trying to lift her to rise himself you can t imagine that I should let you kneel to me You must she said steadily well if it will make you happier I will take a stool and sit by you But you are there above me I am at your feet it is the same chair and you shall not move she stooped in a hasty passion as though atoning for her shall and kissed his hand till I have said it all every word So she began it her long confession from the earliest days He winced often she never wavered She carried through the sharpest analysis of her whole mind with regard to him of her relations to him and Wharton in the old days of the disloyalty and lightness with which she had treated the bond that yet she had never till quite the end thought seriously of breaking of her selfish indifference to even contempt for his life his interests his ideals of her calm forecasts of a married state in which she was always to take the lead and always to be in the right then of the real misery and struggle of the Hurd trial That was my first true experience she said it made me wild and hard but it burnt it purified I began to live Then came the day when when we parted the time in hospital the nursing the evening on the terrace I had been thinking of you because remorse made me think of you solitude mister Hallin everything I wanted you to be kind to me to behave as though you had forgotten everything because it would have made me comfortable and happy or I thought it would And then that night you wouldn t be kind you wouldn t forget instead you made me pay my penalty She stared at him an instant her dark brows drawn together struggling to keep her tears back yet lightening from moment to moment into a divine look of happiness He tried to take possession of her to stop her to silence all this self condemnation on his breast But she would not have it she held him away from her That night though I walked up and down the terrace with mister Wharton afterwards and tried to fancy myself in love with him that night for the first time I began to love you It was mean and miserable wasn t it not to be able to appreciate the gift only to feel when it was taken away It was like being good when one is punished because one must She laid down her head against his chair with a long sigh He could bear it no longer He lifted her in his arms talking to her passionately of the feelings which had been the counterpart to hers the longings jealousies renunciations above all the agony of that moment at the Mastertons party Hallin was the only person who understood he said he knew all the time that I should love you to my grave I could talk to him She gave a little sob of joy and pushing herself away from him an instant she laid a hand on his shoulder I told him she said I told him that night he was dying He looked at her with an emotion too deep even for caresses He never spoke coherently after you left him At the end he motioned to me but there were no words If I could possibly love you more it would be because you gave him that joy He held her hand and there was silence Hallin stood beside them living and present again in the life of their hearts Then little by little delight and youth and love stole again upon their senses Do you suppose he exclaimed that I yet understand in the least how it is that I am here in this chair with you beside me You have told me much ancient history but all that truly concerns me this morning lies in the dark The last time I saw you you were standing at the garden door with a look which made me say to myself that I was the same blunderer I had always been and had far best keep away Bridge me the gap please between that hell and this heaven She held her head high and changed her look of softness for a frown You had spoken of marriage she said Marriage in the abstract with a big M You did it in the tone of my guardian giving me away Could I be expected to stand that He laughed The joy in the sound almost hurt her So one s few virtues smite one he said as he captured her hand again Will you acknowledge that I played my part well I thought to myself in the worst of tempers as I drove away that I could hardly have been more official But all this is evasion What I desire to know categorically is what made you write that letter to me last night after after the day before She sat with her chin on her hand a smile dancing Whom did you walk with yesterday afternoon she said slowly He looked bewildered There she cried with a sudden wild gesture when I have told you it will undo it all Oh if Frank had never said a word to me if I had had no excuse no assurance nothing to go upon had just called to you in the dark as it were there would be some generosity some atonement in that Now you will think I waited to be meanly sure instead of She dropped her dark head upon his hand again with an abandonment which unnerved him which he had almost to brace himself against So it was Frank he said Frank Two hours ago from my window I saw him and Betty down by the river in the park They were supposed to be fishing As far as I could see they were sifting or walking hand in hand in the face of day and the keepers I prepared wise things to say to them None of them will be said now or listened to As Frank s mentor I am undone He held her looking at her intently Shall I tell you he asked in a lower voice shall I show you something something that I had on my heart as I was walking here He slipped his hand into the breast pocket of his coat and drew out a little plain black leather case When he opened it she saw that it contained a pen and ink sketch of herself that had been done one evening by a young artist staying at the Court and a bunch of traveller s joy She gazed at it with a mixture of happiness and pain It reminded her of cold and selfish thoughts and set them in relief against his constancy But she had given away all rights even the right to hate herself Piteously childishly with seeking eyes she held out her hand to him as though mutely asking him for the answer to her outpouring the last word of it all He caught her whisper Forgive he said to her scorning her for the first and only time in their history Does a man forgive the hand that sets him free the voice that recreates him Choose some better word my wife END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MARCELLA This file should be named thirteen thousand seven hundred twenty eight txt or thirteen thousand seven hundred
