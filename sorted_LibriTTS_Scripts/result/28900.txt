QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS three hundred seventy seven INDEX five hundred nine PREFACE The English language is peculiarly rich in synonyms as with such a history it could not fail to be From the time of Julius Caesar Britons Romans Northmen Saxons Danes and Normans fighting fortifying and settling upon the soil of England with Scotch and Irish contending for mastery or existence across the mountain border and the Channel and all fenced in together by the sea could not but influence each other s speech English merchants sailors soldiers and travelers trading warring and exploring in every clime of necessity brought back new terms of sea and shore of shop and camp and battlefield English scholars have studied Greek and Latin for a thousand years and the languages of the Continent and of the Orient in more recent times English churchmen have introduced words from Hebrew Greek and Latin through Bible and prayer book sermon and tract From all this it results that there is scarcely a language ever spoken among men that has not some representative in English speech The spirit of the Anglo Saxon race masterful in language as in war and commerce has subjugated all these various elements to one idiom making not a patchwork but a composite language Anglo Saxon thrift finding often several words that originally expressed the same idea has detailed them to different parts of the common territory or to different service so that we have an almost unexampled variety of words kindred in meaning but distinct in usage for expressing almost every shade of human thought Scarcely any two of such words commonly known as synonyms are identical at once in signification and in use They have certain common ground within which they are interchangeable but outside of that each has its own special province within which any other word comes as an intruder From these two qualities arises the great value of synonyms as contributing to beauty and effectiveness of expression As interchangeable they make possible that freedom and variety by which the diction of an accomplished writer or speaker differs from the wooden uniformity of a legal document As distinct and specific they enable a master of style to choose in every instance the one term that is the most perfect mirror of his thought To write or speak to the best purpose one should know in the first place all the words from which he may choose and then the exact reason why in any case any particular word should be chosen To give such knowledge in these two directions is the office of a book of synonyms Of Milton s diction Macaulay writes His poetry acts like an incantation Its merit lies less in its obvious meaning than in its occult power There would seem at first sight to be no more in his words than in other words But they are words of enchantment No sooner are they pronounced than the past is present and the distant near New forms of beauty start at once into existence and all the burial places of the memory give up their dead Change the structure of the sentence substitute one synonym for another and the whole effect is destroyed The spell loses its power and he who should then hope to conjure with it would find himself as much mistaken as Cassim in the Arabian tale when he stood crying Open Wheat Open Barley to the door which obeyed no sound but Open Sesame The miserable failure of Dryden in his attempt to translate into his own diction some parts of the Paradise Lost is a remarkable instance of this Macaulay s own writings abound in examples of that exquisite precision in the choice of words which never seems to be precise but has all the aspect of absolute freedom Through his language his thought bursts upon the mind as a landscape is seen instantly perfectly and beautifully from a mountain height A little vagueness of thought a slight infelicity in the choice of words would be like a cloud upon the mountain obscuring the scene with a damp and chilling mist Let anyone try the experiment with a poem like Gray s Elegy or Goldsmith s Traveller or Deserted Village of substituting other words for those the poet has chosen and he will readily perceive how much of the charm of the lines depends upon their fine exactitude of expression In our own day when so many are eager to write and confident that they can write and when the press is sending forth by the ton that which is called literature but which somehow lacks the imprint of immortality it is of the first importance to revive the study of synonyms as a distinct branch of rhetorical culture Prevalent errors need at times to be noted and corrected but the teaching of pure English speech is the best defense against all that is inferior unsuitable or repulsive The most effective condemnation of an objectionable word or phrase is that it is not found in scholarly works and a student who has once learned the rich stores of vigorous beautiful exact and expressive words that make up our noble language is by that very fact put beyond the reach of all temptation to linguistic corruption Special instruction in the use of synonyms is necessary for the reason that few students possess the analytical power and habit of mind required to hold a succession of separate definitions in thought at once compare them with each other and determine just where and how they part company and the persons least able to do this are the very ones most in need of the information The distinctions between words similar in meaning are often so fine and elusive as to tax the ingenuity of the accomplished scholar yet when clearly apprehended they are as important for the purposes of language as the minute differences between similar substances are for the purposes of chemistry Often definition itself is best secured by the comparison of kindred terms and the pointing out where each differs from the other We perceive more clearly and remember better what each word is by perceiving where each divides from another of kindred meaning just as we see and remember better the situation and contour of adjacent countries by considering them as boundaries of each other rather than by an exact statement of the latitude and longitude of each as a separate portion of the earth s surface The great mass of untrained speakers and writers need to be reminded in the first place that there are synonyms a suggestion which they would not gain from any precision of separate definitions in a dictionary The deplorable repetition with which many slightly educated persons use such words as elegant splendid clever awful horrid et cetera to indicate for they can not be said to express almost any shade of certain approved or objectionable qualities shows a limited vocabulary a poverty of language which it is of the first importance to correct Many who are not given to such gross misuse would yet be surprised to learn how often they employ a very limited number of words in the attempt to give utterance to thoughts and feelings so unlike that what is the right word on one occasion must of necessity be the wrong word at many other times Such persons are simply unconscious of the fact that there are other words of kindred meaning from which they might choose as the United States surveyors of Alaska found the shuddering tenant of the frigid zone wrapping himself in furs and cowering over a fire of sticks with untouched coal mines beneath his feet Such poverty of language is always accompanied with poverty of thought One who is content to use the same word for widely different ideas has either never observed or soon comes to forget that there is any difference between the ideas or perhaps he retains a vague notion of a difference which he never attempts to define to himself and dimly hints to others by adding to his inadequate word some such phrase as you see or you know in the helpless attempt to inject into another mind by suggestion what adequate words would enable him simply and distinctly to say Such a mind resembles the old maps of Africa in which the interior was filled with cloudy spaces where modern discovery has revealed great lakes fertile plains and mighty rivers One main office of a book of synonyms is to reveal to such persons the unsuspected riches of their own language and when a series of words is given them from which they may choose then with intelligent choice of words there comes of necessity a clearer perception of the difference of the ideas that are to be expressed by those different words Thus copiousness and clearness of language tend directly to affluence and precision of thought Hence there is an important use for mere lists of classified synonyms like Roget s Thesaurus and the works of Soule and Fallows Not one in a thousand of average students would ever discover by independent study of the dictionary that there are fifteen synonyms for beautiful twenty one for beginning fifteen for benevolence twenty for friendly and thirty seven for pure The mere mention of such numbers opens vistas of possible fulness freedom and variety of utterance which will have for many persons the effect of a revelation But it is equally important to teach that synonyms are not identical and to explain why and how they differ A person of extensive reading and study with a fine natural sense of language will often find all that he wants in the mere list which recalls to his memory the appropriate word But for the vast majority there is needed some work that compares or contrasts synonymous words explains their differences of meaning or usage and shows in what connections one or the other may be most fitly used This is the purpose of the present work to be a guide to selection from the varied treasures of English speech This work treats within three hundred seventy five pages more than seven thousand five hundred synonyms It has been the study of the author to give every definition or distinction in the fewest possible words consistent with clearness of statement and this not merely for economy of space but because such condensed statements are most easily apprehended and remembered The method followed has been to select from every group of synonyms one word or two contrasted words the meaning of which may be settled by clear definitive statement thus securing some fixed point or points to which all the other words of the group may be referred The great source of vagueness error and perplexity in many discussions of synonyms is that the writer merely associates stray ideas loosely connected with the different words sliding from synonym to synonym with no definite point of departure or return so that a smooth and at first sight pleasing statement really gives the mind no definite resting place and no sure conclusion A true discussion of synonyms is definition by comparison and for this there must be something definite with which to compare When the standard is settled approximation or differentiation can be determined with clearness and certainty It is not enough to tell something about each word The thing to tell is how each word is related to others of that particular group When a word has more than one prominent meaning the synonyms for one signification are treated in one group and a reference is made to some other group in which the synonyms for another signification are treated as may be seen by noting the synonyms given under APPARENT and following the reference to EVIDENT It has been impossible within the limits of this volume to treat in full all the words of each group of synonyms Sometimes it has been necessary to restrict the statement to a mere suggestion of the correct use in some cases only the chief words of a group could be considered giving the key to the discussion and leaving the student to follow out the principle in the case of other words by reference to the definitive statements of the dictionary It is to be hoped that at some time a dictionary of synonyms may be prepared giving as full a list as that of Roget or of Soule with discriminating remarks upon every word Such a work would be of the greatest value but obviously beyond the scope of a text book for the class room The author has here incorporated by permission of the publishers of the Standard Dictionary much of the synonym matter prepared by him for that work All has been thoroughly revised or reconstructed and much wholly new matter has been added The book contains also more than three thousand seven hundred antonyms These are valuable as supplying definition by contrast or by negation one of the most effective methods of defining being in many cases to tell what a thing is not To speakers and writers antonyms are useful as furnishing oftentimes effective antitheses Young writers will find much help from the indication of the correct use of prepositions the misuse of which is one of the most common of errors and one of the most difficult to avoid while their right use gives to style cohesion firmness and compactness and is an important aid to perspicuity To the text of the synonyms is appended a set of Questions and Examples to adapt the work for use as a text book Aside from the purposes of the class room this portion will be found of value to the individual student Excepting those who have made a thorough study of language most persons will discover with surprise how difficult it is to answer any set of the Questions or to fill the blanks in the Examples without referring to the synonym treatment in Part I or to a dictionary and how rarely they can give any intelligent reason for preference even among familiar words There are few who can study such a work without finding occasion to correct some errors into which they have unconsciously fallen and without coming to a new delight in the use of language from a fuller knowledge of its resources and a clearer sense of its various capabilities West New

philosophical language we speak of the ideas of God The present popular use of idea makes it to signify any product of mental apprehension or activity considered as an object of knowledge or thought

mind has in any way acquired and the Productive Imagination which modifies and combines mental images so as to produce what is virtually new To this Reproductive Imagination President Noah Porter and others have given the name of phantasy or fantasy many psychologists preferring the former spelling Phantasy or fantasy so understood presents numerous and varied images often combining them into new forms with exceeding vividness yet without any true constructive power but with the mind adrift blindly and passively following the laws of association and with reason and will in torpor the mental images being perhaps as varied and as vivid but also as purposeless and unsystematized as the visual images in a kaleidoscope such fantasy often loosely called imagination appears in dreaming reverie somnambulism and intoxication Fantasy in ordinary usage simply denotes capricious or erratic fancy as appears in the adjective fantastic Imagination and fancy differ from fantasy in bringing the images and their combinations under the control of the will imagination is the broader and higher term including fancy imagination is the act or power of imaging or of reimaging objects of perception or thought of combining the products of knowledge in modified new or ideal forms the creative or constructive power of the mind while fancy is the act or power of forming pleasing graceful whimsical or odd mental images or of combining them with little regard to rational processes of construction imagination in its lower form Both fancy and imagination recombine and modify mental images either may work with the other s materials imagination may glorify the tiniest flower fancy may play around a mountain or a star the one great distinction between them is that fancy is superficial while imagination is deep essential spiritual Wordsworth who was the first clearly to draw the distinction between the fancy and the imagination states it as follows To aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose Fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of changes in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent Directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination She recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite She leaves it to fancy to describe Queen Mab as coming In shape no bigger than an agate stone On the forefinger of an alderman Having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as Pompey s Pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of Teneriffe or Atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded The expression is His stature reached the sky the illimitable firmament When the imagination frames a comparison a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties B Poetical Works Pref to Ed of eighteen fifteen p six hundred forty six app T H fifty one So far as actual images are concerned both fancy and imagination are limited to the materials furnished by the external world it is remarkable that among all the representations of gods or demigods fiends and demons griffins and chimaeras the human mind has never invented one organ or attribute that is not presented in human or animal life the lion may have a human head and an eagle s wings and claws but in the various features individually there is absolutely nothing new But imagination can transcend the work of fancy and compare an image drawn from the external world with some spiritual truth born in the mind itself or infuse a series of images with such a spiritual truth molding them as needed for its more vivid expression The imagination modifies images and gives unity to variety it sees all things in one There is the epic imagination the perfection of which is in Milton and the dramatic of which Shakspeare is the absolute master COLERIDGE Table Talk June twenty three thirty four Fancy keeps the material image prominent and clear and works not only with it but for it imagination always uses the material object as the minister of something greater than itself and often almost loses the object in the spiritual idea with which she has associated it and for which alone she values it Fancy flits about the surface and is airy and playful sometimes petty and sometimes false imagination goes to the heart of things and is deep earnest serious and seeks always and everywhere for essential truth Fancy sets off variegates and decorates imagination transforms and exalts Fancy delights and entertains imagination moves and

is productive of momentary physical pain in its higher uses dread approaches the meaning of awe but with more of chilliness and cowering and without that subjection of soul to the grandeur and worthiness of the object that is involved in awe Awe is preoccupied with the object that inspires it dread with apprehension of personal consequences Reverence and veneration are less overwhelming than awe or dread and suggest something of esteem affection and personal nearness We may feel awe of that which we can not reverence as a grandly terrible ocean storm awe of the divine presence is

presupposing knowledge for its very existence and exercise Wisdom is mental power acting upon the materials that fullest knowledge gives in the most effective way There may be what is termed practical wisdom that looks only to material results but in its full sense wisdom implies the highest and noblest exercise of all the faculties of the moral nature as well as of the intellect Prudence is a lower and more negative form of the same virtue respecting outward and practical matters and largely with a view of avoiding loss and injury wisdom transcends prudence so that while the part of prudence is ordinarily also that of wisdom cases arise as in the exigencies of business or of war when the highest wisdom is in the disregard of the maxims of prudence Judgment the power of forming decisions especially correct decisions is broader and more positive than prudence leading one to do as readily as to refrain from doing but judgment is more limited in range and less exalted in character than wisdom to say of one that he displayed good judgment is much less than to say that he manifested wisdom Skill is far inferior to wisdom consisting largely in the practical application of acquired knowledge power and habitual processes or in the ingenious contrivance that makes such application possible In the making of something perfectly useless there may be great skill but no

following exercises have been prepared expressly and solely to accompany the preceding text in which the distinctions of synonyms have been carefully pointed out It is not expected intended or desired that the questions should be answered or the blanks in the examples supplied offhand In such study nothing can be worse than guesswork Hence leading questions have been avoided and the order of synonyms given in Part I has frequently been departed from or reversed in Part II To secure the study of Part I before coming into class pupils should not be allowed to open it during recitation unless on rare occasions to settle doubtful or disputed points The very best method will be found to be to have the examples included in the lesson with any others that may be added copied on the blackboard before recitation and no books brought into class The teacher should make a thorough study of the subject not only mastering what is given in Part I but going beyond the necessarily brief statements there given and consulting the ultimate authorities the best dictionaries and the works of the best speakers and writers For the latter purpose a good cyclopedia of quotations like the Hoyt will be found very helpful The teacher should so study out the subject as to be distinctly in advance of the class and able to speak authoritatively Such independent study will be found intensely interesting and can be made delightful and even fascinating to any intelligent class In answer to questions calling for definitive statement the teacher should insist upon the very words of the text unless the pupil can give in his own words what is manifestly as good This will often be found not easy to do Definition by synonym should be absolutely forbidden Reasonable questions should be encouraged but the class should not be allowed to become a debating society The meaning of English words is not a matter of conjecture and all disputed points should be promptly referred to the dictionary usually to be looked up after the recitation and considered if need be at the next recitation The majority of them will not need to be referred to again as the difficulties will simply represent an inferior usage which the dictionary will brush aside One great advantage of synonym study is to exterminate colloquialisms The class should be encouraged to bring quotations from first class authors with blanks to be filled such quotations being held authoritative though not infallible also quotations from the best newspapers periodicals speeches et cetera with words underlined for criticism such quotations being held open to revision upon consultation of authorities The change of usage whereby that may be correct to day which would not have been so at an earlier period should be carefully noted but always upon the authority of an approved dictionary The examples have been in great part selected from the best literature and all others carefully prepared for this work Hence an appropriate word to fill each blank can always be found by careful study of the corresponding group of synonyms In a few instances either of two words would appropriately fill a blank and yield a
