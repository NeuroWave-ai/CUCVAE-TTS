8295-296107-0000	train-other-500	the Greeks left no child forms in art The student of original sources of history learns little about children in his searches few in number
8295-296107-0001	train-other-500	and comparatively meagre in quality are the literary remains that even refer to them We know little of the childhood days of our forbears
8295-296107-0002	train-other-500	and have scant opportunity to make comparisons or note progress The child of colonial days was emphatically to be seen
none	none	 not to be heard nor was he even to be much in evidence to the eye He was of as little importance in domestic social or ethical relations 
8295-296107-0003	train-other-500	as his childish successor is of great importance to day
none	none	 it was deemed neither courteous decorous nor wise to make him appear of value or note in his own eyes or in the eyes of his seniors 
8295-296107-0004	train-other-500	Hence there was none of that exhaustive study of the motives thoughts and acts of a child which is now rife The accounts of oldtime child life gathered for this book
8295-296107-0005	train-other-500	are wholly unconscious
none	none	 and full of honesty and simplicity not only from 
8295-296107-0006	train-other-500	the attitude of the child but from that of his parents guardians and friends The records have been made from affectionate interest
none	none	 not from scientific interest no profound search has been made for motives or significance but the proof they give of tenderness and affection in the family 
8295-296107-0007	train-other-500	are beautiful to read and to know The quotations from manuscript letters records diaries and accounts which are here given
8295-296107-0008	train-other-500	could only have been acquired by precisely the method which has been followed a constant and distinct search for many years
8295-296107-0009	train-other-500	combined with an alert watchfulness for items or even hints relating to the subject during as many years of extended historical reading
8295-296107-0010	train-other-500	Many private collections and many single treasured relics have been freely offered for use and nearly all the sentences and pages selected from these sources
8295-296107-0011	train-other-500	now appear in print for the first time The portraits of children form a group as rare as it is beautiful They are specially valuable
8295-296107-0012	train-other-500	as a study of costume Nearly all of these also are as true emblems of the generous friendship of the present owners as they are of the life of the past
8295-296107-0013	train-other-500	The rich stores of our many historical associations of the Essex Institute the American Antiquarian Society the Long Island Historical Society
8295-296107-0014	train-other-500	the Deerfield Memorial Hall the Lenox Library have been generously
none	none	 opened carefully gleaned and freely used The expression of gratitude so often tendered to these helpful kinsfolk and friends 
8295-296107-0015	train-other-500	and to these bountiful societies and libraries can scarcely be emphasized by any public thanks yet
8295-296107-0016	train-other-500	it would seem that for such assistance thanks could never be offered too frequently nor too publicly Nor have I in gathering for this as for my other books
8295-296107-0017	train-other-500	failed to exercise what Emerson calls the catlike love of garrets presses and cornchambers and of the conveniences of long housekeeping
none	none	 Many long kept homes have I searched many an old garret and press 
8295-296107-0018	train-other-500	has yielded conveniences for this book Though this is a record of the life of children in the American colonies I have freely compared the conditions in this country with similar ones in England at the same date
8295-296107-0019	train-other-500	both for the sake of fuller elucidation and also to attempt to put on a proper basis the civilization which the colonists left behind them
8295-296107-0020	train-other-500	Many statements of conditions in America do not convey correct ideas of our past comfort and present and liberal progress unless we compare them with facts in English life
8295-296107-0021	train-other-500	We must not overrate seventeenth and eighteenth century life in England either in private or public England was not a first class power among nations till the time of the Treaty of Paris
8295-296107-0022	train-other-500	in seventeen sixty three When our colonies were settled it was third rate Life among the nobility was magnificent
none	none	 but the life of the peasantry was wretched and middle class social life was very bleak and monotonous in both city and country From early days life was much better in many ways in America than in England for the family of moderate means and children shared the benefits of these better conditions A child s life was more valuable here 
8295-296107-0023	train-other-500	The colonial laws plainly show this increased valuation and the child responded to this regard of him by a growing sense of his own importance which in time has produced
8295-296107-0024	train-other-500	Young America It is my hope that children as well as grown folk will find in these pages much to interest them in the accounts of the life of children of olden times
none	none	 I have had this end constantly in my mind 
8295-296107-0025	train-other-500	though I have made no attempt nor had I any intent to write in a style for the perusal of children for I have not found that intelligent children care much or long for such books
8295-296107-0026	train-other-500	except in the very rare cases of the few great books that have been written for children and which are loved and read as much by the old as by the young As our tired
8295-296107-0027	train-other-500	century has grown gray it has developed an interest in things youthful in the beginnings of things Its attitude is akin to that of an old man still in health and clear headed but weary
none	none	 who has lived through his scores of crowded years of action toil and strife and seeks in the last days of his life a serene and peaceful harbor the companionship of little children There is something of mystery too in the turn of the century something which then makes our gaze retrospective and comparative rather than inquisitive into the future Hence this year of our Lord MDCCCXCIX 
8295-296107-0028	train-other-500	has been the allotted day and hour for the writing of this book There has been a trend of destiny which has brought not only a book on oldtime child life
8295-296107-0029	train-other-500	and that book at this century end but has included the fate that it should be written by Alice Morse Earle

chuckle while his heart doth ache The Author s Way of Sending Forth His Second Part of the Pilgrim John Bunyan sixteen eighty four There is something inexpressibly sad in the thought of the children who crossed the ocean with the Pilgrims and the fathers of Jamestown New Amsterdam and Boston and the infancy of those born in the first years of colonial life in this strange new world It was hard for grown folk to live conditions and surroundings offered even to strong men constant and many obstacles to the continuance of existence how difficult was it then to rear children In the southern colonies the planters found a climate and enforced modes of life widely varying from home life in England it took several generations to accustom infants to thrive under those conditions The first years of life at Plymouth are the records of a bitter struggle not for comfort but for existence Scarcely less sad are the pages of Governor Winthrop s journal which tell of the settlers of Massachusetts Bay On the journey across seas not a child had shown fear or dismayedness Those brave children were welcomed to the shore with good cheer says the old chronicler Joshua Scottow with external flavor and sweet odor fragrant was the land such was the plenty of sweet fern laurel and other fragrant simples such was the scent of our aromatic and balsam bearing pines spruces and larch trees with our tall cedars They landed on a beautiful day in June with a smell on the shore like the smell of a garden and these happy children had gathered sweet wild strawberries and single wild roses It is easy to picture the merry faces and cheerful laughter Scant alas were the succeeding days of either sweetness or light The summer wore on in weary work in which the children had to join in constant fears which the children multiplied and magnified and winter came and death There is not a house where there is not one dead wrote Dudley One little earth weary traveller a child whose family and kindred had dyed so many was like the prophets in the Bible given exalted vision through sorrow and had extraordinary evidence concerning the things of another world Fierce east winds searched the settlers through and through and frosts and snows chilled them The dreary ocean the gloomy forests were their bounds Scant was their fare and mean their roof trees yet amid all the want and cold little children were born and welcomed with that ideality of affection which seems as immortal as the souls of the loved ones Hunger and privation did not last long in the Massachusetts colony for it was a rich community for its day and soon the various settlements grew in numbers and commerce and wealth and an exultant note runs through their records Prosperous peoples will not be morose thanksgiving proclamations reflect the rosy hues of successful years Child life was in harmony with its surroundings it was more cheerful but there was still fearful menace to the life and health of an infant From the moment when the baby opened his eyes on the bleak world around him he had a Spartan struggle for life half the Puritan children had scarce drawn breath in this vale of tears ere they had to endure an ordeal which might well have given rise to the expression the survival of the fittest I say half the babies presuming that half were born in warm weather half in cold All had to be baptized within a few days of birth and baptized in the meeting house fortunate indeed was the child of midsummer We can imagine the January babe carried through the narrow streets or lanes to the freezing meeting house which had grown damper and deadlier with every wintry blast there to be christened when sometimes the ice had to be broken in the christening bowl On January twenty two sixteen ninety four Judge Samuel Sewall of Boston records in his diary A very extraordinary Storm by reason of the falling and driving of Snow Few women could get to Meeting A Child named Alexander was baptized in the afternoon The Judge tells of his own children four days old shrinking from the icy water but crying not It was a cold and disheartening reception these children had into the Puritan church many lingered but a short time therein The mortality among infants was appallingly great they died singly and in little groups and in vast companies Putrid fevers epidemic influenzas malignant sore throats bladders in the windpipe raging small pox carried off hundreds of the children who survived baptism The laws of sanitation were absolutely disregarded because unknown drainage there was none nor deemed necessary disinfection was feebly desired but the scanty sprinkling of vinegar was the only expression of that desire isolation of contagious diseases was proclaimed but the measures were as futile when the disease was known to be contagious as they were lacking in the diseases which our fathers did not know were communicable It is appalling to think what must have been the unbounded production and nurture of disease germs and we can paraphrase with truth the words of Sir Thomas Browne and say of our grandfathers and their children Considering the thousand roads that lead to death I do thank my God they could die but once Illustration Edward Winslow It is heartrending to read the entries in many an old family Bible the records of suffering distress and blasted hopes Until this century these sad stories may be found There lies open before me an old leather bound Bible with the record of my great grandfather s family He had sixteen children When the first child was a year and a half old the second child was born The baby was but four days old when the older child died Five times did that mother s heart bear a similar cruel loss when she had a baby in her arms therefore when she had been nine years married she had one living child and five little graves bore record of her sorrow In the seventeenth century the science of medicine had not wholly cut asunder from astrology and necromancy and the trusting Christian still believed in some occult influences chiefly planetary which governed not only his crops but his health and life Hence the entries of births in the Bible usually gave the hour and minute as well as the day month and year Thus could be accurately calculated what favoring or mischief bearing planets were in ascendency at the time of the child s birth what influences he would have to encounter in life The belief that meteorological and astrological conditions affected medicines was strong in all minds The best physicians gravely noted the condition of the moon when gathering herbs and simples and concocting medicines and certain drugs were held to be powerless at certain times of the year owing to planetary influences Sympathetical medicines were confidingly trusted and tried to a surprising extent upon children apparently these were as beneficial as our modern method of healing by the insinuation of improved health We cannot wonder that children died when we know the nostrums with which they were dosed There were quack medicines which held sway for a century among them a valuable property Daffy s Elixir These patented or rather secret medicines had a formidable rival in snail water which was used as a tonic and also a lotion Many of the ingredients and extracts used in domestic medicines were incredibly revolting Venice treacle was a nasty and popular compound traditionally invented by Nero s physician it was made of vipers white wine opium spices from both the Indies licorice red roses tops of germander and saint John s wort and some twenty other herbs juice of rough sloes mixed with honey triple the weight of all the dry spices The recipe is published in dispensatories till within this century The vipers had to be put twelve of em into white wine alone Mithridate the ancient cure all of King Mithridates was another dose for children There were forty five ingredients in this each prepared and introduced with care Rubila made chiefly of antimony and nitre was beloved of the Winthrops and frequently dispensed by them and with benefit Children were grievously afflicted with rickets though curiously enough it was a new disease not old enough to have received adequate observation in England wrote Sir Thomas Browne in the latter part of the seventeenth century Snails furnished many doses for the rickets Exact instruction of treatment for the rickets is given in a manuscript letter written to reverend Joseph Perry of Windsor Connecticut in seventeen sixty nine reverend D SIR In ye Rickets the best Corrective I have ever found is a Syrup made of Black Cherrys Thus Take of Cherrys dry d ones are as good as any put them into a vessel with water Set ye vessel near ye fire and let ye water be Scalding hot Then take ye Cherrys into a thin Cloth and squeeze them into ye Vessell sweeten ye Liquor with Melosses Give two Spoonfuls of this two or three times in a day If you Dip your Child Do it in this manner viz naked in ye morning head foremost in Cold Water don t dress it Immediately but let it be made warm in ye Cradle sweat at least half an Hour moderately Do this three mornings going if one or both feet are Cold while other Parts sweat which is sometimes ye Case Let a little blood be taken out of ye feet ye second Morning and yt will cause them to sweat afterwards Before ye dips of ye Child give it some Snakeroot and Saffern Steep d in Rum Water give this Immediately before Diping and after you have dipt ye Child three Mornings Give it several times a Day ye following Syrup made of Comfry Hartshorn Red Roses Hog brake roots knot grass petty moral roots sweeten ye Syrup with Melosses Physicians are generally fearful about diping when ye Fever is hard but oftentimes all attemps to lower it without diping are vain Experience has taught me that these fears are groundless yt many have about diping in Rickety Fevers I have found in a multitude of Instances of diping is most effectual means to break a Rickety Fever These Directions are agreable to what I have practiced for many years Among other English notions thrust upon American children was one thus advertised in ante Revolutionary newspapers THE FAMOUS ANODYNE NECKLACE price twenty shillings For children s teeth recommended in England by doctor Chamberlen with a remedy to open and ease the foregums of teething children and bring their teeth safely out Children on the very brink of the Grave and thought past recovery with their teeth fits fevers convulsions hooping and other violent coughs gripes looseness and all proceeding from their teeth who cannot tell what they suffer nor make known their pains any other way but by crying and moans have almost miraculously recovered after having worn the famous Anodyne Necklace but one night s time A mother then would never forgive herself whose child should die for want of so very easy a remedy for its teeth And what is particularly remarkable of this necklace is that of those vast numbers who have had this necklace for their children none have made any complaints but express how glad they have been that their children have worn it whereas if they had not had it they believed their children would have been in the grave all means having been used in vain until they had the necklace These anodyne necklaces were akin to the medicated belts of our own day and were worn as children still wear amber beads to avert the croup Various native berries had restorative and preventive properties when strung as a necklace Uglier decorations were those recommended by Josselyn to New England parents strings of fawn s teeth or wolf s fangs a sure promoter of easy teething He also advised scratching the child s gums with an osprey bone Children died however in spite of these varied charms and doses in vast numbers while teething Illustration Mayflower Cradle owned by the Pilgrim William White There were some feeble expressions of revolt against the horrible doses of the day In sixteen forty seven we hear of the publication of a Most Desperate Booke written against taking of Phissick but it was promptly ordered to be burnt and the doses were continued until well into this century The shadow of their power lingers yet in country homes Many alluring baits were written back to England by the first emigrants to tempt others to follow to the new world Among other considerations Gabriel Thomas made this statement The Christian children born here are generally well favored and beautiful to behold I never knew any to come into the world with the least blemish on any part of the body being in the general observed to be better natured milder and more tender hearted than those born in England John Hammond lavished equal praise on the children in Virginia It was also asserted that the average number of children in a family was larger which is always true in a pioneer settlement in a new country The promise of the Lord is ever fulfilled that he will make the families of his servants in the wilderness like a flock A cheerful home life was insured by these large families when they lived Sir William Phips was one of twenty six children all with the same mother Green the Boston printer had thirty children Another printer Benjamin Franklin was one of a family of seventeen William Rawson had twenty children by one wife reverend Cotton Mather tells us One woman had not less than twenty two children and another had no less than twenty three children by one husband whereof nineteen lived to man s estate and a third was mother to seven and twenty children He himself had fifteen children though but two survived him Other ministers had larger families reverend John Sherman of Watertown Massachusetts had twenty six children by two wives reverend Samuel Willard the first minister of Groton Massachusetts had twenty children and was himself one of seventeen children It is to the honor of these poorly paid ministers that they brought up these large families well reverend Abijah Weld of Attleboro Massachusetts had an annual salary of about two hundred and twenty dollars He had a small farm and a decent house he lived in generous hospitality entertaining many visitors and contributing to the wants of the poor He had fifteen children and reared a grandchild In his fifty five years of service as a minister he was never detained from his duties nor failed to perform them reverend Moses Fiske had sixteen children he sent three sons to college and married off all his daughters his salary was never over ninety pounds and usually but sixty pounds a year paid chiefly in corn and wood One verse of a memorial poem to missus Sarah Thayer reads And one thing more remarkable Which here I shall record She d fourteen children with her At the table of her Lord These large families were eagerly welcomed Children were a blessing The Danish proverb says Children are the poor man s wealth To the farmer especially the frontiersman every child in the home is an extra producer No town in New England had less land to distribute than Boston but on all allotments women and children received their full proportion the early allotments of land in Brookline then part of Boston were made by heads that is according to the number of people in the family It is an interesting study to trace the underlying reason for naming children many of the curious names which were given to the offspring of the first colonists Parents searched for names of deep significance for names appropriate to conditions for those of profound influence presumably on the child s life Glory to God and zealous ambition for the child s future were equally influential in deciding selection Illustration Townes Cradle reverend Richard Buck one of the early parsons in Virginia in days of deep depression named his first child Mara This text indicates the reason for his choice Call me Mara for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me I went out full and the Lord hath brought me home empty His second child was christened Gershom for Moses wife bare him a son and called his name Gershom for he said I have been in a strange land Eber the Hebrew patriarch called his son Peleg for his days were divided mister Buck celebrated the Pelegging or dividing of Virginia into legislative districts by naming his third child Peleg Many names have a pathos and sadness which can be felt down through the centuries Dame Dinely widow of a doctor or barber surgeon who had died in the snow while striving to visit a distant patient named her poor babe Fathergone A little Goodman child born after the death of her father was sadly but trustingly named Abiel God is my father Seaborn was the name indicative of the introduction into life of one of my own ancestors In the old Ropes Bible in Salem is given the reason for an unusual name which often appears in that family it is Seeth One of the family was supposed to be dead having disappeared On his sudden reappearance a pious Ropes exclaimed in joy The Lord seeth not as man seeth and my child shall be named Seeth An early example of the name is Seeth Grafton who became the wife of Thomas Gardner in sixteen thirty six Judge Sewall named one son Joseph In hopes of the accomplishment of the Prophecy of Ezekiel xxxvii and such and not out of respect to any Relation or any other Person except the first Joseph Judge Sewall again made an entry in his diary after a christening I named my little Daughter Sarah mister Torrey said call her Sarah and make a Madam of her I was struggling whether to call her Mehetable or Sarah But when I saw Sarah s standing in the Scripture viz Peter Galatians Hebrews Romans I resolv d on that suddenly Abigail meaning father s joy was also frequently given and Hannah meaning grace the history of these two Hebrew women made their names honored of New England Puritans Zurishaddai the Almighty is my rock was bestowed on more than one boy Comfort Deliverance Temperance Peace Hope Patience Charity Faith Love Submit Endurance Silence Joy Rejoice Hoped for and similar

Believe and Tremble With the exception of Puritanical names double Christian names were very rare until after the Revolution as may be seen by examining any document with many signatures such for instance as the Declaration of Independence or the lists of officers and men in the Continental Army Return Jonathan Meigs was a notable exception There exists in New England a tradition of groaning cakes being made and baked at the birth of a child to give to visitors I have found no record of it The Frenchman Misson in his Travels in England says At the birth of their children they visitors drink a glass of wine and eat a bit of a certain cake which is seldom made but upon these occasions Anna Green Winslow a Boston schoolgirl tells of making what she calls a setting up visit to a relative who had a baby about four weeks old She wore her best and most formal attire and says It cost me a pistareen to Nurse Eaton for two cakes which I took care to eat before I paid for them There certainly was a custom of giving money clothing or petty trinkets to the nurse at such visits Judge Sewall frequently writes of these vails which he made at the house of his friends He writes in one case of brewing groaning beer and in his household were held two New England amphidromia The midwife nurses and all the neighboring women who had helped with work or advice during the early days of the child s life were bidden to a dinner One Sewall baby was scarcely two weeks old when seventeen women dined at the Judge s house on boiled pork beef and fowls roast beef and turkey pies and tarts At another time minc d Pyes and cheese were added Judge Winthrop s sister Madam Downing furnished sack and claret also A survival of this custom lasted till this century in the drinking of caudle by the bedside of the mother A pincushion was for many years and indeed is still in some parts of New England a highly conventional gift to a mother with a young babe Poor Robin s Almanack for the year sixteen seventy six says Pincushions and such other knacks A childbed woman always lacks Illustration pincushion I have seen in different families five of precisely the same pattern and size all made about the time of the Revolution One given to a Boston baby while his new home was in state of siege bore the inscription Welcome little Stranger tho the Port is closed These words were formed by the heads of pins Another about five inches long and three inches wide is of green figured silk with a flowered vine stuck in pins and the words John Winslow March seventeen eighty three Welcome Little Stranger Anna Green Winslow tells of her aunts making one with a planthorn of flowers and the name I have seen one with similar inscription knitted of fine silk and with the name sewed on in steel beads among which pins were stuck in a graceful pattern Illustration Indian Cradle The seventeenth century baby slept as his nineteenth century descendant does in a cradle Nothing could be prettier than the old cradles that have survived successive years of use with many generations of babies In Pilgrim Hall still may be seen the quaint and finely wrought wicker cradle of Peregrine White the first white child born in Plymouth This cradle is of Dutch manufacture and is one of the few authentic articles still surviving that came over on the Mayflower It was brought over by William White whose widow married Governor Edward Winslow A similar wicker cradle may be seen at the Essex Institute in Salem together with a heavy wooden cradle in which many members of the Townes family of Topsfield Massachusetts were rocked to sleep two centuries ago Judge Sewall bought a wicker cradle for one of his many children and paid sixteen shillings for it A graceful variant of the swinging cradle is shown in the Indian basket hung at either end from a wooden standard or frame In this strong basket fashioned by an Indian mother many a white child has been swung and sung to sleep A still more picturesque cradle was made of birch bark that plentiful material so widely adaptive to household uses and so deftly manipulated and shaped by the patient squaws In these cradles the colonial baby slept warmly wrapped in a homespun blanket or pressed quilt Poor Robin s Almanack for the year sixteen seventy six enumerates among a baby s outfit Blanckets of a several scantling Therein for to wrap a bantling Of these wraps of the thinner sort may be named the thin close woven homespun flannel sheet spun of the whitest wool into a fine twisted worsted and woven with a close sley into an even web as enduring as the true Oriental cashmere The baby s initials were often marked on these sheets and fortunate was the child who had the light warm wrappings My own children had flannel sheets that had seen a century or more of use with generations of forbears Illustration Governor Bradford s Christening Blanket fifteen ninety A finer coverlet one of state the christening blanket was usually made of silk richly embroidered sometimes with a text of Scripture These were often lace bordered or edged with a narrow home woven silk fringe The christening blanket of Governor Bradford of the Plymouth Colony still exists whole of fabric and unfaded of dye It is a rich crimson silk soft of texture like a heavy sarcenet silk and is powdered at regular distances about six inches apart with conventional sprays of flowers embroidered chiefly in pink and yellow in minute and beautiful cross stitch It is distinctly Oriental in appearance far more so than is indicated by its black and white representation here Another beautiful silk christening blanket was quilted in an intricate flower pattern in almost imperceptible stitches These formal wrappings of state were sometimes called bearing cloths or clothes and served through many generations Shakespeare speaks in Henry VI of a child s bearing cloth A go cart or standing stool was a favorite instrument to teach a child to walk A standing stool a century old in which Newburyport babies stood and toddled is a rather crude frame of wood with a ledge or narrow table for toys The method of using a go cart is shown in this old print taken from a child s book called Little Prattle over a Book of Prints published for sixpence in eighteen oh one In the writers of Queen Anne s day frequent references are made to go carts Illustration Standing Stool I find strong evidence that Locke s Thoughts on Education published in England in sixteen ninety found many readers and ardent followers in the new world The book is in many old time library lists in New England and among the scant volumes of those who had but a single book shelf or book box I have seen abstracts and transpositions of his precepts on the pages of almanacs the most universally circulated and studied of all eighteenth century books save the Bible In contemporary letters evidence is found of the influence of Locke s principles In the prefaces of Thomas reprints he is quoted and eulogized The notions of the English philosopher appealed to American parents because they were as the author said the consideration not what a physician ought to do with a sick or crazy child but what parents without the help of physic should do for the preservation of an healthy constitution Crazy here is used in the old time sense of feeble bodily health not mental In these days of hundreds of books on child study education child culture and kindred topics it is a distinct pleasure to read Locke s sturdy sentences to see how wise and kindly and logical he was in nearly all his advices especially on moral or ethical questions Even those on physical conditions that seem laughably obsolete to day were so in advance of the general practices of his day that they are farther removed from the notions of his time than from those of ours In judging them let us remember doctor Holmes lines Little of all we value here Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year Without both looking and feeling queer Certainly an existence of two centuries may make us pardon a little queerness in advice One of Locke s instructions much thought on in the years his book was so widely read was the advice to wash the child s feet daily in cold water and to have his shoes so thin that they might leak and let in water Josiah Quincy was the suffering subject of some of this instruction when only three years old he was taken from his warm bed in winter as well as summer and this in Eastern Massachusetts carried downstairs to a cellar kitchen and dipped three times in a tub of cold water fresh from the pump He was also brought up with utter indifference to wet feet he said that in his boyhood he sat more than half the time with his feet wet and cold but with no ill results Locke also strongly counselled learning dancing swimming and playing in the open air In his diet flesh should be forborn as long as the boy is in coats or at least till he is two or three years old for breakfast and supper he advises milk milk pottage water gruel flummery and similar spoon meat or brown bread with cheese If the boy called for victuals between meals he should have dry bread His only extra drink should be small beer which should be warm and seldom he should taste wine or strong drink Locke would not have children eat melons peaches plums or grapes while berries and ripe pears and apples the latter especially after October he deems healthful The bed should be hard of quilts rather than of feathers Under these rigid rules were reared many of our Revolutionary heroes and statesmen Illustration De Peyster Twins The adoption of Locke s ideas about the use of cold water or indeed of any frequent bathing was perhaps the most radical innovation in modes of living The English never bathed in our sense of the word a complete immersion nor I suppose did our Puritan Cavalier or Quaker ancestors Sewall makes not one reference to anything of the kind but that is not strange nor is his omission any proof negative or positive for he refers to no personal habits and very shortly and infrequently to dress Pepys the courtier and dandy tells of rare monumental occasions when he cleaned himself far too rare we may judge from side lights thrown by other of his statements The Youth s Behavior an old time book of etiquette lays down an assertion that it is a point of wholesomeness to wash one s face and hands as soon as one is up and dressed and to comb one s head in time and season yet not too curiously Bathing the person in unaccustomed spots was a ticklish proceeding a water ordeal to be gravely considered Mistress Alice Thornton a Yorkshire dame records in her account of her life one occasion when she washed her feet but she was overbold Which my mother did believe it was the cause of that dangerous fitt the next day In the Verney volumes we find that forlorn Verney boy poor sickly Mun wearing a harness for his crooked back till his shirt was black when the famous surgeon changed the harness and Mun his shirt with no thought on the part of either of a bath being a necessity Illustration Go Cart In sixteen thirty a ship was sent from England to Massachusetts which was provisioned for three months Among the stores for the passengers use were two casks of Malaga and Canary twenty gallons of aqua vitae forty five tuns of beer and for drinking washing cooking bathing et cetera but six tuns of water The ships sent out to Georgia by Oglethorpe were so scantily supplied with water that it is positive no fresh water could have been used for bathing even in minute amount The reputation of hidden malevolence which hung around water as a beverage seems to have extended to its use in any form It was believed to be permeated with minute noxious particles which in those ante bacteriological days could not be explained but which were distinctly appreciated and dreaded But these be parlous words Let us rather show some sympathy for our ancestors We bathe in well warmed rooms often in cold water but with steaming hot water in ample command at a turn of the hand Had we to carry all the water for our bathing use from a well whence we laboriously raised it in small amounts and were we forced to bathe in an icy atmosphere with cutting draughts striking us on every side with the basins of water freezing on the hearth in front of a blazing fire and the juices of the wood freezing at the ends of burning logs we might not deem our daily bath such an indispensable necessity We have heard an advanced thinker like Locke suggest brown bread cheese and warm beer as food for young children What then must have been the notions of less thoughtful folk Doubtless in England such food would have been simple but in the new world less beer was drank and more milk which must have proved the salvation of American children And the plentiful and varied cereal foods many of them from Indian corn were a suitable diet for young children Samp hominy suppawn pone succotash all Indian foods and cooked in Indian ways were found in every home in every colony Baked beans another Indian dish were also good food for children Native and domestic fruits were plentiful but with the exception of apples and pears were not very attractive The succession of summer s and autumn s berries must have been eagerly welcomed They were in the rich and spicy plenty offered by a virgin soil A curious rare and quaintly named English book is owned by Earl Spencer Its title runs thus Dyves Pragmaticus A booke in English metre of the great

aught unto thy neighbour or byest anything of him deceave not nor oppress him et cetera Imprinted at London in Aldersgate strete by Alexander Lacy dwellynge beside the Wall The XXV of Aprill fifteen sixty three It contains a list of sweetmeats for the enticement of children which may be confidently relied on as a full one if we can judge by the exhaustiveness of the lists of other commodities found in the poem I have Sucket Surrip Grene Ginger and Marmalade Bisket Cumfet and Carraways as fine as can be made A sucket was a dried sweetmeat such as candied orange peel A caraway was a sweet cake with caraway seeds Apples and caraways were a favorite dish still served at some of the anniversary feasts of English universities Comfits were highly flavored often scented with strong perfumes like musk and bergamot Sweetmeats appear to have been plentiful in the colonies from early days The first native poet of New England wrote complainingly as early as sixteen seventy five that From western isles now fruits and delicacies Do rot maids teeth and spoil their handsome faces Ships in the Indian trade brought to the colonies abundance of sugar molasses chocolate ginger and other dried fruits These were apparently far more common here than in England mister Ernst says these constant relays of sweets produced the American sweet tooth a wonder Candied eringo root candied lemon peel angelica candy as well as caraway comfits and sugared coriander seed and dried ginger were advertised for sale in Boston and show the taste of the day In seventeen thirty one Widow Bonyet had a notice of her specialties in the Boston News Letter It has quite the modern ring in its meat jellies for the sick and home made preserves jellies and sirups She also made those ancient sweets macaroons marchpanes and crisp almonds These latter do not appear to be the glazed and burnt almonds of the confectioner and may have been salted almonds The only candy Sewall refers to is sugared almonds He frequently speaks of gifts of oranges figs and raisins of the sun Raisins were brought into all the colonial ports in vast amounts and were until this century regarded by children as a great dainty Each large city seems to have had some special confectioner or baker who was renowned for special cakes Boston had Meer s cakes New York children probably had the greatest variety of cookies crullers and various small cakes as these were distinctly Dutch and the Dutch vrouws excelled in cake making Strings of rock candy came from China but were rivalled by a distinctly native sweet maple sugar Equally American appear to us those Salem sweets namely Black Jacks and Salem Gibraltars Base imitations appeared elsewhere but never equalled the original delights in Salem Children who were fortunate enough to live in coast towns reaped the sweet fruits of their fathers foreign ventures When a ship came into port with eighty boxes of sugar candy on board and sixty tubs of rock candy poor indeed was the child who was not surfeited with sweets There was a sequel however to the toothsome feast a bitter dessert The ship that brought eighty boxes of sugar candy also fetched a hundred boxes of rhubarb and ten of senna CHAPTER II CHILDREN S DRESS Man s earthly Interests are all hooked and buttoned together and held up by Clothes Sartor Resartus Thomas Carlyle eighteen thirty three Of the dress of infants of colonial times we can judge from the articles of clothing which have been preserved till this day Perhaps I should say that we can judge of the better garments worn by babies not their everyday dress for it is not their simpler attire that has survived but their christening robes their finer shirts and petticoats and caps Linen formed the chilling substructure of their dress thin linen low necked short sleeved shirts and linen even formed the underwear of infants until the middle of this century These little linen shirts are daintier than the warmest silk or fine woollen underwear that have succeeded them they are edged with fine narrow thread lace hemstitched with tiny rows of stitches and sometimes embroidered by hand I have seen a little shirt and a cap embroidered with the coat of arms of the Lux and Johnson families and the motto God bless the Babe these delicate garments were worn in infancy by the Revolutionary soldier Governor Johnson of Virginia Illustration Baptismal Shirt and Mittens of Governor Bradford fifteen ninety In the Essex Institute in Salem Massachusetts are the baptismal shirt and mittens of the Pilgrim Father William Bradford second governor of the Plymouth Colony who was born in fifteen ninety All are of firm close woven homespun linen but the little mittens have been worn at the ends by the active friction of baby hands and are patched with colored chiney or calico A similar colored material frills the sleeves and neck A pair of baby s mitts of fine lace also may be seen at the Essex Institute These were wrought in the sixteenth century and the stitches and work are those of the antique Flanders laces I have seen many tiny mitts knit of silk and mittens of fine linen hemstitched worked in drawn work or embroidered and edged with thread lace and also a few mitts of yellow nankeen which must have proved specially irritating to the tiny little hands that wore them I have never seen a woollen petticoat that was worn by an infant of pre Revolutionary days It may be argued that woollen garments being liable to ruin by moths would naturally not be treasured This argument scarcely is one of force because I have been shown infants cloaks of wool as well as woollen garments for older folk that have been successfully preserved also beautifully embroidered long cloaks of chamois skin I think infants wore no woollen petticoats their shirts petticoats and gowns were of linen or some cotton stuff like dimity Warmth of clothing was given by tiny shawls pinned round the shoulders and heavier blankets and quilts and shawls in which baby and petticoats were wholly enveloped Illustration Robert Gibbs Four and a Half Years Old sixteen seventy The baby dresses of olden times are either rather shapeless sacques drawn in at the neck with narrow cotton ferret or linen bobbin or little straight waisted gowns of state All were exquisitely made by hand and usually of fine stuff But the babies in pioneer settlements a century ago had to share in wearing homespun It is told of one in a log cabin in a New Hampshire clearing that when the grandmother rode out eighty miles on horseback to see her son s first baby she shed bitter tears at beholding the child but a few months old clad in a gray woollen homespun slip with an apron or tier of blue and white checked linen The mother a frontier lass dressed the infant according to the fashions she was accustomed to Nothing could show so fully the costume of children in olden times as their portraits and a series of such portraits of successive dates will be given in these pages Many of them are asserted to be by the three well known artists of colonial days Blackburn Smibert and Copley a few are by Peale Trumbull and Stuart I have accepted all family traditions as true and in many cases believe them to be true especially since there were few painters of any rank in the community and no others who could paint portraits such as those which have been preserved The Gilbert Stuarts and Trumbulls usually have some authentic pedigree Many of these pictures have no artist s signature and are absolutely valueless as works of art and probably meritless as likenesses but as records of costume they are always of interest and historical worth There is a certain sweetness in some of these old time portraits they are stiff and flat but some of them have a quaintness that reminds me of the angels of the early Florentine painters They have little grace of figure but the details of costume make them pleasing even if they are not beautiful The first child s portrait in this series is one of extraordinary interest It is opposite page four and has never before been given to the public It is the reputed miniature of the Pilgrim Father Governor Edward Winslow when a boy about six years of age which would be in sixteen oh two it is the only miniature in existence of any of the Pilgrims at any age I have in deference to the wishes of the reverend doctor William Copley Winslow of Boston to whom I am indebted for it entitled it the reputed miniature of the child Edward Winslow though the term expresses neither his belief nor mine and seems scarcely just to a portrait whose claims to authenticity are far more definite than those of many of the family portraits that have descended to us Illustration Infant s Mitts sixteenth Century The miniature came to doctor Winslow from missus Hersey of Pembroke Massachusetts She died at the age of eighty six Her grandfather assured her that his father the famous General John Winslow received the likeness from his father the grandson of Edward the Pilgrim and that it was the Pilgrim s likeness as a child This through long lived Winslows is a record of few retellings and these were told by folk to be trusted The Winslows were gentlefolk of ample means such as were likely to have miniatures painted and the portrait of Governor Winslow when fifty six years of age now in Pilgrim Hall Plymouth is the sole one save this miniature of any of the Pilgrims Other strong evidence is the extraordinary resemblance of the child s picture to the grown up portrait the same brow contour of face and other similarity There is something in the child s portrait that is singularly suggestive to any one with any historical imagination The simplicity of the dress and arrangement of the hair show the influence of Puritanism As I look at it I can fancy yes I can plainly see some little English children twenty years later standing on that crowded historic ship looking back with childish serenity at the home they were leaving and then greeting as cheerfully and trustingly the sad Plymouth where they disembarked and the faces that I see have the broad brow the flowing hair the bared neck and simple dress shown in this miniature The next portrait which faces the title page shows the costume worn in sixteen ninety by a boy a year or two old it is a charming and quaint picture of the first John Quincy who was born in sixteen eighty nine and who when dying in seventeen sixty seven gave his name to his great grandson John Quincy Adams who had just been born Some have thought the picture that of a sister Esther Quincy but to me it has a hard little boy s face not the features of a delicate girl and also a boy s hands and a boy s toy Children in America if gentlefolk dressed just as children did in England at that date and boys wore coats in England till they were six or seven One of the most charming of all grandmothers letters was written by a doting English grandmother to her son Lord Chief Justice North telling of the leaving off of coats of his motherless little son Francis Guildford then six years old The letter is dated October ten sixteen seventy nine DEAR SON You cannot beleeve the great concerne that was in the whole family here last Wednesday it being the day that the taylor was to helpe to dress little ffrank in his breeches in order to the making an everyday suit by it Never had any bride that was to be drest upon her weding night more handes about her some the legs some the armes the taylor butt ning and others putting on the sword and so many lookers on that had I not a ffinger amongst I could not have seen him When he was quite drest he acted his part as well as any of them for he desired he might goe downe to inquire for the little gentleman that was there the day before in a black coat and speak to the man to tell the gentleman when he came from school that there was a gallant with very fine clothes and a sword to have waited upon him and would come again upon Sunday next But this was not all there was great contrivings while he was dressing who should have the first salute but he sayd if old Joan had been here she should but he gave it to me to quiett them all They were very fitt everything and he looks taller and prettyer than in his coats Little Charles rejoyced as much as he did for he jumpt all the while about him and took notice of everything I went to Bury and bo t everything for another suitt which will be finisht on Saturday so the coats are to be quite left off on Sunday I consider it is not yett terme time and since you could not have the pleasure of the first sight I resolved you should have a full relation from Yo r most aff nate Mother A NORTH When he was drest he asked Buckle whether muffs were out of fashion because they had not sent him one This affectionate letter written to a great and busy statesman the Lord Keeper of the Seals shows how pure and delightful domestic life in England could be but the writer was not a commonplace woman she was the mother of fourteen children and had had years of experience with a father in law before whom an army of traditional mothers in law would pale She lived through this ordeal and a trying marital experience and her children rose up and called her blessed Among her virtues her son Roger dilated at length upon her delightful letter writing her freedom of style and matter and declared that her letters were among the comforts of her children s lives Illustration Jane Bonner Eight Years Old seventeen hundred To return to the dress of John Quincy with the exception of the neck of the body of the frock it is much like the dress of grown women of that day We have existing portraits of Madam Shimpton and Rebecca Rawson of the same date In both of these as in this little boy s portrait the sleeve is the most noticeable feature with its single slash double puff drawn in below the elbow and confined with pretty ribbon knots This sleeve was known as the virago sleeve and John Quincy s are darker colored than his frock All three wear loosely tied rather shapeless hoods such as are seen on the women in the prints of the coronation procession of King William The boy has a close cap under his hood His dress is certainly picturesque and distinctive A portrait facing page thirty six of another Massachusetts boy contemporary with John Quincy is that of Robert Gibbs the rich Boston merchant This is plainly marked as being painted when he was four and a half years old and with the date sixteen seventy He wears the same stiff cuirass as John Quincy the same odd truncated shoes of buff leather and has the same masculine swing of the petticoats Both figures stand on a checker board floor four squares deep with their toes at the same point on the board Robert Gibbs wears a more boyish collar or band as befits a bigger boy The sleeves are an important feature of his dress having a pair of long hanging sleeves bordered with fur which do not show in the print in this book but are plainly visible in the original portrait Hanging sleeves were so distinctively the dress of a little child that the term had at that time a symbolic significance implying childishness both of youth and second childhood Pepys thus figuratively employs the term Judge Sewall wrote in old age to a brother whose widowed sister he desired to marry I remember when I was going from school at Newbury to have sometime met your sisters Martha and Mary in Hanging Sleeves coming home from their school in Chandlers Lane and have had the pleasure of speaking to them And I could find it in my heart now to speak to missus Martha again now I myself am reduc d to Hanging Sleeves This roundabout wooing came to naught The Judge married Widow Mary Gibbs relict of this very Robert Gibbs whose childish portrait we have here The artist who painted this picture may have been Tom Child who is named by Judge Sewall as the portrait painter of that day A demure and quaint portrait opposite page forty two is that of Jane Bonner She was born in sixteen ninety one the daughter of Captain John Bonner of Boston and was married in seventeen ten to John Ellery She was about eight or ten years old when the portrait was painted Crude as is the painting it gives evident proof that the lace of the stomacher and sleeve frills is of the nature of what is now called rose point In the early settlements of Connecticut Massachusetts and Virginia sumptuary laws were passed to restrain and attempt to prohibit extravagance in dress The New England magistrates were curiously minute in description of overluxurious attire and many offenders were tried and fined But vain daughters and sons psisted in fflonting though ministers joined the lawmakers in solemn warnings and reprehensions Young girls were fined for silk hoods and immoderate great sleeves and boldly appeared in court in still richer attire The Dutch never attempted or wished to simplify the dress of either men or women In New York dress was ample substantial varied in texture and variegated in color It ever formed a considerable item in personal property The children of the Dutch settlers had plentiful and warm clothing and sometimes very rich clothing as may be seen in the quaint and interesting picture facing page twenty six of twin girls the two daughters of Abraham De Peyster of New York and his wife Margaret Van Cortlandt They are dressed in red velvet trained gowns but are barefooted They were born December three seventeen twenty four and Eva died in seventeen twenty nine a month after the portrait was painted Catherine was married on her eighteenth birthday to John Livingstone son of the second lord of the manor Their son had a daughter Catherine who became the wife of Don Mariano Velasquez de la Cadenas To their daughters missus Azoy and Miss Mariana Velasquez this interesting portrait now belongs Illustration Infant s Robe Cap and Christening Blanket The mother of these twins was the daughter of Jacobus Van Cortlandt and Eva De Vries Philipse The names of Eva and Catherine have ever been given to the little daughters of these allied families and are borne to day by many of their descendants Another little girl of Dutch blood was Cathalina Post who married Zegor Van Santvoord Her portrait was painted in seventeen fifty when she was fourteen years old and is now owned by doctor Van Santvoord of Kingston on Hudson New York A copy of this quaint old picture faces page two hundred four It is most interesting in costume the head gear showing distinct Dutch influence There is a suggestion of earrings in this portrait and Katherine Ten Broeck another child of Dutch blood but three years old wears earrings The reproduction of her portrait given opposite page one hundred ninety two shows these jewels but dimly but they are visible in the original oil painting She was born in Albany in seventeen fifteen The portrait is marked AEtat s Sua three Years seventeen nineteen She was married to John Livingstone and lived to become a stately old dame receiving formally on New Year s Day her grandchildren who always greeted her in Dutch learned for the special occasion The devastations of two wars and in some localities three destruction by fire and earthquake have sadly destroyed the cherished relics of many southern homes From missus saint Julian Ravenel of Charleston South Carolina the delightful biographer of that delightful colonial dame Eliza Lucas Pinckney come two portraits of children of the Huguenot settlers The picture facing page forty eight of Ellinor Cordes of saint John s Berkeley County South Carolina painted about seventeen forty shows a lovely little child of French features and French daintiness of dress albeit a bright yellow brocaded satin would seem rather gorgeous attire for a girl but two years old Opposite page fifty is a picture of Daniel Ravenel of Wantoot saint John s Berkeley County South Carolina who was born in seventeen sixty and was about five years old when this portrait was painted though he still wears what might be termed a frock with petticoats there is a decided boyishness in the waistcoat with its silver buttons and lace and the befrogged overcoat with broad cuffs and wrist ruffles and a turned over revers and narrow linen inner collar It is an exceptionally pleasing boy s dress for a little child Two portraits of Flagg children painted it is said by Smibert must be among his latest portraits for the baby Polly Flagg was born in Boston in seventeen fifty and Smibert died in seventeen fifty one The portrait facing page one hundred eighty four shows as may be seen a dear little baby not a year old in baby dress and cap clasping a toy It is marked on the back missus Polly Hurd for the little girl lived to be the wife and widow of doctor Wilder of Lancaster Massachusetts and of doctor Hurd of Concord Massachusetts Of equal interest is the severely beautiful face of James Flagg her brother shown opposite page one hundred eighty eight He was born in seventeen thirty nine and was still coats when this portrait was painted These portraits are owned by missus Albert Thorndike of Boston Massachusetts the great granddaughter of Griselda Apthorpe Flagg the sister of these two children Illustration Ellinor Cordes Two Years Old seventeen forty The portrait of Jonathan Mountfort given opposite page fifty eight has a special interest to the art student since it is a specimen of Copley s early work The boy was born December six seventeen forty six and was seven years old when the portrait was painted He married Mary Bole a Newfoundland girl whose father sent her to a school in Halifax under the charge of Captain Shepherd of Medford Massachusetts Finding Halifax in a state of blockade the captain took the little girl to Boston He and his wife were childless and became deeply attached to her and finally adopted her She became engaged to doctor Mountfort and went to visit her parents in Ireland whither they had removed On her return bringing with her the gifts wardrobe and household furnishings of a bride of that period she came into Boston harbor only to be wrecked in sight of the town The ship s mate swam with her to the lighthouse and the two were the only ones saved Captain Shepherd gave her a house and fresh outfit and she married doctor Mountfort They had seven children but the name of Mountfort is now extinct Their daughter Elizabeth married Major Thomas Pitts whose daughter is now missus Farlin of Detroit Michigan the present owner of this interesting portrait Illustration Daniel Ravenel Five Years Old seventeen sixty five An altogether charming group of children facing page fifty four two sisters and two brothers of Governor Christopher Gore seventh governor of Massachusetts was painted about the year seventeen fifty four by Copley The mature little girl of this picture Frances married Thomas Crafts colonel of the regiment of which Paul Revere was lieutenant colonel in the Revolution Colonel and missus Crafts were the great grandparents of the present owners Miss Julia G Robins and Miss Susan P B Robins This picture was for a time in the Boston Museum of Art and on returning it General Loring wrote I shall miss the little grown ups were there no children in those days This look of maturity seems universal to all these portraits I have photographs of several other groups of children one of the most charming that of the Grymes children now in the Capitol at Richmond Virginia but they are all too darkened with age to admit of proper or adequate reproduction and must be left out of these pages The baby in the Grymes group is truly a baby not a grown up Illustration Child s Shoes The handsomest of all the boy portraits of colonial days is that of Samuel Pemberton by Blackburn it is perfect in feature and expression though he is but twelve years old he wears a wig It was painted in seventeen thirty six and boys of good family then wore costly wigs mister Freeman of Portland Maine had in his book of expenses of the year seventeen fifty such items as these Shaving my three sons at sundry times Lfive fourteen s Expenses for James Wig nine Samuel s Wig nine The three sons Samuel James and William were aged eleven nine and seven years The shaving was of their heads Slaves of fashion were parents of that day to bedeck their boys with such rich wigs A more exquisite portrait than that of Thomas Aston Coffin opposite page two hundred twenty two can scarcely be found It is painted in Copley s best manner shown in the highest perfection in the portrait of his daughter Elizabeth A light hued satin petticoat front shows under a rich full skirted satin over dress which brushes the ground The pretty satin sleeves have white under sleeves and wrist ruffles but the neck is cut very low and round The child holds two pigeons by a leash and a feathered hat is by his side This portrait was much loved by its late owner Miss Anne S Robbins of Boston This charming picture of the Pepperell children facing page two hundred fourteen was believed to be by Copley and included in mister Perkins list At present this authorship is doubted It is owned by Miss Alice Longfellow of Cambridge having been bought by her father the poet from the owner of the Portsmouth Museum who had in some singular way acquired it The children are William son of the second Sir William Pepperell and his sister Elizabeth Royal Pepperell who married reverend Henry Hutton A bright eyed little girl Mary Lord has her portrait given opposite page sixty six hanging in the rooms of the Connecticut Historical Society She was born in seventeen oh two in Hartford Connecticut and married in seventeen twenty four Colonel Joseph Pitkin of Hartford By her side hangs the picture of Colonel Wadsworth and his son shown opposite page three hundred sixteen It is the one which the artist Trumbull took to Sir Joshua Reynolds for advice and comment He was snubbed with the snappish criticism that the coat looked like bent tin Other criticism might be made on the anatomical proportions of the subjects Copley s genius is shown in the fine portrait of William Verstile facing page two hundred ten painted in seventeen sixty nine There is one little glimpse of this boy s boyhood which has so human an element is so fully in touch with modern life that I give it It is from an old letter written by his mother during a visit in Boston where possibly this very portrait was painted It shows the beginning of tastes which found ample scope in his services in the war of the Revolution BOSTON June eleven seventeen sixty six My Dear these leaves me and my friends as I hope they will find you for health I was obliged to stay a fortnight as I didn t set out till the middle of the week from Weathersfield was obliged to tarry here a fortnight on account of coming

coming up as mister Hide tells me Billey may ride behind him if he s a mind to Billey became a portrait painter himself and got four guineas apiece for his miniatures He early showed artistic predilections and these tastes were well supplied Interspersed with pumps and hose and hats for Billey are found in his father s purchases brass deviders scales books for limning two dozen hair pencils and one box painter s collurs on glass which cost twelve shillings Illustration Gore Children seventeen fifty four I don t know who taught Billey limning There was a funny book in circulation among students in that day It was written in serious intent but its rules read as though they were dictated by Oliver Herford It was entitled Every Young Man s Companion in Drawing Here are a few of its instructions to young artists Make your outlines which may be mended occasionally From the Elbow to the Root of the Little Finger is Two Noses The Thumb contains a Nose The Inside of Arm to Middle of Arm is Four Noses The crowning glory of the Copley portraits is the charming family group opposite page one hundred eighty depicting Copley himself his beautiful wife his dignified father in law and his lovely children It is now exhibited in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts This group seems perfect and the quaint figure of the child Elizabeth Copley in the foreground is worthy the brush of Van Dyck Colonel John Lewis one of the old Virginia gentlemen had two child wards As befitted young gentlefolk of that day of opulence and extravagance they had their dress from England In seventeen thirty six when Robert Carter the younger child was about nine years old suits of fine holland laced and of red worsted and of green German serge came across seas for him with laced hats with loops and buttons When he was twelve years old part of his winter cloathes were six pair of shoes and two of pumps four pair of worked hose and four of thread hose gloves hats and shoe buckles His sister Betty had a truly fashionable wardrobe and the stiff restrictive dress of the times was indicated by the items of stays hoops masks and fans When Miss Custis was but four years old George Washington ordered for her from England packthread stays stiffened coats a large number of gloves and masks An order for purchases sent to a London agent by Washington in seventeen sixty one contains a full list of garments for both his step children Miss Custis was then six years old These are some of the items one Coat made of Fashionable Silk A Fashionable Cap or fillet with Bib apron Ruffles and Tuckers

shown opposite page two hundred fifty While the dress of both children is mature it is not so elegant as might be expected from the rich garments which were imported for them Sir William Pepperell ordered in seventeen thirty seven equally costly and formal clothing from England for his little daughter to disport at Piscataquay Stays and masks are ever on the lists of little gentlewomen A letter of the day tells of seeing the youthful daughter of Governor Tryon sitting stiffly in a chair in broad lace collar with heavy dress never playing running or even walking Delicacy of figure and whiteness of complexion were equal fetiches with colonial mammas Little Dolly Payne afterward Dolly Madison wore long gloves a linen mask and had a sunbonnet sewed on her head every morning by her devoted mother Very thin shoes of silk morocco or light stuff unfitted little girls for any very active exercise these were high heeled A tiny pair of shoes for a little girl of three are shown on page fifty one I have seen children s stays made of heavy strips of board and steel tightly wrought with heavy buckram or canvas into an iron frame like an instrument of torture These had been worn by a little girl five years old Staymakers advertised stays jumps gazzets costrells and caushets which were doubtless corsets for ladies and children to make them appear strait And I have been told of tin corsets for little girls but I have never seen any such abominations One pair of stays was labelled as having been worn by a boy when five years old There certainly is a suspicious suggestion in some of these little fellows portraits of whalebone and buckram In the sprightly descriptions given by Anna Green Winslow of her own dress we see with much distinctness the little girl of twelve of the year seventeen seventy one I was dress d in my yellow coat my black bib apron my pompedore shoes the cap my aunt Storer sometime since presented me with blue ribbins on it a very handsome loket in the shape of a hart the paste pin my honorable d Papa presented me with in my cap my new cloak bonnet on my pompedore gloves and I would tell you they all lik d my dress very much I was dress d in my

two or three yards of blue ribbin striped tucker ruffels my silk shoes compleated my dress Illustration Jonathan Mountfort Seven Years Old seventeen fifty three It would seem somewhat puzzling to fancy how with a little girl s soft hair the astonishing and varied head gear named above could be attached Little Anna gives a full description of the way her hair was dressed over a high roll so heavy and hot that it made her head itch ach burn like anything She tells of the height of her head gear When it first came home Aunt put it on my new cap on it she then took up her apron measur d me from the roots of my hair on my forehead to the top of my notions I measur d above an inch longer than I did downwards from the roots of my hair to the end of my chin Her picture shown facing page one hundred sixty four is taken from a miniature painted when she was a few years older The roll is more modest in size and the decorations are fewer in number Each year the head equipage diminished till cropped heads were seen with a shock of tight curls on the forehead an incredibly disfiguring mode In the chapter upon the school life of girls a letter is given describing the dress of two young girls who were boarding in Boston while they were being taught There is no doubt that very rich dress was desired and possibly required of these young scholar boarders The oft quoted letter in regard to Miss Huntington s wardrobe shows the elegance of dress of those schoolgirls She had twelve silk gowns but word was sent home to Norwich that a recently imported rich fabric was most suitable for her rank and station and in answer to the teacher s request the parents ordered the purchase of this elegant dress When cotton fabrics from Oriental countries became everywhere and every time worn children s dress as likewise that of grown folk was much reduced in elegance as it was in warmth Hoops disappeared and heavy petticoats also the soft slimsy clinging stuffs suitable only for summer wear were not discarded in winter Boys wore nankeen suits the entire year Calico and chintz were fashioned into trousers and jackets A little suit is shown facing page sixty made of figured calico of high colors which it is stated was worn in seventeen eighty four The labels are very exact and the labellers very cautious of the Deerfield Memorial Hall collection else I should assign this suit to a ten or even twenty years later date Children must have suffered sadly with the cold in this age of cotton Girls dresses were half low necked and were filled in with a thin tucker separate sleeves were tied in at the arm size and often long armed mitts of nankeen or linen took the place of the sleeves Illustration Boy s Suit of Clothing seventeen eighty four A family of Cary children had several charming portraits painted in London Two of them are given opposite pages two hundred forty and two hundred forty six They note the transitions of costume which came at the approach of the close of the century The portrait of the boy is interesting in a special point of costume it shows the abandonment of the cocked hat and adoption of the simpler modern form of head covering The little girl Margaret has a most roguish expression which is suggestive of Sir Joshua Reynolds Girl with the Mouse Trap The resemblance is even more marked in the portrait of the same child at the age of six wherein the eyes and half smile are charmingly engaging unfortunately the photograph from that portrait is not clear enough for satisfactory reproduction A demure little brother and sister were the children of General Stephen Rowe Bradley of Westminster Vermont whose portraits face pages three hundred fifty six and three hundred seventy eight These were painted soon after the Revolution and show the definite changes in dress which set in with other Republican institutions At this date there began to be worn a special dress for both boys and girls Until then as soon as a boy put on breeches he dressed precisely like his father in miniature By tradition Marie Antoinette was the first who had a special dress made for her young son And sadly was she reviled for dressing her poor little Dauphin in jacket and trousers instead of flapped coat waistcoat and knee breeches CHAPTER III SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL LIFE First mark whereof scholes were erected And what the founders did intend And then doe thou thy study directe For to obtain unto that end Doubtless this was all their meaning To have their countrie founded With all poyntes of honest lernynge Whereof the public weal had nede The Last Trumpet R Crowley fifteen fifty No greater contrast of conditions could exist than between the school life of what we love to call the good old times and that of the far better times of to day Poor small and uncomfortable schoolhouses scant furnishings few and uninteresting books tiresome and indifferent methods of teaching great severity of discipline were the accompaniments of school days until this century Yet with all these disadvantages children obtained an education for an education was warmly desired no difficulties could chill that deep lying longing for learning Child said one noble New England mother of the olden days if God make thee a good Christian and a good scholar tis all thy mother ever asked for thee Not only did parents strive for the education of their children but the colonies assisted by commanding the building and maintaining of a school in each town where there was a sufficient number of families and scholars Rhode Island was the only New England colony that did not compel the building of schoolhouses and the education of children So determined was Massachusetts to have schools that in sixteen thirty six only six years after the settlement of Boston the General Court which was composed of representatives from every settlement in the Bay Colony and which was the same as our House of Representatives to day gave over half the annual income of the entire colony to establish the school which two years later became Harvard College This event should be remembered it is distinguished in history as the first time any body of people in any country ever gave through its representatives its own money to found a place of education In Virginia schoolhouses were few for over a century Governor Berkeley an obstinate and narrow minded Englishman wrote home to England in sixteen seventy I thank God there are in Virginia no free schools nor printing and I hope we shall not have for learning hath brought disobedience and heresy into the world Some Virginia gentlemen did not agree with him however and gave money to try to establish free schools for poor children A far greater hindrance to the establishment of schools than the governor s stupid opposition was the fact that there was no town or village life in Virginia the houses and plantations were scattered previous to the year seventeen hundred Jamestown was the only Virginia town and it was but a petty settlement Williamsburg was not even laid out a few seaports had been planned but had not been built Hence the children of wealthy planters were taught by private tutors at home or were sent to school in England Occasionally as years passed on there might be found in Virginia the Carolinas and Georgia what was called an old field school the uniting of a few neighbors to hire a teacher too often a poor one like the hedge teachers of Europe for a short term of teaching in a shabby building placed on an old exhausted tobacco field In one of these old field schools kept by Hobby sexton pedagogue and the most conceited man in three parishes George Washington obtained most of his education A daily ride on horseback for a year to a similar school ten miles away and for another year a row morning and night even in roughest weather across the river to a Fredericksburg teacher ended his school career when he was thirteen but he had then made a big pile of neatly written manuscript school books which may now be seen in the Library at Washington and he had acquired a passionate longing to be educated which accompanied him through life An advisive narrative sent from America to the Bishop of London toward the end of the seventeenth century says This lack of schools in Virginia is a consequence of their scattered planting It renders a very numerous generation of Christian s Children born in Virginia who naturally are of beautiful and comely Persons and generally of more ingenious Spirits than those in England unserviceable for any great Employment in Church or State Illustration Mary Lord seventeen ten circa This statement was not wholly correct for though Virginians were not usually fitted to be parsons they certainly proved suited to state and government When the war of the Revolution broke out the noblest number of great statesmen orators and generals who certainly were men of genius if not of conventional school education came from the southern provinces These brilliant Virginians were strong evidence and proof of what the great orator Patrick Henry called in his singular pronunciation naiteral pairts which he declared was of more account than all the book lairnin on the airth Different climates and surroundings soon bring out different traits in the same race of people The warm climate and fruitful soil in the southern colonies developed from English stock an easy living race who needed the great stimulus and noble excitement of the Revolution to exhibit the highest qualities of brain The Puritan minister Cotton Mather said in sixteen eighty five in a sermon before the Governor and Council in Massachusetts The Youth in this Country are verie Sharp and early Ripe in their Capacities Thus speedily had keen New England air and hard New England life developed these characteristic New England traits New England at that time was controlled both in public and private life by the Puritan ministers who felt as one of them said that unless school and college flourish church and state cannot live The ministers were accredited guardians of the schools and when Boston chose five school inspectors to visit the Latin School with the ministers many of the latter were highly incensed and Increase Mather refused to go with these lay visitors By a law of Massachusetts passed in sixteen forty seven it was ordered that every town of fifty families should provide a school where children could be taught to read and write while every town of one hundred householders was required to have a grammar school In the Connecticut Code of Laws of sixteen fifty were the same orders These schools were public but were not free they were supported at the expense of the parents In sixteen forty four the town of Salem ordered that a note be published the next lecture day that such as have children to be kept at school would bring in their names and what they will give for a whole year and also that if any poor body hath children or a child to be put to school and not able to pay for their schooling that the town will pay it by a rate Lists of children were made out in towns and if the parents were well to do they had to pay whether their children attended school or not Land was sometimes set aside to support partly the school it was called the school meadows or school fields and was let out for an income to help to pay the teacher This was a grant made on the same principle that grants were made to physicians tanners and other useful persons not to establish free education At a later date lotteries were a favorite method of raising money for schools It was not until about the time of the Revolution that the modern signification of the word free a school paid for entirely by general town taxes could be applied to the public schools of most Massachusetts towns and when the schools of Boston were made free that community stood alone for its liberality not only in America but in the world The pay was given in any of the inconvenient exchanges which had to pass as money at that time in wampum beaver skins Indian corn wheat peas beans or any country product known as truck It is told of a Salem school that one scholar was always seated at the window to study and also to hail passers by and endeavor to sell to them the accumulation of corn vegetables et cetera which had been given in payment to the teacher The logs for the great fireplace were furnished by the parents or guardians of the scholars as a part of the pay for schooling and an important part it was in the northern colonies in the bitter winter in the poorly built schoolhouses Some schoolmasters indignant at the carelessness of parents who failed to send the expected load of wood early in the winter banished the unfortunate child of the tardy parent to the coldest corner of the schoolroom The town of Windsor Connecticut voted that the committee be empowered to exclude any scholar that shall not carry his share of wood for the use of the said school In seventeen thirty six West Hartford ordered every child barred from the fire whose parents had not sent wood Illustration Erudition Schoolhouse Bath Maine seventeen ninety seven The school laws of the State of Massachusetts framed in seventeen eighty nine crystallized all the principles practice and hopes that had been developed by a hundred and fifty years of school life The standard set by these laws was decidedly lower than those of colonial days Where a permanent English school had been imperative six months schooling a year might be permitted to take its place where every town of a hundred families had had a grammar school in which boys could be fitted for the university only towns of two hundred families were compelled to have such schools Thus the open path to the university was closed in a hundred and twenty Massachusetts towns Judge Thomas Holme composed in grammarless rhyme in sixteen ninety six a True Relation of the Flourishing State of Philadelphia In it he says Here are schools of divers sorts To which our youth daily resorts Good women who do very well Bring little ones to read and spell Which fits them for writing and then Here s men to bring them to their pen And to instruct and make them quick In all sorts of Arithmetick These statements were scarcely carried out in fact in Pennsylvania educational advantages were few and among some classes education was sorely hampered The Quakers did not encourage absolute illiteracy but they thought knowledge of the three R s was enough they distinctly disapproved of any extended scholarship as it fostered undue pride and provoked idleness The Germans were worse their own historians the Calvinist and Lutheran preachers Schlatter and Muhlenberg are authority there were among them a few schools of low grade but the introduction of the public school system among the Germans was resisted by indignation meetings and litigation The Tunkers degenerated so that they did not desire a membership of educated persons and would have liked to destroy all books but religious ones It was said by these German settlers that schooling made boys lazy and dissatisfied on the farms and that religion would suffer by too much learning As Bayard Taylor puts it in his Pennsylvania Farmer Book learning gets the upper hand and work is slow and slack And they that come long after us will find things gone to wrack School teachers in the middle and southern colonies were frequently found in degraded circumstances many of them were redemptioners and exported convicts I have frequently noted such newspaper advertisements as this from the Maryland Gazette Ran away A Servant man who followed the occupation of a Schoolmaster much given to drinking and gambling So universal was drunkenness among schoolmasters that a chorus of colonial gerund grinders might sing in Goldsmith s words Let schoolmasters puzzle their brains With grammar and nonsense and learning Good liquor I stoutly maintain Gives genius a better discerning Illustration handwritten note Scotland furnished the best and the largest number of schoolmasters to the colonies The first pedagogue of New Amsterdam was one Adam Roelantsen and he had a checkered career His name appears with frequency on the court records of the little town both as plaintiff and defendant He was as active in slandering his neighbors as they were in slandering him though as Miss Van Vechten observes It is hard to see what fiction worse than truth could have been invented about him In spite of the fact that people did not speak well of him he married well But his misdemeanors continued and he was finally sentenced to be flogged We may contrast the legal records of this gentleman s shortcomings with his duties as set forth in his commission one of which was to set others a good example as becometh a devout pious and worthy consoler of the sick church clerk precentor and schoolmaster Some of the contracts under which teachers were hired still exist One for the teacher at the Dutch settlement of Flatbush Long Island in sixteen eighty two is very full in detail and we learn much of the old time school from it A bell was rung to call the scholars together at eight o clock in the morning the school closed for a recess at eleven opened again at one closed at four all sessions began and closed with prayer On Wednesdays and Saturdays the children were taught the questions and answers in the catechism and the common prayers The master was paid usually in wheat or corn for a speller or reader three guilders a quarter for a writer four guilders He had many other duties to perform besides teaching the children He rung the church bell on Sunday read the Bible at service in church and led in the singing sometimes he read the sermon He provided water for baptisms bread and wine for communion and in fact performed all the duties now done by a sexton including sweeping out the church He delivered invitations to funerals and carried messages Sometimes he dug the graves and often he visited and comforted the sick Full descriptions exist of the first country schoolhouses in Pennsylvania and New York They were universally made of logs Some had a rough puncheon floor others a dirt floor which readily ground into dust two or three inches thick that unruly pupils would purposely stir up in clouds to annoy the masters and disturb the school The bark roof was a little higher at one side that the rain might drain off Usually the teacher sat in the middle of the room and pegs were thrust between the logs around the walls three or four feet from the ground boards were laid on these pegs at these rude desks sat the older scholars with their backs to the teacher Younger scholars sat on blocks or benches of logs Until this century many schoolhouses did not have glass set in the small windows but newspapers or white papers greased with lard were fastened in the rude sashes or in holes cut in the wall and let in a dim light At one end or in the middle a cat and clay chimney furnished a fireplace When the first rough log cabin was replaced by a better schoolhouse the hexagonal shape so beloved in those states for meeting houses was chosen and occasionally built in stone A picture of one still standing and still used as a schoolhouse in Raritan New Jersey is here shown It retained its old shelf desks till a few years ago Illustration Old Harmony Schoolhouse Raritan Township Hunterdon company New Jersey In a halting way schools in America followed the customs of English schools The potation penny or the drinking was collected in schools in the colonies In England a considerable sum was often gathered for this treat at the end of the term but the pennies were doled out more slowly in American schools Young Joseph Lloyd of the family of Lloyds Neck on Long Island in the year sixteen ninety three paid out a shilling and sixpence to the Mistris for feast and wine A century later in a school in New Hampshire the children diligently saved the wood ashes in the big fireplace and sold them to a neighboring potash works for their treat They had ample funds to buy rum raisins and gingerbread for all who came to the treat including the ministers and deacons It was of this school doubtless attended largely by Scotch Irish children that the teacher recorded that the boys even the youngest wore leather aprons while many of the girls took snuff Another old English custom the barring out occasionally was known here especially in Pennsylvania The furnishing of the schoolrooms was meagre there were no blackboards no maps seldom was there a pair of globes Though mister MacMaster asserts that pencils were never used even in the early years of our Federal life his statement is certainly a mistake Faber s pencils were made as early as seventeen sixty one Peter Goelet advertised lead pencils for sale in New York in seventeen eighty six with india rubbers and as early as seventeen forty they were offered among booksellers wares in Boston for threepence apiece both black and red lead Judge Sewall had one perhaps it was not our common lead pencil of to day In seventeen seventy one we find the patriot Henry Laurens writing thus to his daughter Martha his dearest Patsey when she was about twelve years old I have recollected your request for a pair of globes therefore I have wrote to mister Grubb to ship a pair of the best eighteen inch with caps and a book of directions and to add a case of neat instruments and one dozen Middleton s best pencils marked M L When you are measuring the surface of the globe remember you are to cut a part in it and think of a plum pudding and other domestic duties Your father HENRY LAURENS Still lead pencils were not in common use even in city schools till this century The manuscript arithmetics or sum books which I have seen were always done in ink Many a country boy grew to manhood without ever seeing a lead pencil Illustration Samuel Pemberton Twelve Years Old seventeen thirty six In country schools even till the middle of this century copy books were made of foolscap paper carefully sewed into book shape and were ruled by hand For this children used lead plummets instead of pencils These plummets were made of lead melted and cast in wooden moulds cut out by the ever ready jackknife and were then tied by a hempen string to the ruler These plummets were usually shaped like a tomahawk and carefully whittled and trimmed to a sharp edge Slightly varied shapes were a carpenter s or a woodcutter s axe also there were cannon battledores and cylinders Paper was scarce and too highly prized for children to waste it was a great burden even to ministers to get what paper they needed for their sermons and they frequently acquired microscopic hand writing for economy s sake To the forest the scholars turned for the ever plentiful birch bark which formed a delightful substitute to cipher on instead of paper Among the thrifty Scotch Irish settlers in New Hampshire and the planters in Maine sets of arithmetic rules were copied by each child on birch bark and made a substantial text book Rolls of birch bark resembling in shape the parchment rolls of the Egyptians and lead plummets seem too ancient in appearance to have been commonly employed in schools within a century in this country It has been asserted that school slates were not used till this century Noah Webster says distinctly in a letter written about the schools of his childhood that before the Revolution and for some years after no slates were used in common schools S Town attending school in Belchertown Massachusetts in seventeen eighty five says that slates were unknown I have seen but a single reference to them in America and that is in such an ingenuous schoolboy s letter I will quote it in full To mister CORNELIUS TEN BROECK att Albany Stamford the thirteenth Day of October

Slate Pocket Books Slates and Slate Pens The first slates were frameless and had a hole pierced at one side on which a pencil could be hung or by which they could be suspended around the neck An old gentleman told me that he distinctly recalled the first time he ever saw slates in school The master brought in a score that had been ordered to supply his pupils He asked if any scholar had a bit of string My old gentleman thrust his hand in his pocket and confidingly brought out his best fishing line The master took it calmly cut it into twenty lengths each long enough to go around the neck of a child and permit the slate when hung on it to lie loosely in front of his chest It was a bitter blow to the boy to witness the cruel and unexpected severing of his beloved treasure and he never forgot it Illustration Nathan Hale Schoolhouse In England for centuries existed the custom of sending young children to the houses of friends relatives or people of some condition and state to be educated Young boys were placed in noblemen s households to learn carving singing and good manners Young girls went to learn housewifery needlework and etiquette The work of these children in what would to day be deemed the duties of upper servants was given in payment for their board and tuition The housemistress gained a large corps of orderly intelligent servitors and there was no disgrace in that day in being called a servant In the time of Henry VII these customs were universal The Italian Relation of England of that date is most severe upon English parents saying this putting away of young children though under the guise of having them taught good manners was done really through lack of affection through greediness The Paston Letters the Verney Papers give ample proof that children of good families were thus banished A remnant of this custom of the putting forth of children lingered in the colonies A good education could generally be obtained only in the schools in larger towns or in the households of learned men The New England ministers almost universally eked out their meagre incomes by taking young lads into their homes to educate When at school in Andover Josiah Quincy boarded with the minister The boys eight in number slept in a large chamber with four beds two boys in each The fare was ample but simple of beef pork plentiful vegetables badly baked rye and Indian bread The minister had white bread as the brown bread gave him the heart burn Children went if possible to the house of a kinsman An old letter in the Mather Papers is from Mary Hoar She writes To her

boys off to the boarding school with ample store of neatly marked underclothing stockings and handkerchiefs and had them return at the holidays nearly bereft of underwear bearing stockings with feet existing only in outlines and possessing but two or three handkerchiefs these in dingy wads at the bottom of coat pockets and usually marked with some other scholar s name such can sympathize with poor thrifty old lady Coleman when naughty Richard tied his good new handkerchiefs in knots beat his companions and recklessly threw the knotted strings away CHAPTER IV WOMEN TEACHERS AND GIRL SCHOLARS A godly young Woman of special parts who was fallen into a sad infirmity the loss of her understanding and reason which had been growing upon her divers years by occasion of giving herself wholly to reading and writing and had written many books Her husbande was loath to grieve hir but he saw his error when it was too late For if she had attended to her household affairs and such things as belong to women and not gone out of hir way and calling to meddle in such things as are proper for men whose minds are stronger she had kept hir Wits and might have improved them usefully and honorably History of New England Governor John Winthrop sixteen forty While the education of the sons of the planters in all the colonies was bravely provided and supported the daughters fared but poorly The education of a girl in book learning was deemed of vastly less importance than her instruction in household duties But small arrangement was made in any school for her presence nor was it thought desirable that she should have any very varied knowledge That she should read and write was certainly satisfactory and cipher a little but many girls got on very well without the ciphering and many alas without the reading and writing There had been a time when English girls and English gentlewomen had eagerly studied Latin and Greek and wise masters such as Erasmus and Colet and Roger Ascham had told with pride of their intelligent English girl scholars but all that had passed away with the good old times In the seventeenth century English gentlemen looked with marked disfavor on learned women Sir Ralph Verney who adored his own little daughters to the neglect of his sons and was tender devoted and generous to every little girl of his acquaintance wrote about the year sixteen ninety to a friend Let not your girle learn Latin or short hand the difficulty of the first may keep her from that Vice for soe I must esteem it in a woeman but the easinesse of the other may bee a prejudice to her for the pride of taking sermon noates hath made multitudes of woemen most unfortunate Had saint Paul lived in our Times I am confident hee would have fixt a Shame upon our woemen for writing as well as for speaking in church Occasionally an intelligent father would carefully teach his daughters President Colman of Harvard was such a father He gave what was called a profound education to his daughter Jane A letter of his to her when she was ten years old is worthy of full quotation MY DEAR CHILD I have this morning your Letter which pleases me very well and gives me hopes of many a pleasant line from you in Time to come if God spare you to me and me to you I very much long to see your Mother but doubt whether the weather will permit to day I pray God to bless you and make you one of his Children I charge you to pray daily and read your Bible and fear to sin Be very dutiful to your Mother and respectful to everybody Be very humble and modest womanly and discreet Take care of your health and as you love me do not eat green apples Drink sparingly of water except the day be warm When I last saw you you were too shamefaced look people in the face speak freely and behave decently I hope to bring Nabby in her grandfather s Chariot to see you The meanwhile I kiss your dear Mother and commend her health to the gracious care of God and you with her to His Grace Give my service to mister A and family and be sure you never forget the respect they have honoured you with Your loving father BOSTON Aug one seventeen eighteen Jonathan Edwards was an only son with ten sisters In seventeen eleven when he was eight years old five of these sisters had been born The father Timothy Edwards went as chaplain on an expedition to Canada His letters home show his care and thought for his children girls and boy I desire thee to take care that Jonathan dont lose what he hath learnt but that as he hath got the accidence and about two sides of Propria quae maribus by heart so that he keep what he hath got I would therefore have him say pretty often to the girls I would also have the girls keep what they have learnt of the Grammar and get by heart as far as Jonathan hath learnt he can keep them as far as he had learnt And would have both him and them keep their writing and therefore write much oftener than they did when I was at home I have left paper enough for them which they may use to that end Conditions remained the same throughout the century The wife of President John Adams born in seventeen forty four the daughter of a New England minister of good family and social position doubtless had as good an education as any girl of her birth and station She writes in eighteen seventeen My early education did not partake of the abundant opportunities which the present days offer and which even our common country schools now afford I never was sent to any school I was always sick Female education in the best families went no further than writing and arithmetic in some few and rare instances music and dancing On another occasion she said that female education had been everywhere neglected and female learning ridiculed and she speaks of the trifling narrow contracted education of American women Girls in the other colonies fared no better than New England damsels The instruction given to girls of Dutch and English parentage in New York was certainly very meagre missus Anne Grant wrote an interesting account of her childhood in Albany New York in a book called Memoir of an American Lady The date was the first half of the eighteenth century She said It was at that time very difficult to procure the means of instruction in those districts female education was in consequence conducted on a very limited scale girls learned needlework in which they were indeed both skilful and ingenious from their mothers and aunts they were taught too at that period to read in Dutch the Bible and a few Calvinistic tracts of the devotional kind But in the infancy of the settlement few girls read English when they did they were thought accomplished they generally spoke it however imperfectly and a few were taught writing William Smith wrote in seventeen fifty six that the schools in New York then were of the lowest order the teachers ignorant and women especially ill educated It was the same in Virginia Mary Ball the mother of George Washington wrote from her Virginia home when fifteen years old We have not had a schoolmaster in our neighborhood till now in nearly four years We have now a young minister living with us who was educated at Oxford took orders and came over as assistant to reverend Kemp The parish is too poor to keep both and he teaches school for his board He teaches Sister Susie and me and Madam Carter s boy and two girls I am now learning pretty fast The Catechism of Health an old time child s book thus summarily and definitely sets girls in their proper places Query Ought female children to receive the same education as boys and have the same scope for play Answer In their earlier years there should be no difference But there are shades of discretion and regards to propriety which judicious and prudent guardians and teachers can discern and can adjust and apply We seldom find any recognition of girls as pupils in the early public schools Sometimes it is evident that they were admitted at times not devoted to the teaching of boys For instance in May seventeen sixty seven a school was advertised in Providence for teaching writing and arithmetic to young ladies But the girls had to go from six to half past seven in the morning and half past four to six in the afternoon The price for this most inconvenient and ill timed schooling was two dollars a quarter It is pathetic to read of a learning hungry little maid in Hatfield Massachusetts who would slip away from her spinning and knitting and sit on the schoolhouse steps to listen with eager envy to the boys as they recited within When it became popular to have girls attend public schools an old farmer on a country school committee gave these matter of fact objections to the innovation In winter it s too far for girls to walk in summer they ought to stay at home to help in the kitchen The first school for girls only where they were taught in branches not learned in the lower schools was started in seventeen eighty in Middletown Connecticut by a graduate of Yale College named William Woodbridge Boston girls owed much to a famous teacher Caleb Bingham who came to that city in seventeen eighty four and advertised to open a school where girls could be taught writing arithmetic reading spelling and English grammar His school was eagerly welcomed and it prospered He wrote for his girl pupils the famous Young Lady s Accidence referred to in another chapter and under his teaching newspapers were to be introduced in the school at the discretion of the master This is the first instance I believe in any country of the reading of newspapers being ordered by a school committee There were always dame schools which were attended by small boys and girls reverend John Barnard of Marblehead Massachusetts was born in sixteen eighty one and was educated in Boston He wrote in his old age a sketch of his school life He says By that time I had a little passed my sixth year I had left my reading school in the latter part of which my mistress had made me a sort of usher appointing me to teach some children that were older than myself as well as some smaller ones And in which time I had read my Bible through thrice My parents thought me to be weakly because of my thin habit and pale countenance The penultimate sentence of this account evidently accounts for the ultimate It also appears that this unnamed school dame practised the monitorial system a century or more before Bell and Lancaster made their claims of inventing it The pay of women teachers who taught the dame schools was meagre in the extreme The town of Woburn Massachusetts reached the lowest ebb of salary In sixteen forty one a highly respected widow one missus Walker kept a school in a room of her own house The town agreed to pay her ten shillings for the first year but after deducting seven shillings for taxes and various small amounts for produce et cetera she received finally from the town one shilling and three pence for her pedagogical work Elizabeth Wright was the first teacher in the town of Northfield Massachusetts She taught a class of young children at her own house for twenty two weeks each summer for this she received fourpence a week for each child At this time she had four young children of her own She took all the care of them and did all the work of her household made shirts for the Indians for eight pence each and breeches for Englishmen for one shilling sixpence a pair and wove much fine linen to order For the summer school at Franklin Connecticut in seventeen ninety eight a qualified woman teacher had but sixty seven cents a week pay Men teachers who taught both girls and boys usually had better pay but Samuel Appleton in later life the well known Boston merchant and philanthropist was my great grandfather s teacher in the year seventeen eighty six His pay was his board lodging and washing and sixty seven cents per week and it was deemed liberal and ample Illustration Elizabeth Storer Twelve Years Old seventeen thirty eight There were always in the large cities small classes where favored girls could be taught the rudiments of an education and there were many private teachers who taught young misses Boston gentlewomen from very early days had a mode of eking out a limited income by taking little girls and young ladies from country homes especially from the southern colonies and the Barbadoes to board while they attended these classes and recited to these teachers Many honored New England names appear among the advertisements of those desiring boarders missus Deming wrote to her niece Anna Green Winslow telling her of two boarders she had Had I time and spirits I could acquaint you of an expedition the two sisters made to

her young daughter Elizabeth on July twenty six sixteen eighty when the latter was away from home and attending school It abruptly begins BETTY Having an opportunity to send to you I could doe no less than write a few lines to mind you that you carry yourself very respectively and dutyfully to missus Graves as though she were your Mother and likewise respectively and loveingly to the children and soberly in words and actions to the servants and be sure you keep yourself diligently imployed either at home or at school as missus Graves shall order you Doe nothing without her leave and assure yourself it will be a great preservative from falling into evill to keep yourself well imployed But with all and in the first place make it your dayly work to pray earnestly to God that he would keep you from all manner of evil Take heed of your discourse at all times that it be not vaine and foolish but know that for every idle word you must certainly give account another day Be sure to follow your reading omit it not one day your father doth propose to send you some coppies that so you may follow your wrighting likewise I shall say no more at present but only lay a strict charge upon you that you remember and practise what I have minded you of and as you desire the blessing of God upon you either in soul or body be careful to observe the counsell of your parents and consider that they are the words of your loving and affectionate mother ELIZ SALTONSTALL Present my best respects to Mistris Graves Your brothers remember their love to you Old Madam Coleman who had somewhat of a handful in her grandson Richard Hall during his school days was given charge of his sister Sarah in seventeen nineteen to care for and guard while she received an education When Missy arrived from the Barbadoes she was eight years old She brought with her a maid The grandmother wrote back cheerfully to the parents that the child was well and brisk as indeed she was All the very young gentlemen and young ladies of Boston Brahmin blood paid her visits and she gave a feast at a child s dancing party with the sweetmeats left over from her sea store Her stay in her grandmother s household was surprisingly brief She left unceremoniously and unbidden with her maid and went to a mister Binning s to board she sent home word to the Barbadoes that her grandmother made her drink water with her meals Her brother wrote at once in return to Madam Coleman We were all persuaded of your tender and hearty affection to my Sister when we recommended her to your parental care We are sorry to hear of her Independence in removing from under the Benign Influences of your Wing am surprised she dare do it without our leave or consent or that mister Binning receive her at his house before he knew how we were affected to it We shall now desire mister Binning to resign her with her waiting maid to you and in our Letter to him have strictly ordered her to Return to your House And you may let her know before my Father took his departure for London he desired me peremptorily to enjoin it and my Mother and myself back it with our Commands which we hope she wont venture to refuse or disobey But no brother could control this spirited young damsel Three months later a letter from Madam Coleman read thus Sally wont go to school nor to church and wants a nue muff and a great many other things she don t need I tell her fine things are cheaper in Barbadoes She says she will go to Barbados in the Spring She is well and brisk says her Brother has nothing to do with her as long as her father is alive Hugh Hall wrote in return saying his daughter ought to have one room to sleep in and her maid another that it was not befitting children of their station to drink water they should have wine and beer The grandmother was not offended with him or the children but shielded the boy from rebuke when he was sent from one school to another said proudly he was a child of great parts ye best Dancer of any in town and could learn as much in an hour as another in three hours The bill for the dancing lessons still exists Richard s dancing lessons for a year and a quarter cost seven pounds Sally s for four months two pounds Four months instruction in writing and pens ink and paper was one pound seven shillings and four pence The entrance fee for dancing lessons was a pound apiece Sally learned to sew floure write and dance The brisk child grew up a dashing belle and married Major John Wentworth brother of Governor Benning Wentworth Good Brother Richard writes I heartily rejoice in Sally s good fortune and hope Molly will have her turn also but it would not have been fair to let Sally dance barefoot which I hear Molly expected would have been done Sister Molly married first Adam Winthrop and then Captain William Wentworth The two sisters were left widows and lived till great old age in the famous old Wentworth House in Portsmouth New Hampshire both dying in seventeen ninety Mistress Agan Blair of Williamsburg Virginia married one Colonel John Banister of Petersburg her letters even in old age are full of a charming freedom of description and familiarity of language even amounting to slang which are very unusual in correspondence of that day They are printed in the History of the Blair and Braxton Families She writes to her sister missus Braxton of the latter s little daughter Betsey in the year seventeen sixty nine Betsey is at work for you I suppose she will tell you to morrow is Dancing Day for it is in her Thoughts by Day her dreams by Night mister Fearson was so surprised to find she knew so much of the Minuet step and could not help asking if Miss had never been taught So you will find she is likely to make some progress that way mister Wray by reason of business has but lately taken her in hand tho he assures me a little practice is all she wants her Reading I hear twice a day And when I go out she is consigned over to my Sister Blair we have had some few Quarrels and one Battle Betsey and her Cousin Jenny had been fighting for several days successively was threatened to be whipt for it as often but they did not regard us Her Mamma self thought it necessary to let them see we were in earnest if they have fought since we have never heard of it She has finish d her work d Tucker but ye weather is so warm that with all ye pains I can take with clean hands and so forth she cannot help dirtying it a little I do not observe her to be fond of negroes company nor have I heard lately of any bad words chief of our Quarrels is for eating of those green Apples in our garden and not keeping the head smooth I have had Hair put on Miss Dolly but find it is not in my power of complying with my promise in giving her Silk for a Sacque and Coat Some of our pretty Gang broke open a Trunk in my Absence and stole several Things of which the Silk makes a part So imagine Betsey will petition you for some I am much obliged for the care you have taken to get all my Duds together I cannot find you have neglected putting up anything for Betsey It will readily be seen from all these letters that whether the little girl was taught at home or in a private school to sew floure write and dance were really the chief things she learned usually the only things save deportment and elegance of carriage To attain an erect and dignified bearing growing girls were tortured as in English boarding schools by sitting in stocks wearing harnesses and being strapped to backboards The packthread stays and stiffened coats of little Miss Custis were made still more unyielding by metal and wood busks the latter made of close grained heavy wood These were often carved in various designs or with names and verses or ornamented with drawings in colored inks and made a favorite gift Illustration Carved Busks All these constrainments and accessories contributed to a certain thin chested though erect appearance which is notable in the portraits of girls and women painted in the past century The backboard certainly helped to produce an erect and dignified carriage and was assisted by the quick graceful motions used in wool spinning The daughter of the Revolutionary patriot General Nathanael Greene stated to her grandchildren that in her girlhood she sat every day with her feet in stocks strapped to a backboard She was until the end of her long life a straight backed elegant dame Many of the portraits given in this book plainly show the reign of the backboard The portrait of Elizabeth Storer facing page ninety eight is perhaps the best example It is authenticated as having been painted by Smibert when the subject was but twelve years old but she is certainly a most mature faced child Another straight backed portrait opposite page one hundred eight is the famous one immortalized in rhyme by doctor Oliver Wendell Holmes that of Dorothy Q the daughter of Judge Edmund Quincy The poet s lines are more simply descriptive than any prose Grandmother s mother her age I guess Thirteen summers or something less Girlish bust but womanly air Smooth square forehead with uprolled hair Lips that lover has never kissed Taper fingers and slender wrist Hanging sleeves of stiff brocade So they painted the little maid Who the painter was none may tell One whose best was not over well Hard and dry it must be confessed Flat as a rose that has long been pressed Yet in her cheek the hues are bright Dainty colors of red and white And in her slender shape are seen Hint and promise of stately mien It would be no effort of the imagination to stretch the poet s thirteen summers or less to thirty summers Illustration Dorothy Q Thirteen Summers seventeen twenty circa Of associate interest is the portrait of Elizabeth Quincy her sister facing page one hundred twelve The faces hair and dress are similar but the parrot is replaced by an impossible little dog Elizabeth is somewhat fairer to look upon Dorothy is certainly nothing handsome On the back of the portrait is written this inscription It pleased God to take Out of Life my Honor d and dearly Belov d Mother M rs Elizabeth Wendell daughter to Honble Edmund Quincy esquire r March seventeen forty six aged thirty nine Years Her brother Edmund Quincy married her husband s sister Elizabeth thus the two Elizabeths exchanged surnames and Dorothy Q married Edward Jackson The desire of girls and women to be ethereal and slender delicate and shrinking began over a century ago but reached a climax in the early years of this century To effect this severe measures were taken in girls schools doctor Holmes wrote in jest but in truth too They braced my aunt against a board To make her straight and tall They laced her up they starved her down To make her light and small They pinched her feet they singed her hair They screwed it up with pins Oh never mortal suffered more In penance for her sins Though Madam Coleman a Boston Puritan told so proudly of her grandchildren s dancing that accomplishment or rather integral part of a little lass s education had not been quietly promoted in that sober city In early years both magistrates and ministers had declaimed against it In sixteen eighty four Increase Mather preached a strong sermon against what he termed Gynecandrical Dancing or that which is commonly called Mixt or Promiscuous Dancing of Men and Women be they elder or younger Persons together He called it the great sin of the Daughters of Zion and he bursts forth Who were the Inventors of Petulant Dancings Learned men have well observed that the Devil was the First Inventor of the impleaded Dances and the Gentiles who worshipped him the first Practitioners of this Art Of course he could not be silent as to the dancings of Miriam and David in the Bible but disposed of them summarily thus Those Instances are not at all to the Purpose Preaching against dancing was as futile as against wig wearing Horrid Bushes of Vanity soon decked every head and gay young feet tripped merrily to the sound of music in every village and town Dancing could not be repressed in an age when there was so little other excitement so great physical activity and so narrow a range of conversation and after a time Ordination balls were given when a new minister was ordained Dancing was a pleasant accomplishment and a serious one in good society The regard of it as a formal function is proved by the story the Marquis de Chastellux told of the Philadelphia Assembly A young lady who was up in a country dance spoke for a moment to a friend and thus forgot her turn The Master of Ceremonies Colonel Mitchell immediately came to her side and said severely Give over Miss Take care what you are about Do you think you came here for your pleasure It was a much more varied art than is ordinarily taught to day Signor Sodi taught rigadoons and paspies in Philadelphia John Walsh added the Spanish fandango Other modish dances were Allemand vally s De la cours Devonshire jiggs Minuets Complicated contra dances were many in number and quaint in name The Innocent Maid A Successful Campaign Priest s House Clinton s Retreat Blue Bonnets The Orange Tree A letter from an interesting little child shows that dancing was deemed part of a liberal education PHILADELPHIA March thirty seventeen thirty nine HONOUR D SIR Since my coming up I have entered with mister Hackett to improve my Dancing and hope to make such Progress therein as may answer to the Expense and enable me to appear well in any Public Company The great Desire I have of pleasing you will make me the more Assiduous in my undertaking and I arrive at any degree of Perfection it must be Attributed to the Liberal Education you bestow on me I am with greatest Respect Dear Pappa Yr dutiful Daughter MARY GRAFTON RCHD GRAFTON esquire New Castle Delaware We have much contemporary evidence to show that music as a formulated study was rarely taught till after the Revolution But there never was a time in colonial life when music was not loved and clung to with a sentiment that is difficult of explanation but must not be underrated doctor John Earle gives in his Microcosmographie the character of a Puritan woman or a shee precise Hypocrite saying shee suffers not her daughters to learne on the Virginalls because of their affinity with the Organs yet I find Judge Sewall a true Puritan taking his wife s virginals to be repaired I supposed she played psalm tunes on them Spinets and harpsichords were brought to wealthy citizens Copies of old time music show how very elementary were the performances on these instruments Listeners were profoundly moved at the sound but it would seem far from inspiring to day The notes of slender harpsichords with tapping twinkling quills Or carrolling to a spinet with its thin metallic thrills Illustration Elizabeth Quincy Wendell seventeen twenty circa Even the new Clementi with glittering keys gave but a tinny sound Girls raised a tune however to these far from resonant accompaniments and sung their ballads and sentimental ditties unhampered by thoughts of technique and methods and schools Many of these old musical instruments are still in existence The harpsichord bought for little Miss Custis is in its rightful home at Mount Vernon By Revolutionary times girls boarding schools had sprung into existence in large towns and certainly filled a great want One New England school haloed with romance was kept by missus Susanna Rawson who was an actress the daughter of an English officer and married to a musician She was also a play writer and wrote one novel of great popularity Charlotte Temple Eliza Southgate Bowne gives some glimpses of the life at this school in her letters She was fourteen years when she thus wrote to her father honorable FATHER I am again placed at school under the tuition of an amiable lady so mild so good no one can help loving her she treats all her scholars with such tenderness as would win the affection of the most savage brute I learn Embroiderey and Geography at present and wish your permission to learn Musick I have described one of the blessings of creation in missus Rawson and now I will describe missus Lyman as the reverse she is the worst woman I ever knew of or that I ever saw nobody knows what I suffered from the treatment of that woman This missus Lyman kept a boarding school at Medford eight girls slept in one room the fare was meagre and the education kept close company with the fare The Moravian schools at Bethlehem Pennsylvania were widely popular President John Adams wrote to his daughter of the girls school that one hundred and twenty girls lived in one house and slept in one garret in single beds in two long rows He says How should you like to live in such a nunnery Eliza Southgate Bowne wrote a pretty account of this school The first was merely a sewing school little children and a pretty single sister about thirty with her white skirt white short tight waistcoat nice handkerchief pinned outside a muslin apron and a close cap of the most singular form you can imagine I can t describe it The hair is all put out of sight turned back and no border to the cap very unbecoming and very singular tied under the chin with a pink ribbon blue for the married white for the widows Here was a Piano forte and another sister teaching a little girl music We went thro all the different school rooms some misses of sixteen their teachers were very agreeable and easy and in every room was a Piano She also tells of the great dormitory the beds of singular shape high and covered a single hanging lamp lighted at night with one sister walking patrol Though the education given to girls in these boarding schools was not very profound they had at the close of the school year a grand opportunity of showing off in a school exhibition Mary Grafton Dulany wrote when thirteen years old to her father from a Philadelphia school I went to Madame B s exhibition There were five Crowns two principal for Eminence in Lessons and Virtue They were crowned in great style in the Assembly Rooms in the presence of five hundred Spectators missus Quincy wrote of a school which she attended in seventeen eighty four of what she termed the breaking up A stage was erected at the end of the room covered with a carpet ornamented with evergreens and lighted by candles in gilt branches Two window curtains were drawn aside from the centre before it and the audience were seated on the benches of the schoolroom The Search after Happiness by missus More The Milliner and The Dove by Madame Genlis were performed In the first I acted Euphelia one of the court ladies and also sung a song intended in the play for one of the daughters of Urania but as I had the best voice it was given to me My dress was a pink and green striped silk feathers and flowers decorated my head and with bracelets on my arms and paste buckles on my shoes I thought I made a splendid appearance The only time I ever rode in a sedan chair was on this occasion when after being dressed at home I was conveyed in one to Miss Ledyard s residence Hackney coaches were then unknown in New York In the second piece I acted the milliner and by some strange notion of Miss Ledyard s or my own was dressed in a gown cap handkerchief and apron of my mother s with a pair of spectacles to look like an elderly woman a proof how little we understood the character of a French milliner When the curtain was drawn many of the audience declared it must be missus Morton herself on the stage How my mother with her strict notions and prejudices against the theatre ever consented to such proceedings is still a surprise to me All parents did not approve of those exhibitions Major Dulany wrote with decision to his daughter that he lamented the boldness and over assurance which accompanied any success in such performances and which proceeded he deemed from callous feeling These plays were merely a revival of an old fashion when English school children took part in miracle plays or mysteries In the seventeenth century schoolmasters took great pride in writing exhibition plays for their pupils Dreary enough these acts or interludes are One forced all the characters to act anomalies of all the chiefest parts of grammar oh the poor lads that therein played their parts CHAPTER V HORNBOOK AND PRIMER To those who are in years but Babes I bow My Pen to teach them what the Letters be And how they may improve their A B C Nor let my pretty Children them despise All needs must there begin that would be wise Nor let them fall under Discouragement Who at their Hornbook stick and time hath spent Upon that A B C while others do Into their Primer or their Psalter go A Book for Boys and Girls or Country Rhimes for Children John Bunyan sixteen eighty six The English philosopher John Locke in his Thoughts concerning Education written in sixteen ninety says the method of teaching children to read in England at that time was always the ordinary road of Horn book Primer Psalter Testament and Bible These he said engage the liking of children and tempt them to read The road was the same in New England but it would hardly be called a tempting method The first book from which the children of the colonists learned their letters and to spell was not really a book at all in our sense of the word It was what was called a hornbook A thin piece of wood usually about four or five inches long and two inches wide had placed upon it a sheet of paper a trifle smaller printed at the top with the alphabet in large and small letters below were simple syllables such as ab eb ib ob et cetera then came the Lord s Prayer This printed page was covered with a thin sheet of yellowish horn which was not as transparent as glass yet permitted the letters to be read through it and both the paper and the horn were fastened around the edges to the wood by a narrow strip of metal usually brass which was tacked down by fine tacks or nails It was therefore a book of a single page At the two upper corners of the page were crosses hence to read the hornbook was often called reading a criss cross row At the lower end of the wooden back was usually a little handle which often was pierced with a hole thus the hornbook could be carried by a string which could be placed around the neck or hung by the side Illustration Hornbook owned by missus Anne Robinson Minturn When five years ago was published my book entitled Customs and Fashions in Old New England I wrote that I did not know of the preservation of a single hornbook in America though for many years eager and patient antiquaries of English and of American blood had vainly sought in American historical collections in American libraries in American rural homes for a true American hornbook that is one studied by American children of colonial times The publication of my statement has made known to me three American hornbooks The first is the shabby little treasure owned by missus Anne Robinson Minturn of Shoreham Vermont found hidden under the dusty eaves of a Vermont garret The illustration shows its exact size On the back is a paper coarsely stamped in red with a portrait of Charles II king of England on horseback This may indicate its age but not its exact date The young colonist who owned it was by this print taught loyalty to the Crown though in a far land The second hornbook is owned by Miss Grace L Gordon of Flushing Long Island It is a family heirloom having come to its present owner through a great uncle who was born in seventeen eighty two and stated that it was used by his father who was born in seventeen thirty six The tablet is of oak and the back is covered with a red paper stamped with the design of a double headed eagle The third owned by missus John W Norton of Guildford Connecticut is almost precisely like Miss Gordon s and is equally well preserved Illustration Hornbook owned by Miss Gordon From these shabby little relics and from thousands of their ill printed but useful kinsfolk childish lips in America first read aloud the letters pointed firmly out by a knitting needle in some dame s hand Undisturbed by kindergarten inductions and suggestions unbewildered by baleful processes and diagrams unthreatened by scientific principles of instruction did the young colonists stoutly shout their a b abs did they spell out their prayer did they read in triumphal chorus their criss cross row Isn t it strange that these three lonely little ghosts of old time schooling should be the only representatives of their regiments of classmates Wouldn t it seem that tender association or miserly hoarding or even forgetful neglect would have made some greater salvage from the vast number of hornbooks sent to this country in the century after its settlement that by intent or accident many scores would have survived But these are all three little battered oaken backs and stubby handles three faded paper slips a splintered sheet or two of horn a few strips of brass tape a score of tiny hand wrought nails all poor things enough but shaping themselves into precious and treasured relics Another of their kindred a penny hornbook proved its present value at a sale in London in eighteen ninety three by fetching the far from ignoble sum of sixty five pounds One of these little hornbooks filled in its single self what has become a vast item in public school expenses As mister Martin wittily expresses it it was in embryo all that the Massachusetts statutes now designate by the formal phrase text books and supplies The knitting needle of the schooldame could be dignified by the pompous name of fescue a pointer and something of that nature a straw a pin a quill a skewer of wood was always used to direct children s eyes to letter or word There certainly were plenty of these humble little engines of instruction in America old Judge Sewall had them for his fourteen children at the end of the seventeenth century as we know from his diary he wrote in sixteen ninety one of his son Joseph going to school his cousin Jane accompanying him carrying his horn book Waitstill Winthrop sent them to his little Connecticut Plantation nieces in seventeen sixteen It is told of one zealous Puritan minister that hating the symbolism of the cross he blotted it out of the criss cross row of a number of hornbooks imported to Boston Illustration Back of Hornbook Gilt horns were sold in Philadelphia with Bibles and Primers as we learn from the Pennsylvania Gazette of December four seventeen sixty and in New York in seventeen fifty three so says the New York Gazette of May fourteen of that year Pretty little lesson toys these gilded horns must have proved but not so fine as the hornbooks of silver and ivory used by young misses of quality in England Scores of pictures by seventeenth century artists on canvas and glass show demure little maids and masters with hanging hornbooks Even the pictures of the Holy Family show the infant Christ hornbook in hand tenderly taught by the Virgin Mother The hornbook was called by other names horn gig horn bat battledore book absey book et cetera and in Dutch it was the a b boordje They were worked in needlework and written in ink and stamped on tin and carved in wood as well as printed and Prior tells in rhyme of a hornbook common enough in England which must have proved eminently satisfactory to the student To master John the English maid A horn book gives of gingerbread And that the child may learn the better As he can name he eats the letter To this day in England at certain Fairs and in Kensington bake shops these gingerbread hornbooks are made and sold in spite of the solemn warning of British moralists No liquorish learning to thy babes extend Still All the letters are digested Hateful ignorance detested I have seen in New England what were called cookey moulds which were of heavy wood incised with the alphabet were of ancient Dutch manufacture and had been used for making those koeckje hornbooks Illustration The Royal Battledore The sight of an old hornbook must always be of interest to any one of any power of imagination or of thoughtful mind who can read between the irregular lines the ill shapen letters its true significance as the emblem the well spring of English education and literature This thought of the symbolism of the hornbook is expressed in quaint words on the back of a shabby battered specimen of questionable age in the British Museum What more could be wished for even by a literary Gourmand under the Tudors than to be able to Read and Spell to repeat that holy Charm before which fled all unholy Ghosts Goblins or even the Old Gentleman himself to the very bottom of the Red Sea to say that immortal Prayer which seems Heaven to all who ex animo use it and to have those mathematical powers by knowing units from which spring countless myriads For a fuller account of the hornbook readers should go to the History of the Hornbook by Andrew W Tuer two splendid volumes forming one of the most interesting and exhaustive accounts of any special educational topic that has ever been written The printed cardboard battledore was a successor of the hornbook This was often printed on a double fold of stiff card with a third fold or flap lapping over like an old pocket book These battledores were issued in such vast numbers that it is futile to attempt even to allude to the myriad of publishers An affine of the hornbook is seen in the wooden reading boards which were used a hundred years ago in Erasmus Hall the famous old academy built in seventeen eighty six in Flatbush Long Island It is still standing and still used for educational purposes These reading boards are tablets of wood fifteen inches long covered on either side with time yellowed paper printed in large letters with some simple reading lesson The old fashioned long s in the type proves their age Through a pierced hole a loop of string suspended these boards before a class of little scholars who doubtless all read in chorus Similar ones bearing the alphabet are still used in Cornish Sunday schools They were certainly used in Dutch schools two centuries ago as the illustrations of old Dutch books prove Illustration My New Battledore A prymer or primer was specifically and ecclesiastically before and after the Reformation in England a book of private devotions As authorized by the Church and written or printed partially or wholly in the vernacular it contained devotions for the hours the Creed Lord s Prayer Ten Commandments some psalms and certain instructions as to the elements of Christian knowledge These little books often opened with the criss cross row or alphabet arranged hornbook fashion hence the term primer naturally came to be applied to all elementary books for children s use A B C the Middle English name for the alphabet in the forms apsey abce absie et cetera was also given to what we now call a primer Shakespeare called it absey book The list in Dyves Pragmaticus runs I have inke paper and pennes to lode with a barge Primers and abces and books of small charge What Lack you Scollers come hither to me Illustration Reading Board Erasmus Hall The book which succeeded the hornbook in general use was the New England Primer It was the most universally studied school book that has ever been used in America for one hundred years it was the school book of America for nearly another hundred years it was frequently printed and much used More than three million copies of this New England Primer were printed so declares its historian Paul Leicester Ford These were studied by many more millions of school children All of us whose great grandparents were American born may be sure that those great grandparents and their fathers and mothers and ancestors before them learned to read from one of these little books It was so religious in all its teachings and suggestions that it has been fitly called the Little Bible of New England It is a poorly printed little book about five inches long and three wide of about eighty pages It contains the alphabet and a short table of easy syllables such as a b ab e b eb and words up to those of six syllables This was called a syllabarium There were twelve five syllable words of these five were abomination edification humiliation mortification and purification There were a morning and evening prayer for children and a grace to be said before meat Then followed a set of little rhymes which have become known everywhere and are frequently quoted Each letter of the alphabet is illustrated with a blurred little picture Of these two thirds represent Biblical incidents They begin In Adam s fall We sinned all and end with Z Zaccheus he Did climb a tree His Lord to see In the early days of the Primer all the colonies were true to the English king and the rhyme for the letter K reads King Charles the Good No man of blood But by Revolutionary years the verse for K was changed to Queens and Kings Are Gaudy Things Later verses tell the praise of George Washington Then comes a series of Bible questions and answers then an alphabet of lessons for youth consisting of verses of the Bible beginning successively with A B C and so on X was a difficult initial letter and had to be contented with Xhort one another daily et cetera After the Lord s Prayer and Apostle s Creed appeared sometimes a list of names for men and women to teach children to spell their own names The largest and most interesting picture was that of the burning at the stake of John Rogers and after this a six page set of pious rhymes which the martyr left at his death for his family of small children Illustration mister JOHN ROGERS Minister of the Gospel in London was the first Martyr in Queen Mary s Reign and was burnt at Smithfield February fourteenth fifteen fifty four His Wife with nine small Children and one at her Breast following him to the Stake with which sorrowful Sight he was not in the least daunted but with wonderful Patience died courageously for the Gospel of Jesus Christ Some John Rogers After the year seventeen fifty a few very short stories were added to its pages and were probably all the children s stories that many of the scholars of that day ever saw It is interesting to see that the little prayer so well known to day beginning Now I lay me down to sleep is usually found in the New England Primer of dates later than the year seventeen thirty seven The Shorter Catechism was perhaps the most important part of this primer It was so called in contrast to the catechism in use in England called The Careful Father and Pious Child which had twelve hundred questions with answers The Shorter Catechism had but a hundred and seven questions though some of the answers were long Usually another catechism was found in the primer called Spiritual Milk for Babes It was written by the Boston minister John Cotton and it had but eighty seven questions with short answers Sometimes a Dialogue between Christ Youth and the Devil was added The Shorter Catechism was the special delight of all New Englanders Cotton Mather called it a little watering pot to shed good lessons He begged writing masters to set sentences from it to be copied by their pupils and he advised mothers to continually drop something of the Catechism on their children as Honey from the Rock Learning the catechism was enforced by law in New England and the deacons and ministers visited and examined families to see that the law was obeyed Thus it may plainly be seen that this primer truly filled the requisites of what the Roxbury school trustees called scholastical theological and moral discipline CHAPTER VI SCHOOL BOOKS The most worthless book of a bygone day is a record worthy of preservation Like a telescopic star its obscurity may render it unavailable for most purposes but it serves in hands which know how to use it to determine the places of more important bodies A de Morgan eighteen forty seven When any scholar could advance beyond hornbook and primer he was ready for grammar This was not English grammar but Latin and the boy usually began to study it long before he had any book to con A bulky and wretched grammar called Lilly s was most popular in England Locke said the study of it was a religious observance without which no scholar was orthodox It named twenty five different kinds of nouns and devoted twenty two pages of solid print to declensions of nouns it gave seven genders with fifteen pages of rules for genders and exceptions Under such a regime we can sympathize with Nash s outburst Syntaxis and prosodia you are tormentors of wit and good for nothing but to get schoolmasters twopence a week It was said of Ezekiel Cheever the old Boston schoolmaster who taught for over seventy years He taught us Lilly and he Gospel taught But he also wrote a Latin grammar of his own Cheever s Accidence which had unvarying popularity for over a century Cheever was a thorough grammarian Cotton Mather thus eulogized him Were Grammar quite extinct yet at his Brain The Candle might have well been Lit again There was brought forth at his death a broadside entitled The Grammarian s Funeral A fac simile of it is here given Josiah Quincy later in life the president of Harvard College wrote an account of his dismal school life at Andover He entered the school when he was six years old and on the form by his side sat a man of thirty Both began Cheever s Accidence and committed to memory pages of a book which the younger child certainly could not understand and no advance was permitted till the first book was conquered He studied through the book twenty times before mastering it The hours of study were long eight hours a day and this upon lessons absolutely meaningless Ilustration The Grammarians Funeral

Learners more especially for those of the Fair Sex though Proper for Either It is said that a hundred thousand copies of it were sold It was a very little grammar about four or five inches long and two or three wide and had only fifty seven pages but it was a very good little grammar when compared with its fellows being simple and clearly worded The fashion of the day was to set everything in rhyme as an aid to memory and even so unpoetical a subject as English Grammar did not escape the rhyming writer In the Grammar of the English Tongue a large and formidable book in fine type all the rules and lists of exceptions and definitions were in verse A single specimen the definition of a letter will show the best style of composition which when it struggled with moods and tenses was absolutely meaningless A Letter is an uncompounded Sound Of which there no Division can be Found Those Sounds to Certain Characters we fix Which in the English Tongue are Twenty Six The spelling of that day was wildly varied Dilworth s Speller was one of the earliest used and the spelling in it differed much from that of the British Instructor A third edition of The Child s New Spelling Book was published in seventeen forty four Famous English lesson books known among common folk as Readamadeasies and book traders as Reading Easies really Reading made easy belied their name Some had alphabets on two pages because One Alphabet is commonly worn out before the Scholar is perfect in his Letters It is interesting to find Poor Richard s sayings in these English books but it is natural too when

Spelling Book and Dictionary was there any decided uniformity of spelling Professor Earle says the process of compelling a uniform spelling is a strife against nature Certainly it took a long struggle against nature to make spelling uniform in America In the same letter men of high education would spell the same word several different ways There was no better usage in England The edition of Milton s Paradise Lost printed in sixteen eighty eight shows some very grotesque spelling Therefore it is not strange to find a New York teacher advertising to teach writeing and spilling To show that a fetich was made of spelling seventy five years ago I give this extract from a Danbury school notice The advantages that small children obtain at this school may be easily imagined when the public are informed that those who spell go through the whole of Webster s spelling book twice a fortnight The teaching of spelling in many schools was peculiar The master gave out the word with a blow of his strap on the desk as a signal for all to start together and the whole class spelled out the word in syllables in chorus The teacher s ear was so trained and acute that he at once detected any misspelling If this happened he demanded the name of the scholar who made the mistake If there was any hesitancy or refusal in acknowledgment he kept the whole class until by repeated trials of long words accuracy was obtained The roar of the many voices of the large school all pitched in different keys could be heard on summer days for a long distance In many country schools the scholars not only spelled aloud but studied all their lessons aloud as children in Oriental countries do to day and the teacher was quick to detect any lowering of the volume of sound and would reprove any child who was studying silently Sometimes the combined roar of voices became offensive to the neighbors of the school and restraining votes were passed at town meetings The colonial school and schoolmaster took a firm stand on cyphering The Bible and figgers is all I want my boys to know said an old farmer Arithmetic was usually taught without text books Teachers had manuscript sum books from which they gave out rules and problems in arithmetic to their scholars Abraham Lincoln learned arithmetic from a sum book of which he made a neat copy A page from this sum book is here given in reduced size Too often these sums were copied by the pupil without any explanation of the process being offered or rendered by the master The artist Trumbull recalled that he spent three weeks unaided in any way over a single sum in long division Illustration Page from Abraham Lincoln s Sum Book A manuscript sum book in my possession is marked Sarah Keeler her Book May ye first A D seventeen seventy three Ridgbury

not what for there are within their borders mysterious abbreviations and signs like some black magic Sainted Sarah Keeler a melancholy sympathy settles on me as I regard this book and all the extended sums you knew and think of the paths of pleasantness of the present pupils of kindergartens and wonder what kind of a mathematical song or game or allegory could be invented to disguise these very plain figures Sometimes a zealous teacher would write out tables of measures and a few blind rules for his scholars This amateur arithmetic would be copied and recopied until it was punctuated with

Battledore Lessons in Numbers Many scholars never saw a printed arithmetic and when the master had one for circulation it was scarcely more helpful than the sum book One of the most ancient arithmetics was written by the mathematician Record who lived from the year fifteen hundred to fifteen fifty eight He is said to have invented the sign of equality but there is nothing in his book to indicate this fact The terms arsemetrick and augrime are used in it instead of arithmetic Many curious and obsolete rules are given among them The Golden Rule Rule of Falsehood The Redeeming of Pawnes of Geams The Backer Rule of Thirds Here is a simple problem under the latter I did lend my friend three four of a Porteguise seven months upon promise that he should do as much for me again and when I should borrow of him he could lend me but five twelve of a Porteguese now I demand how long time I must keep his money in just Recompence of my loan accounting thirteen months in the year Rhyme is used in this book in dialogues between the master and scholar Copies of Cocker s Arithmetick are said to be very rare in England but I have seen several in America An edition was published in

Cocker Now to Rest thou rt Gone Noe Art can Show thee fully but thine Own Thy rare Arithmetick alone can show What vast Sums of Thanks wee for Thy Labour owe Ingenious Cocker as one would say Most noble Shakespeare It is hard indeed to idealize or write poetical tributes to one by the name of Cocker It gives us a sense of pleasant familiarity with any one to know that he is well acquaint with one of our intimate friends so I feel much drawn to ingenious Cocker by knowing that he was well known of Sam Pepys He was a writing master and did some mighty fine engraving for Pepys who calls him ingenuous not ingenious It is rather a facer to learn from the notes in the Diary that Cocker had nothing whatever to do with his Arithmetic which was a forgery by John Hawkins The age that would

The Golden rule is mie stumbling stule And Practice makes me mad After the Revolution in new and zealous Americanism text books by American authors outsold English books The blue backed spelling book of Noah Webster drove Perry and Dilworth from the field Bingham and Webster took advantage of the need of suitable school books and divided the field between them Webster s Spelling Book outstripped Bingham s Child s Companion but Bingham s Readers such as The American Preceptor and The Columbian Orator held their ground against Webster s Not one of Bingham s books proved a failure The Columbian Orator contained seven extracts from speeches of Pitt in opposition to the measures of George III it had speeches by Fox and Sheridan part of the address of President Carnot at the establishment of the French Republic and the famous speech of Colonel Barre on the Stamp Act Nicholas Pike of Newburyport Massachusetts wrote an arithmetic that routed the English books of Cocker and Hodder It was studied by many persons now living It had three hundred and sixty three barren rules and not a single explanation of one of them Many of them would now be wholly unintelligible to scholars though no more antiquated than are the methods for instance this rule in Tare and Trett Deduct the Tare and Trett Divide the Suttle by amount given the Quotient will be the Cloff which subtract from the Suttle the Remainder will be the Neat Illustration The Little Reader s Assistant by Noah Webster The tables of measures were longer than ours to day in measuring liquids were used the terms anchors tuns butts tierces kilderkins firkins puncheons et cetera In dry measure were pottles strikes cooms quarters weys lasts Examples in currency were in pounds shillings and pence and doubtless helped to retain the use of these terms in daily trade long after dollars had been coined in America This labored book aided by the flattering testimonials of Governor Bowdoin of the Presidents of Harvard Yale and Dartmouth Colleges and of that idolized American George Washington gained wide acceptance I have examined with care a Wingate s Arithmetic printed in sixteen twenty which was used for over a century in the Winslow family in Massachusetts Pythagoras his Table is of course our multiplication table Then comes the Rule of Three the double Golden Rule the Rule of Fellowship the Rule of False et cetera et cetera ending with Pastimes a collection of pleasant and polite Questions to exercise all the parts of Vulgar Arithmetick Here is one This Problem is usually propounded in this manner viz fifteen Christians and fifteen Turks being at Sea in one and the same Ship in a terrible Storm the Pilot declaring a necessity of casting the one half of those Persons into the Sea that the rest might be saved they all agreed that the persons to be cast away should be set out by lot after this manner viz the thirty persons should be placed in a round form like a Ring and then beginning to count at one of the Passengers and proceeding circularly every ninth person should be cast into the Sea until of the thirty persons there remained only fifteen The question is how those thirty persons ought to be placed that the lot might infallibly fall upon the fifteen Turks not upon any of the fifteen Christians For the more easie remembering of the rule to resolve this question shall presuppose the five vowels a e i o u to signifie five numbers to wit a one e two i three o four and u five then will the rule it self be briefly comprehended in these two following verses From numbers aid and art Never will fame depart In which verses you are principally to observe the vowels with their correspondent numbers before assigned and then beginning with the Christians the vowel o in from signifieth that four Christians are to be placed together next unto them the vowel u in num signifieth that five Turks are to be placed In like manner e in bers denoteth two Christians a in aid one Turk i in aid three Christians a in and one Turk a in art one Christian e in ne two Turks e in ver two Christians i in will three Turks a in fame one Christian e in fame two Turks e in de two Christians a in part one Turk The invention of the said Rule and such like dependeth upon the subsequent demonstration viz if the number of persons be thirty let thirty figures or cyphers be placed circularly or else in a right line as you see ooooooooooooooo I trust the little Winslows and their neighbors understood this sum and its explanation and that the Christians were all saved and the Turks were all drowned Geography was an accomplishment rather than a necessary study and was spoken of as a diversion for a winter s evening Many objections were made that it took the scholar s attention away from cyphering It was not taught in the elementary schools till this century Morse s Geography was not written till after the Revolution It had a mean little map of the United States only a few inches square On it all the land west of the Mississippi River was called Louisiana and nearly all north of the Ohio River the Northwestern Territory Small as the book was and meagre as was its information many of its pages were devoted to short stilted dialogues between a teacher and pupil in which the scholar was made to say such priggish sentences I am very thankful sir for your entertaining instruction and I shall never forget what you have been telling me I long sir for to morrow to come that I may hear more of your information I am truly delighted sir with the account you have given me of my country I wish sir it may be agreeable to you to give me a more particular description of the United States I hope sir I have a due sense of your goodness to me I have sir very cheerfully and I trust very profitably attended your instructions A rather amusing Geographical Catechism was published in seventeen ninety six by reverend Henry Pattillo a Presbyterian minister of North Carolina for the use of the university students It is properly and Presbyterianly religious It gives this explanation of comets Their uses are mere conjecture Some judge them the seats of punishment where sinners suffer the extremes of heat and cold mister Whiston says a comet approaching the sun brushed the earth with its tail and caused the deluge and that another will cause the conflagration Let us not be too eager to jeer at these ancient school books Pope wrote nearly two centuries ago Still is to morrow wiser than to day We think our fathers fools so wise we grow Our wiser sons no doubt will think us so Perhaps the series of text books which have chased each other in and out of our nineteenth century public schools under the successive boards of commissioners and school committees who have also flashed briefly on our educational horizon may cut no better figure two centuries hence than do those of Lilly and Pike and Cocker CHAPTER VII PENMANSHIP AND LETTERS Ink alwais good store on right hand to stand Brown paper for great haste or else box of sand Dip pen and shake pen and touch pen for haire Wax quills and penknife see alwais ye beare A New Book of Hands sixteen fifty circa In glancing over old school contracts it will be noted that in a majority of cases the teacher is specified as a writing master without doubt the chief requisite of a satisfactory teacher in colonial days was that he should be a good teacher of penmanship We have seen in our own day distinct changes in the handwriting of an entire generation the colonists whose lives ended with the seventeenth century had a characteristic handwriting which retained certain elements of old English even of mediaeval script It was a handsome and dignified chirography and an impressive one and was usually easy to read The writing of the first Pilgrim and Puritan fathers was not over good Governor John Winthrop s was not much better than Horace Greeley s Bradford s we are familiar with through the beautiful facsimiles of his Relation The first half of the succeeding century did not send forth such good writers nor did it send forth writers so universally the proportion of signatures to public documents by cross instead of writing increased Our grandparents and great grandparents all wrote well In hundreds of century old letters which I have examined an ill written letter is an exception Children at the close of the eighteenth century wrote beautifully rounded clear and uniform hands if we can judge from their copy books Little Anna Green Winslow writing in seventeen seventy one showed page after page in a hand far better than that of most girls of her age to day Claude Blanchard was commissary of supplies for the French army which landed in Newport in seventeen eighty He visited the Newport school and gave this tribute to the scholars I saw the writing of these children it appeared to me to be handsome among others that of a young girl nine or ten years old very pretty and very modest and such as I would like my own daughter to be when she is so old she was called Abigail Earle as I perceived upon her copy book on which her name was written I wrote it myself adding to it very pretty An exhibition piece is here given of the penmanship of Anne Reynolds a little girl of Norwich Connecticut who died shortly after this piece was written Writing masters were universally honored in every community A part of the funeral notice of one in Boston who died in seventeen sixty nine reads thus Last Friday morning died mister Abiah Holbrook in this town He was looked upon by the best Judges as the Greatest Master of the pen we ever had among us of which he has left a beautiful Demonstration This beautiful demonstration of his penmanship was a most intricate piece of what was known as fine knotting or knotwork It was said to be written in all the known hands of Great Britain and was valued at Lone hundred It was bequeathed to Harvard College unless it was bought by the Revolutionary patriot John Hancock who had been one of Master Holbrook s pupils and as we know from the fine bold signature of his own name to the Declaration of Independence was a very creditable scholar Illustration Exhibition Piece of Anne Reynolds This work had occupied every moment of what Abiah Holbrook called his spare time for seven years As he had in the year seventeen forty five two hundred and twenty scholars at one time in one school his spare time must have been very short He and other writing masters of the Holbrook family left behind a still nobler demonstration than this knotwork in the handwriting of their scholars Boston ministers merchants statesmen and patriots whose elegant penmanship really formed a distinct style and was known as Boston Style of Writing The hands of

noted that a penwiper is not upon the list Illustration Writing master s Initial In olden times but one kind of a pen was used one cut from a goose quill with the feathers left on the handle The selection and manufacture of these goose quill pens was a matter of considerable care in the beginning and of constant watchfulness and mending till the pen was worn out One of the indispensable qualities of a colonial schoolmaster was that he was a good pen maker and pen mender It often took the master and usher two hours to make the pens for the school Boys studied arithmetic at eleven years of age but were not allowed to make pens in school till they were twelve years old Ink was not bought in convenient liquid form as at present each family each person had to be an ink manufacturer The favorite method of ink making was through the dissolving of ink powder Liquid ink was but seldom seen for sale In remote districts of Vermont Maine and Massachusetts home made ink feeble and pale was made by steeping the bark of swamp maple in water boiling the decoction till thick and diluting it with copperas Each child brought to school an ink bottle or ink horn filled with the varying fluid of domestic manufacture Illustration Writing of Abiah Holbrook A book called The District School written as late as eighteen thirty four shows the indifferent quality of the ink used The writer complains that the parents made a poor ink of vinegar water and ink powder which the child could not use and permitted to dry up while he borrowed of the teacher The inkstand is then used at the evening meetings as a candlestick Other inkstands with good ink are seized and used for the same purpose and the ink ruined with grease and nothing left to write with when the teacher sets his scholars to work There are no remains of olden times that put us more closely in touch with the men women and children who moved and lived in these shadowy days than do the letters they wrote Old James Howell said over two centuries ago Letters are the Idea and the truest Miror of the Mind they shew the Inside of a Man Certainly the most imaginative mind must be touched with a sense of nearness to the heart of the writer whose yellowed pages he unfolds and whose fading words he deciphers The roll of centuries cannot dim the power of written words In the Prince Library in Boston are the manuscripts known under the various titles of the Mather Papers the Cotton Papers the Torrey Papers et cetera They are delightful to see and to read for the ink is still clear and black the paper firm and good the letters well formed and the text breathes a spirit of kindness affection and loving thoughtfulness that speaks of the beauty of Puritan home life Some of the letters are written by Puritan women and these letters are uniformly well spelt well written and intelligent Perhaps only intelligent women were taught to write These letters are on fine Dutch paper there was no English writing paper till the time of William and Mary They are carefully folded with due regard to the etiquette of letter folding and plainly and neatly addressed The letters are very tender and gentle sometimes they are written to children they begin My deare Child My Indear d Sonn To my dearly loved Friend and Child One ends With my Indeared Love committing thyself and thy duty and service to all our friends and to the protection of the Almighty I am thine A mother addresses on the outside her letter to her son in these words To my very good friend These Present et cetera John Cotton addresses a letter externally thus These For the Reverend his very deare Brother mister Increase Mather Teacher of a Church at Boston Present Sometimes the address ran Messenger present these to et cetera Hence it may be seen that the word Present sometimes seen on modern letters properly is the imperative verb Present Occasionally the words Haste post haste were seen as on English letters but I have never seen the old postal inscription Haste post haste on your Life on your Life A very genuine and pleasing letter was written by John Quincy Adams when he was nine years old to his father President John Adams BRAINTREE June the second seventeen seventy seven DEAR SIR I love to receive letters very well much better than I love to write them I make but a poor figure at composition my head is much too fickle my thoughts are running after bird s eggs play and trifles till I get vexed with myself I have but just entered the third vol of Smollett tho I had design d to have got it half through by this time I have determined this week to be more diligent as mister Thaxter will be absent at Court I cannot persue my other studies I have set myself a Stent determine to read the third Volume Half out If I can but keep my resolution I will write again at the end of the week and give a better account of myself I wish Sir you would give me some instructions with regard to my time advise me how to proportion my Studies my Play in writing I will keep them by me endeavour to follow them I am dear Sir with a present determination of growing better yours P S Sir if you will be so good as to favour me with a Blank Book I will transcribe the most remarkable occurrences I meet with in my reading which will serve to fix them upon my mind We cannot wonder at the precision and elegance of the letter writing of our forbears when we know the painful precepts of parents in regard to their children s penmanship and composition In the letters written by Ephraim Williams a plain New England farmer from his home in Stockbridge in the years seventeen forty nine et seq to his son Elijah while the latter was in Princeton College is shown the respect felt for a good handwriting Nearly every letter had some such sentences as these I would intreet you to endeavour daily to Improve yourself in writting and spelling they are very ornimentall to a scholar and the want of them is an exceeding great Blemish Illustration David Waite Seven Years Old I desire you would observe in your Wrighting to make proper Distances between words don t blend your words together use your utmost endeavours to spell

tells him not to follow his the father s writing for an example as he has but common English learning He reproves admonishes and finally says Elijah s sisters will prove better scholars than he is if he does not have a care which was a bitter taunt Major Dulany of Maryland wrote to his little daughter some very intelligent advice of which these lines are a portion In letter writing as in conversation it will be found that those who substitute the design of distinguishing themselves for that of giving pleasure to those whom they address must ever fail Having decided upon what is proper to be said accustom yourself to express it in the best possible manner Always use the words that most exactly correspond with the ideas you mean to express There are fewer synonymous words in our language than is generally supposed as you will find in looking over your Dictionary It has been remembered upon as a great excellence of general l Washington s writings that no one could substitute a single word which could so well express his meaning I have heard whether it be true or not I cannot say that for seven years of his life he never wrote without having his Dictionary before him The letters of Aaron Burr written at a little later period to his beloved daughter Theodosia show as unvarying and incessant pains to form perfection in letter writing as was displayed by Lord Chesterfield in his letters to his son When she was but ten or twelve we find Burr giving her minute instruction as to her penmanship its size shape the formation of sentences the spelling the exact use of synonyms He sends her sentences bidding her return them in a more elegant form to translate them into Latin He exhorts her to study the meaning use and etymology of every word in his letter He has her keep for him a daily journal written in a narrative style Even when on trial for treason in eighteen oh eight he still instructed her reproving her for her negligent failure to acknowledge letters received He commended her style saying she had energy and aptitude of expression altogether I can fancy no rule of correct epistolary conduct left unsaid by Burr to his daughter That he had a high opinion of her powers we cannot doubt but the specimens of her composition that exist show no great brilliancy or originality As books multiplied after the Revolution many letters were modelled on effusions that had been seen and admired in print this at a loss of much naturalness and quaintness of expression Letter writing guides formed the most pernicious influence Miss Stoughton of East Windsor inviting sprightly Nancy Williams of East Hartford to a gay party began her note in this surprising way Worthy Lady Children and grown people too had a very reprehensible habit of scribbling in their books Of course each owner wrote his name with more or less elegance and accompanying flourishes according to his capacity Some very valuable autographs have by this means been preserved A single title page will often bear the names of several owners They also wrote various rhymes and sentiments which might be gathered under the head of title page lore The most ancient rhyme I have seen is dated sixteen thirty five and is in an ancient Cocker s Arithmetic John Greene or Graves his book God give Him Grace theirein to look Not oneley to look but to Understand That Larning is better than House or Land This rhyme is frequently seen sometimes with the added lines When Land is Gone and Money Spent Then Larning is most excellent If this you See Remember Me Another rhyme is Steal not this Book for if You Do The Devil will be after You Longer and more formal rhymes are found in the books of older owners Occasionally a child s book had a valentine sentiment or a riddle or a drawing of hearts and darts crude pictures of Indians and horses are many I have seldom found verses from the Bible or religious sentiments written in childish hands Whether this is the result of profound respect or of indifference I cannot tell As a special example of book scribbling one of historical interest is given a page of the famous White Bible which contains the entry much disputed of genealogical and historical societies that John Howland married Governor Carver s grand darter Illustration Page from White Bible CHAPTER VIII DIARIES AND COMMONPLACE BOOKS And such his judgment so exact his text As what was best in bookes as what bookes best That had he join d those notes his labours tooke From each most praised and praise deserving booke And could the world of that choise treasure boast It need not care though all the rest were lost And such his wit he writ past what he quotes And his productions farre exceed his notes Eglogue on the Death of Ben Jonson Lucius Cary Lord Falkland sixteen thirty seven Grown folk had in colonial days a habit of keeping diaries and making notes in interleaved almanacs but they are not of great value to the historian for they are not what Wordsworth declared such compositions should be namely abundant in observation and sparing of reflection They are instead barren of accounts of happenings and descriptions of surroundings and are chiefly devoted to weather reports and moral and religious reflections both original and in the form of sermon and lecture notes The note taking habit of Puritan women was held up by such detractors as Bishop Earle as one of their most contemptible traits To day we can simply deplore it as having been such a vain thing for it is certainly true no matter how deeply religious in feeling any one of the present day may be that to the modern mind a long course of the pious sentiments and religious aspirations of others is desperately tiresome reading Such records were not tiresome however to those of Puritan faith there were but few old time diaries which were not composed on those lines The chief exception is that historical treasure house Judge Sewall s diary which shows plainly also the deep religious feeling of its author Another of more restricted interest but of value is that of doctor Parkman the Westborough minister Governor Winthrop s History has much of the diary element in it Naturally the diaries of children copied in quality and wording those of their elders A unique exception in these youthful records is the journal of a year or two of the life of a Boston schoolgirl Anna Green Winslow Fortunately little Anna s desire to report the sermons she had heard at the Old South Church and to moralize in ambitious theological comments thereon was checked by the sensible aunt with whom she lived who said A Miss of twelve years cant possibly do justice to nice Subjects in Divinity and therefore had better not attempt a repetition of particulars We therefore have a story of her life not of her thoughts and many references to her diary appear in this volume Illustration Anna Green Winslow It is curious and interesting to note how Puritan traits and habits lingered in generation after generation and outlived change of environment and mode of living In sixteen thirty reverend John White of Dorchester England brought out a Puritan colony which settled in Massachusetts and named the village Dorchester after their English home In sixteen ninety five a group of the descendants of these settlers once more emigrated to Carolina Tradition asserts that they were horrified at the persecution of witches in Massachusetts Upham names one Daniel Andrew as a man who protested so vigorously against the prevailing folly and persecution that he was compelled to fly to South Carolina Thomas Staples was fearless enough to sue and obtain judgment against the Deputy Governor for saying Goodwife Staples was a witch and members of his family went also to South Carolina With loyalty to their two Dorchester homes a third Dorchester in South Carolina was named They built a good church which is still standing though the village has entirely disappeared and the site is overgrown with large trees Indian wars poor government church oppression and malaria once more drove forth these undaunted Puritans to found a fourth Dorchester in Georgia In seventeen fifty two they left in a body took up a grant of twenty two thousand acres in saint John s Parish and formed the Midway Church Their meeting house was headquarters for the Whigs during the Revolution was burned by the British rebuilt in seventeen ninety and is still standing In it meetings are held every spring by hundreds of the descendants of its early members though it is remote from railroads and swamps and pine barrens have taken the place of smiling rice and cotton fields Stories of the rigidity of church government of these people still exist The tradition of one child who smiled in Midway Church was for generations held up with horror as though she had hoofs and horns There attended this church a descendant of both Andrew and Staples the scoffers at witches one Mary Osgood Sumner She had a short and sad life Married at eighteen she was a widow at twenty and with her sister missus Holmes an aunt of Oliver Wendell Holmes and another sister Anne sailed from Newport to New York and were never heard of more Illustration Pages from the Diary of Mary Osgood Sumner She left behind her sermon notes and a Monitor or diary which had what she called a black list of her childish wrong doings omissions of duty et cetera while the white list showed the duties she performed Though she was evidently absolutely conscientious these are the only entries on the Black Leaf July eight I left my staise on the bed nine Misplaced Sister s sash ten Spoke in haste to my little Sister spilt the cream on the floor in the closet twelve I left Sister Cynthia s frock on the bed sixteen I left the brush on the chair was not diligent in learning at school seventeen I left my fan on the bed nineteen I got vexed because Sister was a going to cut my frock twenty two Part of this day I did not improve my time well thirty I was careless and lost my needle Aug five I spilt some coffee on the table Not a very heinous list Here are entries from the good page of her little Monitor WHITE LEAF July eight I went and said my Catechism to day Came home and wrote down the questions and answers then dressed and went to the dance endeavoured to behave myself decent eleven I improved my time before breakfast after breakfast made some biscuits and did all my work before the sun was down twelve I went to meeting and paid good attention to the sermon came home and wrote down as much of it as I could remember seventeen I did everything before breakfast endeavored to improve in school went to the funeral in the afternoon attended to what was said came home and wrote down as much as I could remember twenty five A part of this day I parsed and endeavored to do well and a part of it I made some tarts and did some work and wrote a letter twenty seven I did everything this morning same as usual went to school and endeavored to be diligent came home and washed the butter and assisted in getting coffee twenty eight I endeavored to be diligent to day in my learning went from school to sit up with the sick nursed her as well as I could thirty I was pretty diligent at my work to day and made a pudding for dinner Aug one I got some peaches for to stew after I was done washing up the things and got my work and was midlin Diligent four I did everything before breakfast and after breakfast got some peaches for Aunt Mell and then got my work and stuck pretty close to it and at night sat up with Sister and nursed her as good as I could eight I stuck pretty close to my work to day and did all that Sister gave me and after I was done I swept out the house and put the things to rights nine I endeavored to improve my time to day in reading and attending to what Brother read and most of the evening I was singing I have given this record of this monotonous young life in detail simply to prove the simplicity of the daily round of a child s life at that time The pages prove with equal force the domination of the Puritan temperament a nervous desire and intent to be good and industrious and attentive and helpful We seldom meet that temperament in children nowadays and when we do it is sure to be as in this case a Puritan inheritance John Quincy Adams when eleven years old determined to write a Journal and he thus lucidly and sensibly explains his intentions to his mother HONOURED MAMMA My Pappa enjoins it upon me to keep a journal or diary of the Events that happen to me and of objects I see and of Characters that I converse with from day to day and altho I am convinced of the utility importance necessity of this Exercise yet I have not patience perseverance enough to do it so Constantly as I ought My Pappa who takes a great deal of Pains to put me in the right way has also advised me to Preserve copies of all my letters and has given me a Convenient Blank Book for this end and altho I shall have the mortification a few years hence to read a great deal of my Childish nonsense yet I shall have the Pleasure and advantage of Remarking the several steps by which I shall have advanced in taste judgment and knowledge A journal Book a letter Book of a Lad of Eleven years old can not be expected to contain much of Science Litterature arts wisdom or wit yet it may serve to perpetuate many observations that I may make may hereafter help me to recolect both Persons things that would other ways escape my memory My father has given me hopes of a Pencil Pencil Book in which I can make notes upon the spot to be transferred afterwards to my Diary and my letters this will give me great pleasure both because it will be a sure means of improvement to myself make me to be more entertaining to you I am my ever honoured and revered Mamma your Dutiful Affectionate Son JOHN QUINCY ADAMS Illustration Joshua Carter Four Years Old seventeen sixty five I believe this diary so carefully decided upon does not now exist The Adams family preserved a vast number of family papers but this was not among them I am sorry for I find John Quincy Adams a very pleasing child When he was about seven years old his father was away from home as a delegate to a Congress in Philadelphia which sought to secure unity of action among the rebellious colonies His patriotic mother taught her boy in their retreat at Braintree to repeat daily each morning with the Lord s Prayer Collins inspiring ode beginning How sleep the brave who sink to rest et cetera Later in life Adams wrote to a Quaker friend For the space of twelve months my mother with her infant children dwelt liable every hour of the day and of the night to be butchered in cold blood or taken and carried into Boston as hostages My mother lived in unintermitted danger of being consumed with them all in a conflagration kindled by a torch in the same hands which on the seventeenth of June seventeen seventy five lighted the fires of Charlestown I saw with my own eyes those fires and heard Britannia s thunders in the Battle of Bunker Hill and witnessed the tears of my mother and mingled them with my own The mother took her boy by the hand and mounted a height near their home and showed him the distant signs of battle Thus she fixed an impression of a war for liberty on his young memory Two years later to relieve her anxious and tedious waiting for intelligence from her husband the boy became post rider for her between Braintree and Boston which towns were eleven miles apart not a light or easy task for the nine year old boy with the unsettled roads and unsettled times The spirit of patriotism which filled the mind of all grown folk was everywhere reflected in the minds of the children Josiah Quincy was at school in Andover from seventeen seventy eight to seventeen eighty six and he stated that he and his schoolmates had as a principle as a schoolboy law that every hoop sled et cetera should in some way bear thirteen marks This was evidence of the good political character of the owner and if the marks were wanting the article was contraband was seized and forfeited without judge jury or power of appeal Besides journal keeping folks of that day had a useful custom of keeping a commonplace book that is they wrote out in a blank book memorable sentences or words which attracted their attention or admiration in the various books they read or made abstracts or notes of the same Cotton Mather tells of such note making by young students This writing out of aphorisms statements et cetera not only fixed them in the memory but kept them where the memory if faulty could easily be assisted It also served as practice in penmanship A verb to commonplace came from this use of the word The biography of Francis North Baron Guildford gave an account which explains fully commonplacing It was his lordship s constant practice to commonplace as he read He had no bad memory but was diffident and would not trust it He acquired a very small but legible hand for where contracting is the main business of law it is not well to write as the fashion now is in uncial or semi uncial letters to look like a pig s ribs His writing on his commonplaces was not by way of index but epitome because he used to say the looking over a commonplace book on any occasion gave him a sort of survey of what he had read about matters not then inquisited which refreshed them somewhat in his memory People invented methods of keeping commonplace books and gave rules and instructions in commonplacing I have seen several commonplace books made by children of colonial times pathetic memorials in every case of children who died in early youth Tender and loving hearts have saved those little unfinished records of childish reading after the way of mothers and fathers till the present day whose grieved affections cannot bear the thought even of reverent destruction of the irregular writing of a dearly loved child whose hands are folded in death One of these books with scantily filled pages was tied with a number of note books of an old New England minister and in the father s handwriting on the first leaf were these words Fifty years ago died my little John A child of promise Alas alas January tenth eighteen oh five Illustration Page from Diary of Anna Green Winslow The matter read by those children is clearly indicated by their commonplace books One entry shows evidence of light reading It is of riddles which are headed Guesses they are the ones familiar to us all in Mother Goose s Melodies to day The answers are written in a most transparent juvenile shorthand Thus the answer Well is indicated by the figures twenty three five twelve twelve referring to the position of the letters in the alphabet The usual entries are of a religious character extracts from sermons answers from the catechism verses of hymns accompany stilted religious aspirations and appeals In them a painful familiarity with and partiality for quotations bearing on hell and the devil show the religious teaching of the times CHAPTER IX CHILDISH PRECOCITY Where babies much to their surprise Were born astonishingly wise With every Science on their lips And Latin at their finger tips Bab Ballads W S Gilbert eighteen seventy seven The seventeenth century was in Europe a period of eager development and hasty harvesting English boys were made serious minded by the conditions they saw around them as well as by a forcing house system of education begun at very early years This early ageing is reflected in the writings of the times The Religio Medici apparently the composition of a man of the large experience and serene contemplation of extreme age was written by Sir Thomas Browne when he was but thirty Illustration Samuel Torrey Twelve Years Old seventeen seventy There are many records of the precocity of children preserved for us many times alas through the sad recounting of early deaths One of the most pathetic records of a father s blasted hopes may be found in the pages of the diary of John Evelyn In December sixteen fifty eight died his little son Richard five years and three days old He was a prodigy of wit and learning as beautiful as an angel and of rare mental endowment His father s account of his acquirements runs thus He had learned all his catechism at two years and a half old he could perfectly read any of the English Latin French or Gothic letters pronouncing the first three languages exactly He had before the fifth year or in that year not only skill to read most written hands but to decline all the nouns conjugate the verbs regular and most of the irregular learned out Puerelis got by heart almost the entire vocabulary of Latin and French primitives and words could make congruous syntax turn English into Latin and vice versa construe and prove what he read and did the government and use of relatives verbs substantives ellipses and many figures and tropes and made a considerable progress in Comenius Janua begun himself to write legibly and had a strong passion for Greek The number of verses he could recite was prodigious and what he remembered of the parts of plays which he would also act and when seeing a Plautus in one s hand he asked what book it was and being told it was comedy and too difficult for him he wept for sorrow Strange was his apt and ingenious application of fables and morals for he had read AEsop he had a wonderful disposition to mathematics having by heart divers propositions of Euclid that were read to him in play and he would make lines and demonstrate them He had learned by heart divers sentences in Latin and Greek which on occasion he would produce even to wonder He was all life all prettiness far from morose sullen or childish in any thing he said or did Of course this is not given as an ordinary education of an every day child It is an extraordinary record of a very unusual child but it shows what an intelligent child could be permitted to do Evelyn was a man of great good sense not the sort of man who would force a child indeed he averred that he abhorred precocity But in truth it was a time in England s history when such a child could easily be overstimulated when public events the course of history was so exciting that every child of keen wit must have felt the effects The crowding of young minds did not end with the seventeenth century A striking example of the desire to press education is found in the letters of Lord Chesterfield to his son beginning in seventeen thirty eight when the boy was not six years old The language and subjects would be deemed to day suited only to mature minds In seventeen forty one the father wrote This is the last letter I shall write to you as a little boy for to morrow you will attain your ninth year so that for the future I shall treat you as a youth You must now commence a different course of life a different course of studies No more levity Childish toys and playthings must be thrown aside and your mind directed to serious objects What was not unbecoming to a child would be disgraceful to a youth et cetera Letter after letter continued in this tone For years was the process carried on The result was a striking proof of the futility of such methods The son died when but little past his youth a failure in everything the father had most fondly desired and striven for The crowded brain ever stumbled and hesitated when put to any important test It was inevitable that New England parents with their fairly passionate intensity of zeal for the education of their children should in many cases overstimulate and force the infant minds in their charge It seems somewhat anomalous with the almost universal distrust and hindrance of female education that one of the most precocious flowers of Puritanism should have been a girl the pious and ingenious missus Jane Turell who was born in Boston in seventeen oh eight Before her second year was finished she could speak distinctly knew her letters and could relate many stories out of the Scriptures to the satisfaction and pleasure of the most judicious Governor Dudley and other wise and polite New England gentlemen were among those entitled judicious who placed her on a table to show off her acquirements When she was three years old she could recite the greater part of the Assembly s Catechism many of the psalms many lines of poetry and read distinctly at the age of four she asked many astonishing questions about divine mysteries As her father was President of Harvard College it may be inferred she had an extended reading course but in a catalogue of Harvard College library printed a year or two later there is not a title in it of any of the works of Addison or any of the poems of Pope nothing of Dryden Steele Young or Prior In seventeen twenty two when Jane Turell was twenty years old the works of Shakespeare were first advertised for sale in Boston Illustration The Copley Family In many families of extreme Puritanical thought the children developed at an early age a comprehension of religious matters which would seem abnormal to day but was natural then A striking instance of this youthful development as he was of highly sensitive thought of every description was Jonathan Edwards A letter of his written when he was twelve years old is certainly precocious in its depth though there is a certain hint of humor in it Some one had stated the belief that the soul was material and remained in the body until after the resurrection Young Edwards wrote I am informed y t you have advanced a notion y t the soul is material and keeps w th y e body till y e resurrection As I am a profest lover of novelty you must alow me to be much entertained by this discovery one saint I w d know whether this material soul keeps w th in ye Coffin and if so whether it might not be convenient to build a repository for it in order w ch

His paper on spiders written when he was but twelve has become famous as a bit of childish composition It shows great habits of observance care in note taking and logical reasoning and bears no evidence of youth either in matter or manner A typical example of the spirit of the times in regard to juvenile education is found in the letters of missus Pinckney She writes to a friend Shall I give you the trouble my dear Madam to buy my son a new toy a description of which I inclose to teach him according to mister Locke s method which I have carefully studied to play himself into learning mister Pinckney his father himself has been contriving a sett of toys to teach him his letters by the time he can speak You perceive we begin betimes for he is not yet four months old This toy may have been what is known to day as a set of alphabet blocks a commonplace toy Locke speaks of a game of dice with letters with which children could play a game like royal oak and through which they would learn to spell He was not the inventor of these letter dice as is generally asserted It was a stratagem of Sir Hugh Plat fully explained and illustrated in his Jewel House of Art and Nature printed in London in sixteen fifty three a portion of a page of which is shown here The toy seems to have been a success for the following year missus Pinckney writes to her sister Your little nephew not yet two and twenty months old prattles very intelligibly he gives his duty to you and thanks for the toys and desires me to tell his Aunt Polly that if she don t take a care and a great deal of pains in her learning he will soon be the best scholar for he can tell his letters in any book without hesitation and begins to spell before he is two years old This precocious infant afterward General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of Revolutionary fame declared in his later life that this early teaching was sad stuff and that the haste to make him a very clever fellow nearly made him a very stupid one Illustration A ready way for children to learn their A B C Cau f e four large dice of bone or wood to be made and upon every f quare one of the f mal letters of the cro f s row to be graven

and Nature Little Martha Laurens born in Charleston South Carolina in seventeen fifty nine could in her third year read any book and like many another child since her day learned to read holding the book upside down Joseph T Buckingham declared that when he was four years old he knew by heart nearly all the reading lessons in the primer and much of the Westminster Catechism Boys entered the Boston Latin School when as young as but six years and a half old They began to study Latin frequently when much younger Zealous and injudicious parents sometimes taught infants but three years old to read Latin words as soon as they could English ones It redounds to the credit of the scholarship of one of my kinsmen rather than to his good sense or good temper albeit he was a minister of the Gospel that each morning while he shaved his little son five years of age stood by his dressing table on a footstool and read Latin to his father who had also a copy of the same book open before him that he might note and correct the child s errors And the child when grown to old age told his children and grandchildren that his father angered at what he deemed slowness of progress frequent errors of pronunciation and poor attempts at translation would throw the book at the child and once felled him from the footstool to the floor Illustration Polly Flagg One Year Old seventeen fifty one It is told of Timothy Dwight President of Yale College that he learned the alphabet at a single lesson and could read the Bible before he was four years old and taught it to his comrades At the age of six he was sent to the grammar school and importuned his father to let him study Latin Being denied he studied through the Latin grammar twice without a teacher borrowing a book of an older boy He would have been prepared for college when but eight years old had not the grammar school luckily discontinued and left him without a teacher The curriculum at Harvard in olden times bore little resemblance to that of to day Sciences were unknown and the requirements in mathematics were meagre Still a boy needed even then to be clever to know enough Greek and Latin to enter at eleven Paul Dudley did so in sixteen eighty six His father wrote to the president a quaint letter of introduction I have humbly to offer you a little sober and well disposed son who tho very young if he may have the favour of admittance I hope his learning may be tollerable and for him I will promise that by your care and my care his own Industry and the blessing of God this mother the University shall not be ashamed to allow him the place of a son Appoint a time when he may be examined There were still younger college students In seventeen ninety nine there was graduated from Rhode Island College now Brown University a boy named John Pitman who was barely fourteen There is no evidence that the early marriages that is marriages of children and very young lads and girls which were far from rare in England during the first years of our colonial life ever were permitted in the new world Nor were they as common at that date in England as during the previous century for there had been severe legislation against them especially against the youthful marriages of poor folk Many have known of the juvenile weddings of English princes and princesses and marriages by proxy for reasons of state but few know of these unions being general among English people An interesting and authoritative book on this subject was published in eighteen ninety seven by the Early English Text Society doctor Furnivall made a careful study of the old court records of the town of Chester England and published this account of trials and law cases concerning child marriages divorces ratifications troth plights affiliations clandestine marriages and other kindred matters It is as the editor says a most light giving volume It ranges over all classes from people of wealth the manor owners and squires to ale house keepers farmers cobblers maids and men It tells of the marriages of little children in their nurses arms some but two or three years old so young that their baby tongues could not speak the words of matrimony Various arrangements chiefly relating to lands and maintenance led to these marriages also a desire to evade the Crown s guardianship of orphans In one case a bigge damsell of twelve intysed with two apples a younger boy to marry her The woman tempted me and I did eat One little bridegroom of three was held up in the arms of an English clergyman who coaxed him to repeat the words of the service Before it was finished the child said he would learn no more of his lesson that day The parson answered You must speak a little more and then go play yon The child marriage of the Earl and Countess of Essex in sixteen oh six resulting in the poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury and the Countess marriage to the Earl of Somerset is a well known historical example of the unhappy result of such marriages The Earl of Anglesey s grandson was married in sixteen seventy three when he was eight years old Mary Hewitt of Danton Basset was wedded in sixteen sixty nine when three years old In sixteen seventy two John Evelyn was present at the marriage of Lord Arlington s only daughter a sweet child if there ever was any aged five to the Duke of Grafton I have given the dates of these later child marriages to show that they were not unusual in England long after America was settled As late as seventeen twenty nine a little English girl of some wealth and but nine years old was taken from her boarding school by her guardian and married to his son Very differently did the upright New Englander regard the duties of guardianship A little girl named Rebecca Cooper was left an orphan in early colonial days at Salem Massachusetts She was a verie good match an inheritrice and the sharp eyes of Emanuel Downing and his wife were upon her to make a motion of marriage for their son Both wrote to Governor Winthrop Madam Downing s brother to gain his intercession in the matter though the maid had not been spoken to Madam wrote The disposition of the mayde and her education with missus Endicott are hopefull her person tollerable the estate very convenient and that is the state of the business Governor Endicott was the guardian and his answering letter to Winthrop has a manly and honorable ring which might well have sounded in the ears of all English guardians Illustration James Flagg Five Years Old seventeen forty four I am told you are sollicited in a busniss concerninge the girle which was putt to my warde and trust I have not been made acquainted with it by you know whome which if there had been any such intendment I think had been but reason But to let that passe I pray you advise not to stirre in it for it will not be affected for reasons I shall show you The Lord knows I have alwais resolved and so hath my wife ever since the girl came to vs to yielde her vp to be disposed by yourself to any of yours if ever the Lord should make her fitt and worthie Now for the other for whom you writt I confesse I cannot freelie yeald thereunto for the present for these grounds ffirst The girle desires not to mary as yet secondlee Shee confesseth which is the truth hereselfe to be altogether yett vnfitt for such a condition shee beinge a verie girl and but fifteen yeares of age thirdlie Where the man was moved to her shee said shee could not like him fourthlie You know it would be of ill reporte that a girl because shee hath some estate should bee disposed of soe young espetialie not having any parents to choose for her ffifthlie I have some good hopes of the child s coming on to the best thinges And on the other side I fear I will say no more Other things I shall tell you when we meet If this will not satisfy some let the Court take her from mee and place with any other to dispose of her I shall be content Which I heare was plotted to accomplish this end but I will further enquire about it and you shall know if it be true ffor I know there are many passages about this busniss which when you heare of you will not like It is pleasant to record that all this match making and machination came to naught It would not have been strange if Governor Winthrop had deemed this girl old enough to be married He had been but seventeen years old himself when he was married but he was so he writes a man in stature and understanding He evidently was of the opinion that a child of fourteen or fifteen was of mature years When his son John was but fourteen the governor made a will making the boy the executor of it These child marriages were not abolished in America because maturity or majority was established at a greater age for up to the Revolution boys reached man s estate at sixteen years of age became tax payers and served in the militia Early unions were controlled by restrictive laws such as the one enacted in Massachusetts in sixteen forty six that no female orphan during her minority should be given in marriage by any one except with the approbation of the majority of the selectmen of the town in which she resided Another privilege of the girl orphan was that at fourteen she could choose her own guardian Thus were children protected in the new world and their rights conserved CHAPTER X OLDTIME DISCIPLINE My child and scholar take good heed unto the words that here are set And see thou do accordingly or else be sure thou shalt be beat The English Schoolmaster Edward Coote sixteen eighty The manner of oldtime children differed as much from the carriage of children to day as the severe and arbitrary modes of discipline of colonial days differed from the persuasive explanations the moral inculcations and exhortations by which modern youth are influenced to obedience Parents teachers and ministers chanted in solemn and unceasing chorus Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child and they believed the only cure for that foolishness was in stern repression and sharp correction above all in the rod They found abundant support for this belief in the Bible their constant guide John Robinson the Pilgrim preacher said in his essay on Children and Their Education Surely there is in all children though not alike a stubbernes and stoutnes of minde arising from naturall pride which must in the first place be broken and beaten down that so the foundation of their education being layd in humilitie and tractablenes other virtues may in their time be built thereon It is commendable in a horse that he be stout and stomackfull being never left to his own government but always to have his rider on his back and his bit in his mouth but who would have his child like his horse in his brutishnes The chief field of the breaking and beating down process was in school English schoolmasters were proverbial for their severity and from earliest days though monks with their classes are never depicted with the rod We find Agnes Paston in fourteen fifty seven writing to London for word to be delivered to the schoolmaster of her son Clement who was then sixteen years old If he hath nought do well nor wyll nought amend pray hym that he wyll trewly belassch hym tyll he wyll amend and so did the last master and the best that ever he had at Cambridge And say I wyll give hym X marks for hys labor for I had lever he were beryed than lost for defaute Illustration Katherine Ten Broeck Three Years Old seventeen nineteen She herself had borne on hand on her marriageable daughter beating her every week sometime twice a day and her head broken in two or three places This seems to have been the usual custom of the British matron in high life Lady Jane Grey when she was fifteen years old never came into the presence of her father and mother but she was sharply taunted cruelly threatened yea punished sometimes with pinches nips bobs and other way Elizabeth Lady Falkland as long as her mother lived always spoke to that rigid lady while kneeling before her sometimes for more than an hour together though she was but an ill kneeler and worse riser Poor Elizabeth she was an only child an inheritrice but she could truthfully aver she never was spoiled An early allusion to school discipline is in the Boy Bishop s Sermon from the press of Wynkyn de Worde who died in fifteen thirty five It runs thus There is no fault he doth but he is punished Sometimes he wringeth him by the ear sometimes he giveth him a strype on the hand with the ferrul sometimes beateth him sharply with the rod Great Cromwell was sent off to school with injunctions to the master doctor Beard to flog the boy soundly for persisting in the wickedness of the assertion that he had had a vision and prophecy of his future greatness doctor Johnson told of the unmerciful beating he had by one Master Hunter who was very wrong headedly severe He said the man never distinguished between ignorance and negligence and beat as hard for not knowing a thing as for neglecting to know it and as he whipped would shout This I do to save you from the gallows Still the Doctor was grateful for the beatings as he felt to them he owed his knowledge of Latin and he approved of the rod saying of some well behaved young ladies whose mother had whipped them oft and heavily in variation of one of Shakespeare s lines Rod I will honor thee for this thy duty His creed of correction was this I would rather have the rod to be the general terror to all to make them learn than to tell a child if you do this or thus you will be more esteemed than your brothers and sisters The rod produces an effect which terminates in itself A child is afraid of being whipped and gets his task and there s an end on t Whereas by exciting emulation and comparisons of superiority you lay the foundation of lasting mischief you make brothers and sisters hate each other The illustrations of old Dutch books that show school furniture have the odd ferules of monkish days the flat ladle shaped pieces of wood which were distinctly for striking the palm of the scholar s hand The derivation of the word ferule is interesting It is from ferula fennel The tough stalks of the giant fennel of Southern Europe were used by the Roman schoolmasters as an instrument of castigation Illustration twenty one THE DUNCE This is a sight to give us pain Once seen ne er wished to see again Illustration from Plain Things for Little Folks Old English lesson books of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries many even of the early years of this century that have any illustrations of classes schoolmasters or school interiors invariably picture the master with a rod or bunch of birch twigs An old herbalist says I have not red of any vertue byrche hath in physick howbeit it serveth many good uses and none better than for the betynge of stubborn boyes that either lye or will not learn Birch rods were tauntingly sold on London streets with a cry by pedlers of Buy my fine Jemmies Buy my London Tartars Even that miserable Dyves Pragmaticus enumerated Fyne Rod for Children of Wyllow and Burche among his wares A crowning insult was charging the cost of birch rod on schoolboys bills and in some cases making the boy pay for the birch out of his scant spending money Birch trees were plentiful in America and whippings too Scholars in New England were not permitted to forget the methods of discipline of the good old days Massachusetts schools resounded with strokes of the rod Varied instruments of chastisement were known from A besomme of byrche for babes verye fit To a long lasting lybbet for lubbers as meet A lybbet was a billet of wood and the heavy walnut stick of one Boston master well deserved the name A cruel inquisitor invented an instrument of torture which he termed a flapper It was a heavy piece of leather six inches in diameter with a hole in the middle This was fastened by an edge to a pliable handle Every stroke on the bare flesh raised a blister the size of the hole in the leather Equally brutal was the tattling stick a cat o nine tails with heavy leather straps The whipping with this tattling stick was ordered to be done upon a peaked block whatever that may be That fierce Boston disciplinarian and patriot Master Lovell whipped with strong birch rods and made one culprit mount the back of another scholar to receive his lashing He called these whippings trouncings the good old English word of the Elizabethan dramatists Another brutal Boston master struck his scholars on the head with a ferule until this was forbidden by the school directors he then whipped the soles of the scholars feet and roared out in an ecstasy of cruelty Oh the Caitiffs it is good for them There was sometimes an aftermath of sorrow when our stern old grandfathers whipped their children at home for being whipped at school so told reverend Eliphalet Nott Illustration Whispering Sticks Many ingenious punishments were invented A specially insulting one was to send the pupil out to cut a small branch of a tree A split was made by the teacher at the severed end of the branch and the culprit s nose was placed in the cleft end Then he was forced to stand painfully pinched an object of ridicule A familiar punishment of the dame school which lingered till our own day was the smart tapping of the child s head with a heavy thimble this was known as thimell pie Another was to yoke two delinquents together in a yoke made with two bows like an ox yoke Sometimes times a boy and girl were yoked together a terrible disgrace Whispering sticks were used to preserve quiet in the schoolroom Two are shown here wooden gags to be tied in the mouth with strings somewhat as a bit is placed in a horse s mouth Children were punished by being seated on a unipod a stool with but a single leg upon which it was most tiring to try to balance they were made to stand on dunce stools and wear dunce caps and heavy leather spectacles they were labelled with large placards marked with degrading or ridiculous names such as Tell Tale Bite Finger Baby Lying Ananias Idle Boy and Pert Miss Prat a Pace One of Miss Hetty Higginson s punishments in her Salem school at the beginning of this century was to make a child hold a heavy book such as a dictionary by a single leaf Of course any restless motion would tear the leaf Her rewards of merit should be also told She would divide a single strawberry in minute portions among six or more scholars and she had a bussee or good child who was to be kissed Many stories have been told of special punishments invented by special teachers The schoolmaster at Flatbush was annoyed by the children in his school constantly using Dutch words as he was employed to teach them English He gave every day to the first scholar who used a Dutch word a little metal token or medal This scholar could promptly transfer the token to the next child who spoke a Dutch word and so on thus it went from hand to hand through the day But the unlucky scholar who had the token in his possession at the close of school received a sound whipping An amusing method of securing good lessons and good behavior was employed by old Ezekiel Cheever and was thus told by one of his pupils reverend John Barnard I was a very naughty boy much given to play in so much that Master Cheever openly declared You Barnard I know you can do well enough if you will but you are so full of play you hinder your classmates from getting their lessons therefore if any of them cannot perform their duty I shall correct you for it One day one of my classmates did not look at his book and could not say his lesson though I called upon him once and again to mind his book Whereupon our master beat me The boy was pleased with my being corrected and persisted in his neglect for which I was still beaten and that for several days I thought in justice I ought to correct the boy and compel him to a better temper therefore after school was done I went to him and told him I had been beaten several times for his neglect and since master would not correct him I would and then drubbed him heartily The famous Lancasterian system that of monitorial schools discountenanced the rod but the forms of punishment were not wholly above criticism They were the neck and hands pillory familiar up to that date in England and America as a public punishment of criminals wooden shackles hanging in a sack tying the legs together and labelling with the name of the offence against rules Illustration twelve Falsehood Punished Illustration from Early Seeds to Produce Spring Flowers I have found nothing to show that Dutch schoolmasters were as severe as those of the English colonies doctor Curtius the first master of the Latin School in New Amsterdam complained that his hands were tied as some of the parents of his scholars forbade him punishing their children and that as a result these unruly young Dutchmen beat each other and tore the clothes from each other s backs The contract between the Flatbush Church and schoolmaster dated sixteen eighty two specifies that he shall demean himself patient and friendly towards the children The discipline of Master Leslie a New York teacher of the next century is described by Eliza Morton Quincy in her delightful Memoirs The date is about seventeen eighty two His modes of punishment would astonish children of the present day One of them was to hold the blocks They were of two sizes The large one was a heavy block of wood with a ring in the centre by which it was to be held a definite number of minutes according to the magnitude of the offence The smaller block was for the younger child Another punishment was by a number of leathern straps about an inch wide and a finger long with which he used to strap the hands of the larger boys One German schoolmaster Samuel Dock stands out in relief in this desert of ignorance and cruelty With simplicity and earnestness he wrote in seventeen fifty the story of his successful teaching as in simplicity and earnestness he had taught in his school at Shippack His story is as homely as his life HOW I RECEIVE THE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL It is done in the following manner The child is first welcomed by the other scholars who extend their hands to it It is then asked by me whether it will learn industriously and be obedient If it promises me this I explain to it how it must behave and if it can say its A B C s in order one after the other and also by way of proof can point out with the forefinger all the designated letters it is put into the A b Abs When it gets thus far its father must give it a penny and its mother must cook for it two eggs because of its industry and a similar reward is due to it when it goes further into words and so forth He made them little presents as prizes drew pictures for them taught them singing and also musical notation and he had a plan to have the children teach each other He had a careful set of rules for their behavior to try to change them from brutish peasants to intelligent citizens They must be clean and delinquents were not punished with the rod but by having the whole school write and shout out their names with the word lazy attached Letter writing was carefully taught with exercises in writing to various people and to each other Profanity was punished by wearing a yoke and being told the awful purport of the oaths He taught spelling and reading with much Bible instruction but he did not teach the Catechism since he had scholars of many sects and denominations however he made them all learn and understand what he called the honey flowers of the New Testament In order to appreciate his gentleness and intelligence one should know of the drunken dirty careless and cruel teachers in other Pennsylvania schools One whipped daily and hourly with a hickory club with leather thongs attached at one end this he called the taws Another had a row of rods of different sizes which with ugly humor he termed his mint sticks Another nicknamed Tiptoe Bobby always carried a raccoon s tail slightly weighted at the butt end this he would throw with sudden accuracy at any offender who meekly returned it to his instructor and received a fierce whipping with a butt end of rawhide with strips of leather at the smaller end One Quaker teacher in Philadelphia John Todd had such a passion for incessant whipping that after reading accounts of his ferocious discipline his manner and his words the only explanation of his violence and cruelty is that of insanity Illustration Cathalina Post Fourteen Years Old seventeen fifty There is no doubt that the practice of whipping servants was common here not only children who were bound out and apprentices and young redemptioners but grown servants as well Occasionally the cruel master was fined or punished for a brutal over exercise of his right of punishment At least one little child died from the hand of his murderous master In Boston and other towns commissioners were elected who had power to sentence to be whipped exceeding ten stripes children and servants who behaved disobediently and disorderly toward their parents masters and governours to the disturbance of families and discouragement of such parents and governours In Hartford Connecticut a topping young maid felt the force of a similar law Susan Coles for her rebellious cariedge towards her mistris is to be sent to the house of correction and be kept to hard labour and coarse dyet to be brought forth the next Lecture Day to be publicquely corrected and so to be corrected Weekly until Order be given to the Contrary Scores of similar records might be given Judge Sewall in his diary never refers to punishing his servants nor to any need of punishing them There is some evidence of their faithfulness and of his satisfaction in it especially in the references to his negro man servant Boston who after a life of faithful service was buried like a gentleman with a ceremonious funeral a notice of his death in the News Letter a well warmed parlor chairs set in orderly rows cake and wine and doubtless gloves John Wynter was the head agent of a London company at a settlement at Richmond s Island in Maine His wife had an idle maid and some report of her beating this maid was sent back to

England where as we have abundant evidence the whipping of servants was excessive and constant Pepys and other old English authors make frequent note of it Pepys whipped his boy till his arm was lame The Diary of a Lady of Quality gives some glimpses of this custom On January thirty seventeen sixty Lady Frances Pennoyer writes at her home at Bullingham Court Herefordshire that one of her maids spoke in the housekeeper s room about a matter that was not to the credit of the family My lady knew there was truth in what the girl said but it was not her place to speak of it and she must be taught to know and keep her place The diarist writes She hath a pretty face and should not be too ready to speak ill of those above her in station I should be very sorry to turn her adrift upon the world and she hath but a poor home Sent for her to my room and gave her choice either to be well whipped or to leave the house instantly She chose wisely I think and with many tears said I might do what I liked I bade her attend my chamber at twelve Dearlove my maid came to my room as I bade her I bade her fetch the rod from what was my mother in law s rod closet and kneel and ask pardon which she did with tears I made her prepare and I whipped her well The girl s flesh is plump and firm and she is a cleanly person such a one not excepting my own daughters who are thin and one of them Charlotte rather sallow as I have not whipped for a long time She hath never been whipped before she says since she was a child what can her mother and the late lady have been about I wonder and she cried out a great deal Poor little Dearlove fair and plump and in bitter tears you make a more pleasing picture seen through the haze of a century than fierce my lady with her rod The many hundred pages of Judge Sewall s diary give abundant testimony of his tender affection for his children In this record of his entire married life he but twice refers to punishing his children once his son was whipped for telling a lie a second time he notes the punishment thus sixteen ninety two Nov six Joseph threw a knob of Brass and hit his sister Betty upon the forehead so as to make it bleed upon which and for his playing at Prayer time and eating when Return Thanks I whip d him pretty smartly When I first went in call d by his Grandmother he sought to shadow and hide himself from me behind the head of the Cradle which gave me the sorrowful remembrance of Adam s carriage It was natural that Judge Sewall ever finding symbols of religious signification in natural events should see in his son Joseph s demeanor a painful reminder of original sin and we can imagine with what sad sense of duty he whipped him It is the standard resort of ignorant writers upon Puritanism and especially upon Puritanic severity to give the name of Cotton Mather as a prime expositor of cruel discipline I have before me a magazine illustration which represents him lean lank violent and mean of aspect with clipped head raising a heavy bunch of rods over a cowering child He was in reality exceedingly handsome very richly bewigged with the full distinctly sensual countenance of the Cottons not the severe ascetic features of the Mathers and he as strongly opposed punishment by the rod as most of his friends and neighbors favored and practised it His son wrote of him The slavish way of education carried on with raving and kicking and scourging in schools as well as in families he looked upon as a dreadful judgment of God on the world he thought the practice abominable and expressed a mortal aversion to it The first chastisement which he would inflict for any ordinary fault was to let the child see and hear him in an astonishment and hardly able to believe that the child would do so base a thing He would never come to give the child a blow except in case of obstinacy or something very criminal To be chased for a while out of his presence he would make to be looked upon as the sorest punishment in his family There can be found episodes of colonial history where the disprejudiced modern mind can perceive ample need of the sharp whippings so freely bestowed upon dull or idle scholars and slow servants Cotton Mather was too gentle and too forbearing toward certain children with whom he had close relations A warm birch applied in the early stages of that terrible tragedy the Salem Witchcraft to Ann Putnam the protagonist of that drama would doubtless so quickly have ended it in its incipiency as to obliterate it entirely from the pages of history Illustration William Verstile seventeen sixty nine CHAPTER XI MANNERS AND COURTESY A child should always say what s true And speak when he is spoken to And behave mannerly at table At least as far as he is able A Child s Garden of Verse Robert Louis Stevenson eighteen ninety five In ancient days in England manners and courtesy manly exercises music and singing knowledge of precedency and rank heraldry and ability to carve were much more important elements in education than Latin and philosophy Children were sent to school and placed in great men s houses to learn courtesy and the formalities of high life Of all the accomplishments and studies of the Squire as recounted by Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales but one would now be taught in English college music Of all which were taught courtesy was deemed the most important Aristotle the Philosopher this worthye sayinge writ That manners in a chylde are more requisit Than playinge on instrumentes and other vayne pleasure For virtuous manners is a most precious treasure The importance given to outward forms of courtesy was a natural result of the domination for centuries of the laws of chivalry and rules of heraldry But they were something more than outward show Emerson says The forms of politeness universally express benevolence in a superlative degree They certainly developed a regard for others which is evinced in its highest and best type in the character of what we term a gentleman and gentlewoman It is impossible to overestimate the value these laws of etiquette these conventions of customs had at a time when neighborhood life was the whole outside world Without them life would have proved unendurable Even savage nations and tribes have felt in their isolated lives the need of some conventions which with them assume the form of taboos superstitious observances and religious restrictions The laws of courtesy had much influence upon the development of the character of the colonial child Domestic life lacked many of the comforts of to day but save in formality it did not differ in essential elements from our own home life Everything in the community was made to tend to the preservation of relations of civility this is plainly shown by the laws Modern historians have been wont to wax jocose over the accounts of law suits for slander scandal monging name calling lying et cetera which may be found in colonial court records Astonishingly petty seem many of the charges even the calling of degrading nicknames making of wry faces jeering and finger sticking were fined and punished But all this rigidity tended to a preservation of peace The child who saw a man fined for lying who beheld another set in the stocks for calling his neighbor ill names or repeating scandalous assertions grew up with a definite knowledge of the wickedness and danger of lying and a wholesome regard for the proprieties of life These sentiments may not have made him a better man but they certainly made him a more endurable one The child of colonial days had but little connection with little knowledge of the world at large He probably never had seen a map of the world and if he had he didn t understand it Foreign news there was none in our present sense Of special English events he might occasionally learn months after they had happened but never any details nor any ordinary happenings European information was of the scantiest and rarest kind knowledge of the result of a war or a vast disaster like the Lisbon earthquake might come From the other great continents came nothing Nor was his knowledge of his own land extended There was nothing to interest him in the newsletter even if he read it He cared nothing for the other colonies he knew little of other towns If he lived in a seaport he doubtless heard from the sailors on the wharves tales of adventure and romantic interest and he heard from his elders details of trade both of foreign and native ports The boy therefore grew up with his life revolving in a small circle the girl s was still smaller It had its advantages and its serious disadvantages It developed an extraordinarily noble and pure type of neighborliness but it did not foster a general broad love of humanity Perhaps those conditions developed types which were fitted to receive and absorb gradually the more extended views of life which came through the wider extent of vision which has been brought to us by newspapers by steam and by electricity At any rate children were serenely content for they were unconscious Illustration The Pepperell Children Among early printed English books are many containing rules of courtesy and behavior Many of these and manuscripts on kindred topics were carefully reprinted in eighteen sixty eight by the Early English Text Society of Great Britain Among these are The Babees Book The Lytill Children s Lytil Boke The Boke of Nurture fifteen seventy seven The Boke of Curtasye fourteen sixty The Schole of Vertue fifteen fifty seven From those days till the present similar books have been written and printed and form a history of domestic manners It certainly conveys an idea of the demeanor of children of colonial days to read what was enjoined upon them in a little book of etiquette which was apparently widely circulated and doubtless carefully read Instructions as to behavior at the table run thus Never sit down at the table till asked and after the blessing Ask for nothing tarry till it be offered thee Speak not Bite not thy bread but break it Take salt only with a clean knife Dip not the meat in the same Hold not thy knife upright but sloping and lay it down at right hand of plate with blade on plate Look not earnestly at any other that is eating When moderately satisfied leave the table Sing not hum not wriggle not Spit no where in the room but in the corner and But I will pursue the quotation no further nor discover other eighteenth century pronenesses painfully revealed in lurid light in other detailed Don

Precepts By the Author of the Engli f h Exerci f es The Fourth Edition LONDON Printed for Tho Cockerill at the Three Legs and Bible again f t Grocers Hall in the Poultrey seventeen oh one Title page of The School of Manners In many households in the new world children could not be seated at the table even after the blessing had been asked They stood through the entire meal Sometimes they had a standing place and plate or trencher at other boards they stood behind the grown folk and took whatever food was handed to them This must have been in families of low social station and meagre house furnishings In many homes they sat or stood at a side table and trencher in hand ran over to the great table for their supplies A certain formality existed at the table of more fashionable folk Children were given a few drops of wine in which to drink the health of their elders In one family the formula was Health to papa and mamma health to brothers and sisters health to all my friends In another the father s health only was named Sometimes the presence of grandparents at the table was the only occasion when children joined in health drinking The little book teaches good listening When any speak to thee stand up Say not I have heard it before Never endeavour to help him out if he tell it not right Snigger not never question the Truth of it The child is enjoined minutely as to his

Throw not aught on the Street as Dirt or Stones If thou meetest the scholars of any other School jeer not nor affront them but show them love and respect and quietly let them pass along Boys took a good deal from their preceptors and took it patiently and respectfully but I can well imagine the roar of disgust with which even a much hampered eighteenth century schoolboy read the instructions to show love and respect to the boys of a rival school and not to jeer or fire stones at them This book of manners was reprinted in Worcester by Isaiah Thomas in seventeen eighty seven I have seen an earlier edition called The School of Manners which was published in London in seventeen oh one The title page and a page of the precepts are here reproduced The directions in these books of etiquette are plainly copied from a famous book entitled Youths Behaviour or Decency in Conversation Amongst Men a book unsurpassed in the seventeenth century as an epitome of contemporary manners and held in such esteem that it ran through eleven editions in less than forty years after its first appearance Not the least remarkable thing about this volume was the fact that the first edition in English was by an ingeniose Spark not then eight years of age one Francis Hawkins who rendered it from the French of grave persons The bookseller begs the reader to connive at the stile on the plea that it was wrought by an uncouth and rough file of one in green years Green years we cannot fancy sober young Francis as ever green or as anything but a sere and prematurely withered leaf We can see him in sad colored attire carefully made quill pen in hand seated at desk and standish his poor little shrunken legs hanging pitifully down inditing on foolscap with precision and elegance his pompous precepts After all he only translated these maxims hence perhaps was the reason that he managed to live to grow up For translating did not tax his intellectuals as would have composition The Youths Behaviour contained many rules and instructions worded from still older books on courtesy such as The Babees Book and The Boke of Nurture and traces of those hackneyed rules lingered even in the etiquette books of Isaiah Thomas long after the house furnishings and household conditions indicated by them and sometimes necessitated by them had become as obsolete as the formal duties of the squire s sons the younkers of account youths of good houses and young gentlemen henxmen for whom they had originally been written Let us believe that the habits pointed out by such rules were obsolete also I cannot think for instance that the boy born after our Revolutionary war was in the habit of casting poultry and meat bones under dining tables even though he is so seriously enjoined not to do so This rule is a survivor from the earthen floors and dirty ways of old England A famous book of rules of etiquette entitled The Mirror of Compliments was printed in sixteen thirty five in England and as late as seventeen ninety five many pages of it were reprinted in America by Thomas under the title A New Academy of Compliments The teachings in this book were fearfully and wonderfully polite This is the sort of thing enjoined upon children and grown folk as correct phrases to be exchanged on the subject of breaking bread together Sir you shall oblige me very much if you will do me the honour to take my poor dinner with me Sir you are too courteous and persuasive to be refused and therefore I shall trouble you Sir pray excuse your bad entertainment at the present dinner and another time we will endeavour to make you amends Truly Sir it has been very good without any defect and needs no excuse The child who sought to be mannerly certainly must have felt rather discouraged at the prospect laid before him These superfluities of politeness were equalled by the absurdities of restraint It would certainly have been a study of facial expression to see the average schoolboy when he read this dictum It is a wilde and rude thing to lean upon ones elbow In Brinsley s Grammar Schoole written in sixteen twelve he enumerates the bookes to bee first learned of children First were abcies and primers then the Psalms in metre then the Testament Then if any other require any little booke meet to enter Children the Schoole of Virtue is one of the Principall and easiest for the first enterers being full of precepts of ciuilitie And after the Schoole of Good Manners leading the child as by the hand in the way of all good manners The constant reading of these books and the persistent reprinting of their formal rules of behavior may have tended to conserve the old fashioned deportment of children which has been so lamented by aged grumblers and lovers of the good old times It was certainly natural that children should be affected by the regard for etiquette the distinctions of social position which they saw heeded all around them and in all departments of life No man could enlist in the Massachusetts Cavalry unless he had a certain amount of property Even boys in college had their names placed in the catalogues not by classes years scholarship or alphabetical order but by the dignity and wealth of their family and social position and a college boy at Harvard had to give the baluster side of the staircase to any one who was his social superior Of course the careful seating of the meeting was simply an evidence of this regard of rank and station Illustration Thomas Aston Coffin Three Years Old It was a profound distance between mister and Goodman Mistress and Goody marked a distinction as positive if not as great as between a duchess and a milkmaid Unmarried women and girls if deemed worthy any title at all were not termed Miss but were also missus

missus Rebecka Sewall August ye fourth seventeen ten Cotton Mather wrote of missus Sarah Gerrish a very beautiful and ingenious damsel seven years of age Miss was not exactly a term of reproach but it

Miss Lord Miss never mind that Aunt has told you all hant she Miss A certain regard for formality obtained even in very humble households The childhood of David and John Brainerd born respectively in seventeen eighteen and seventeen twenty in East Haddam Connecticut who later in life were missionaries to the New Jersey Indians has been written by a kinsman They were nurtured under the influences of Connecticut Puritanism in a simple New England home Their biographer writes of their rearing A boy was early taught a profound respect for his parents teachers and guardians and implicit prompt obedience If he undertook to rebel his will was broken by persistent and adequate punishment He was taught that it was a sin to find fault with his meals his apparel his tasks or his lot in life Courtesy was enjoined as a duty He must be silent among his superiors If addressed by older persons he must respond with a bow He was to bow as he entered and left the school and to every man and woman old or young rich or poor black or white whom he met on the road Special punishment was visited on him if he failed to show respect for the aged the poor the colored or to any persons whatever whom God had visited with infirmities All children in godly households were taught personal consideration of the old and afflicted a consideration which lasted till our present days of organized charities As a lesson of patience and kindness read missus Silsbee s account of the blind piano tuner in Salem He was employed in many households and ever treated with marked attention His tuning instrument had to be placed for him on each piano screw by some member of the family He was paid given cake and wine then humored by being given a tangled skein of silk to unravel and thus show his dexterity and finally led tenderly home Sir Francis Doyle says It is the intention of the Almighty that there should exist for a certain time between childhood and manhood the natural production known as a boy This natural production existed two centuries ago as well as to day Though children were certainly subdued and silent in the presence of older folk still they were boys and girls not machine like models of perfection We know of their turbulence in church and boys in colonial days robbed orchards and played ball in the streets and tore down gates and frightened horses and threw stones with as much vim and violence as if they had been born in the nineteenth century Mather in his Vindication of New England referring to the charge of injuring King s Chapel shows us Boston schoolboys in much the same mischief that schoolboys have been in since All the mischief done is the breaking of a few Quarels of Glass by idle Boys who if discover d had been chastis d by their own Parents They have built their Chapel in a Publick burying place next adjoining a great Free School where the Boyes having gotten to play may some by Accident some in Frolick and some perhaps in Revenge for disturbing their Relatives Graves by the Foundation of that Building have broken a few Quarels of the Windows Children did not always pose either as models of decorum or propriety in their relations with each other In a little book called The Village School we read of their beating and kicking each other and that there was one bleeding nose Worse yet when the girls went forth to gather daisies and butter flowers the ungallant boys kicked the girls to make them pipe CHAPTER XII RELIGIOUS THOUGHT AND TRAINING Puritanism is not of the Nineteenth Century but of the Seventeenth the grand unintelligibility for us lies there The Fast Day Sermons in spite of printers are all grown dumb In long rows of dumpy little quartos they indeed stand here bodily before us by human volition they can be read but not by any human memory remembered The Age of the Puritans is not extinct only and gone away from us but it is as if fallen beyond the capabilities of memory itself it is grown what we may call incredible Its earnest Purport awakens now no resonance in our frivolous hearts the sound of it has become tedious as a tale of past stupidities Oliver Cromwell s Life and Letters Thomas Carlyle eighteen forty five The religious aspect of the life of children especially in early colonial days and most particularly in New England bore a far deeper relation to the round of daily life than can be accorded to it in these pages The spirit of the Lord perhaps I should say the fear of the Lord truly filled their days Born into a religious atmosphere reared in religious ways surrounded on every side by religious influences they could not escape the impress of deep religious feeling they certainly had a profound familiarity with the Bible The historian Green says that the Englishman of that day was a man of one book and that book the Bible It might with equal truth be said that the universal child s book of that day was the Bible There were few American children until after the Revolution who had ever read from any book save the Bible a primer or catechism and perhaps a hymn book or an almanac The usual method at that time of reading the Bible through was in the regular succession of every chapter from beginning to end not leaving out even Leviticus and Numbers This naturally detracted from the interest which would have been awakened by a wise selection of parts suited to the liking of children and many portions doubtless frightened young children as we have abundant record in the writings of Sewall and Mather J T Buckingham stated in his Memoirs that he read the Bible through at least a dozen times before he was sixteen years old Some portions especially the Apocalypse or Revelation of saint John filled him with unspeakable terror and he called the enforced reading of them a piece of gratuitous and unprofitable cruelty He was careful however to pay due tribute to the influence of the Bible upon his literary composition and phraseology The constant reading of the beautiful English wording of the Bible influenced not only the style of writing of that day but controlled the everyday speech of the people keeping it pure and simple Illustration missus John Hesselius and her Children John and Caroline There was one important reason for the unfailing desire of English folk for the Bible and the employment of its words and terms it was not only the sole book with which most English readers were familiar the book which supplied to them sacred hymns and warlike songs the great voices of the prophets the parables of the Evangelists stories of peril and adventure logic legends history visions but it was also a new book The family of the seventeenth century that read the words of the small Geneva Bibles in the home circle or poorer folk who listened to the outdoor reading thereof heard a voice that they had longed for and waited for and suffered for and that their fathers had died for and a treasure thus acquired is never lightly heeded The Pilgrim Fathers left England for Holland before King James Bible our Authorized Version had been published The Puritans of the Boston and Salem settlements had seen the importation of Geneva Bibles forbidden in England by Laud in sixteen thirty three and the reading prohibited at their meetings They revelled in it in their new homes for custom had not deadened their delight and they were filled with it it satisfied them they needed no other literature Though Puritanism in its anxious and restricted religionism denied freedom to childhood yet the spirit of Puritanism was deeply observant and conservative of family relations The meagre records of domestic life in Puritan households are full of a pure affection if not of grace or good cheer The welfare if not the pleasure of their children lay close to the heart of the Pilgrims Their love was seldom expressed but their rigid sense of duty extended to duty to be fulfilled as well as exacted Governor Bradford wrote in his now world famous Log book in his lucid and beautiful English an account of the motives of the emigration from Holland and in a few sentences therein he gives one of the most profound reasons of all their intense yearning for the true welfare of their children As necessitie was a taskmaster over them so they were forced to be such not only to their servants but in a sorte to their dearest children the which as it did not a little wound ye tender harts of many a loving father and mother so it produced likewise sundrie sad and sorrowful effects For many of theier children that were of best dispositions and gracious inclinations having lernde to bear the yoake in their youth and willing to beare parte of their parents burden were often times so oppressed with their hevie labours that though their minds were free and willing yet their bodies bowed under ye weight of ye same and became decrepid in their early youth the vigor of nature being consumed in ye very budd as it were But that which was more lamentable and of all sorrows most heavie to be borne was that many of their children were drawne away by evill examples into extravagant and dangerous coarses getting ye raines off their necks and departing from their parents This country was settled at a time when all English people were religious The Puritan child was full of religious thoughts and exercises so also was the child of Roman Catholic parents or one reared in the Established Church The diarist Evelyn was a stanch Church of England man no lover of Puritan ways but he could write thus of his little child As to his piety astonishing were his applications of Scripture upon occasion and his sense of God He had learned all his Catechism early and understood all the historical part of the Bible and New Testament to a wonder how Christ came to redeem mankind and how comprehending those messages himself his godfathers were discharged of his promises He would of himself select the most pathetic psalms and chapters out of Job to read to his maid during his sickness telling her when she pitied him that all God s children must suffer affliction He declaimed against the vanities of the world before he had seen any Often he would desire those who came to see him to pray by him and a year before he fell sick to kneel and pray with him alone in some corner It was not of a Puritan dame that this was written Her Maids came into her Chamber early every morning and ordinarily shee passed about an howr with them In praying and catechizing and instructing them To these secret and private Praiers the publick Morning and Evening praiers of the Church before dinner and supper and another form together with reading Scriptures and singing Psalms before bed time were daily and constantly added This zealous Christian was Letice Lady Falkland a devoted Church of England woman so strict was she that if she missed any from the religious services she presently sent for them and consecrated another howr of praier there purposely for them A strenuous insistence showed itself in all sects in the new world The Articles Lawes and Orders Divine Politique and Martiall for the colony of Virginea were unrivalled in their mingling of barbarity and Christianity by any other code of laws issued in America No Puritan dared go farther than did the good Episcopalian Sir Thomas Dale For irreverence to any Preacher or Minister of Gods Holy Word the offender was to be whipped three times and thrice to ask public forgiveness Any one who persistently refused to be instructed and catechized could be whipped every day Rigidly were all forced to attend the Sunday exercises There is one name which must appear constantly on the pages of any history of New England of the half century from sixteen eighty to seventeen twenty eight that of Cotton Mather This reference is due him not only because he was prominent in the history of those years but because he is the preserver of that history for us From his multitudinous pages full though they be of extraordinary religious sentiments strained metaphors and unmistakable slang we also gain much to show us the life of his day The man himself was not only a Puritan of the Puritans but the personification of a passionate desire to do good This constant thought for others and wish to benefit them frequently led him to perform deeds which were certainly officious ill timed and unwelcome though inspired by noble motives His son Samuel wrote a life of him which has justly been characterized by Professor Barrett Wendell as the most colorless book in the English language but even from those bleached and dried pages we learn of Cotton Mather s love of his children and his earnest desire for their education and salvation His son s words may be given as evidently truthful He began betimes to entertain them with delightful stories especially Scriptural ones and he would ever conclude with some lesson of piety bidding them to learn that lesson from the story Thus every day at the table he used himself to tell some entertaining tale before he rose and endeavor to make it useful to the olive plants about the table When his children accidentally at any time came in his way it was his custom to let fall some sentence or other that might be monitory or profitable to them He betimes tried to engage his children in exercises of piety and especially secret prayer He would often call upon them Child don t you forget every day to go alone and pray as I have directed you He betimes endeavoured to form in his children a temper of kindness He would put them upon doing services and kindnesses for one another and other children He would applaud them when he saw them delight in it He would upbraid all aversion to it He would caution them exquisitely against all revenges of injuries and would instruct them to return good offices for evil ones He would let them discover he was not satisfied except when they had a sweetness of temper shining in them His thought for the young did not cease with those of his own family he never failed to instil good lessons everywhere and a special habit of his on visiting any town was to beg a holiday for the school children asking them to perform some religious task in return Illustration Charlotte and Elizabeth Hesselius Another Puritan preacher reverend Ezekiel Rogers was so laden with the fruit of the tree of knowledge that he stoopt for the very children to pick off the apple ready to drop into their mouths When they came to his study he would examine them How they walked with God How they spent their time what good books they read Whether they prayed without ceasing He wrote to a brother minister in sixteen fifty seven Do your children and family grow more godly I find greatest trouble and grief about the rising generation Young people are little stirred here but they strengthen one another in evil by example and by counsel Much ado have I with my own family hard to get a servant that is glad of catechizing or family duties I had a rare blessing of servants in Yorkshire and those that I brought over were a blessing but the young brood doth much afflict me Even the children of the godly here and elsewhere make a woful proof These ministers lived at a time when New England Puritanism in its extreme type was coming to a close but parents and households thus reared clung more rigidly and exactly to it and instilled in it a fervent hope of giving permanency to what seemed to their sad eyes in danger of being wholly thrust aside and lost Such religionists were both Cotton Mather and Samuel Sewall true New English Christians they called and deemed themselves They were very gentle with their children but a profound anxiety for the welfare of those young souls made them most cruel in the intensity of their teaching and warning especially displeasing to modern modes of thought are their constant reminders of death When Cotton Mather s little daughter was but four years old he made this entry in his diary I took my little daughter Katy into my Study and then I told my child I am to dye Shortly and shee must when I am Dead remember Everything I now said unto her I sett before her the sinful Condition of her Nature and I charged her to pray in Secret Places every Day That God for the sake of Jesus Christ would give her a New Heart I gave her to understand that when I am taken from her she must look to meet with more humbling Afflictions than she does now she has a Tender Father to provide for her The vanity of all such painful instruction harrowing to the father and terrifying to the child is shown in the sequel Cotton Mather did not die till thirty years afterward and long survived the tender little blossom that he loved yet blighted with the chill and dread of death The pages of Judge Sewall s diary sadly prove his performance of what he believed to be his duty to his children just as the entries show the bewilderment and terror of his children under his teachings Elizabeth Sewall was the most timid and fearful of them all a frightened child a retiring girl a vacillating sweetheart an unwilling bride she became the mother of eight children but always suffered from morbid introspection and overwhelming fear of death and the future life until at the age of thirty five her father sadly wrote God has delivered her now from all her fears The process which developed this unhappy nature is plainly shown by many entries in the diary This was when she was about five years old It falls to my daughter Elizabeth s Share to read the twenty four of Isaiah which she doth with many Tears not being very well and the Contents of the Chapter and Sympathy with her draw Tears from me also The terrible verses telling of God s judgment on the land of fear of the pit of the snare of emptiness and waste of destruction and desolation must have sunk deep into the heart of the sick child and produced the condition shown by this entry when she was a few years older When I came in past seven at night my wife met me in the Entry and told me Betty had surprised them I was surprised with the Abruptness of the Relation It seems Betty Sewall had given some signs of dejection and sorrow but a little while after dinner she burst into an amazing cry which caus d all the family to cry too Her Mother ask d the Reason she gave none at last said she was afraid she should go to Hell her Sins were not pardon d She was first wounded by my reading a sermon of mister Norton s Text Ye shall seek me and shall not find me And these words in the Sermon Ye shall seek me and die in your Sins ran in her Mind and terrified her greatly And staying at home she read out of mister Cotton Mather Why hath Satan filled thy Heart which increas d her Fear Her Mother asked her whether she pray d She answered Yes but fear d her prayers were not heard because her sins were not pardoned Poor little wounded Betty her fear that she should go to hell because she like Spira was not elected was answered by her father who having led her into this sad state was but ill fitted to comfort her Both prayed with bitter tears and he says mournfully I hope God heard us Hell Satan eternal damnation everlasting torments were ever held up before these Puritan children We could truthfully paraphrase Wordsworth s beautiful line Heaven lies about us in our infancy and say of these Boston children Hell lay about them in their infancy The lists in their books of the proper names in the Bible had an accompanying list that of names of the devil A most painfully explicit account of one of the ultra sensitive natures developed by these methods is given by Cotton Mather in his most offensive style in a short religious biography of Nathaniel Mather The boy died when he was nineteen years old but unhappily he kept a diary of his religious sentiments and fears He fasted often and prayed constantly even in his sleep He wrote out in detail his covenant with God and I cannot doubt that he more than lived up to his promises as he did to the minute rules he laid out for his various religious duties Still this young Christian was full of self loathing horrible conceptions of God unbounded dread of death and all the horrors of a morbid soul A letter written by an older Mather about sixteen thirty eight when he was twelve years old shows an ancestral tendency to religious fears Though I am thus well in body yet I question whether my soul doth prosper as my body doth for I perceive yet to this very day little growth in grace and this makes me question whether grace be in my heart or no I feel also daily great unwillingness to good duties and the great ruling of sin in my heart and that God is angry with me and gives me no answers to my prayers but many times he even throws them down as dust in my face and he does not grant my continued request for the spiritual blessing of the softening of my hard heart And in all this I could yet take some comfort but that it makes me to wonder what God s secret decree concerning me may be for I doubt whether even God is wont to deny grace and mercy to his chosen though uncalled when they seek unto him by prayer for it and therefore seeing he doth thus deny it to me I think that the reason of it is most like to be because I belong not unto the election of grace I desire that you would let me have your prayers as I doubt not but I have them and rest Your Son SAMUEL MATHER A strong characteristic of English folk at the time of the settlement of the American colonies was superstition This showed not only in scores of petty observances but in serious beliefs such as those about comets and thunder storms It controlled medical practice and was displayed in the religious significance attributed to trifling natural events It was evinced in the dependence on dreams and the dread of portents Naturally children were imbued with the beliefs and fears of their parents and multiplied the importance and the terror of these notions It can readily be seen that religious training and thought such as was shown in the families of Samuel Sewall and Cotton Mather joined to hereditary traits and race superstitions could naturally produce a condition of mind and judgment which would permit such an episode as that known as the Salem Witchcraft Nor is it anything but natural to find that those two prominent Bostonians took such important parts in the progress of that tragedy Illustration Charles Spooner Cary Eight Years Old seventeen eighty six It was my intent to devote a chapter of this book to the results of the study of the part borne by children in that sad tale of psychological phenomena and religious fanaticism The study proved most fascinating and research was faithfully made but a stronger desire was that children might find some pleasure in these pages in reading of the child life of their forbears Such a chapter could neither be profitable to the child nor comprehended by him nor would it be to the taste of parents of the present day It was a sad tale but was not peculiar to Salem nor to New England The Salem and Boston settlers came largely from the English counties of Suffolk and Essex where witches and witch hunters and witch finders abounded and Salem children and parents had seen in their English homes or heard the tales of hundreds of similar obsessions and possessions New England children were instilled with a familiarity with death in still another way than through talking and reading of it Their presence at funerals was universal A funeral in those days had an entirely different status as a ceremony from to day It was a social function as well as a solemn one it was a reunion of friends and kinsfolk a ceremonial of much expense and pomp a scene of much feasting and drinking Judge Sewall tells of the attendance of his little children when five and six years old at funerals When reverend Thomas Shepherd was buried scholars went before the Herse at the funeral Sargent in his Dealings with the Dead tells of country funerals in the days of his youth When I was a boy and at an academy in the country everybody went to everybody s funeral in the village The population was small funerals rare the preceptor s absence would have excited remark and the boys were dismissed for the funeral A clergyman told me that when he was settled at Concord N H he officiated at the funeral of a little boy The body was borne in a chaise and six little nominal pall bearers the oldest not thirteen walked by the side of the vehicle Before they left the house a sort of master of ceremonies took them to the table and mixed a tumbler of gin sugar and water for each A crisis was reached in Boston when funerals had to be prohibited on Sundays because the vast concourse of children and servants that followed the coffin through the streets became a noisy rabble that profaned the sacred day Little girls were pall bearers also at the funerals of their childish mates and young unmarried girls at those of their companions Dressed in white with uncovered heads or veiled in white these little girls made a touching sight Religious expression naturally found its highest point in Puritan communities in the strict and decorous observance of Sunday Stern were the laws in ordering this observance Fines imprisonment and stripes on the naked back were dealt out rigorously for Sabbath breaking The New Haven Code of Laws with still greater severity enjoined that profanation of the Lord s Day if done proudly and with a high hand against the authority of God should be punished with death This rigid observance fell with special force and restriction on children A loved poet Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote of the day Hush tis the Sabbath s silence stricken morn No feet must wander through the tasselled corn No merry children laugh around the door No idle playthings strew the sanded floor The law of Moses lays its awful ban On all that stirs Here comes the Tithing man There were many public offices in colonial times which we do not have to day for we do not need them One of these is that of tithing man he was a town officer and had several neighboring families under his charge usually ten as the word tithing would signify He enforced the learning of the church catechism in these ten homes visited the houses and heard the children recite their catechism These ten families he watched specially on Sundays to see whether they attended church and did not loiter on the way In some Massachusetts towns he watched on week days to keep boys and all persons from swimming in the water Ten families with many boys must have kept him busy on hot August days He inspected taverns reported disorderly persons and forbade the sale of intoxicating liquor to them He administered the oath of fidelity to new citizens and warned undesirable visitors and wanderers to leave the town He could arrest persons who ran or rode at too fast a pace when going to meeting on Sunday or who took unnecessary rides on Sunday or otherwise broke the Sunday laws Within the meeting house he kept order by beating out dogs correcting unruly and noisy boys and waking those who slept He sometimes walked up and down the church aisles carrying a stick which had a knob on one end and a dangling foxtail on the other tapping the boys on the head with the knob end of the stick and tickling the face of sleeping church attendants with the foxtail Some churches had tithing men until this century A Puritanical regard of the Sabbath still lingers in our New England towns There are many Christian old gentlemen still living of whom such an anecdote as this of old Deacon Davis of Westborough might be told A grandson walked to church with him one Sabbath morning and a gray squirrel ran across the road The child delighted pointed out the beautiful little creature to his grandfather A sharp twist of the ear was the old Puritan s rejoinder and the caustic words that squirrels were not to be spoken of on the Lord s Day With all the religious restriction and all the religious instruction with the everyday repression of youth and the special Sabbath day rigidity of laws it is somewhat a surprise to the reader of the original sources of history to find that girls sometimes laughed and boys behaved very badly in meeting The latter condition would be more surprising to us did we not see so plainly that the method of seating the meeting in colonial days was not calculated to produce or maintain order Boys were not separated from each other into various pews in the company of their parents as to day they were all huddled together in any undignified or uncomfortable seats In Salem in sixteen seventy six it was ordered that all the boys of the town sitt upon ye three paire of stairs in ye meeting house and two citizens were deputed to assist the tithing man in controlling them and watching them and if any proved unruly to psent their names as the law directs Sometimes they were seated on the pulpit stairs under the eyes of the entire audience more frequently in a boys pue in a high gallery remote from all other Christians the wretched boys were set off as though they were religious lepers In Dorchester the boys could not keep still in meeting the selectmen had to appoint some meet person to inspect the boys in the meeting house in time of divine service These guardians had to tarry at noon and prevent disorder then By seventeen seventy six the boys were so turbulent the spirit of independence was so rife and riotous that six men had to be appointed to keep order and they had authority to give proper discipline if necessary Illustration Margaret Graves Cary Fourteen Years Old seventeen eighty six It is not necessary to multiply examples of the badness of the boys nor of the unsophisticated artlessness of their parents Scores of old town and church records give ample proof of the traits of both fathers and sons These accounts are often as amusing as they are surprising in their hopelessness The natural remedy of the isolation of the inventors of mischief and separation of conspirators and quarrellers did not enter the brains of our simple old forefathers for over a century Indeed these Devil s play houses as doctor Porter called them were not entirely abolished until fifty years ago The town of Windsor Connecticut suffered and suffered from boys pews until the year eighteen forty five CHAPTER XIII RELIGIOUS BOOKS Lisping new syllables we scramble next Through moral narrative or sacred text And learn with wonder how this world began Who made who marred and who has ransomed man Tyrocinium William Cowper seventeen eighty four It was inevitable since the colonization of America was in the day of Puritanism that the first modern literature known by American children should be the distinctive literature of that sect and period These were religious emblems controversial treatises records of martyrdoms catechismic dialogues and a few accounts of precociously pious infants who had died Thomas White a Puritan minister wrote thus When thou canst read read no ballads and romances and foolish books but the Bible and the Plaine Man s Pathway to Heaven a very plaine holy book for you Get the Practice of Piety mister Baxter s call to the Unconverted Allen s Alarm to the Unconverted The Book of Martyrs The two books which he named after the Bible had the distinction of being the only ones owned by the wife of John Bunyan The confiding Puritan child who read The Plain Man s Pathway to Heaven under the promise that it was a plaine and perfite book must have been sorely disappointed But if it wasn t plain it was popular The twelfth edition is dated seventeen thirty three Foxe s Book of Martyrs was found in many colonial homes and was eagerly read by many children Neither this nor any of the books on the reverend mister White s list were properly children s books A special book for children was written by a Puritan preacher whose sayings were very dull in prose and I am sure must have been more so in verse It was called Old mister Dod s Sayings composed in Verse for the better Help of Memory and the Delightfulness of Children reading them and learning them whereby they may be the better ingrafted in their memories and Understanding Cotton Mather also wrote Good Lessons for Children in Verse Doubtless the most popular and most widely read of all children s books in New England was one whose title page runs thus A Token for Children being an Exact Account of the Conversion Holy and Exemplary Lives and Joyful Deaths of Several Young Children by James Janeway To which is added A Token for the Children of New England or Some Examples of Children in whom the Fear of God was remarkably Budding before they died in several Parts of New England Preserved and Published for the Encouragement of Piety in other Children The first portion of this book was written by an English minister and was as popular in England as in America The entire book with the title as given went through many editions both in England and America even being reprinted in this century In spite of its absolute trustfulness and simplicity of belief it is a sad commentary on the spiritual conditions of the times I will not give any of the accounts in full for the expression of religious thought shown therein is so contrary to the sentiment of to day that it would not be pleasing to modern readers The New England portion was written by Cotton Mather and out Janeways Janeway Young babes chide their parents for too infrequent praying and have ecstasies of delight when they can pray ad infinitum One child two years old was able savingly to understand the mysteries of Redemption another of the same age was a dear lover of faithful ministers One poor little creature had such extraordinary meltings that his eyes were red and sore from weeping on his sins Anne Greenwich who died when five years old discoursed most astonishingly of great mysteries Daniel Bradley who had an Impression and inquisitiveness of the State of Souls after Death when three years old Elizabeth Butcher who when two and a half years old as she lay in the Cradle would ask her self the Question What is my corrupt Nature and would answer herself It is empty of Grace bent unto Sin and only to Sin and that Continually were among the distressing examples Illustration The Custis Children seventeen sixty circa Jonathan Edwards Narratives of Conversions contained similar records of religious precocity There is a curious double light in all these narratives the premature sadness of the children who seem as old as original sin is equalled by the absolute childishness of the reverend gentlemen mister Janeway mister Mather mister Edwards who tell the tales There were other similar collections of examples one of children in Siberia others in Silesia and another of Pious Motions and Devout Exercises of Jewish Children in Berlin Siberia was apparently as remote and inaccessible to Boston in those days as the moon and the incredulous mind cannot help wondering who sent and how were sent these accounts to those trusting Boston ministers Another child s book by James Janeway was The Looking Glass for Children There had been a previous book with nearly the same title Janeway s book was certainly popular perhaps because it was in verse and children s poetry was very scanty and rare in those days It was reprinted many times and parts appeared in selections and compilations until this century A few lines run thus When by Spectators I behold What Beauty doth adorn me Or in a glass when I behold How sweetly God did form me Hath God such comeliness bestowed And on me made to dwell What pity such a pretty maid As I should go to Hell A book of similar title was Divine Blossoms a Prospect or Looking Glass for Youth The lack of poetry may also account in some degree for the astonishing popularity of a poem which appeared in sixteen sixty two written by a Puritan preacher named Michael Wigglesworth and entitled The Day of Doom or a Poetical description of the Great and Last Judgement This epic of hell fire and damnation was reprinted again and again and was sold in such large numbers that it is safe to assert that every New England household whose members could read was familiar with it It was printed as a broadside and children committed it to memory teachers extolled it ministers quoted it Its horrible descriptions of hell and the sufferings of the damned are weakened to the modern mind by the thought of the presumptuous complacence of the author who would dare to give page after page of what he conceived the great Judge would say on the Day of Judgment But of course no child certainly no child of Puritan training would note either absurdity or impropriety in assigning such words and it is sad to think what must have been the climax of horror with which a sensitive child read God s answer to the plea for salvation made by reprobate infants the terrible words running on through many stanzas and ending thus Will you demand Grace at my hand and challenge what is mine Will you teach me whom to set free and thus my Grace confine You sinners are and such a share as sinners may expect Such you shall have for I do save none but my own Elect Yet to compare your sin with their s who liv d a longer time I do confess yours is much less though every sin s a crime A Crime it is therefore in bliss you may not hope to dwell But unto you I shall allow the easiest room in Hell Thomas White wrote a book for children which certainly comes under the head of religious books though its pages held also those frivolous lines A was an archer who shot at a frog et cetera This dreary volume was entitled a Little Book for Little Children It contained accounts of short lived and morbid young Christians much like those of James Janeway s book One child of eight wept bitter and inconsolable tears for his sins One wicked deed was lying His mother asked him whether he were cold He answered Yes instead of Forsooth and afterward doubted whether he really was cold or not Another sin was whetting his knife on the Sabbath day Poor Nathaniel Mather whittled on the Lord s day and hid behind the door while thus sinning A boy s jack knife was a powerful force then as now This book also had accounts of the Christian martyrs and their tortures This was an English book first reprinted in Boston in seventeen oh two An edition of Pilgrim s Progress was printed in Boston in sixteen eighty one another in seventeen oh six and an illustrated edition in seventeen forty four but I doubt that these were the complete book Many shortened copies and imitations appeared One was called The Christian s Metamorphosis Unfolded Another The Christian Pilgrim doctor Neale edited it for children making says a modern critic a most impudent book Bunyan also wrote Divine Emblems which the young were enjoined to read and he also bowed his pen to children and wrote Country Rhimes for Children For many years no copy of this was known to exist but one was found in America in recent years and is now in the British Museum It is an uncouth mixture of religious phrases and similes and very crude natural history Illustration And the serpent f aid unto the woman Ye f hall not f urely die GENESIS iii four THE HOLY BIBLE ABRIDGED OR THE HISTORY OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT Illu f trated with NOTES and adorned with CUTS For the U f e of CHILDRENS Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not LUKE xviii sixteen THE SECOND WORCESTER EDITION WORCESTER MASSACHUSETTS FROM THE PRESS OF THOMAS SON THOMAS AND SOLD AT THEIR BOOKSTORE MDCCXCVI The Holy Bible Abridged Pilgrim s Progress was the first light reading of Benjamin Franklin Other books of his boyhood were Plutarch s Lives Defoe s Essays upon Projects Cotton Mather s Essays to do Good and Burton s Historical Collections Another patriot at a later day Abraham Lincoln learning little but the primer at school read slowly and absorbed into his brain his heart and his everyday speech the Bible Pilgrim s Progress AEsop s Fables and Plutarch s Lives a good education to which a Life of Washington added details of local patriotism Illustration Illustration from Original Poetry for Young Minds Another book for young people which might be termed a story book though its lesson was deemed deeply religious was called A Small Book in Easy Verse Very Suitable for Children entitled The Prodigal Daughter or the Disobedient Lady Reclaimed It was a poem of about a hundred stanzas relating the story of a very wilful young woman who on being locked up in her room by her father to check her extravagance made a league with the Devil attempted to poison her father and mother dropped dead apparently on her wickedness being discovered was carried to the grave but revived just as the sexton was about to lower her coffin in the ground She recovered repented related her experiences with unction and lived ever after happy The title page bears a picture of the devil as a fine gentleman wearing his tail as a sword and having one high topped cloven footed boot This book enjoyed unbounded popularity even during the early years of this century It was similar in teaching to a chap book which was entitled The Afflicted Parents or the Undutiful Child Punished In this tale the daughter gave some very priggish advice to her wicked brother who promptly knocks her down and kills her He is captured tried condemned sentenced and at last executed by two pardoned highwaymen But upon being cut down he comes to life pompously discourses at much length and then is executed a second time as a warning to all disobedient children Death bed scenes continued to be full of living interest The Good Child s Little Hymnbook represents the taste of the times One poem is on the death and burial of twins and thus is doubly interesting Another is on Dying The child asks whether he is going to die and look white and awful and be put in the pithole with other dead people And yet the preface runs Mamma See what a Pretty Book At Day s Pappa has bought That I may at the pictures look And by the words be taught After a time some attempts were made to render the Bible in a form specially for children s reading There was a rhymed adaptation called the Bible in Verse This was not the Bible versification of Samuel Wesley printed in seventeen seventeen of which he says condescendingly Some passages here represented are so barren of Circumstances that it was not easy to make them shine in Verse Older hands had essayed to rhyme the Bible one was called A Briefe Somme of the Bible These Bible abridgments were literally little books usually three or four inches long covered with brown or mottled paper One tiny well worn book of Bible stories was but two inches long and an inch wide It had two hundred and fifty pages each of about twenty words There was also the famous Thumb Bible printed by the Boston book printers Mein and Fleming A copy of this may be seen at the Lenox Library in New York City The Hieroglyphick Bible with Emblematick Figures was illustrated with five hundred tiny pictures set with the print which helped to tell the story after the manner of an illustrated rebus Bewick made the cuts for the English edition Tiny catechisms were widely printed and sought after and used as gifts to good and godly children There were also dull little books of parables modelled on the parables of the Bible Those were profoundly religious but were so darkly and figuratively expressed as to be frequently entirely incomprehensible and they fully realized the definition of a parable given by a child I know a heavenly story with no earthly meaning Illustration Page of Hieroglyphick Bible An extremely curious and antiquated religious panada was entitled the History of the Holy Jesus The seventh edition was printed in New London in seventeen fifty four The illustrations in this stupid little book were more surprising than the miserable text No attempt was made to represent Oriental scenery The picture of an earthquake showed a group of toy houses and a substantial church of the type of the Old South in perfect condition tipped over and leaning solidly on each other The Prodigal Son returned to an English manor house with latticed windows and the women wore high commodes and hoop skirts In the cut intended to represent to the inquiring young Christian in New England the Adoration of the Magi the wise men of the East appear in the guise of prosperous British merchants in cocked hats knee breeches and full skirted coats with great flapped pockets they look wisely at the star spotted heavens and a mammoth and extremely conventionalized comet through British telescopes mounted on tripods The Slaughter of the Innocents must have seemed painfully close at hand when Yankee children looked at the trim military platoons of English clad infants each waving an English flag while Herod in a modern uniform on a horse with modern trappings charged upon them Perhaps some of the fathers and mothers born in England and in the Church of England had a still more vivid realization of Herod s crime for it was the custom in some English parishes at one time to whip all the children on Holy Innocent s Day As Gregory said It hath been a custom to whip up the children upon Innocent s Day morning that the memorie of this murther might stick the closer and in a moderate proportion to act over the crueltie again in kind The book was in rhyme Here are a few of the verses The Wise Men from the East do come Led by a Shining Star And offer to the new born King Frankincense Gold and Myrrh Which Herod hears wrathful Grows And now by Heavn s Decree Joseph and Mary and her Son Do into AEgypt flee The Bloody Wretch enrag d to think Christ s Death he could not gain Commands that Infants all about Bethlehem should be slain But O to hear the awful cries Of Mothers in Distress And Rachel mourns for her first born Snatch d from her tender Breast The History of the Holy Jesus was told by reverend mister Instructwell to Master Learnwell The book contained also the Child s Body of Divinity and some of doctor Watts hymns These Divine Songs for Children appear in many forms The Cradle Hymn is the one most frequently seen and I recently have heard it extolled as a perfect lullaby for a child A curious study it is showing how absolutely traditional religious conception could usurp the mind and obscure the impulses of the heart Its sweet and tender lines which begin Hush my dear lie still and slumber Holy angels guard thy bed are soon contrasted with the vehement words which tell of the lot of the infant Jesus and at the mother s passionate expressions of brutal creatures cursed sinners that affront their Lord the child apparently cries for the mother sings Soft my child I did not chide thee Though my song may sound too hard In the next stanza however theological venom again finds vent to the poor wondering baby Yet to read the shameful story How the Jews abused their King How they served the Lord of Glory Makes me angry while I sing This certainly seems an ill phrased and exciting lullaby but is perhaps what might be expected as the notion of a soothing cradle hymn from a bigoted old bachelor CHAPTER XIV STORY AND PICTURE BOOKS If we are to consider that the condition of the human mind at any particular juncture is worth studying it is certainly of importance to know on what food its infancy is fed The Book Hunter John Hill Burton eighteen sixty three Locke says in his Thoughts on Education that the only book I know of fit for children is AEsop s Fables and Reynard the Fox By this he means the only story books A chap book a cheap ill printed edition of AEsop s Fables was read in New England but I have found nothing to indicate that these fables were specially printed or bought for children or that children were familiar with them There seem to have been absolutely no books for the special delight of young men and maids in the first years in the new world no romances or tales of adventure nor were there any in England One Richard Codrington a Puritan and a tiresome old bore wrote a book For the Instructing of the Younger Sort of Maids and Boarders at Schools It is about as void of instruction as a book well could be and this is his pleasant notion of a girl s own book To entertain young Gentlewomen in their hours of Recreation we shall commend unto them God s Revenge against Murther and Artemidorous his Interpretation of Dreams It isn t hard to guess which one of these two was taken out most frequently from the school library Speculation about dreams was one of the few existing outlets to youthful imagination and many happy hours were spent in elaborate interpretations Thus tired Nature s sweet restorer balmy Sleep supplied the element of romance which the dull waking hours denied and made life worth living Though no great books were written for children during all these years three of the great books of the world written with deep purpose for grown readers were calmly appropriated by children with a promptness that would seem to prove the truth of the assertion that children are the most unerring critics of a story These books were Pilgrim s Progress first published in sixteen eighty eight Robinson Crusoe in seventeen fourteen and Gulliver s Travels in seventeen twenty six The religious political and satirical purposes of these books have been wholly obscured by their warm adoption as stories They have been loved by hundreds of thousands of English reading children and translated into many other languages Hundreds of other books chiefly for children have been written that have been inspired by or modelled on these books thus the debt of children to them is multiplied Illustration MERRY TALES OF THE Wi f e Men of GOTHAM Printed and Sold in London Title page of Merry Tales The history of children s story books in both England and America begins with the life of John Newbery the English publisher who settled in London in seventeen forty four His life and his work have been told at length by mister Charles Welsh in the book entitled A Book Seller of the Last Century Newbery was the first English bookseller who made any extended attempt to publish books especially for children s reading The text of these books was written by himself and by various English authors among them no less a genius than Oliver Goldsmith His books were promptly exported to America where they were doubtless as eagerly welcomed as in England The meagre advertisements of colonial newspapers contain his lists During Newbery s active career as a publisher and activity was his distinguishing characteristic he published over two hundred books for children One of the earliest was announced in seventeen forty four as a pretty little pocket book It contained the story of Jack the Giant Killer Illustration TALE III Illustration two men with a cuckoo On a time the men of Gotham fain would have pinned the cuckoo that f he might f ing all the year all in the mid f t of the town they had a hedge made in a round compa f s and got a cuckoo and put her into it and f aid Sing here and you f hall lack neither meat nor drink all the year The Cuckoo when f he f ee her f elf encompa f f ed within the hedge flew away A vengeance on her f aid the Wi f e Men we made not the hedge high enough Page of Merry Tales of Wise Men of Gotham An amusing albeit thrifty intermezzo of all children s books was the publisher s persistent advertisement of his other juvenile literary wares If a generous godfather is introduced he is at once importuned to buy another of good mister Newbery the printer s books When Tommy Truelove is to have his reward of virtue and industry he implores that it may be a little book sold at the Book Shop over against Aldermary Churchyard Bow Lane If a kind mamma sets out to learn Jenny June to read she does it with one of Marshall s Universal Battledores so beloved of young masters and misses The old time reader was never permitted to forget for over a page that the good kind thoughtful gentleman who printed this book had plenty of others to sell Newbery was the most ingenious of these advertisers This is an example of one of his newspaper eye catchers printed in seventeen fifty five This day was published Nurse Truelove s New Years Gift or the book of books for children adorned with cuts and designed as a present for every little boy who would become a great man and ride upon a fine horse and to every little girl who would become a great woman and ride in a lord mayor s gilt coach Printed for the author who has ordered these books to be given gratis to all boys and girls at the Bible and Sun in saint Paul s Churchyard they paying for the binding which is only twopence for each book Other books were sold with a Ball and Pincushion the use of which will infallibly make Tommy a good boy and Polly a good girl The juvenile characters in the books are always turning aside to read or buy some one of mister Newbery s little books or pulling one of mister Newbery s nice gilded library out of their pockets or taking doctor James Fever Powder which was also one of mister Newbery s popular specialities The Revolutionary patriot and printer Isaiah Thomas was said to be very ingenious in spirit I do not know the exact significance of this term unless it means that he was a wide awake publisher which he certainly was He was a bright stirring man of quick wit and active intelligence in all things He brought out just after the Revolution many little books for children Few of them have any pretence of originality even in a single page Nearly all are wholesale reprints of various English books for children chiefly those of John Newbery I don t know what made Thomas so ready to catch up the reprinting of these children s books in advance of other American printers Perhaps his attention was led to it by the fact that his Prentice s Token or specimen of his work when he was a printer s prentice was one of those little books It was issued in seventeen sixty one by A Barclay in Cornhill Boston and a copy now in the possession of the American Antiquarian Society at Worcester Massachusetts is indorsed in Thomas own handwriting as being by his prentice hand The book is entitled Tom Thumbs Play Book To Teach Children their letters as soon as they can speak It contains the old rhyme A Apple pye B bit it C cut it et cetera Then came the rhymes beginning A was an Archer and shot at a frog also a short catechism Isaiah Thomas lived in Worcester printed these books there and founded there the American Antiquarian Society in the library of that society now in that city may be seen copies of nearly all these children s books which he reprinted and a collection of pretty quaint little volumes they are It is the universal decision of the special students of juvenile literature that Goldsmith wrote Goody Two Shoes Washington Irving thought the title page plainly bore the stamp of the sly and playful humour of the author of the Vicar of Wakefield It reads thus The History of Little Goody Two Shoes otherwise called missus Margery Two Shoes with the means by which she acquired her Learning and Wisdom and in consequence thereof her Estate set forth at large for the Benefit of those Who from a state of Rags and Care And having Shoes but half a pair Their fortune

the whole Pari f h was frightened Who does not know Lady Ducklington or who does not know that f he was buried at this pari f h church Well The Renowned History of Goody Two Shoes See the original manuscript in the Vatican at Rome and the Cuts by Michael Angelo Illustrated by the Comments of our great modern Critics Price Sixpence Copies of Goody Two Shoes are seldom seen for sale to day and many copies are expurgated The following quaint chapter is the one chosen for excision because our children must never hear the word ghost HOW THE WHOLE PARISH WAS FRIGHTENED Who does not know Lady Ducklington or who does not know that she was buried at this parish church Well I never saw so grand a funeral in all my life but the money they squandered away would have been better laid out in little books for children or in meat drink and clothes for the poor This is a fine hearse indeed and the nodding plumes on the horses look very grand but what end does that answer otherwise than to display the pride of the living or the vanity of the dead Fie upon such folly say I and heaven grant that those who want more sense may have it But all the country round came to see the burying and it was late before the corpse was interred After which in the night or rather about four o clock in the morning the bells were heard to jingle in the steeple which frightened the people prodigiously who all thought it was Lady Ducklington s ghost dancing among the bell ropes The people flocked to Will Dobbins the Clerk and wanted him to go and see what it was but William said he was sure it was a ghost and that he would not offer to open the door At length mister Long the rector hearing such an uproar in the village went to the clerk to know why he did not go into the church and see who was there I go says William why the ghost would frighten me out of my wits missus Dobbins too cried and laying hold on her husband said he should not be eat up by the ghost A ghost you blockheads says mister Long in a pet did either of you ever see a ghost or know anybody that did Yes says the clerk my father did once in the shape of a windmill and it walked all round the church in a white sheet with jack boots on and had a gun by its side instead of a sword A fine picture of a ghost truly says mister Long give me the key of the church you monkey for I tell you there is no such thing now whatever may have been formerly Then taking the key he went to the church all the people following him As soon as he opened the door what sort of a ghost do you think appeared Why little Twoshoes who being weary had fallen asleep in one of the pews during the funeral service and was shut in all night She immediately asked mister Long s pardon for the trouble she had given him told him she had been locked into the church and said she should not have rung the bells but that she was very cold and hearing Farmer Boult s man go whistling by with his horses she was in hopes he would have went to the Clerk for the key to let her out It would seem that even an advanced pedagogist and child culturist might forgive this delightful ghost like a windmill with jack boots and a gun just as a modern grammarian must forgive the verb would have went from little Two Shoes who as mister Charles Welsh says really ought to have known better The first Worcester edition of Goody Two Shoes was printed in seventeen eighty seven with some alterations suited to time and place Margery sings the Cuzzes Chorus which may be found in the Pretty Little Pocket Book of mister Thomas et cetera and when she grows up she is made a teacher in missus Williams College which is described in Nurse Truelove s American books It will doubtless be a surprise to many that Tommy Trip s History of Beasts and Birds et cetera was written by Goldsmith This little book opens with an account of Tommy and his dog Jowler who serves Tommy for a horse When Tommy has a mind to ride he pulls a little bridle out of his pocket whips it upon honest Jowler and away he gallops tantwivy As he rides through the town he frequently stops at the doors to know how the good children do within and if they are good and learn their books he then leaves an apple an orange or a plumb cake at the door and away he gallops again tantwivy tantwivy As a specimen of Tommy s literary skill he gives the lines beginning Three children sliding on the ice Upon a summer s day et cetera The description of animals are such as would be expected from the author of Animated Nature an amusing medley of truth and tradition Illustration A NEW

children both in the titles and as the name of ascribed author It was used until this century The title page of A New Lottery Book by Tommy Trip is here shown The manner of using this little Lottery Book is thus explained As soon as the child can speak let him stick a pin through the page by the side of the letter you wish to teach him Turn the page every time and explain the letter by which

Them the Lilliputian Magazine and other Books that are sold by mister Isaiah Thomas at his Book Store near the Court House in Worcester c c It will be noted that the word college is employed in its old time meaning of school but I am not sure that Thomas used it innocently For in the following pages the text compares missus Williams to any other old Lady in the European Universities The Christmas Box referred to has a decided American flavor It was printed in seventeen eighty nine and is entitled Nurse True Love s Christmas Box or a Golden Plaything for Children It gives the history of one Master Friendly and is specially forced in style Here are two sentences He learned so fast Dear me it did my heart good to hear him talk and read Why he got all the little books by rote that are sold by mister Thomas in Worcester when he was but a very little boy Then he never missed church Ah he was a charming boy He is chosen Congressman already and yet he is not puffed up Well I saw him seated in a Chair when he was chosen Congressman and he looked he looked I do not know what he looked like but everybody was in love with him Illustration He He He Frontispiece of Be Merry and Wise This latter sentence is accompanied by a cut of Congressman Friendly imbecile in countenance seated in a chair fixed on two handles and borne aloft by four footmen in full livery This picture had evidently seen service as a chairing in some English book When we think what the Congressmen of that day were earnest simple hearted patriots and that Thomas knew them well it seems strange that he could have given such stuff to American children On the inside of the cover are printed these lines Come hither little Lady fair And you shall ride take the Air But first of all pray let me know If you can say your criss cross row For none should e er in coaches be Unless they know their A B C It may interest children to read a short story from one of these little volumes to see the sort of thing children had to amuse them a hundred years ago This is from a book called The Father s Gift or How to be Wise and Happy There were two little Boys and Girls the Children of a fine Lady and Gentleman who loved them dearly They were all so good and loved one another so well that every Body who saw them talked of them with Admiration far and near They would part with any Thing to each other loved the Poor spoke kindly to Servants did every Thing they were bid to do were not proud knew no Strife but who should learn their Books best and be the prettiest Scholar The Servants loved them and would do any Thing they desired They were not proud of fine Clothes their Heads never ran on their Playthings when they should mind their Books They said Grace before they ate and Prayer before going to bed and as soon as they rose They were always clean and neat would not tell a Fib for the World and were above doing any Thing that required one God blessed them more and more and their Papa Mama Uncles Aunts and Cousins for their Sakes They were a happy Family no one idle all prettily employed the little Masters at their Books the little Misses at their Needles At their Play hours they were never noisy mischievous or quarrelsome No such word was ever heard from their Mouths as Why mayn t I have this or that as well as Betty or Bobby Or Why should Sally have this or that any more than I but it was always as Mama pleases she knows best with a Bow and a Smile without Surliness to be seen on their Brow They grew up the Masters became fine Scholars and fine Gentlemen and were honoured the Misses fine Ladies and fine Housewives This Gentleman sought to Marry one of the Misses and that Gentleman the Other Happy was he that could be admitted into their Company They had nothing to do but to pick and choose the best Matches in the Country while the greatest Ladies for Birth and most remarkable for Virtue thought themselves honoured by the Addresses of the two Brothers They all married and made good Papas and Mamas and so the blessing goes round The Brother s Gift or the Naughty Girl Reformed of which the third Worcester edition was printed in seventeen ninety one bore these lines as a motto Ye Misses Shun the Coxcomb of the Mall The Masquerade the Rout the Midnight Ball In lieu of these more useful arts pursue And as you re fair be wise and virtuous too Though useful arts were inculcated by this book the reward of virtue to the reformed girl was a fine new pair of stays which are duly pictured Another of Newbery s beloved books was The History of Tommy Careless or the Misfortunes of a Week On Monday Tommy fell in the water spoiled his coat and was sent to bed On Tuesday he lost his kite and ended the day in bed On Wednesday he fell from the apple tree and again was put in bed Thursday the maid gave him two old pewter spoons he made some dump moulds and in casting his dumps scalded his fingers and as ever was put in retirement On Friday he

PRINTED BY ISAIAH THOMAS AND SOLD AT HIS BOOK STORE MDCCLXXXVI Title page of Be Merry and Wise When we think of the vast number of these books it seems strange that so few have survived The penny books were too valueless to be saved Sometimes we find one among abandoned or discarded piles or bundles of books It has been the fate however of most children s books to be destroyed by children With coarse time browned paper poor type and torn worn leaves they are not very attractive Open one at random Ten to one you have before you the page upon which centres the interest of the book its climax its adventure or its high wit That page was a favorite Many times you will find crude attempts at amateur coloring of the prints In these books is found an entirely different code from that inculcated by modern books or taught by earlier books The first books for children simply exhorted goodness giving no reasons but commanding obedience and virtue The books of the Puritan epoch taught children to be good for fear of hell This succeeding school instructed them to be good because it was profitable All the advice is frankly politic much is of mercenary mould Children are instructed to do aright not because they should but because they will benefit thereby and profit is given the most worldly guise such as riding in a coach having a purse full of gold wearing silks and satins becoming Lord Mayor or most exalted station of all a proud Sheriff As chief officer of the Crown the old time sheriff of each English county was superior in rank to every nobleman in the county The diarist Evelyn tells that his father when sheriff had a hundred and fifty servants in livery and many gentleman attendants Punishment the abhorrence of parents and evil results fall upon children not so fiercely for lying stealing treachery or cruelty as they do for soiling their clothes falling into the water tumbling off walls breaking windows or china and a score of other actions which are the result of carelessness clumsiness or indifference rather than of viciousness These books would educate had they been forcible enough to be of profound influence generations of trucklers time servers and money lovers The natural inclination and the diversity of inclination of children made them rise above these instructions Illustration COBWEBS TO CATCH FLIES fifty two In another part of the fair the boys f aw f ome children to f f ed about thus They were f inging merrily the old nur f e s ditty Now we go up up up Now we go down down down Now we go backward and forward Now we go round round round Page from Cobwebs to Catch Flies It was the constant effort of the artists authors and teachers of olden times to imbue youth with the notion that no harm could possibly come to the good unless early death could be counted an evil Children were taught that virtue and each good action was ever immediately and conspicuously rewarded The pictures repeated and emphasized the didactic teachings and morality industry and good intentions were made to triumph over things animate and inanimate That the old illustrations were a delight to children cannot be doubted they were so easily comprehended The bad boys of the story always bore a miserable countenance and figure and the good boys were smugly prosperous The prim girls are shown the beloved of all and the tomboys equally the misery and embarrassment All this is lacking in modern picture books which so truly represent real life and things that the naughty boy is not blazoned at first glance as a different being from the pious delight I am inclined to believe that the old time grotesqueness was more amusing and impressive to children than modern realism that there was a stronger association of ideas with the emphasis of disproportion the absurdities and anachronisms of scenery and costume were unnoted by the juvenile reader because he knew no better In the children s books which I have examined the colored illustrations are all of dates later than eighteen hundred when dated at all mister Andrew W Tuer in the preface to his most interesting collection entitled Pages and Pictures from Forgotten Children s Books says that the coloring was done by children in their teens who worked with great celerity Each child had a single pan of water color a brush a properly colored guide and a pile of printed sheets One child painted in all the red required by the copy another the green another the blue and so on till the coloring was finished Illustration William and Amelia from The Looking Glass for the Mind There was one book which children loved that every little child loves to day Mother Goose s Melodies Attempts have been made to show that the name and collection were both American that the former referred to one missus Goose or Vergoose a Boston goodwife The name Mother Goose is believed by most folk to be of French not of English or American origin A collection of nursery rhymes was printed for John Newbery about seventeen sixty under the popular name Mother Goose s Melodies about seventeen eighty five Isaiah Thomas issued at Worcester Massachusetts an edition of Mother Goose s Melodies with the songs from Shakespeare and certainly this must have been an oasis in the desert of dull books for New England children There is no pretence in this edition of Thomas that the book had any American origin it is said to be a collection of rhymes by old British nurses and such it really was Halliwell says many of these nursery rhymes are fragments of old ballads mister Whitmore deems the great popularity of Mother Goose due to the Boston editions issued in large numbers from eighteen twenty four to eighteen sixty The preface to the Worcester edition of seventeen eighty five circa is said to be written by a very great writer of very little books Could this have been Oliver Goldsmith Irving in his Life of Goldsmith refers to the poet s love of catches and simple melodies and tells of his singing his favorite song about An old woman tossed in a blanket seventeen times as high as the moon A Miss Hawkins boasted late in life that Goldsmith taught her to play Jack and Jill with bits of paper on his fingers just as we show the trick to children to day Included in these melodies are the verses Three children sliding on the ice which we know were written by Goldsmith Here is an example of one of the melodies and its note Trip upon Trenchers Dance upon Dishes My mother sent me for some Barm some Barm She bade me tread Lightly And leave again Quickly For fear the Young Men should do me some Harm Yet don t you see What naughty tricks they put upon me They broke my Pitcher And spilt my Water And huffed my Mother And chid her Daughter And kiss d my Sister instead

the day the notion of Goldsmith or some other book hack wag these notes were all ascribed as quotations from some profound author just as the cuts in Goody Two Shoes were said to be by Michael Angelo

Lesson to Cure Vanity from The Looking Glass for the Mind A very priggish little book was entitled Cobwebs to Catch Flies The tone of its text may be shown in the dialogue about The Toss About The brothers who attended a country fair had been forbidden by their mother to ride in the Merry go round Dear Ned wished to try the fun Dear James said with propriety Dear Ned I am sure our mamma would object to our riding in this Toss about Ned answered Dear James did you ever hear her name the Toss about No dear Ned but I am certain that if she had known of it she would have given us the same caution as she did about the Merry go round Ned paused a moment then said How happy am I to have an elder brother who is so prudent Whereupon James replied I am no less happy that you are so willing to be advised et cetera A distinctly American book for children was printed in Philadelphia in seventeen ninety three a History of the Revolution It was in Biblical phraseology This sort of writing had been made popular by Franklin in his famous Parable against Persecution which he wrote committed to memory and pretended to read as the last chapter in Genesis Illustration Sir John Denham and his Worthy Tenant from The Looking Glass for the Mind Exceeding plainness and even coarseness of speech was presented in the pages of these old time story books It was simply the speech of the times shown in the plays tales and essays of the day and reflected to some degree even in the literature for children As an example of what was deemed wit may be given a portion of the prologue to Who Killed Cock Robin The book is entitled Death and Burial of Cock Robin We were all enjoying ourselves very agreeably after dinner when on a sudden Sir Peter s Lady gave so loud a sneeze as threw the whole company into disorder Master Danvers instead of cracking a nut gave his fingers a tolerable squeeze in the nut crackers Miss Friendly who had carried with intent to put a fine cherry in her mouth missed the mark and bit her finger Sir Peter himself who was filling a glass of wine spilled the bottle on the table Miss Comely and Miss Danvers who were talking with each other with their heads very close to each other very politely knocked them together to see which was the hardest I myself had twelve of my ten toes handsomely trod on by one of the young ladies jumping off a chair in a fright But this is not all no nor half what I was an eye witness of for just at the time her Ladyship sneezed I was busy contemplating the beauty and song of Miss Prudence s Cock Robin that was singing and as noisy as a grig when my Lady sneezed which so frightened him he fell to the bottom of the Cage as dead as a Stone A widely read little book was somewhat pompously entitled The Looking Glass for the Mind It was chiefly translated from that much admired work L Ami des Enfans Those terse and entertaining tales of Berquin had perennial youth in their English form and were reprinted till our own day The illustrations of Bewick have a distinct value as showing the dress of children A few are here shown The first is from William and Amelia both children are not eight years old The long trained gowns bare necks elbow sleeves and tall feathered hats are precisely the dress of grown women of that day as William s coat and knee breeches are the garb of a man The two ladies were walking arm in arm humming a pretty song then fashionable in the village collection of Ballads When they glanced at the apples in the tree William the politest and prettiest little fellow in the village dropped his shepherd s pipe climbed the tree and threw down apples in the ladies aprons As Charlotte got more and bigger apples Amelia abandoned her usual pleasing prattle sulked and at last ordered William to fall down on his knees on this instant to apologize As he refused Amelia pouted at dinner would not touch her wine nor say Your good health William and at last was ordered by her mother from the table William after many attempts sneaked out with some peaches for her and thus an affectionate and generous friendship was restored Illustration Clarissa or the Grateful Orphan from The Looking Glass for the Mind Another illustration is for the tale Caroline or a Lesson to Cure Vanity Caroline s dress is further described in the text as of pea green taffety with fine pink trimmings elegantly worked shoes hair a clod of powder and pomatum Her fine silk slip was nicely soused in the rain her hoop and flounces and train caught in the furzes her gauze hat blew in a pond of filthy water et cetera all these made her glad to return to a more modest dress The illustration for the Worthy Tenant shows Farmer Harris speaking to polite Sophia while Robert was so shamefully impertinent as to walk round the farmer holding his nose and asking his brother if he did not perceive something of the smell of a dung heap He then lighted some paper at the fire and carried it around the room in order to disperse as he said the unpleasant smell et cetera Clarissa or the Grateful Orphan who was so good that the king relinquished a large fortune to her complete the quartette of illustrations A group of books was published just after the end of the colonial period which had a vast influence on the children of our young Republic These books were English the most important of them were The History of

religious tales of James Janeway were not the only ones to familiarize death to the reading child The Fairchild Family was once deemed a most charming as it was certainly a most earnest book and it has ever had popularity for within a few years it has been reprinted in a large edition I wonder how many death bed scenes and references there are in that book Nor are ordinary death beds the saddest or most grewsome scenes The little Fairchilds having lost their little tempers and pommelled each other somewhat their father takes them as a shocking object lesson to see the body of a man hung in chains on a gibbet The horror of the progress through the gloomy wood to this revolting sight the father s unsparing comments the hideous account of the thing rattling swinging turning its horrible countenance while mister Fairchild described and explained and gloated over it and finally kneeled and prayed all this through several pages no carefully reared child to day would be permitted to read mister Fairchild s reason for taking them to this gibbeted corpse should not be omitted from this account it was to show them something which I think they will remember as long as they live that they may love each other with perfect and heavenly love A painful and ever present lesson found on every page is the sinfulness of the world The children recite verses and quote Bible texts to prove that all mankind have bad hearts and Lucy commits to memory a prayer a portion of which runs thus My heart is so exceedingly wicked so vile so full of sin that even when I appear to be tolerably good even then I am sinning When I am praying or reading the Bible or hearing other people read the Bible even then I sin When I speak I sin when I am silent I sin Sandford and Merton is most insincerely recommended by many folk to children to day I cannot believe any one who has recently read the book would ever expect a modern child to care for it It is haloed in the memory of people who read it in their youth and fancy they still like it but won t take the trouble to read it and see that they don t Jane and Ann Taylor should be added to this class of authors The poem My Mother by Ann Taylor was

binding of these books so often spoken of in the notices is wholly a thing of the past It was made in Holland and Germany but recent inquiry about it discovered that the stamps and presses used in its manufacture had all been destroyed An enthusiastic lover of these little books wrote Talk of your vellum gold embossed morocco roan and calf The blue and yellow wraps of old were prettier by half They were cheap enough but a penny apiece some of them others sixpence It is doubtful whether they were ever sold in America in vast numbers Children lent them to each other Anna Green Winslow borrowed them and letters of her day show other children doing likewise It was a day of book lending for circulating libraries were slow of formation The minister s library was often the largest one in each town and he lent his precious books to his flock In the sparse advertisements of colonial newspapers are many advertisements of book owners who have lent books forgotten to whom and wish them returned The only way country children had of reading many books was by borrowing Illustration Vice in its proper Shape thirty nine he had lived to years of maturity kind death was plea f ed to di f patch him in the twelfth year of his age by the help of a dozen penny cu f tards which he greedily conveyed down his throat at one meal and thereby gorged his stomach and threw him f elf into a mortal fever After his Page of Vice in its proper Shape American boys and girls felt till our own day both bewilderment and impatience at forever reading stories whose local color was wholly strange to them doctor Holmes thus expresses this condition of things Books where James was called Jem not Jim as we heard it where naughty schoolboys got through a gap in the hedge to steal Farmer Giles s red streaks instead of shinning over the fence to hook old Daddy Jones s baldwins where Hodge used to go to the ale house for his mug of beer while we used to see old Joe steering for the grocery to get his glass of rum where there were larks and nightingales instead of yellow birds and bobolinks where the robin was a little domestic bird that fed at table instead of a great fidgety jerky whooping thrush The debt of amusement which American children owed to Newbery was paid in this century by the supply to English children of a vast number of little books of profit and pleasure all written by a single author Peter Parley or Samuel G Goodrich In the middle of the century this gentleman stated that he had written one hundred and twenty books that were professedly juvenile Of these and his books for older minds about seven million copies had been sold and about three hundred thousand were still sold annually They were sent to England in vast numbers and were reprinted there both with and without the author s permission And when the original books were not pirated the name Peter Parley was calmly attached to the compositions of English authors as a vastly salable trade mark Scores of American authors by the middle of this century were writing little books for children These were a class by themselves Sunday school books They do not come within the very elastic time limit set for this chapter They are not old enough in years though they are rapidly becoming as obsolete as any children s books of the last century Books written avowedly for Sunday schools are in decreasing demand Those with sectarian teachings especially find fewer and fewer purchasers CHAPTER XV CHILDREN S DILIGENCE For Satan finds some mischief still For idle hands to do Divine Songs for Children Isaac Watts seventeen twenty Colonial children did not spend much time in play The old deluder Sathan was not permitted to find many idle hands ready for his mischievous work It was ordered by the magistrates that children tending sheep or cattle in the field should be set to some other employment withal such as spinning upon the rock knitting weaving tape et cetera These were all simple industries requiring slight paraphernalia The rock was the hand distaff It was simple of manipulation but required a certain knack of dexterity to produce even well twisted thread Good spinners could spin on the rock as they walked Tape weaving was done on a simple appliance the heddle frame of primitive weavers known as a tape loom garter loom belt loom or gallus frame On these small looms girls wove scores of braids and tapes for use as glove ties shoe strings hair laces stay laces garters hatbands belts et cetera and boys wove garters and breeches suspenders There was plenty of work on a farm even for little children they sowed various seeds in early spring they weeded flax fields walking barefoot among the tender plants they hetchelled flax and combed wool All the work on the flax after the breaking was done in olden times by women and children It is said there are in all twenty different occupations in flax manufacture of which half can be easily done by children Much of the work in domestic wool spinning and weaving was done by little girls They could spin on the great wheel when they were so small that they had to stand on a foot stool to reach up They skeined the yarn on a clock reel They easily filled the quills with the woollen yarn used in weaving bedspreads and set the quills in the middle of the great pointed wooden shuttles They wound the white warp on the spools and set the spools on the scarne They might if very deft and attentive help set the piece that is wind the warp threads on the great yarn beam pass them through the eyes of the heddles or harness and the spans of the reed Girls of six could spin flax Anna Green Winslow when twelve years old speaks often in her diary of spinning and when disabled from sewing by a painful whitlow on her finger wrote that it is a nice opportunity if I do but improve it to perfect myself in learning to spin flax Illustration The Good Girl and her Wheel In the Memoirs of the missionaries David and John Brainerd a boy s busy life on a Connecticut farm is thus described The boy was taught that laziness was the worst form of original sin Hence he must rise early and make himself useful before he went to school must be diligent there in study and promptly home to do chores at evening His whole time out of school must be filled up with some service such as bringing in fuel for the day cutting potatoes for the sheep feeding the swine watering the horses picking the berries gathering the vegetables spooling the yarn He was expected never to be reluctant and not often tired This constant employment of a farm boy s time lasted till our own day but now conditions have changed in Eastern farm life The work still is hard and incessant but not so varied as of yore Many crops are obsolete no flax is raised and but little wool and that sold as soon as sheared Little grain is raised and no threshing is done by the flail Vast itinerant threshing machines go from farm to farm Few farmers make cider which gave so much work to the boys in autumn There is no potash or soap boiling One of the most delightful chronicles of obsolete farm industry is written by honorable George Sheldon and entitled The Passing of the Stall Fed Ox and the Farmer s Boy Illustration nine THE LITTLE SEMPSTRESS This pretty sempstress who can see And not admire her industry As thus upright she sits to sew Not stooping as some children do Illustration from Plain Things for Little Folks The sawing and chopping of wood was a never diminishing incubus this outdoor work on wood was continued within doors in the series of articles fashioned for farm and domestic use by the boy s jack knife and the few heavy carpenter s tools at his command some gave to the farm boy the rare pennies of his spending money The making of birch splinter brooms was the best paying work For these the boy got six cents apiece The splitting of shoe pegs was another Setting card teeth was for many years the universal income furnisher for New England children Gathering nuts was a scantily paid for harvest tying onions a less pleasing one and chiefly followed in the Connecticut Valley The crop of wild cherries known as chokecherries was one of the most lucrative of the boy s resources They were much desired for making cherry rum or cherry bounce and would fetch readily a dollar a bushel A good sized tree would yield about six bushels J T Buckingham tells of his first spending money being ninepence received from a brush maker for hog bristles saved from slaughtered swine The story of various silk fevers which raged in America cannot be given here romantic as they are From the first venture the care of silkworms was held to be a specially suitable work for children It was said two boys if their hands be not sleeping in their pockets could care for six ounces of seed from hatching till within fourteen days of spinning when three or four more helps women and children being as proper as men had to assist in feeding cleansing airing drying and perfuming them The Reformed Virginia Silk Worm asserted For the Labour of a man and boy They gain you Sixty pounds which is no toy Mulberry trees were planted everywhere and kept low like a hedge so children could pick the leaves All the books of instruction of the day reiterate that a child ten years of age could easily gather seventy five pounds of mulberry leaves a day and make great wages But an old lady now eighty years old who made much sewing silk in Connecticut in her youth writes thus to me Girls picked most of the leaves It was very hard work and very small pay They had ten cents a bushel for picking Some could pick three bushels a day The first thought of spring brought to the men of the New England household a hard work maple sugar making which meant vast labor in preparation and in execution all of which was cheerfully hailed for it gave men and boys a chance to be as Charles Kingsley said a savage for a while It meant several nights spent in the sugar camp in the woods a gypsying Think of the delight of that scene the air clear but mild enough to make the sap run patches of snow still shining pure in the moonlight and starlight all the mystery of the voices of the night when a startled rabbit or squirrel made a crackling sound in its stealthy retreat the distant hoot of a wakeful owl the snapping of pendent icicles and crackling of blazing brush yet over all a great stillness all silence and all glisten An exaltation of the spirit and senses came to the country boy which was transformed at midnight into keen thrills of imaginative fright at recollection of the stories told by his elders with rude acting and vivid wording during the early evening round the fire of hunting and trapping of Indians and bears and those delights of country story tellers in New England catamounts wolverines and cats this latter ever meaning in hunter s phrasing wild cats Think of a wolverine with eyes like blazing coals and every hair whistling like a bell as he sprung with outspread claws from a high tree on the passing hunter do you think the boy sat by the fire throughout the night without looking a score of times for the blazing eyeballs and listening for the whistling fur and hearing steps like that of the lion in Pilgrim s Progress a great soft padding paw What forest lore the boys learned too that more and sweeter sap came from a maple which stood alone than from any in a grove that the shallow gouge flowed more freely but the deep gouge was richest in sweet and that many other forest trees besides the maple ran a sweet sap I believe that in earliest colonial days boys also took part in a joyful outing a public custom known as perambulating or beating the bounds The memory of boundaries and division lines of commons public highways et cetera was kept fresh in the minds of the inhabitants by an old time Aryan custom the walking around them once a year noting lines of boundary and impressing these on the notice and memory of young people To induce English boys to accompany these perambulations it was customary to distribute some little gratuity this was usually a willow wand tied at the end with a bunch of points which were bits of string about eight inches long consisting of strands of cotton or woollen yarn braided or twisted together ended by a tag of a bit of metal or wood These points were used to tie the hose to the knees of the breeches the waistband of the breeches to the jacket et cetera Long after points were abandoned as a portion of dress the wands with their little knot of points were given Pepys wrote in sixteen sixty one that he heard that at certain boundaries the boys were smartly whipped to impress the bounds upon their memories Illustration Anne Lennod s Sampler Beating the bounds was a specially important duty in the colonies where land surveys were imperfect land grants irregular and the boundaries of each man s farm or plantation at first very uncertain In Virginia this beating the bounds was called processioning Landmarks were renewed that were becoming obliterated blazes on a tree would be somewhat grown over they were deeply recut piles of great stones containing a certain number for designation were sometimes scattered the original number would be restored Special trees would be found fallen or cut down new marking trees would be planted usually pear trees as they were long lived Disputed boundaries were decided upon and announced to all the persons present some of whom at the next processioning would be living and be able to testify as to the correct line This processioning took place between Easter and Whitsuntide that lovely season of the year in Virginia and must have proved a pleasant reunion of neighbors a May party In New England this was called perambulating the bounds and the surveyors who took charge were called perambulators or boundsgoers To either man or boy of to day or any day it would seem an absurdity to name hunting and fishing in a chapter dealing with boys diligence for in the sports of the woods and waters colonial boys doubtless found one of their greatest amusements But these sports were also hard work and were engaged in for profit as well as for pleasure The scattered sheepfolds and grazing pastures at first had to be zealously guarded from wild animals wolves were everywhere the most hated and most destructive beasts They were caught in many ways in wolf pits in log pens in log traps Heavy mackerel hooks were tied together dipped in melted tallow which hardened in a bunch and concealed the hooks and tied to a strong chain If the wolf swallowed the hooks without any chain attached it would kill him but he might die in the depths of the forest and his head could not be brought in to secure the bounty In old town lists are the names of many boys with wolf money set to their credit A wolf rout or wolf drive which was like the old English drift of the forest was a ring of men and boys armed with guns surrounding a large tract of forest The wary wolves scented their enemies afar and retreated before them to the centre of a circle and many were killed Squirrels and hares were hunted in the same way Once a year in many places they had shooting matches in which every living wild creature was prey and a prize was given to the one bringing in the most birds heads and animals tails This cruel wholesale destruction of singing birds as well as game birds was carried on almost till our own day Foxes were destructive in the hen yards On a bright moonlight night the hunters placed a load of codfish heads on the bright side of a stone wall The fish could be smelt afar and when the keen foxes approached they were shot by the hunters hiding in the shadow Bears lingered long even in the vicinity of cities and were hunted with dogs The History of Roxbury states that in the year seventeen twenty five in one week in September twenty bears were killed within two miles of Boston In Virginia deer hunting was a constant sport They were burnt out and in imitation of the Indian way of hunting under the blind of a stalking head the English taught their horses to walk slowly by the huntsman s side hiding him as he approached the deer who were not afraid of horses A diverting sport was what was called vermin hunting It was done on foot with small dogs by moon or starlight Raccoons foxes and opossums were the chief animals sought Bounties were paid for the destruction of squirrels and rattlesnakes It is appalling to see the bounty lists of some New England towns for snake rattles Yet the loss of life was small from snake bites The boys profited by all these bounties and worked eagerly to secure them Illustration Colonel Wadsworth and his Son Wild turkeys were caught in turkey pens enclosures made of poles about twenty feet long laid one above another forming a solid wall ten feet high This was covered with a close pole and brush roof A ditch was dug beginning about fifteen feet away from the pen sloping down and carried under one side of the pen and opening up into it through a board in which a hole was cut just large enough for a turkey to pass through Corn was strewn the whole length of the ditch The turkeys followed the ditch and the corn up through the hole into the pen and held their heads too high ever to find their way out again Often fifty captives would be found in the morning Boys learned to prate for pigeons that is to imitate their call This was useful in luring them within gun shot A successful method of pigeon shooting was learned from the Indians A covert was made of green branches with an opening in the back by which the hunter could enter In front of this covert at firing distance a long pole was raised up on two crotched sticks eight or ten feet from the ground set so that a shot from the booth would rake the entire length of the pole hence the crotch nearest the booth was a trifle lower than the other at the same angle that the gun barrel would take To lure pigeons from a flock to settle on this pole live pigeons were used as decoys They were temporarily blinded in a cruel manner A hole was pierced in the lower eyelid a thread inserted and the eyelid drawn up and tied over the eye A soft kid boot or loop was put over one leg and a fine cord tied to it The pigeon called the long flyer had a long cord and by his fluttering attracted pigeons from a flock The short flyer with shorter cord lured pigeons flying low The hoverer was tied close to the end of a small pole set on an upright post This pole was worked by a string and by moving the pigeon up and down it appeared to be hovering as if to alight The hunter loudly prating sat hidden behind his three blind fluttering terrified decoys Then came a beautiful flash and gleam of color and life and graceful motion as with a swish of reversed wings a row of gentle creatures lighted on the fatal pole In a second came the report of the gun and the ground was covered with the fluttering maimed and dead bodies Fifty two at one shot a Lexington man named William Locke killed Other methods of pigeon killing were by snaring them in twitch ups also in a pigeon bed baited over which a net was thrown on the feeding birds By the seashore whole communities turned to the teeming ocean for the means of life Every fishing vessel that left the towns of Cape Ann and Cape Cod carried with its crew of grown men a boy of ten or twelve to learn the art and mystery of fishing He had a name a cut tail He cut a wedge shaped bit from the tail of every fish he caught and in the sorting out and counting up at the close of the trip his share of the profits was thus plainly indicated Long before these fishing industries were thoroughly organized the early chroniclers told of the share of boys in fishing Even John Smith stirred up English stay at homes saying Young boyes girles salvages or any others bee they never such idlers may turne carry and returne fish without shame or either greate paine hee is very idle that is past twelve years of age and cannot doe so much and shee is very old that cannot spin a thread to catch them It was natural that boys born in seashore towns should turn to the sea They found in the incoming ships their sole connecting link with the outside world Romance sentiment mystery deviltry haloed the sailor He was ever welcome to the public and ever a source of interest whether in tarry working garb or gay shore togs of flapping trousers crimson sash eelskin and cutlasses or perhaps garbed like Captain Creedon who appeared in Boston in the year sixteen sixty two dressed so says the letter of a Boston minister in a strange habitt with a four Cornered Capp instead of a hatt and his Breeches hung with Ribbons from the Wast downward a great depth one over the other like the Shingles of a house Naturally enough the boys made an outcry and wondered Can it be wondered that two centuries of New England boys stirred in their quiet round of life by similar gay comets and tales of adventure have had a passionate ichor in their veins of longing for the magic and the mystery of the sea that they have eagerly gone before the mast and rounded the Horn and come home master seamen when in their teens I know a New England family of dignity and wealth in which six successive generations of sons have gone to sea in their boyhood some of later years running away from home to do so In Portsmouth New Hampshire in seventeen eighty seven so tells a newspaper of that date were living a man and wife who had been married about twenty years and had eighteen sons of whom ten were then at sea CHAPTER XVI NEEDLECRAFT AND DECORATIVE ARTS She wrought all Needleworks that Women exercise With Pin Frame or Stoole all Pictures Artificiall Curious Knots or Traits that Fancy could devise Beasts Birds or Flowers even as things Naturall Epitaph of Elizabeth Lucar Church saint Michael Crooked Lane London fifteen thirty seven Human nature was the same in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as to day waves of devotion to some special form of ornamentation either for the household or the wardrobe swept over families neighborhoods communities when we reach the days of newspapers we find in their columns some evidence of the names and character of these decorations In seventeen sixteen mister Brownell the Boston schoolmaster advertised that at his school young women and children could be taught all sorts of fine works as Feather works Filigree and Painting on Glass Embroidering a new way Turkeywork for Handkerchiefs two new Ways fine new fashion Purses flourishing ishing and Plain work The perishable nature of the material would prevent the preservation of many specimens of feather work but very pretty flowers for head dresses and bonnets were made of minute feathers or portions of feathers pasted on a firm foundation in many collected shapes This work may have been suggested by the beautiful feather flowers made in many of the South Sea Islands perhaps an old sea captain brought some home to his wife or sweetheart as a gift The sober colors of many of our home birds would not make so brilliant a bouquet as the songless birds of the tropics especially the millions of the various parrot tribes still an everyday New England rooster has a wealth of splendid glistening color while blue jays red headed woodpeckers yellow birds and an occasional oriole or scarlet tanager could furnish beautiful feathers enough to waken the ire of an Audubon Society Painting on glass was an amusement of more scope In England it was all the mode and some very quaint specimens survive simpering beauties flowers and fruit were the favorite subjects Coats of arms too were painted on glass and handsome they were It is not possible to state exactly the position which the study of armorial bearings and significations had for two or three centuries It seemed to bear relatively the same place that a profound study of literature has to day the pastime and delight of cultured people We have been amused for a few years past at the domination of color in literature every book title had a color word as The Red Robe Under the Red Lamp A Study in Scarlet The Red Badge of Courage et cetera This idiasm as mister Ingleby would call it has extended to music and even into scientific suggestion and medicine but this attributing unusual qualities to colors is nothing new In the Cotton Manuscripts a series of essays on music six hundred years old the relation between music and color especially in coat armor is given for instance fire red was the most malignant color in arms and only third in benignity in music All gentlefolk were profoundly wise as to the meaning of colors in coats of arms et cetera and their influence on the character and life of the persons bearing the arms This interest in the study of heraldry wavered in intensity but did not die till the days of a new nation and we find from the middle of the seventeenth to the middle of the eighteenth century that young girls in the families of gentlefolk paid much attention to the making of coats of arms Those painted on glass were the richest in color and the most satisfactory but embroidered ones were more common The choicest materials were used the drawing was carefully executed and the stitches minute It is interesting to note that the laws of the herald were strictly regarded in the setting of the stitches In azure the stitches were laid parallel across the escutcheon in gules perpendicular in purpure diagonally from right to left and so on Illustration Jerusha Pitkin s Embroidery and Frame Here is shown an unfinished coat of arms of the Pitkin family which belonged to Jerusha Pitkin who was born in seventeen thirty six The frame upon which the work is stretched the manner in which it is mounted the hand made nails that fasten it the way the work is outlined are all of interest The needle still is thrust in the black satin background where it was left by girlish hands a century and a half ago Colored silks gold bullion and thread to complete this work have been preserved with it The embroidery is on black satin and is lozenge shaped as was the proper shape of a hatchment or mourning emblem and it is possible that this work was begun as a funeral piece commemorative of some Pitkin ancestor Such funeral pieces were deemed a very dignified observance of respect and mark of affection They had as successors what were definitely termed mourning pieces bearing stiff presentments of funeral urns monuments drooping willows and sometimes a bowed and weeping figure After the death of Washington mourning designs deploring our national loss and significant of our affection and respect for that honored name appeared in vast numbers Framed prints of these designs hung on every wall table china in large numbers and variety bore these funereal emblems and laudatory and sad mottoes As other Revolutionary heroes passed away similar designs appeared in more limited numbers and the reign of embroidered mourning pieces may be said to begin at this time Washington so to speak set the fashion Familiarized with the hideous Apotheosis pitcher or the gloomy Washington s Tomb teacups as set on a festal board special mourning embroideries did not seem oversad for decorative purposes and soon no properly ambitious household was without one They were even embroidered when the family circle was unbroken and an empty space was left yawning like an open grave for some one to die Religious designs were also eagerly sought for The Tree of Life was a favorite A conventional tree was hung at wide intervals with apples bearing the names of various virtues and estimable traits of humanity such as Honor Modesty Silence Patience et cetera The sparse harvest of these emblematic fruits seemed to indicate a cynical belief in scant nobility of nature but there was hope of improvement for a white winged angel assiduously watered the roots of the tree with a realistic watering pot The devil never absent in that day from art science or literature also loomed in blackness beneath the branches but sadly handicapped from activity by being forced to carry a colossal pitchfork and an absolutely unsurmountable tail of gigantic proportions These mourning pieces were but decadent successors of the significant heraldic embroideries of earlier days We passed through trying days in art architecture and costume in the first half of this century and it was not until we revived the older forms of embroidery and the ancient stitches that we rallied from the blight of commonplaceness and sentimentality which seemed to spread over everything Illustration Lora Standish s Sampler The most universal and best preserved piece of embroidery done by our foremothers was the sampler These were known as sampleths sam cloths saumplers and sampleres the titles were all derived by apheresis from esampler exampleir The sampler contrived a double debt to pay of teaching letters and stitches it was in fact a needlework hornbook containing the alphabet a verse indicative of good morals or industry or a sentence from the Bible the name and date and some crude representations of impossible birds beasts flowers trees or human beings Though the sampler s reign in every American household was in the eighteenth century and the earlier years of the nineteenth it was the direct successor of the glories of needlework of English women of earlier years which was known and admired on the Continent as Opus Anglicanum The chief excellency of English needlework has even been closely associated with a high state of social morals In Elizabeth s day Englishwomen still loved needlecraft Shakespeare Sidney Milton Herrick all refer to women s samplers In a collection of old ballads printed in seventeen twenty five is A Short and Sweet Sonnet made by one of the Maids of Honour upon the death of Q Elizabeth which she sewed upon a Sampler of Red Silk Gone is Elizabeth whom we have loved so dear She our kind Mistress was full four and Forty Year England she govern d well not to be blamed Flanders she govern d well and Ireland famed France she befriended Spain she had toiled Papists rejected and the Pope spoiled To Princes powerful to the World vertuous To her Foes merciful to subjects gracious Her Soul is in Heaven the World keeps her glory Subjects her good deeds so ends my Story In the licentious days of King James and King Charles there is little record of women s needlework in court or country but the Puritan women the virtuous home makers revived and encouraged all household arts There is no doubt that as a rule the long and narrow samplers are older than those more nearly square These ancient samplers especially the few bearing dates of the seventeenth century are much finer in design more closely worked and better in execution than those of later date The linen background is much more closely covered They have more curious and varied stitches Occasionally they are of minute size but four or five inches long with exquisitely fine stitches Illustration Fleetwood Quincy Sampler Two ancient samplers are here depicted One shown on page three hundred twenty seven was made by Lora Standish the daughter of a Pilgrim Father and it is now at Pilgrim Hall Plymouth The interesting and beautiful sampler known as the Fleetwood Quincy Sampler has such perfect stitches that both sides are alike It bears the names Miles and Abigail Fleetwood and the date sixteen fifty four It has been in the possession of missus Henry Quincy and her descendants since seventeen fifty There is little doubt that the Miles Fleetwood of the sampler was the brother or nephew of Charles Fleetwood who married Anne Ireton eldest daughter of great Cromwell A splendid piece of Anne Fleetwood s embroidery was recently exhibited in the Kensington Museum It was scarcely a sampler for it bore a curious design in applique work of a lozenge formed by four right angled triangles each of a different bit of rich brocade of gold and silver figures on amber or pink ground all worked together with curious vines and stitches Miles Fleetwood clung to the royal cause and thus fell into the obscurity hinted at in the sampler verses In prosperity friends will be plenty But in adversity not one in twenty In the older samplers little attention is paid to the representation of things in their real colors a green horse may balance a blue tree And as flat tints were used there were few effects of light and shade and no perspective Distance is indicated by a different color of worsted thus the green horse will have his off legs worked in red This is precisely the method used in the Bayeux Tapestry and other antique embroideries Sampler verses had their times and seasons and ran through families They were eagerly copied for young friends and in a few cases were natural composures or as we should say to day original compositions Ruth Gray of Salem embroidered on her sampler a century ago Next unto God dear Parents I address Myself to you in humble Thankfulness For all your Care and Charge on me bestow d The means of learning unto me allowed Go on I pray and let me still Pursue Such Golden Arts the Vulgar never knew To show the extent to which those lines could be transmitted let me state that they are found on a sampler in Dorchester Massachusetts worked in eighteen oh two one in Waltham Massachusetts one worked in eighteen thirteen in a seminary in Boston one in Medford one worked in seventeen ninety in Salem by a young girl of ten another in Lynn on an English sampler in the Kensington Museum and in the diary of that Boston schoolgirl Anna Green Winslow dated seventeen seventy one There were certain variants of a popular sampler verse that ran thus This is my Sampler Here you see What care my Mother Took of me Another rhyme was Mary Jackson is my name America my nation Boston is my dwelling place And Christ is my salvation The doxology From all that dwell below the skies et cetera appears on samplers and these lines Though life is fair And pleasure young And Love on ev ry Shepherd s Tongue I turn my thoughts To serious things Life is ever on the wing Another rhyme is found with varying words in some of the lines Young Ladyes fair when youthful minds incline To all that s curious Innocent and fine With Admiration let your worke be made The various textures and the twining thread Then let your fingers with unrivalled skill Exalt the Needle Grace the noble Quill Some of the verses are as short as the scant but sweet English words on the sampler of Katherine the wife of Charles II twenty first of Maye Was our Wedding Daye A sampler in the Old South Church in Boston has this inscription Dorothy Lynde is my Name And this Work is mine My Friends may have When I am Dead and laid in Grave This Needlework of mine can tell That in my youth I learned well And by my elders also taught Not to spend my time for naught Illustration Polly Coggeshall s Sampler In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it was high fashion to have mottoes and texts carved or painted on many articles where they would frequently catch the eye Printed books were then rare possessions and these mottoes whether of vanity or piety took their place Perhaps inscriptions on various pieces of tableware and drinking utensils were the most common Specially beautiful and interesting early examples are the sets of beechen roundels known to collectors that is sets of wooden plates or trenchers carved with mottoes Women dexterous of the needle embroidered mottoes and words on articles of clothing Whole texts of the Bible are said to have been inscribed on the edges of gowns and petticoats She is a Puritan at her needle too She works religious petticoats Elaborate vines of flowers and other scroll designs were worked on petticoats often in colored crewels There still exists the linen petticoat of Rebecca Taylor Orne a Salem dame who lived to be one hundred and twenty years old It is deeply embroidered with trees vines flowers and fruits on homespun linen Silk petticoats were also embroidered and painted by young girls and are beautiful pieces of work In New York newspapers we find proof that New York girls were taught decorative accomplishments similar to those which were so fashionable in Boston Martha Gazley late from Great Britain now in the city of New York Makes and Teacheth the following curious Works viz Artificial Fruit and Flowers and other Wax Works Nuns work Philligree and Pencil Work upon Muslin all sorts of Needle Work and Raising of Paste as also to Paint upon Glass and Transparant for Sconces with other Works If any young Gentlewomen or others are inclined to learn any or all of the above mentioned curious Works they may be carefully instructed in the same by said Martha Gazley Illustration Flowered Apron The waxwork of Martha Gazley was more fully detailed in a school advertisement of missus Sarah Wilson of Philadelphia She taught waxworks in all its branches flowers fruit and pin baskets also how to take profiles in wax This latter was distinctly art work and portraits of Washington and other Revolutionary heroes still exist in wax a material that could be worked with facility but was very perishable Illustration Mary Richards Sampler A very full list of old time stitches has come down to us and curiously enough not from any woman who worked these stitches but from the pen of a man John Taylor the Water Poet in his Praise of the Needle sixteen forty For Tent worke Rais d work Laid worke Frost worke Net worke Most curious Purles or rare Italian Cut worke Fine Ferne stitch Finny stitch New stitch and Chain stitch Brave Bred stitch Fisher stitch Irish stitch and Queen stitch The Spanish stitch Rosemary stitch and Mouse stitch The smarting Whip stitch Back stitch and the Cross stitch All these are good and these we must allow And these are everywhere in practise now They were doubtless everywhere in practice in America as well but nearly all are now but empty names While Dutch women must be awarded the palm of comfortable and attractive housekeeping they did not excel Englishwomen in needlework though the first gold thimble was made for Madam Van Rensselaer the foremother of our American patroons and many beautiful specimens of Dutch embroidery exist A sample is here shown which was worked by Mary Richards a granddaughter of the famous Anneke Jans missus Van Cortlandt wrote in her delightful account of home life in old New York Crewel work and silk embroidery were fashionable and surprisingly pretty effects were produced Every little maiden had her sampler which she begun with the alphabet and numerals following them with a Scriptural text or verse of a psalm Then fancy was let loose on birds beasts and trees Most of the old families possessed framed pieces of embroidery the handiwork of female ancestors Pride in needlework and a longing for household decoration found expression in quilt piecing Bits of calico chiney or chintz were carefully shaped by older hands and sewed by diligent little fingers into many fanciful designs A Job s Trouble made of hexagon pieces could be neatly done by little children but more complicated designs required more judgement and the age of a little daughter might be accurately guessed by her patchwork The quilt making was the work of older folk It required long arms larger hands greater strength Knitting was taught to little girls as soon as they could hold the needles Girls four years of age could knit stockings and mittens In country households young damsels knit mittens to sell and coarse socks Many fine and beautiful stitches were taught and a beautiful pair of long silk stockings of open work design has initials knit on the instep They were the wedding hose of a bride of the year seventeen sixty and the silk for them was raised wound and spun by the bride s sister a girl of fourteen who also did the exquisite knitting Lace making was never an industry in the colonies it was an elegant accomplishment Pillow lace was made and the stitches were taught in families of wealth a guinea a stitch was charged by some teachers Old lace pillows have been preserved to this day with strips of unfinished lace and hanging bobbins to show the kind of lace which was the mode a thread lace much like the fine Swiss hand made laces Illustration Old Lace Pillow Reels and Pockets Tambour work on muslin or lace and a lace made of certain designs darned on net took the place of pillow lace Nothing could be more beautiful in execution and design than the rich veils collars and caps of this worked net which remained the mode during the early years of this century Girls spent years working on a single collar or tucker Sometimes medallions of this net lace were embroidered down upon fine linen lawn I have infants caps of this beautiful work finer than any needlework of to day CHAPTER XVII GAMES AND PASTIMES The plays of children are nonsense but very educative nonsense Essay on Experience Ralph Waldo Emerson eighteen sixty There are no more striking survivals of antiquity than the games and pastimes of children We have no historians of old time child life to tell us of these games but we can get side glimpses of that life which reveal to us as Ruskin says more light than a broad stare Many of these games were originally religious observances but there are scores that in their present purpose of simple amusement date from mediaeval days The chronicler Froissart in L Espinette Amoureuse tells of the sports of his early life over five centuries ago In that early childish day I was never tired to play Games that children everyone Love until twelve years are done To dam up a rivulet With a tile or else to let A small saucer for a boat Down the purling gutter float Over two bricks at a will To erect a water mill In those days for dice and chess Cared we busy children less Than mud pies and buns to make And heedfully in oven bake Of four bricks and when came Lent Out was brought a complement Of river shells from secret hold Estimated above gold To play away as I thought meet With the children of our street The children of our street has a delightfully familiar ring He also names many familiar games such as playing ball ring prisoner s base riddles and blowing soap bubbles Top spinning was an ancient game even in Froissart s day having been played in old Rome and the Orient since time immemorial It is interesting to note the persistent survival of games which are seldom learned from printed rules but are simply told from child to child from year to year On the sidewalk in front of my house is now marked out with chalk the lines for a game of hop scotch and a group of children are playing it precisely as I played it in my New England home in my childhood and as my grandfathers and grandmothers played Scotch hoppers in their day In a little century old picture book called Youthful Recreations Scotch hoppers is named and vaguely explained and a note says This exercise was frequently practiced by the Greeks and Spartan women Might it not be useful in the present day to prevent children having chilblains Now isn t that stupid Every one knows hop scotch time is not in the winter when the ground is rough and frozen or wet with snow and when chilblains are rife It is a game for the hard solid earth or a sunny pavement The variants of tag have descended to us and are played to day just as they were played when Boston and New York streets were lanes and cowpaths The pretty game I catch you without green mentioned by Rabelais is well known in the Carolinas whither it was carried by French Huguenot immigrants who retained many of their home customs as well as their language for so long a time Stone tag and wood tag took the place in America of the tag on iron of Elizabeth s day Squat tag and cross tag have their times and seasons and in Philadelphia tell tag is also played Pickadill is a winter sport a tag played in the snow Another tag game known as poison or stone poison is where the player is tagged if he steps off stones The little books on etiquette so frequently read in the seventeenth century and quoted in other pages of this book have this severe injunction Tread not pomposely on pebblestones for it is the art of a fool A man who was not a fool one doctor Samuel Johnson was swayed in his walk by similar notions Illustration Scotch Hoppers from Juvenile Games for the Four Seasons Honey pots still is played by American children Halliwell says the honey pot was a boy rolled up in a certain stiff position I have seen it played by two girls carrying a third in a chair made by crossing hands In a popular little book of the last century called Juvenile Pastimes or Sports for Four Seasons the illustration shows girls playing it The explanatory verse reads Carry your Honey pot safe and sound Or it will fall upon the Ground A truly historic game taught by children to each other is what is called cats cradle or cratch cradle One player stretches a length of looped cords over the extended fingers of both hands in a symmetrical form The second player inserts the fingers and removes the cord without dropping the loops in a way to produce another figure These various figures had childish titles If Hone s derivation of the game and its meaning is true cratch cradle is the correct name A cratch was a grated crib or manger The adjustment of threads purported to represent the manger or cradle wherein the infant Saviour was laid by his Virgin Mother As little girls take off the cradle they say criss cross criss cross This like the criss cross row in the hornbook was originally Christ s cross Illustration Old Skates In a quaint little book called The Pretty Little Pocket Book published in America at Revolutionary times is a list of boys games with dingy pictures showing how the games were played the names given were chuck farthing kite flying dancing round May pole marbles hoop and hide thread the needle fishing blindman s buff shuttlecock king am I peg farthing knock out and span hop skip and jump boys and girls come out to play I sent a letter to my love cricket stool ball base ball trap ball swimming tip cat train banding fives leap frog bird nesting hop hat shooting hop scotch squares riding rosemary tree The descriptions of the games are given in rhyme and to each attached a moral lesson in verse Some of the verses read thus CHUCK FARTHING As you value your Pence At the Hole take your Aim Chuck all safely in And You ll win the Game MORAL Chuck Farthing like Trade Requires great Care The more you observe The better you ll fare A few of the games are to day unknown or little known for instance the game called in the book Pitch and Hussel Poise your hand fairly Pitch plumb your Slat Then shake for all Heads Turn down the Hat The game called All the birds of the air reads Here various boys stand round and soon Does each some favorite bird assume And if the Slave once hits his name He s then made free and crowns the game mister Newell has given a list and description of many of the historic singing games and rounds of American children These were known to me in my childhood Here we go round the mulberry bush Here come three Lords out of Spain On the green carpet here we stand I ve come to see Miss Ginia Jones Little Sally Waters sitting in the sun Green gravel green gravel the grass is so green Old Uncle John is very sick what shall we send him Oats pease beans and barley grows When I was a shoemaker Here I brew Here I bake Here I make my Wedding Cake The needle s eye that doth supply Soldier Brown will you marry marry me O dear Doctor don t you cry There s a rose in the garden for you young man Ring around a rosy Go round and round the valley Quaker Quaker How art thee I put my right foot in My master sent me to you sir London Bridge is falling down Illustration Skating from Old Picture Book Some of these rhymes were founded on certain lines of ballads but without any printed words or music we all knew them well and the music was the same that our mothers used though our mothers had not taught us To day children all over the country are singing and playing these games to the same music I heard verse after verse of London Bridge sung in a high key in the shrill voices of the children of a New Hampshire country school this winter Such a survival in such an environment is not strange but it is surprising and pathetic too to hear in a public primary or a parochial school the children of German Italian or Irish parentage chanting Green gravel green gravel the grass is so green within the damp and dingy yard walls or in the basement playrooms of our greatest city The Dutch settlers had many games They were very fond of bowling on the grass a well known street in New York Bowling Green shows the popularity of the game and where it was played They played tick tack a complicated sort of backgammon and trock on a table somewhat like a billiard table in it an ivory ball was struck under wire wickets with a cue Coasting down hill became a most popular sport Many attempts were made to control and stop the coasters At one time the Albany constables were ordered to take the small or great slees in which boys and girls ryde down the hills and break them in pieces At another time the boy had to forfeit his hat if he were caught coasting on Sunday The sleds were low with a rope in front and were started and guided by a sharp stick There is a Massachusetts law of the year sixteen thirty three against common coasters unprofitable fowlers and tobacco takers three classes of detrimentals mister Ernst says coasting meant loafing along the shore then idling in general then sliding down hill for fun In Canada they slid down the long hills on toboggans In New England they used a double runner a long narrow board platform on two sleds or two sets of runners Judge Sewall speaks of his little daughter going out on sleds but there is nothing to indicate precisely what he meant thereby Sports of the Innyards languished in New England Innkeepers were ordered not to permit the playing of Dice Cards Tables Quoits Log gats Bowls Ninepins or any other Unlawful Game in house yard Garden or backside Slide groat was also forbidden mister Henry Cabot Lodge says the shovel board of Shakespeare s day was almost the only game that was tolerated This game was perhaps the most popular of old time domestic pastimes and was akin to slide groat I found nothing to indicate that the cruel sport known as cock throwing cock steling or cock squoiling ever prevailed in America In this sport the cock was tied by a short cord to a stake and boys at a distance of twenty yards took turns at throwing sticks at him till he was killed This sport was as old as Chaucer s time and universal among the English Judge Sewall wrote of Shrove Tuesday in Boston in sixteen eighty five that there was great disorder in Boston by reason of cock skailing Another year he tells of a young lad going through Boston streets carrying a cock on his back and a bell in his hand Several friends followed him loosely blindfolded and carrying cart whips and under pretence of striking at him managed to distribute their blows with stinging force on the gaping crowd around This was an old English custom At a later date the sport of shying at leaden cocks prevailed The dumps which were thrown and the crude little images of lead and pewter shaped like a cock were often made and sold by apprentices as part of their perquisites Cock fighting was popular in the Southern colonies and New York There are prohibitions against it in the rules of William and Mary College Certainly it was not encouraged or permitted here as in English schools where boys had cock fights in the schoolroom and where that great teacher Roger Ascham impoverished himself with dicing and cock fighting Cock fights were often held on Shrove Tuesday The picture of Colonel Richard Wynkoop shown on the opposite page was painted when he was twelve years old the dim figures of two fighting cocks can be seen by his side They are obscured by the sword which the colonel carried during the Revolution and which is thrust in front of the picture The cruel Dutch sport of riding for the goose was riding at full speed to catch a swinging greased goose Young lads sometimes took part in this but no small boys Illustration Cornelius D Wynkoop Eight Years Old seventeen forty two In The Schole of Vertue fifteen fifty seven we read O Lytle childe eschew thou ever game For that hath brought many one to shame As dysing and cardynge and such other playes Which many undoeth as we see nowe a dayes Playing cards were fiercely hated and their sale prohibited in Puritan communities but games of cards could not be beaten down Grown folk had a love of card playing and gaming which seemed almost hereditary But I do not believe young children indulged much in card playing in any of the colonies William Bradford then governor of the colony at Plymouth thus grimly records in his now famous Log book the first Christmas Day in that settlement The day called Christmas Day ye Gov r cal d them out to worke as was used but ye moste of this new company excused themselves and saide y t went against their consciences to work on y t Day So ye Gov r tould them that if they made it mater of conscience he would spare them till they were better informed So he led away ye rest and left them but when they came home at noon from their work he found them in ye street at play openly some pitching ye bar and some at stoolball and such like sports So he went to them and took away their implements and tould them it was against his conscience that they should play and others work The exact description of this game I do not know doctor Johnson says it is a play where balls are driven from stool to stool which may be a good definition but is a very poor explanation The Pretty Little Pocket Book says vaguely The ball once struck with Art and Care And drove impetuous through the Air Swift round his Course the Gamester flies Or his Stools are taken by surprise At the end of the seventeenth century a French traveller named Misson wrote a very vivacious account of his travels in England He sagely noted English customs fashions attributes and manners and airily discoursed on the English game of football In winter football is a useful and charming exercise It is a leather ball about as big as one s head fill d with wind This is kick d about from one to tother in the streets by him that can get it and that is all the art of it That is all the art of it I can imagine the sentiments of the general reader of that day if any general reader existed in England at that time when he read and noted the debonair simplicity of this brief account of what was even then a game of so much importance in England The proof that Misson was truly ignorant of this subject is shown in the fact that he could by any stretch of an author s privileged imagination call the English game of foot ball of that day a useful and charming exercise Nothing could be further from the Englishman s intent than to make it either profitable or pleasing Illustration three Battledore and Shuttlecock four Thread the Needle Page from Youthful Sports In the year fifteen eighty three a Puritan named Phillip Stubbes horror stricken and sore afraid at the many crying evils and wickednesses which were rife in England published a book which he called The Anatomie of Abuses It was made dialogue wise and is one of the most distinct contributions to our knowledge of Shakespeare s England Written in racy spirited English it is unsparing in denunciations of the public and private evils of the day His characterization of the game of foot ball is one of the strongest and most fearless of his accusations Now who is so grosly blinde that seeth not that these aforesaid exercises not only withdraw us from godliness and virtue but also haile and allure us to wickednesse and sin For as concerning football playing I protest unto you that it may rather be called a friendlie kinde of fyghte than a play or recreation a bloody and murthering practice than a felowly sport or pastime For dooth not everyone lye in waight for his adversarie seeking to overthrowe him and picke him on his nose though it be uppon hard stones in ditch or dale in valley or hill or whatever place soever it be hee careth not so hee have him downe and he that can serve the most of this fashion he is counted the only fellow and who but he So that by this means sometimes their necks are broken sometimes their backs sometimes their legs sometimes their armes sometimes their noses gush out with blood sometimes their eyes start out and sometimes hurte in one place sometimes in another But whosoever scapeth away the best goeth not scot free but is either forewounded craised or bruised so as he dyeth of it or else scapeth very hardlie and no mervaile for they have the sleights to meet one betwixt two to dash him against the hart with their elbowes to hit him under the short ribs with their griped fists and with their knees to catch him on the hip and pick him on his neck with a hundred such murthering devices Illustration Stephen Row Bradley eighteen hundred circa This was written three hundred years ago and these are not the words of a modern reporter They have sleights to meet one betwixt two to dash him against the heart with their elbows to hit him under the short ribs with their griped fists and with their knees to catch him on the hip and pick him on the neck Stubbes may be set down by many as a sour visaged sour voiced Puritan but a very gracious courtier of his day an intelligent and thoughtful man Sir Thomas Elyot was equally severe on the game He wrote in fifteen thirty seven The Boke named the Gouvernour full of sensible advice and instruction In it he says Foot ball wherein is nothynge but beastlye furie and exstreme violence whereof proceedeth hurte and consequently malice and rancour do remayne with them that be wounded whereof it is to be putt in perpetuall silence The perpetuall silence which he put on the game has not fallen even by the end of three centuries and a half Some indirect testimony as to the character of the English game comes from travellers in the American colonies where the American Indians were found playing a game of foot ball like that of their white brothers John Dunton travelling in New England when Boston was half a century old tells of the Indians game There was that day a great game of Foot ball to be played There was another Town played against em as is sometimes common in England but they played with their bare feet which I thought very odd but it was upon a broad sandy Shoar free from Stones which made it the more easie Neither were they so apt to trip up one another s heels and quarrel as I have seen em in England At the same time English boys were kicking the foot ball around Boston streets and were getting themselves complained of by game hating Puritan neighbors and enjoined by pragmatical magistrates just as they were in English towns Fewer games are played now by both boys and girls than in former times in England as well as America In a manuscript list of games played at Eton in seventeen sixty five are these titles cricket fives shirking walls scrambling walls bally cally battledore pegtop peg in the ring goals hop scotch heading conquering cobs hoops marbles trap ball steal baggage puss in the corner cat gallows kites cloyster and hyer gigs tops humming tops hunt the hare hunt the dark lanthorn chuck sinks stare caps hurtlecap No games are now recognized at Eton save cricket foot ball and fives Racquet and hockey flourished for a time The playing of marbles was abandoned about eighteen twenty and top spinning about eighteen forty Top time had always opened ten days after the return to school after the summer holidays Hoops were made of stout ash laths with the bark on and the hoop rolling season ended with a class fray with hoopsticks for weapons At one time marble playing was prohibited in the English universities It is not probable that those undergraduates habitually played marble any more than do our Princeton University men who have a day of marble playing and one of top spinning each spring Illustration Doll s Furniture One Hundred Years Old A record of old time sports would be incomplete without reference to the laws of sport times These are as firmly established as the seasons and as regular as the blooming of flowers Children cannot explain them nor is there any leader who establishes them It is not a matter of reason it is instinct A Swiss writer says that boys games there belong chiefly to the first third of the year always return in the same order and without the individual child being able to say who had given the sign and made the beginning From Maine to Georgia the first time is has been and we may almost add ever shall be world without end marble time Then come tops The saying is Top time s gone kite time s come April Fool s Day will soon be here Ball playing in Boston had as its time the first Thursday in April Whistle making would naturally come at a time when whistle wood was in good condition All the boys in all the towns perch on stilts as closely in unison as the reports of a Gatling gun There is much sentiment in the thought that for years almost for centuries thousands of boys in every community have had the same games at the same time and the recital almost reaches the dignity of history CHAPTER XVIII CHILDREN S TOYS Behold the child by nature s kindly law Pleased with a rattle tickled with a straw Some livelier plaything gives his youth delight A little louder but as empty quite Essay on Man Alexander Pope seventeen thirty two In the year sixteen ninety five mister Higginson wrote from Massachusetts to his brother in England that if toys were imported in small quantity to America they would sell In very small quantity we fancy though the influence of crown and court began to be felt in New England and many articles of luxury were exported to that colony as they were to Virginia According to our present ideas playthings for children in colonial time were few in number save the various ones they manufactured for themselves They played more games and had fewer toys than modern children In seventeen twelve on the list of rich goods brought into Boston by a privateersman and sold there were Boxes of Toys In seventeen forty three the Boston News Letter advertised Dutch and English Toys for Children and mister Ernst says Boston had a flourishing toy shop at that date Other towns did not as we know from many shipping orders Illustration An Old Doll The Toy Shop or Sentimental Preceptor one of Newbery s books gives a list of toys which the young English scholar sought they are a looking glass a spying glass a fluffed dog a pocket book a mask a drum a doll a watch a pair of scales Few of these articles named would really be termed toys Some of the games already alluded to such as top spinning hoop rolling and the various games of ball required toys to carry them on but they seemed to fall into classification more naturally in the chapter on games than in this one Illustration An Old Doll I have often been asked whether the first childish girl emigrants to this solemn new world had the comfort of dolls They certainly had something in the semblance of a doll though far removed from the radiant doll creatures of this day little puppets crude and shapeless yet ever beloved symbols of maternity have been known to children in all countries and all ages dolls are as old as the world and human life In the tombs of Attica are found classic dolls of ivory and terra cotta with jointed legs and arms Sad little toys are these for their human guardians are scattered dust Dolls were called puppets in olden times and babies In the Gentleman s Magazine London September seventeen fifty one is an early use of the word doll Several dolls with different dresses made in saint James Street have been sent to the Czarina to show the manner of dressing at present in fashion among English ladies This circulation of dressed dolls as fashion transmitters was a universal custom Fashion plates are scarce more than a century old in use Dolls were sent from house to house from town to town from country to country and even to a new continent Illustration French Doll These babies for fashion models came to be made in large numbers for the use of milliners and as the finest ones came from the Netherlands they were called Flanders babies To the busy fingers of Dutch children English and American children owed many toys besides these dolls It was a rhymed reproach to the latter that What the children of Holland take pleasure in making The children of England take pleasure in breaking Fashions changed and the modish raiment grew antiquated and despised but still the Flanders babies had a cherished old age They were graduated from milliners boxes and mantua makers show rooms to nurseries and play rooms where they reigned as queens of juvenile hearts There are old ladies still living who recall the dolls of their youth as having been the battered fashion dolls sent to their mammas The best dolls in England were originally sold at Bartholomew Fair and were known as Bartholomew babies The English poet Ward wrote Ladies d y want fine Toys For Misses or for Boys Of all sorts I have Choice And pretty things to tease ye I want a little Babye As pretty a one as may be With head dress made of Feather In Poor Robin s Almanack sixteen ninety five is a reference to a Bartholomew baby trickt up with ribbons and knots and they were known at the time of the landing of the Pilgrims Therefore it is not impossible that some Winslow or Winthrop maid some little miss of Bradford or Brewster birth brought across seas a Bartholomew baby and was comforted by it A pathetic interest is attached to the shapeless similitude of a doll named Bangwell Putt shown facing page three hundred seventy It is in the collection at Deerfield Memorial Hall It was cherished for eighty years by Clarissa Field of Northfield Massachusetts who was born blind and whose halting but trusting rhymes of longing for the clear vision of another world are fastened to the plaything she loved in youth and in old age Nothing more absurd could be fancied than the nomenclature French attached to the two shapeless inelegant creatures a century old shown on pages three hundred sixty four and three hundred sixty seven Yet gawky as they are they show signs of hard usage which proves them to have had a more beloved life than the case of elegant Spanish dolls on page three hundred eighty nine which were evidently too fine ever to be touched The White House Doll spent the days of her youth in the White House at Washington with the children of the President John Quincy Adams and is still cherished by his descendants Illustration French Doll Skilful jackknives could manufacture home made dolls furniture Birch bark was especially adaptable to such uses The wicker cradles and chaises of babies were copied in miniature for dolls Tin toys were scarce for tin was not much used for domestic utensils A tin horse and chaise over a hundred years old is shown on page three hundred seventy three and a quaint plaything it is The eternal desire of a child for something suggestive of a horse found satisfaction in home made hobby horses and when American ships wandered over the world in the India trade they brought home to American children strange coaches and chariots of gay colors and strange woods these were often comical copies of European shapes sometimes astonishingly crude but ample for the ever active imagination of a child to clothe with beautiful outlines An old coach is shown on page three hundred sixty nine with the box in which it was originally packed It is marked Leghorn but is doubtless Chinese Illustration Dolls and Furniture Illustration Chinese Coach and Horses The word jack as a common noun and in compound words has been held to be a general term applied to any contrivance which does the work of a boy or servant or a simple appliance which is subjected to common usage In French the name Jacques was a term for a young man of menial condition The term country jake is of kindred sense Jack lord jack meddler jackanapes Jack Tar smoke jack jack o lantern black jack jack rabbit the term jack applied to the knave in playing cards and the expressions jack at a pinch jack in office jack in bedlam jack in a box jack of all trades and many others show the derivative meaning Hence jack knife may mean a boy s knife In English dialect the word was jack lag knife also jack a legs in Scotch jock te leg these by a somewhat fanciful derivation said to be from Jacques de Liege the celebrated cutler Illustration Old Jack knives A good jack knife was the most highly desired possession of a boy Days of weary work and hours of persistent pleading were gone through with in hundreds of cases before the prize was secured Barlow knives had a century of popularity Some now in Deerfield Memorial Hall are here shown Note the curved end a shape now obsolete but in truth an excellent one for safe pocket carriage Knives of similar shape have been found that are known to be a century and a half old I have never seen in America any of the old knives used as lovers tokens with mottoes engraved on them referred to by Shakespeare The boy s stock of toys was largely supplied by his own jack knife elder pop guns chestnut and willow whistles windmills water wheels box traps figure four traps Toy weapons have varied little from the Christian era till to day Clubs slings bows and arrows air guns are as old as the year One Ere these were used as toys they had been formidable weapons They were weapons still for some years of colonial life In sixteen forty five the court of Massachusetts ordered that all boys from ten to sixteen years old should be exercised with bows and arrows Illustration Bangwell Putt Skating is an ancient pastime As early as the thirteenth century Fitzstephen tells of young Londoners fastening the leg bones of animals to the soles of the feet and then pushing themselves on the ice by means of poles shod with sharp iron points Pepys thought skating a very pretty art when he saw it in sixteen sixty two but it was then a novelty to him and he was characteristically a little afraid of it justly disturbed too that the Duke of York would go though the ice was broken and dangerous yet he would go slide upon his scates which I did not like but he slides very well Illustration White House Doll Wooden skates shod with iron runners were invented in the Low Countries Dutch children in New Netherlands all skated just as their grandfathers had in old Batavia The first skates that William Livingstone had on the frozen Hudson were made of beef bones as were those of mediaeval children In Massachusetts and Connecticut skating was among the many Dutch ways and doings practised by English folk in the new world The Plymouth Pilgrims brought these Dutch customs to the new world through their long and intimate sojourn in Holland the New Haven and Connecticut Valley settlers learned them through their constant trade and intercourse with their neighbors the Dutch of Manhattan but the Massachusetts Bay settlers of Boston and Salem had known these Dutch ways longer they brought them from England across seas from the counties of Essex and Suffolk where the Dutch had gone years before and married with the English Illustration Old Tin Toy New England boys in those early days went skating on thin ice and broke through and were drowned just as New England boys and girls are to day alas Judge Sewall wrote in his diary on the last day in November in sixteen ninety six that many scholars went to scate on Fresh Pond and that two boys named Maxwell and Eyre fell in and were drowned Illustration Doll s Wicker Coach Advertisements of men s and boys skates and of Best Holland Scates of Different Sizes show a constant demand and use In an invoice of sundry merchandise to Weathersfield Connecticut in the year seventeen sixty three are twelve pair small brass scates three Lthree sixteen I do not know the age of the skates shown opposite page three hundred forty six No date less than a hundred years ago is ever willingly assigned to such relics They are similar in shape to the ones shown on page three hundred forty nine in the illustration taken from a book for children entitled Children s Sports published a century ago which ends its dissertation on skating with this sensible advice Tis true it looks exceeding nice To see boys gliding on the ice And to behold so many feats Perform d upon the sliding skates But before you venture there Wait until the ice will bear For want of this both young and old Have tumbled in got wet and cold It was not until October seventeen seventy one that a pleasure filled item appeared Boys Marbles In The Pretty Little Pocket Book are these lines MARBLES

portraits of children show battledores as that of Thomas Aston Coffin All books of children s games speak of them It was in fact a popular game and deemed a properly elegant exercise for decorous young misses to indulge in CHAPTER XIX FLOWER LORE OF CHILDREN In childhood when with eager eyes The season measured years I view d All garb d in fairy guise Pledg d constancy of good Spring sang of heaven the summer flowers Bade me gaze on and did not fade Even suns o er autumn s bowers Heard my strong wish and stay d They came and went the short lived four Yet as their varying dance they wove To my young heart each bore Its own sure claim of love J H Card Newman eighteen seventy four The records of childish flower lore contained in this chapter are those of my own childhood but they are equally the records of the customs of colonial children for these games and rhymes and plays about flowers have been preserved from generation to generation of New England children The transmission of this nature lore has been as direct and unaltered in the new world as in Great Britain Some of these customs such as the eating of hollyhock cheeses and the blowing of dandelion clocks came originally as have other play usages from England many were varied in early years by different conditions in the new world by local fitness and suggestion One chapter in mister Newell s book upon the Games of American Children dwells upon the conservatism of children The unquestioning reception of play formulas which he proves extended to the flower rhymes and lore which I have recollected and herein set down These inherited customs are far dearer to children than modern inventions There is a quaintness of expression a sentiment of tradition that the child feels without power of formulating Illustration Stella Bradley Bellows eighteen hundred circa If the paradise of the Orientals is a garden so was a garden of old fashioned flowers the earthly paradise for a child the long sunny days brought into life so many delightful playthings to be made through the exercise of that keen instinct of all children destructiveness Each year saw the fresh retelling and teaching of child to child of happy flower customs almost intuitively or through the knowledge never learned at schools that curious subtle system of transmission which everywhere exists among children who are blessed enough to spend their summer days in the woods or in a garden The sober teachings of science in later years can never make up the loss to those who have lived their youth in great cities and have grown up debarred from this inheritance knowing not when The summer comes with flower and bee The dandelion was the earliest flower to stir the children s memories in New England it is the firstling of the year In the days of my childhood we did not wait for the buttercup to open to learn whether we loved butter the soft dimpled chin of each child was held up as had been those of other children for past decades to catch the yellow reflection of the first dandelion on the pinky throat The dandelion had other charms for the child When the blooms had grown long stemmed through seeking the sun from under the dense box borders what pale green opal tinted curls could be made by splitting the translucent stems and immersing them in water or by placing them in the mouth I taste still their bitterness What grace these curls conferred when fastened to our round combs or hung over our straight braids far better than locks of corn silk And what adorning necklaces and chains like Indian wampum could be made by stringing dandelion beads formed by cutting the stems into sections This is an ancient usage one German name of the flower is chain flower The making of dandelion curls is also an old time childish custom in Germany When the dandelion had lost her golden locks and had grown old and gray the children still plucked the downy heads the clocks or blowballs and holding aloft these airy seed vessels and fortifying the strong young lungs with a deep breath they blew upon the head to see whether my mother wants me or to learn the time o day Dandelion the globe of down The schoolboy s clock in every town Which the truant puffs amain To conjure back long hours again The ox eye daisy the farmer s whiteweed was brought to New England so tradition tells as a garden flower Now as doctor Holmes says it whitens our fields to the great disgust of our liberal shepherds It soon followed the dandelion in bloom and a fresh necklace could be strung from the starry blossoms a daisy chain just as English children string their true pink and white daisies This daisy was also used as a medium of amatory divination by pulling from the floret the white ray flowers saying He loves me he loves me not or by repeating the old apple seed rhyme Illustration A daisy chain surrounds most of the page One I love Two I love Three I love I say Four I love with all my heart Five I cast away et cetera Flower oracles are mediaeval and divination by leaves of grass Children to day as of old draw grass stalks in the field and match them to see who will be It Walther von der Vogelweide eleven seventy twelve thirty did likewise A spire of grass hath made me gay I measured in the self same way I have seen practised by a child Come look and listen if she really does She does does not she does does not she does The yellow disk or button of the ox eye daisy which was formed by stripping off the white rays made a pretty pumpkin pie for the dolls table A very effective and bilious old lady or daisy grandmother was made by clipping off the rays to shape the border or ruffle of a cap leaving two long rays for strings and marking in a grotesque old face with pen and ink A dusky face called with childish plainness of speech a nigger head could be made in like fashion from the black eyed Susan or yellow daisy which now rivals the ox eye daisy as a pest of New England fields Though the spring violets were dearly loved we slaughtered them ruthlessly by fighting roosters with them The projecting spur under the curved stem at the base of the flower was a hook and when the violets clinched we pulled till the stronger was conqueror and the weaker head was off What braided cat ladders and quaint antique shaped boats with swelling lateen sail and pennant of striped grass could be made from the flat sword like leaves of the flower de luce Filled with flowers these leafy boats could be set gayly adrift down a tiny brook in the meadow or with equal sentiment in that delight of children since Froissart s day the purling gutter of a hillside street after a heavy midsummer shower The flowers chosen to sail in these tiny crafts were those most human of all flowers pansies or their smaller garden sisters the ladies delights that turned their laughing happy faces to us from every nook and corner of our garden The folk names of this flower such as three faces under a hood johnny jump up jump up and kiss me come tickle me show the universal sense of its kinship to humanity I knew a child who insisted for years that pansies spoke to her Another child who had stolen a rose and hidden it under her apron called out pettishly throwing the rose in a pansy bed Here take your old flower as the pansy faces blinked and nodded knowingly to her The dielytra bleeding heart or lady s eardrops we called it had long gracefully drooping racemes of bright red pink flowers which when pulled apart and straightened out made fairy gondolas or which might be twisted into a harp and bottle How many scores have I carefully dissected trying to preserve intact in skeleton shape the little heart shaped frame of the delicate flower The bleeding heart is a flower of inexplicable charm to children it has something of that mystery which in human nature we term fascination Little children beg to pick it and babies stretch out their tiny hands to it when showier blossoms are unheeded What black headed puppets or dolls could be made from the great poppies whose reflexed petals formed gay scarlet petticoats and also from the blossoms of vari colored double balsams with their frills and flounces The hollyhock ever ready to render to the child a new pleasure could be tied into tiny dolls with shining satin gowns true fairies Families nay tribes of patriarchal size had the little garden mother Mertensia or lungwort we termed pink and blue ladies The lovely blossoms which so delighted the English naturalist Wallace and which he called drooping porcelain blue bells are shaped something like a child s straight waisted full skirted frock If pins are stuck upright in a piece of wood the little blue silken frocks can be hung over them and the green calyx looks like a tiny hat A child friend forbidden to play with dolls on the solemn New England Sabbath was permitted to gather the mertensia bells on that holy day and also to use the cherished income of a prosperous pin store It was discovered with maternal horror that she had carefully arranged her pink and blue ladies in quadrilles and contra dances and was very cheerfully playing dancing party to beguile the hours of a weary summer Sunday afternoon Illustration Playing Marbles mister Tylor the author of Primitive Culture call our attention to the fact that many of the beloved plays of children are only sportive imitations of the serious business of life In some cases the game has outlived the serious practice of which it is a copy such as the use of bows and arrows Children love to produce these imitations themselves with what materials they can obtain not to have them provided in finished perfection Thus the elaborately fitted up doll s house and imitation grocery store cannot keep the child contented for days and weeks as can the doll s room or shop counter furnished by the makeshifts of the garden The child makes her cups and saucers and furniture herself She prepares her own powders and distillations and is satisfied A harvest of acorn cups furnished table garniture but not a cherished one they were too substantial we preferred more fragile more perishable wares Rose hips were fashioned into tiny tea sets and would not be thought to be of great durability A few years ago I was present at the opening of an ancient chest which had not been thoroughly searched for many years In a tiny box within it was found some cherished belongings of a little child who had died in the year seventeen ninety four Among them was one of these tea sets made of rose hips with handles of bent pins Though shrunken and withered the rose hips still possessed some life color but they soon fell into dust There was something most tender in the thought of that loving mother who had herself been dead over half a century who had thus preserved the childish work of her beloved daughter Poppy pericarps made famous pepper boxes from which the seed could be shaken as pepper dishes and cups too for dolls tea tables and tiny handles of strong grass stems could be attached to the cups For the child s larder hollyhocks furnished food in their mucilaginous cheeses and the insipid akenes of the sunflower and seeds of pumpkins swelled the feast A daintier morsel a drop of honey the clear bee wine of Keats could be sucked from the curved spur of the columbine and the scarlet and yellow trumpet of the beautiful coral honeysuckle mellifluous of the name as well as from the tubes of the heads of clover We ate rose leaves also and grass roots and smarting peppergrass The sorrel and oxalis which we called ladies sorrel and the curling tendrils of grape vines gave an acid zest to our childish nibblings and browsings The gnarled plum trees at the end of the garden exuded beautiful crystals of gum of which we could say proudly like Cornelia These are my jewels Translucent topaz and amber were never more beautiful and void of settings these pellucid gems could be stuck directly on the fingers or on the tip of the ear And when our vanity was sated with the bravery or we could no longer resist our appetite there still remained another charm with childish opulence like Cleopatra we swallowed our jewels A low growing mallow wherever it chanced to run shared with its cousin hollyhock the duty of providing cheeses These mallow cheeses were also eaten by English children In allusion to this the poet Clare wrote The sitting down when school was o er Upon the threshold of the door Picking from mallows sport to please The crumpled seed we call a cheese These flower customs never came to us through reading All our English story books told of making cowslip balls of breaking the shepherd s purse of playing lords and ladies with the arum what we call jack in the pulpit yet we never thought of making any kindred attempts with these or similar flowers We did gather eagerly the jack in the pulpit whose singularity of aspect seems always to attract the attention of children and by pinching it at the base of the flower made it squeak made Jack preach But like true republicans we never called our jacks lords and ladies The only liking we had for the portulaca was in gathering the seeds which grew in little boxes with a lid opening in a line around the middle Oh dear It doesn t seem like the same thing to hear these beloved little seed boxes described as a pyxis or a capsule with a circumscissile dehiscence From the live for ever or orpine once tenderly cherished as a garden favorite now in many localities a hated and persistent weed we made frogs or purses by gently pinching the fleshy leaves between thumb and forefinger thus loosening the epidermis on the lower side of the leaf and making a bladder which when blown up would burst with a delightful pop The New England folk names by which this plant is called such as frog plant blow leaf pudding bag plant show the wide spread prevalence of this custom A rival in sound could be made by popping the foxglove s fingers English countrywomen call the foxglove a pop The morning glory could also be blown up and popped and the canterbury bell We placed rose petals and certain tender leaves over our lips and drew in the centres for explosion Illustration Spanish Dolls Noisy boys found scores of other ways to make various resounding notes in the gardens A louder pop could be made by placing broad leaves on the extended thumb and forefinger of one hand and striking them with the other The boys also made squawks out of birch bark and fiddles of cornstalks and trombones from the striped prickly leaf stalks of pumpkins and squashes The New England chronicler in rhyme of boyhood days reverend John Pierpont called this sound evoked from the last named instrument the deeper tone that murmurs from the pumpkin leaf trombone It is instead a harsh trumpeting These trombones were made in Germany as early as the thirteenth century An ear piercing whistle could be constructed from a willow branch and a particularly disagreeable sound could be evoked by every boy and I must acknowledge it by every girl too by placing broad leaves of grass preferably the pretty striped ribbon grass or gardener s garters between the thumbs and blowing thereon Other skilful and girl envied accomplishments of the boys I will simply name making baskets and brooches by cutting or filing the furrowed butternut or the stone of a peach also fairy baskets Japanesque in workmanship of cherry stones manufacturing old women dolls of hickory nuts squirt guns and pop guns of elderberry stems pipes of horse chestnuts corn cobs or acorns in which dried sweet fern could be smoked sweet fern or grape stem or corn silk cigars Some child customs successfully defy the law of the survival of the useful and ignore the lesson of reason they simply exist A marked example of these of bootless toil is the laborious hoarding of horse chestnuts each autumn With what eagerness and hard work do boys gather these pretty nuts how they quarrel with one another over the possession of every one how stingily they dole out a few to the girls who cannot climb the trees and are not permitted to belabor the branches with clubs and stones for dislodgment of the treasures as do their lordly brothers How carefully the gathered store is laid away for winter and not one thing ever done with one horse chestnut until all feed a grand blaze in the open fireplace At the time of their gathering they are converted to certain uses are made into certain toys They are tied to the ends of strings and two boys holding the stringed chestnuts play cob nut Two nuts are also tied together by a yard of cord and by a catching knack circled in opposite directions But these games have a very emphatic time and season the weeks when the horse chestnuts ripen The winter s store is always untouched From a stray burdock plant which had escaped destruction in our kitchen garden or from a group of these pestilent weeds in a neighboring by path could be gathered materials for many days of pleasure The small tenacious burs could be easily wrought into interesting shapes There was a romance in our neighborhood about a bur basket A young man conveyed a written proposal of marriage to his sweetheart reposing in one of the spiny vehicles Like the Ahkoond of Swat I don t know why or which or when or what he chose such an extraordinary medium but the bur basket was forever after haloed with sentiment We made from burs more prosaic but admirable furniture for the dolls house tables chairs and cradles Traces of the upholstery clung long and disfiguringly to our clothing but never deterred us from the fascinating occupation To throw these burs upon each other s clothing was held to be the commission of the unpardonable sin in childish morals still it was done in holiday foolery as in Shakespeare s day The milkweed one of our few native weeds and a determined settler on its native soil furnished abundant playthings The empty pods became fairy cradles and tiny pillows could be made of the beautiful silk The milkweed and thistle both furnish pretty silvery balls when treated with deft fingers and their manufacture is no modern fashion Manasseh Cutler writing in seventeen eighty six says I was pleased with a number of perfectly white silken balls as they appeared to be suspended by small threads along the frame of the looking glass They were made by taking off the calyx of the thistle at an early stage of blooming Ingenious toys of amusing shapes could be formed of the pith of the milkweed and when weighted with a tack would always fall tack downward as did the grotesque corn stalk witches Pressed flowers were devoted to special uses I cannot recall pressing any flower save larkspur the lark heels of Shakespeare Why this flower was chosen I do not know unless for the reason that its colors were so enduring We used to make charming wreaths of the stemless flowers by placing the spur of one in the centre of another flower and thus forming a tiny circle A favorite arrangement was alternating the colors pink and blue These stiff little pressed wreaths were gummed on a sheet of paper to be used at the proper time as a valentine were made for that definite purpose yet I cannot now recall that when February came I ever sent one of these valentines or indeed had any to send I have found these larkspur wreaths in a Pike s Arithmetic used a century ago and also in old Bibles sometimes fastened in festoons on the title page around the name of a past owner Did doctor Holmes refer to one when he wrote his graceful line light as a loop of larkspur A similar wreath could be made of the columbine spurs A friend tells me she made scores in her youth but we never pressed any flowers but larkspur Many pretty wreaths were made of freshly gathered flowers The daintiest were of lilac or phlox petals which clung firmly together without being threaded and the alternation of color in these wreaths one white and two purple lilac petals or two white phlox petals and two crimson could easily prove the ingenuity and originality of the child who produced them In default of better loved flowers the four o clock or marvel of Peru was made into a similar garland In the beautiful and cleanly needles of the pine the children had an unlimited supply for the manufacture of toys Pretty necklaces could be made for personal adornment resembling in miniature the fringed bark garments of the South Sea Islanders and tiny brooms for dolls houses A thickly growing cluster of needles was called a lady When her petticoats were carefully trimmed she could be placed upright on a sheet of paper and by softly blowing upon it could be made to dance A winter s amusement was furnished by gathering and storing the pitch pine cones and hearing them snap open in the house The cones could also be planted with grass seeds and form a cheerful green growing ornament Illustration Leaf Boats made from Flower de luce From birch bark gathered in long wood walks could be made cornucopias and drinking cups and letters could be cut thereon and thereof There wandered through the town harmless and happy one of God s fools whose like is seen in every country community He found his pleasure in early autumn in strolling through the country and marking with his jack knife in cabalistic designs the surface of all the unripe pumpkins and squashes He was driven by the farmers from this annoying trespass in the daytime but by brave moonshine could still make his mysterious mark on the harvest of the year The boys of the town impressed by the sight of a garden or field of squashes thus curiously marked fell into a habit of similar inscription which in them became wanton vandalism and had none of the sense of baffled mystery which always hung around and illumined poor Elmer s letters A favorite manner of using the autumn store of pumpkins was in the manufacture of Jack o lanterns which were most effective and hideous when lighted from within The umbrellas are out call country children in spring when the peltate leaves of the May apple spread their umbrella shaped lobes and the little girls gather them and the leaves of the wild sarsaparilla for dolls parasols The spreading head of what we called snake grass could also be tied into a very effective miniature parasol There is no sense of caste among children when in a field or garden all are equally well dressed when bedizened and brocaded with garden finery Green leaves can be pinned with their stems into fantastic caps and bonnets foxglove fingers can be used as gloves the blossoms of the jewelweed make pretty earrings and the dandelion and daisy chains are not the only necklaces the lilac and larkspur chains and pretty little circlets of phlox are proudly worn and strings of rose hips end the summer The old English herbalist says children with delight make chains and pretty gewgaws of the fruit of roses Truly the garden bred child walks in gay attire from May to October The satten found by the traveller Josselyn in seventeenth century New England gardens formed throughout New England a universal plaything and a frequent winter posy in country parlors on mantel or table The broad white oval partition of satiny lustre remaining after the side valves had fallen made juvenile money and the plant went by the appropriate name of money in both pockets Other seeds were gathered as the children s spoils those of the garden balsam to see them burst or to feel them curl up in the hand like living creatures those of the balsam s cousin the jewelweed to watch them snap violently open hence its country name of touch me not and snapweed When the leaves were hung with dew it deserved its title of jewelweed and when they were immersed in water its other pretty descriptive folk name of silver leaf A grotesquery could be formed from the seed pods in the centre of the peony when opened in such a way that the tiny pink and white seeds resembled two sets of teeth in an open mouth Imaginary miniature likenesses were found in the various parts of many flowers the naked pistil and stamens of one were a pair of tongs another had a seed ovary which was a lady a very stout lady with extending hoops The heart s ease had in its centre an old lady washing her feet the monk s hood a devil in his chariot A single petal of the columbine with attached sepals was a hovering dove and the whole flower Izaak Walton s culverkeys formed a little dish with a ring of pigeon heads bending within There were many primitive inks and staining juices that could be expressed and milks and gums that exuded from various plants We painted pictures in our books with the sap from the petals of the red peonies and blue juice from the blossom of the spiderwort or tradescantia now a neglected flower We dyed dolls clothes with the juice of elderberries The country child could also dye a vivid red with the juice of the pokeberry the red ink plant or with the stems of the bloodroot and the sap crushed from soft pulpy leaves such as those of the live for ever furnished a green stain There was a certain garden lore connected with insects not so extensive probably as a child would have upon a farm We said to the snail Snail snail come out of your hole Or else I will beat you as black as a coal We sang to the lady bug Lady bug lady bug fly away home Your house is on fire your children will burn We caught the grasshoppers and thus exhorted them Grandfather grandfather gray Give me molasses or I ll throw you away We believed that earwigs lived for the sole purpose of penetrating our ears that dragon flies flew with the sole thought of sewing up our lips devil s darning needles we called them To this day I instinctively cover my mouth at their approach We used to entrap bumble bees in the bells of monopetalous flowers such as canterbury bells or in the ample folds of the hollyhock and listen to their indignant scolding and buzzing and watch them gnaw and push out to freedom I cannot recall ever being stung in the process We had the artistic diversion of pin a sights These were one of the shop furnishings of pin stores whose curious lore and the oddly shaped and named articles made for them should be recorded ere they are forgotten A pin a sight was made of a piece of glass on which were stuck flowers in various designs Over these flowers was pasted a covering of paper in which a movable flap could be lifted to display on payment of a pin the concealed treasures We used to chant to entice sight seers A pin a pin a poppy show This being our rendering of the word puppet show I recall as our sights chiefly the tiny larkspur wreaths before named and miniature trees carefully manufactured of grass spires A noted pin a sight glorious still in childish history and tradition was made for my pin store by a grown up girl of fourteen She cut in twain tiny baskets which she pasted on glass and filled with wonderful artificial flowers manufactured out of the petals of real blossoms I well remember her gilding refined gold by making a gorgeous blue rose out of the petals of a flower de luce I cannot recall playing much with roses we fashioned a bird out of the buds The old English rhyme describing the variation of the sepals was unknown to us On a summer s day in sultry weather Five brethren were born together Two had beards and two had none And the other had but half a one Still with the rose is connected one of my most tender child memories somewhat of a gastronomic cast yet suffused with an element of grace the making of rosy cakes These dainty fairy cakes were made of layers of rose leaves sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon and then carefully enfolded in slips of white paper Sometimes they were placed in the garden over night pressed between two flat stones As a morsel for the epicure they were not altogether alluring although inoffensive but decidedly preferable to pumpkin or sunflower seeds and they were englamoured with sentiment for these rosy cakes were not destined to be greedily eaten by the concocter but were to be given with much secrecy as a mark of affection a true love token to another child or some beloved older person and were to be eaten also in secret I recall to this day the thrill of happiness which the gift of one of these little paper inclosed rosy cakes brought to me in the days of my childhood when it was slipped into my hand by a beautiful and gentle child who died the following evening during a thunder storm of fright The tragedy of her death the memory of the startling glimpses given by the vivid lightning of agitated running to and fro in the heavy rain and lowering darkness and the terrified summons of kindly neighbors all have fixed more firmly in my mind the happy recollection of her last gift Another custom of my youth was watching at dusk the opening of the twisted buds of the garden primrose into wan yellow stars pallid flowers by dew and moonlight fed which filled the early evening with a faint ineffable fragrance that drew a host of encircling night moths Keats said they leaped from buds into ripe flowers a habit thus told by Margaret Deland Here in warm darkness of a night in June children came To watch the primrose blow Silent they stood Hand clasped in hand in breathless hush around And saw her shyly doff her soft green hood And blossom with a silken burst of sound In our home garden stood a clump of tall primroses whose beautiful flowers when opened were four inches in diameter When riding one summer evening along a seaside road on Cape Ann we first saw one of these queens of the night in an humble dooryard In the dark its seeds were gathered and given by an unknown hand and a flower loving heart to my mother to form under her fair tendance the luminous evening glory of her garden And on summer nights this stately primrose still blooms in moonlight and starlight though the gentle hand that planted it is no longer there Yon rising Moon that looks for us again How oft hereafter will she wax and wane How oft hereafter look for us Through this same Garden and for one in vain To every garden bred child the sudden blossoming and pale shining in the gloaming have ever given the evening primrose a special tender interest a faintly mystic charm through the chill of falling dew and the dim light and through a half sad atmosphere which has always encircled the flower and has been felt by many of the poets making them seldom sing the evening primrose as a flower of happiness With the good night of children to the flowers I close this record of old time child life Index Ye labor and ye patience ye

children s lives Grown careful with years I crave for it a safe journey and sheltered harbor Perhaps the craft may bear to some reader a memory of his own childhood as well as stories of the children of an ancient day a day so gray and sad as seen through the haze of centuries that the only cheerful light is found in the faces of the children Illustration leafy boats Minor typographical errors have been corrected without note Irregularities and inconsistencies in the text have been retained as printed The illustrations have been moved so that they do not break up paragraphs thus the page
