dreadly desolate The lordly mountains soar in scorn As still as death as stern as fate The lonely sunsets flame and die The giant valleys gulp the night The monster mountains scrape the sky Where eager stars are diamond bright So gaunt against the gibbous moon Piercing the silence velvet piled A lone wolf howls his ancient rune The fell arch spirit of the Wild O outcast land O leper land Let

COMFORT one hundred three PREMONITION one hundred five THE TRAMPS one hundred six L ENVOI one hundred eight Songs of a Sourdough THE LAW OF THE YUKON This is the law of the Yukon and ever she makes it plain Send not your foolish and feeble send me your strong and your sane Strong for the red rage of battle sane for I harry them sore Send me men girt for the combat men who are grit to the core Swift as the panther in triumph fierce as the bear in defeat Sired of a bulldog parent steeled in the furnace heat Send me the best of your breeding lend me your chosen ones Them will I take to my bosom them will I call my sons Them will I gild with my treasure them will I glut with my meat But the others the misfits the failures I trample under my feet Dissolute damned and despairful crippled and palsied and slain Ye would send me the spawn of your gutters Go take back your spawn again Wild and wide are my borders stern as death is my sway From my ruthless throne I have ruled alone for a million years and a day Hugging my mighty treasure waiting for man to come Till he swept like a turbid torrent and after him swept the scum The pallid pimp of the dead line the enervate of the pen One by one I weeded them out for all that I sought was Men One by one I dismayed them frighting them sore with my glooms One by one I betrayed them unto my manifold dooms Drowned them like rats in my rivers starved them like curs on my plains Rotted the flesh that was left them poisoned the blood in their veins Burst with my winter upon them searing forever their sight Lashed them with fungus white faces whimpering wild in the night Staggering blind through the storm whirl stumbling mad through the snow Frozen stiff in the ice pack brittle and bent like a bow Featureless formless forsaken scented by wolves in their flight Left for the wind to make music through ribs that are glittering white Gnawing the black crust of failure searching the pit of despair Crooking the toe in the trigger trying to patter a prayer Going outside with an escort raving with lips all afoam Writing a cheque for a million drivelling feebly of home Lost like a louse in the burning or else in tented town Seeking a drunkard s solace sinking and sinking down Steeped in the slime at the bottom dead to a decent world Lost mid the human flotsam far on the frontier hurled In the camp at the bend of the river with its dozen saloons aglare Its gambling dens a riot its gramophones all a blare Crimped with the crimes of a city sin ridden and bridled with lies In the hush of my mountained vastness in the flush of my midnight skies Plague spots yet tools of my purpose so natheless I suffer them thrive Crushing my Weak in their clutches that only my Strong may survive But the others the men of my mettle the men who would stablish my fame Unto its ultimate issue winning me honour not shame Searching my uttermost valleys fighting each step as they go Shooting the wrath of my rapids scaling my ramparts of snow Ripping the guts of my mountains looting the beds of my creeks Them will I take to my bosom and speak as a mother speaks I am the land that listens I am the land that broods Steeped in eternal beauty crystalline waters and woods Long have I waited lonely shunned as a thing accurst Monstrous moody pathetic the last of the lands and the first Visioning camp fires at twilight sad with a longing forlorn Feeling my womb o er pregnant with the seed of cities unborn Wild and wide are my borders stern as death is my sway And I wait for the men who will win me and I will not be won in a day And I will not be won by weaklings subtile suave and mild But by men with the hearts of vikings and the simple faith of a child Desperate strong and resistless unthrottled by fear or defeat Them will I gild with my treasure them will I glut with my meat Lofty I stand from each sister land patient and wearily wise With the weight of a world of sadness in my quiet passionless eyes Dreaming alone of a people dreaming alone of a day When men shall not rape my riches and curse me and go away Making a bawd of my bounty fouling the hand that gave Till I rise in my wrath and I sweep on their path and I stamp them into a grave Dreaming of men who will bless me of women esteeming me good Of children born in my borders of radiant motherhood Of cities leaping to stature of fame like a flag unfurled As I pour the tide of my riches in the eager lap of the world This is the Law of the Yukon that only the Strong shall thrive That surely the Weak shall perish and only the Fit survive Dissolute damned and despairful crippled and palsied and slain This is the Will of the Yukon Lo how she makes it plain THE PARSON S SON This is the song of the parson s son as he squats in his shack alone On the wild weird nights when the Northern Lights shoot up from the frozen zone And it s sixty below and couched in the snow the hungry huskies moan I m one of the Arctic brotherhood I m an old time pioneer I came with the first O God how I ve cursed this Yukon but still I m here I ve sweated athirst in its summer heat I ve frozen and starved in its cold I ve followed my dreams by its thousand streams I ve toiled and moiled for its gold Look at my eyes been snow blind twice look where my foot s half gone And that gruesome scar on my left cheek where the frost fiend bit to the bone Each one a brand of this devil s land where I ve played and I ve lost the game A broken wreck with a craze for hooch and never a cent to my name This mining is only a gamble the worst is as good as the best I was in with the bunch and I might have come out right on top with the rest With Cormack Ladue and Macdonald O God but it s hell to think Of the thousands and thousands I ve squandered on cards and women and drink In the early days we were just a few and we hunted and fished around Nor dreamt by our lonely camp fires of the wealth that lay under the ground We traded in skins and whiskey and I ve often slept under the shade Of that lone birch tree on Bonanza where the first big find was made We were just like a great big family and every man had his squaw And we lived such a wild free fearless life beyond the pale of the law Till sudden there came a whisper and it maddened us every man And I got in on Bonanza before the big rush began Oh those Dawson days and the sin and the blaze and the town all open wide If God made me in His likeness sure He let the devil inside But we all were mad both the good and the bad and as for the women well No spot on the map in so short a space has hustled more souls to hell Money was just like dirt there easy to get and to spend I was all caked in on a dance hall jade but she shook me in the end It put me queer and for near a year I never drew sober breath Till I found myself in the bughouse ward with a claim staked out on death Twenty years in the Yukon struggling along its creeks Roaming its giant valleys scaling its god like peaks Bathed in its fiery sunsets fighting its fiendish cold Twenty years in the Yukon twenty years and I m old Old and weak but no matter there s hooch in the bottle still I ll hitch up the dogs to morrow and mush down the trail to Bill It s so long dark and I m lonesome I ll just lay down on the bed To morrow I ll go to morrow I guess I ll play on the red Come Kit your pony is saddled I m waiting dear in the court Minnie you devil I ll kill you if you skip with that flossy sport How much does it go to the pan Bill play up School and play the game Our Father which art in heaven hallowed be Thy name This was the song of the parson s son as he lay in his bunk alone Ere the fire went out and the cold crept in and his blue lips ceased to moan And the hunger maddened malamutes had torn him flesh from bone THE SPELL OF THE YUKON I wanted the gold and I sought it I scrabbled and mucked like a slave Was it famine or scurvy I fought it I hurled my youth into the grave I wanted the gold and I got it Came out with a fortune last fall Yet somehow life s not what I thought it And somehow the gold isn t all No There s the land Have you seen it It s the cussedest land that I know From the big dizzy mountains that screen it To the deep deathlike valleys below Some say God was tired when He made it Some say it s a fine land to shun Maybe but there s some as would trade it For no land on earth and I m one You come to get rich damned good reason You feel like an exile at first You hate it like hell for a season And then you are worse than the worst It grips you like some kinds of sinning It twists you from foe to a friend It seems it s been since the beginning It seems it will be to the end I ve stood in some mighty mouthed hollow That s plumb full of hush to the brim I ve watched the big husky sun wallow In crimson and gold and grow dim Till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming And the stars tumbled out neck and crop And I ve thought that I surely was dreaming With the peace o the world piled on top The summer no sweeter was ever The sunshiny woods all athrill The grayling aleap in the river The bighorn asleep on the hill The strong life that never knows harness The wilds where the caribou call The freshness the freedom the farness O God how I m stuck on it all The winter the brightness that blinds you The white land locked tight as a drum The cold fear that follows and finds you The silence that bludgeons you dumb The snows that are older than history The woods where the weird shadows slant The stillness the moonlight the mystery I ve bade em good bye but I can t There s a land where the mountains are nameless And the rivers all run God knows where There are lives that are erring and aimless And deaths that just hang by a hair There are hardships that nobody reckons There are valleys unpeopled and still There s a land oh it beckons and beckons And I want to go back and I will They re making my money diminish I m sick of the taste of champagne Thank God when I m skinned to a finish I ll pike to the Yukon again I ll fight and you bet it s no sham fight It s hell but I ve been there before And it s better than this by a damsite So me for the Yukon once more There s gold and it s haunting and haunting It s luring me on as of old Yet it isn t the gold that I m wanting So much as just finding the gold It s the great big broad land way up yonder It s the forests where silence has lease It s the beauty that thrills me with wonder It s the stillness that fills me with peace THE CALL OF THE WILD Have you gazed on naked grandeur where there s nothing else to gaze on Set pieces and drop curtain scenes galore Big mountains heaved to heaven which the blinding sunsets blazon Black canyons where the rapids rip and roar Have you swept the visioned valley with the green stream streaking through it Searched the Vastness for a something you have lost Have you strung your soul to silence Then for God s sake go and do it Hear the challenge learn the lesson pay the cost Have you wandered in the wilderness the sage brush desolation The bunch grass levels where the cattle graze Have you whistled bits of rag time at the end of all creation And learned to know the desert s little ways Have you camped upon the foothills have you galloped o er the ranges Have you roamed the arid sun lands through and through Have you chummed up with the mesa Do you know its moods and changes Then listen to the wild it s calling you Have you known the Great White Silence not a snow gemmed twig a quiver Eternal truths that shame our soothing lies Have you broken trail on snowshoes mushed your huskies up the river Dared the unknown led the way and clutched the prize Have you marked the map s void spaces mingled with the mongrel races Felt the savage strength of brute in every thew And though grim as hell the worst is can you round it off with curses Then hearken to the wild it s wanting you Have you suffered starved and triumphed grovelled down yet grasped at glory Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole Done things just for the doing letting babblers tell the story Seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul Have you seen God in His splendours heard the text that nature renders You ll never hear it in the family pew The simple things the true things the silent men who do things Then listen to the wild it s calling you They have cradled you in custom they have primed you with their preaching They have soaked you in convention through and through They have put you in a showcase you re a credit to their teaching But can t you hear the wild it s calling you Let us probe the silent places let us seek what luck betide us Let us journey to a lonely land I know There s a whisper on the night wind there s a star agleam to guide us And the wild is calling calling let us go THE LONE TRAIL Ye who know the Lone Trail fain would follow it Though it lead to glory or the darkness of the pit Ye who take the Lone Trail bid your love good bye The Lone Trail the Lone Trail follow till you die The trails of the world be countless and most of the trails be tried You tread on the heels of the many till you come where the ways divide And one lies safe in the sunlight and the other is dreary and wan Yet you look aslant at the Lone Trail and the Lone Trail lures you on And somehow you re sick of the highway with its noise and its easy needs And you seek the risk of the by way and you reck not where it leads And sometimes it leads to the desert and the tongue swells out of the mouth And you stagger blind to the mirage to die in the mocking drouth And sometimes it leads to the mountain to the light of the lone camp fire And you gnaw your belt in the anguish of hunger goaded desire And sometimes it leads to the Southland to the swamp where the orchid glows And you rave to your grave with the fever and they rob the corpse for its clothes And sometimes it leads to the Northland and the scurvy softens your bones And your flesh dints in like putty and you spit out your teeth like stones And sometimes it leads to a coral reef in the wash of a weedy sea And you sit and stare at the empty glare where the gulls wait greedily And sometimes it leads to an Arctic trail and the snows where your torn feet freeze And you whittle away the useless clay and crawl on your hands and knees Often it leads to the dead pit always it leads to pain By the bones of your brothers ye know it but oh to follow you re fain By your bones they will follow behind you till the ways of the world are made plain Bid good bye to sweetheart bid good bye to friend The Lone Trail the Lone Trail follow to the end Tarry not and fear not chosen of the true Lover of the Lone Trail the Lone Trail waits for you THE HEART OF THE SOURDOUGH There where the mighty mountains bare their fangs unto the moon There where the sullen sun dogs glare in the snow bright bitter noon And the glacier gutted streams sweep down at the clarion call of June There where the livid tundras keep their tryst with the tranquil snows There where the Silences are spawned and the light of hell fire flows Into the bowl of the midnight sky violet amber and rose There where the rapids churn and roar and the ice floes bellowing run Where the tortured twisted rivers of blood rush to the setting sun I ve packed my kit and I m going boys ere another day is done I knew it would call or soon or late as it calls the whirring wings It s the olden lure it s the golden lure it s the lure of the timeless things And to night O God of the trails untrod how it whines in my heart strings I m sick to death of your well groomed gods your make believe and your show I long for a whiff of bacon and beans a snug shake down in the snow A trail to break and a life at stake and another bout with the foe With the raw ribbed Wild that abhors all life the wild that would crush and rend I have clinched and closed with the naked North I have learned to defy and defend Shoulder to shoulder we ve fought it out yet the Wild must win in the end I have flouted the Wild I have followed its lure fearless familiar alone By all that the battle means and makes I claim that land for mine own Yet the Wild must win and a day will come when I shall be overthrown Then when as wolf dogs fight we ve fought the lean wolf land and I Fought and bled till the snows are red under the reeling sky Even as lean wolf dog goes down will I go down and die THE THREE VOICES The waves have a story to tell me As I lie on the lonely beach Chanting aloft in the pine tops The wind has a lesson to teach But the stars sing an anthem of glory I cannot put into speech The waves tell of ocean spaces Of hearts that are wild and brave Of populous city places Of desolate shores they lave Of men who sally in quest of gold To sink in an ocean grave The wind is a mighty roamer He bids me keep me free Clean from the taint of the gold lust Hardy and pure as he Cling with my love to nature As a child to the mother knee But the stars throng out in their glory And they sing of the God in man They sing of the mighty Master Of the loom His fingers span Where a star or a soul is a part of the whole And weft in the wondrous plan Here by the camp fire s flicker Deep in my blanket curled I long for the peace of the pine gloom When the scroll of the Lord is unfurled And the wind and the wave are silent And world is singing to world THE PINES 
6097-293616-0000	train-other-500	We sleep in the sleep of ages the bleak barbarian pines The grey moss drapes us like sages and closer we lock our lines
none	none	 And deeper we clutch through the gelid gloom 
6097-293616-0001	train-other-500	where never a sunbeam shines On the flanks of the storm gored ridges are our black battalions massed We surge in a host to the sullen coast and we sing in the ocean blast
6097-293616-0002	train-other-500	From empire of sea to empire of snow we grip our empire fast To the niggard lands were we driven twixt desert and foe are we penned To us was the Northland given ours to stronghold and defend
6097-293616-0003	train-other-500	Ours till the world be riven in the crash of the utter end Ours from the bleak beginning through the aeons of death like sleep Ours from the shock when the naked rock was hurled from the hissing deep
6097-293616-0004	train-other-500	Ours through the twilight ages of weary glacier creep Wind of the East wind of the West wandering to and fro Chant your songs in our topmost boughs that the sons of men may know
6097-293616-0005	train-other-500	The peerless pine was the first to come and the pine will be last to go We pillar the halls of perfumed gloom we plume where the eagles soar The North wind swoops from the brooding Pole
6097-293616-0006	train-other-500	and our ancients crash and roar But where one falls from the crumbling walls shoots up a hardy score We spring from the gloom of the canyon s womb in the valley s lap we lie
6097-293616-0007	train-other-500	From the white foam fringe where the breakers cringe to the peaks that tusk the sky We climb and we peer in the crag locked mere that gleams like a golden eye
6097-293616-0008	train-other-500	Gain to the verge of the hog back ridge where the vision ranges free Pines and pines and the shadow of pines as far as the eye can see A steadfast legion of stalwart knights in dominant empery
none	none	 Sun moon and stars give answer 
6097-293616-0009	train-other-500	shall we not staunchly stand Even as now forever wards of the wilder strand Sentinels of the stillness lords of the last lone land THE HARPY
6097-293616-0010	train-other-500	There was a woman and she was wise woefully wise was she She was old so old yet her years all told were but a score and three
none	none	 And she knew by heart from finish to start the Book of Iniquity 
6097-293616-0011	train-other-500	There is no hope for such as I on earth nor yet in Heaven Unloved I live unloved I die unpitied unforgiven
none	none	 A loathed jade I ply my trade 
6097-293616-0012	train-other-500	unhallowed and unshriven I paint my cheeks for they are white and cheeks of chalk men hate Mine eyes with wine I make to shine that men may seek and sate With overhead a lamp of red
none	none	 I sit me down and wait 
6097-293616-0013	train-other-500	Until they come the nightly scum with drunken eyes aflame Your sweethearts sons ye scornful ones
none	none	 tis I who know their shame 
6097-293616-0014	train-other-500	The gods ye see are brutes to me and so I play my game For life is not the thing we thought and not the thing we plan And woman in a bitter world must do the best she can Must yield the stroke and bear the yoke and serve the will of man
6097-293616-0015	train-other-500	Must serve his need and ever feed the flame of his desire Though be she loved for love alone or be she loved for hire For every man since life began is tainted with the mire And though you know he love you so and set you on love s throne
none	none	 Yet let your eyes but mock his sighs and let your heart be stone 
6097-293616-0016	train-other-500	Lest you be left as I was left attainted and alone From love s close kiss to hell s abyss is one sheer flight I trow And wedding ring and bridal bell are will o wisps of woe
6097-293616-0017	train-other-500	And tis not wise to love too well and this all women know Wherefore the wolf pack having gorged upon the lamb their prey With siren smile and serpent guile I make the wolf pack pay
6097-293616-0018	train-other-500	With velvet paws and flensing claws a tigress roused to slay One who in youth sought truest truth and found a devil s lies A symbol of the sin of man a human sacrifice
6097-293616-0019	train-other-500	Yet shall I blame on man the shame Could it be otherwise Was I not born to walk in scorn where others walk in pride The Maker marred and evil starred I drift upon His tide
6097-293616-0020	train-other-500	And He alone shall judge His own so I His judgment bide Fate has written a tragedy its name is The Human Heart The theatre is the House of Life Woman the mummer s part
6097-293616-0021	train-other-500	The Devil enters the prompter s box and the play is ready to start THE LURE OF LITTLE VOICES There s a cry from out the Loneliness Oh listen Honey listen
6097-293616-0022	train-other-500	Do you hear it do you fear it you re a holding of me so You re a sobbing in your sleep dear and your lashes how they glisten Do you hear the Little Voices all a begging me to go All a begging me to leave you
6097-293616-0023	train-other-500	Day and night they re pleading praying On the North wind on the West wind from the peak and from the plain Night and day they never leave me do you know what they are saying He was ours before you got him and we want him once again
6097-293616-0024	train-other-500	Yes they re wanting me they re haunting me the awful lonely places They re whining and they re whimpering as if each had a soul They re calling from the wilderness the vast and god like spaces
6097-293616-0025	train-other-500	The stark and sullen solitudes that sentinel the Pole They miss my little camp fires ever brightly bravely gleaming In the womb of desolation where was never man before As comradeless I sought them
6097-293616-0026	train-other-500	lion hearted loving dreaming And they hailed me as a comrade and they loved me evermore And now they re all a crying
none	none	 and it s no use me denying The spell of them is on me and I m helpless as a child 
6097-293616-0027	train-other-500	My heart is aching aching but I hear them sleeping waking It s the Lure of Little Voices it s the mandate of the Wild I m afraid to tell you Honey I can take no bitter leaving
6097-293616-0028	train-other-500	But softly in the sleep time from your love I ll steal away Oh it s cruel dearie cruel and it s God knows how I m grieving But His Loneliness is calling and He knows I must obey
6097-293616-0029	train-other-500	THE SONG OF THE WAGE SLAVE When the long long day is over and the Big Boss gives me my pay I hope that it won t be hell fire as some of the parsons say
6097-293616-0030	train-other-500	And I hope that it won t be heaven with some of the parsons I ve met All I want is just quiet just to rest and forget Look at my face toil furrowed look at my calloused hands Master I ve done Thy bidding
6097-293616-0031	train-other-500	wrought in Thy many lands Wrought for the little masters big bellied they be and rich
none	none	 I ve done their desire for a daily hire and I die like a dog in a ditch 
6097-293616-0032	train-other-500	I have used the strength Thou hast given Thou knowest I did not shirk Threescore years of labour Thine be the long day s work And now Big Master
none	none	 I m broken and bent and twisted and scarred But I ve held my job and Thou knowest and Thou wilt not judge me hard 
6097-293616-0033	train-other-500	Thou knowest my sins are many and often I ve played the fool Whiskey and cards and women they made me the devil s tool I was just like a child with money I flung it away with a curse
6097-293616-0034	train-other-500	Feasting a fawning parasite or glutting a harlot s purse
none	none	 Then back to the woods repentant 
6097-293616-0035	train-other-500	back to the mill or the mine I the worker of workers everything in my line Everything hard but headwork I d no more brains than a kid
none	none	 A brute with brute strength to labour 
6097-293616-0036	train-other-500	doing as I was bid Living in camps with men folk a lonely and loveless life Never knew kiss of sweetheart never caress of wife
none	none	 A brute with brute strength to labour 
6097-293616-0037	train-other-500	and they were so far above Yet I d gladly have gone to the gallows for one little look of Love I with the strength of two men savage and shy and wild
none	none	 Yet how I d ha treasured a woman 
6097-293616-0038	train-other-500	and the sweet warm kiss of a child Well tis Thy world and Thou knowest
none	none	 I blaspheme and my ways be rude But I ve lived my life as I found it and I ve done my best to be good 
6097-293616-0039	train-other-500	I the primitive toiler half naked and grimed to the eyes Sweating it deep in their ditches swining it stark in their styes Hulling down forests before me spanning tumultuous streams

6097-293616-0040	train-other-500	palaces fairer than dreams Boring the rock to the ore bed driving the road through the fen Resolute dumb uncomplaining a man in a world of men Master I ve filled my contract
6097-293616-0041	train-other-500	wrought in Thy many lands Not by my sins wilt Thou judge me but by the work of my hands Master I ve done Thy bidding and the light is low in the west
6097-293616-0042	train-other-500	And the long long shift is over Master I ve earned it Rest GRIN If you re up against a bruiser and you re getting knocked about
6097-293616-0043	train-other-500	Grin If you re feeling pretty groggy and you re licked beyond a doubt Grin Don t let him see you re funking let him know with every clout

bluff And grin THE SHOOTING OF DAN MCGREW A bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute saloon The kid that handles the music box was hitting a jag time tune Back of the bar in a solo game sat Dangerous Dan McGrew And watching his luck was his light o love the lady that s known as Lou When out of the night which was fifty below and into the din and the glare There stumbled a miner fresh from the creeks dog dirty and loaded for bear He looked like a man with a foot in the grave and scarcely the strength of a louse Yet he tilted a poke of dust on the bar and he called for drinks for the house There was none could place the stranger s face though we searched ourselves for a clue But we drank his health and the last to drink was Dangerous Dan McGrew There s men that somehow just grip your eyes and hold them hard like a spell And such was he and he looked to me like a man who had lived in hell With a face most hair and the dreary stare of a dog whose day is done As he watered the green stuff in his glass and the drops fell one by one Then I got to figgering who he was and wondering what he d do And I turned my head and there watching him was the lady that s known as Lou His eyes went rubbering round the room and he seemed in a kind of daze Till at last that old piano fell in the way of his wandering gaze The rag time kid was having a drink there was no one else on the stool So the stranger stumbles across the room and flops down there like a fool In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat and I saw him sway Then he clutched the keys with his talon hands my God but that man could play Were you ever out in the Great Alone when the moon was awful clear And the icy mountains hemmed you in with a silence you most could hear With only the howl of a timber wolf and you camped there in the cold A half dead thing in a stark dead world clean mad for the muck called gold While high overhead green yellow and red the North Lights swept in bars Then you ve a haunch what the music meant hunger and night and the stars And hunger not of the belly kind that s banished with bacon and beans But the gnawing hunger of lonely men for a home and all that it means For a fireside far from the cares that are four walls and a roof above But oh so cramful of cosy joy and crowned with a woman s love A woman dearer than all the world and true as Heaven is true God how ghastly she looks through her rouge the lady that s known as Lou Then on a sudden the music changed so soft that you scarce could hear But you felt that your life had been looted clean of all that it once held dear That some one had stolen the woman you loved that her love was a devil s lie That your guts were gone and the best for you was to crawl away and die Twas the crowning cry of a heart s despair and it thrilled you through and through I guess I ll make it a spread misere said Dangerous Dan McGrew The music almost died away then it burst like a pent up flood And it seemed to say Repay repay and my eyes were blind with blood The thought came back of an ancient wrong and it stung like a frozen lash And the lust awoke to kill to kill then the music stopped with a crash And the stranger turned and his eyes they burned in a most peculiar way In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat and I saw him sway Then his lips went in in a kind of grin and he spoke and his voice was calm And Boys says he you don t know me and none of you care a damn But I want to state and my words are straight and I ll bet my poke they re true That one of you is a hound of hell and that one is Dan McGrew Then I ducked my head and the lights went out and two guns blazed in the dark And a woman screamed and the lights went up and two men lay stiff and stark Pitched on his head and pumped full of lead was Dangerous Dan McGrew While the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast of the lady that s known as Lou These are the simple facts of the case and I guess I ought to know They say that the stranger was crazed with hooch and I m not denying it s so I m not so wise as the lawyer guys but strictly between us two The woman that kissed him and pinched his poke was the lady that s known as Lou THE CREMATION OF SAM MCGEE There are strange things done in the midnight sun By the men who moil for gold The Arctic trails have their secret tales That would make your blood run cold The Northern Lights have seen queer sights But the queerest they ever did see Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge I cremated Sam McGee Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee where the cotton blooms and blows Why he left his home in the South to roam round the Pole God only knows He was always cold but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell Though he d often say in his homely way that he d sooner live in hell On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail Talk of your cold through the parka s fold it stabbed like a driven nail If our eyes we d close then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn t see It wasn t much fun but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee And that very night as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow And the dogs were fed and the stars o erhead were dancing heel and toe He turned to me and Cap says he I ll cash in this trip I guess And if I do I m asking that you won t refuse my last request Well he seemed so low that I couldn t say no then he says with a sort of moan It s the cursed cold and it s got right hold till I m chilled clean through to the bone Yet taint being dead it s my awful dread of the icy grave that pains So I want you to swear that foul or fair you ll cremate my last remains A pal s last need is a thing to heed so I swore I would not fail And we started on at the streak of dawn but God he looked ghastly pale He crouched on the sleigh and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee There wasn t a breath in that land of death and I hurried horror driven With a corpse half hid that I couldn t get rid because of a promise given It was lashed to the sleigh and it seemed to say You may tax your brawn and brains But you promised true and it s up to you to cremate those last remains Now a promise made is a debt unpaid and the trail has its own stern code In the days to come though my lips were dumb in my heart how I cursed that load In the long long night by the lone firelight while the huskies round in a ring Howled out their woes to the homeless snows O God how I loathed the thing And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow And on I went though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low The trail was bad and I felt half mad but I swore I would not give in And I d often sing to the hateful thing and it hearkened with a grin Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge and a derelict there lay It was jammed in the ice but I saw in a trice it was called the Alice May And I looked at it and I thought a bit and I looked at my frozen chum Then Here said I with a sudden cry is my cre ma tor eum Some planks I tore from the cabin floor and I lit the boiler fire Some coal I found that was lying around and I heaped the fuel higher The flames just soared and the furnace roared such a blaze you seldom see And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal and I stuffed in Sam McGee Then I made a hike for I didn t like to hear him sizzle so And the heavens scowled and the huskies howled and the wind began to blow It was icy cold but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks and I don t know why And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near I was sick with dread but I bravely said I ll just take a peep inside I guess he s cooked and it s time I looked then the door I opened wide And there sat Sam looking cool and calm in the heart of the furnace roar And he wore a smile you could see a mile and he said Please close that door It s fine in here but I greatly fear you ll let in the cold and storm Since I left Plumtree down in Tennessee it s the first time I ve been warm There are strange things done in the midnight sun By the men who moil for gold The Arctic trails have their secret tales That would make your blood run cold The Northern Lights have seen queer sights But the queerest they ever did see Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge I cremated Sam McGee MY MADONNA

none	none	 Be it so THE LOW DOWN WHITE This is the pay day up at the mines when the bearded brutes come down There s money to burn in the streets to night so I ve sent my klooch to town With a haggard face and a ribband of red entwined in her hair of brown And I know at the dawn she ll come reeling home with the bottles one two three One for herself to drown her shame and two big bottles for me To make me forget the thing I am and the man I used to be To make me forget the brand of the dog as I crouch in this hideous place To make me forget once I kindled the light of love in a lady s face Where even the squalid Siwash now holds me a black disgrace Oh I have guarded my secret well And who would dream as I speak In a tribal tongue like a rogue unhung mid the ranch house filth and reek I could roll to bed with a Latin phrase and rise with a verse of Greek Yet I was a senior prizeman once and the pride of a college eight Called to the bar my friends were true but they could not keep me straight Then came the divorce and I went abroad and died on the River Plate But I m not dead yet though with half a lung there isn t time to spare And I hope that the year will see me out and thank God no one will care Save maybe the little slim Siwash girl with the rose of shame in her hair She will come with the dawn and the dawn is near I can see its evil glow Like a corpse light seen through a frosty pane in a night of want and woe And yonder she comes by the bleak bull pines swift staggering through the snow THE LITTLE OLD LOG CABIN When a man gits on his uppers in a hard pan sort of town An he ain t got nothin comin an he can t afford ter eat An he s in a fix fer lodgin an he wanders up an down An you d fancy he d been boozin he s so locoed bout the feet When he s feelin sneakin sorry an his belt is hangin slack An his face is peaked an grey like an his heart gits down an whines Then he s apt ter git a thinkin an a wishin he was back In the little ol log cabin in the shadder of the pines When he s on the blazin desert an his canteen s sprung a leak An he s all alone an crazy an he s crawlin like a snail An his tongue s so black an swollen that it hurts him fer to speak An he gouges down fer water an the raven s on his trail When he s done with care and cursin an he feels more like to cry An he sees ol Death a grinnin an he thinks upon his crimes Then he s like ter hev a vision as he settles down ter die Of the little ol log cabin an the roses an the vines Oh the little ol log cabin it s a solemn shinin mark When a feller gits ter sinnin an a goin ter the wall An folks don t understand him an he s gropin in the dark An he s sick of bein cursed at an he s longin fer his call When the sun of life s a sinkin you can see it way above On the hill from out the shadder in a glory gin the sky An your mother s voice is callin an her arms are stretched in love An somehow you re glad you re goin an you ain t a scared to die When you ll be like a kid again an nestle to her breast An never leave its shelter an forget an love an rest THE YOUNGER SON If you leave the gloom of London and you seek a glowing land Where all except the flag is strange and new There s a bronzed and stalwart fellow who will grip you by the hand And greet you with a welcome warm and true For he s your younger brother the one you sent away Because there wasn t room for him at home And now he s quite contented and he s glad he didn t stay And he s building Britain s greatness o er the foam When the giant herd is moving at the rising of the sun And the prairie is lit with rose and gold And the camp is all a bustle and the busy day s begun He leaps into the saddle sure and bold Through the round of heat and hurry through the racket and the rout He rattles at a pace that nothing mars And when the night winds whisper and camp fires flicker out He is sleeping like a child beneath the stars When the wattle blooms are drooping in the sombre she oak glade And the breathless land is lying in a swoon He leaves his work a moment leaning lightly on his spade And he hears the bell bird chime the Austral noon The parakeets are silent in the gum tree by the creek The ferny grove is sunshine steeped and still But the dew will gem the myrtle in the twilight ere he seek His little lonely cabin on the hill Around the purple vine clad slope the argent river dreams The roses almost hide the house from view A snow peak of the Winterberg in crimson splendour gleams The shadow deepens down on the karroo He seeks the lily scented dusk beneath the orange tree His pipe in silence glows and fades and glows And then two little maids come out and climb upon his knee And one is like the lily one the rose He sees his white sheep dapple o er the green New Zealand plain And where Vancouver s shaggy ramparts frown When the sunlight threads the pine gloom he is fighting might and main To clinch the rivets of an Empire down You will find him toiling toiling in the south or in the west A child of nature fearless frank and free And the warmest heart that beats for you is beating in his breast And he sends you loyal greeting o er the sea You ve a brother in the Army you ve another in the Church One of you is a diplomatic swell You ve had the pick of everything and left him in the lurch And yet I think he s doing very well I m sure his life is happy and he doesn t envy yours I know he loves the land his pluck has won And I fancy in the years unborn while England s fame endures She will come to bless with pride the Younger Son THE MARCH OF THE DEAD The cruel war was over oh the triumph was so sweet We watched the troops returning through our tears There was triumph triumph triumph down the scarlet glittering street And you scarce could hear the music for the cheers And you scarce could see the house tops for the flags that flew between The bells were pealing madly to the sky And every one was shouting for the Soldiers of the Queen And the glory of an age was passing by And then there came a shadow swift and sudden dark and drear The bells were silent not an echo stirred The flags were drooping sullenly the men forgot to cheer We waited and we never spoke a word The sky grew darker darker till from out the gloomy rack There came a voice that checked the heart with dread Tear down tear down your bunting now and hang up sable black They are coming it s the Army of the Dead They were coming they were coming gaunt and ghastly sad and slow They were coming all the crimson wrecks of pride With faces seared and cheeks red smeared and haunting eyes of woe And clotted holes the khaki couldn t hide Oh the clammy brow of anguish the livid foam flecked lips The reeling ranks of ruin swept along The limb that trailed the hand that failed the bloody finger tips And oh the dreary rhythm of their song They left us on the veldt side but we felt we couldn t stop On this our England s crowning festal day We re the men of Magersfontein we re the men of Spion Kop Colenso we re the men who had to pay We re the men who paid the blood price Shall the grave be all our gain You owe us Long and heavy is the score Then cheer us for our glory now and cheer us for our pain And cheer us as ye never cheered before The folks were white and stricken and each tongue seemed weighed with lead Each heart was clutched in hollow hand of ice And every eye was staring at the horror of the dead The pity of the men who paid the price They were come were come to mock us in the first flush of our peace Through writhing lips their teeth were all agleam They were coming in their thousands oh would they never cease I closed my eyes and then it was a dream There was triumph triumph triumph down the scarlet gleaming street The town was mad a man was like a boy A thousand flags were flaming where the sky and city meet A thousand bells were thundering the joy There was music mirth and sunshine but some eyes shone with regret And while we stun with cheers our homing braves O God in Thy great mercy let us nevermore forget The graves they left behind the bitter graves FIGHTING MAC A LIFE TRAGEDY A pistol shot rings round and round the world In pitiful defeat a warrior lies A last defiance to dark Death is hurled A last wild challenge shocks the sunlit skies Alone he falls with wide wan woeful eyes Eyes that could smile at death could not face shame Alone alone he paced his narrow room In the bright sunshine of that Paris day Saw in his thought the awful hand of doom Saw in his dream his glory pass away Tried in his heart his weary heart to pray O God who made me give me strength to face The spectre of this bitter black disgrace The burn brawls darkly down the shaggy glen The bee kissed heather blooms around the door He sees himself a barefoot boy again Bending o er page of legendary lore He hears the pibroch grips the red claymore Runs with the Fiery Cross a clansman true Sworn kinsman of Rob Roy and Roderick Dhu Eating his heart out with a wild desire One day behind his counter trim and neat He hears a sound that sets his brain afire The Highlanders are marching down the street Oh how the pipes shrill out the mad drums beat On to the gates of Hell my Gordons gay He flings his hated yardstick far away He sees the sullen pass high crowned with snow Where Afghans cower with eyes of gleaming hate He hurls himself against the hidden foe They try to rally ah too late too late Again defenceless with fierce eyes that wait For death he stands like baited bull at bay And flouts the Boers that mad Majuba day He sees again the murderous Soudan Blood slaked and rapine swept He seems to stand Upon the gory plain of Omdurman Then Magersfontein and supreme command Over his Highlanders To shake his hand A King is proud and princes call him friend And glory crowns his life and now the end The awful end His eyes are dark with doom He hears the shrapnel shrieking overhead He sees the ravaged ranks the flame stabbed gloom Oh to have fallen the battle field his bed With Wauchope and his glorious brother dead Why was he saved for this for this And now He raises the revolver to his brow In many a Highland home framed with rude art You ll find his portrait rough hewn stern and square It s graven in the Fuyam fellah s heart The Ghurka reads it at his evening prayer The raw lands know it where the fierce suns glare The Dervish fears it Honour to his name Who holds aloft the shield of England s fame Mourn for our hero men of Northern race We do not know his sin we only know His sword was keen He laughed death in the face And struck for Empire s sake a giant blow His arm was strong Ah well they learnt the foe The echo of his deeds is ringing yet Will ring for aye All else let us forget THE WOMAN AND THE ANGEL An angel was tired of heaven as he lounged in the golden street His halo was tilted sideways and his harp lay mute at his feet So the Master stooped in His pity and gave him a pass to go For the space of a moon to the earth world to mix with the men below He doffed his celestial garments scarce waiting to lay them straight He bade goodbye to Peter who stood by the golden gate The sexless singers of heaven chanted a fond farewell And the imps looked up as they pattered on the red hot flags of hell Never was seen such an angel eyes of a heavenly blue Features that shamed Apollo hair of a golden hue The women simply adored him his lips were like Cupid s bow But he never ventured to use them and so they voted him slow Till at last there came One Woman a marvel of loveliness And she whispered to him Do you love me And he answered that woman Yes And she said Put your arms around me and kiss me and hold me so But fiercely he drew back saying This thing is wrong and I know Then sweetly she mocked his scruples and softly she him beguiled You who are verily man among men speak with the tongue of a child We have outlived the old standards we have burst like an over tight thong The ancient outworn puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong Then the Master feared for His angel and called him again to His side For oh the woman was wondrous and oh the angel was tried And deep in his hell sang the Devil and this was the strain of his song The ancient outworn puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong THE RHYME OF THE RESTLESS ONES We couldn t sit and study for the law 
6097-293621-0000	train-other-500	The stagnation of a bank we couldn t stand For our riot blood was surging and we didn t need much urging To excitements and excesses that are banned So we took to wine and drink and other things And the devil in us struggled to be free
6097-293621-0001	train-other-500	Till our friends rose up in wrath and they pointed out the path And they paid our debts and packed us o er the sea
none	none	 Oh they shook us off and shipped us o er the foam 
6097-293621-0002	train-other-500	To the larger lands that lure a man to roam And we took the chance they gave Of a far and foreign grave And we bade goodbye for evermore to home And some of us are climbing on the peak And some of us are camping on the plain
6097-293621-0003	train-other-500	By pine and palm you ll find us with never claim to bind us By track and trail you ll meet us once again We are fated serfs to freedom sky and sea We have failed where slummy cities overflow
6097-293621-0004	train-other-500	But the stranger ways of earth know our pride and know our worth And we go into the dark as fighters go Yes we go into the night as brave men go Though our faces they be often streaked with woe Yet we re hard as cats to kill
6097-293621-0005	train-other-500	And our hearts are reckless still And we ve danced with death a dozen times or so
none	none	 And you ll find us in Alaska after gold 
6097-293621-0006	train-other-500	And you ll find us herding cattle in the South We like strong drink and fun and when the race is run We often die with curses in our mouth We are wild as colts unbroke but never mean
6097-293621-0007	train-other-500	Of our sins we ve shoulders broad to bear the blame But we ll never stay in town and we ll never settle down And we ll never have an object or an aim
none	none	 No there s that in us that time can never tame 
6097-293621-0008	train-other-500	And life will always seem a careless game And they d better far forget Those who say they love us yet Forget
none	none	 blot out with bitterness our name 
6097-293621-0009	train-other-500	NEW YEAR S EVE It s cruel cold on the water front silent and dark and drear Only the black tide weltering only the hissing snow
none	none	 And I alone like a storm tossed wreck on this night of the glad New Year Shuffling along in the icy wind ghastly and gaunt and slow They re playing a tune in McGuffy s saloon and it s cheery and bright in there 
6097-293621-0011	train-other-500	God but I m weak since the bitter dawn and never a bite of food
none	none	 I ll just go over and slip inside 
6097-293621-0012	train-other-500	I mustn t give way to despair Perhaps I can bum a little booze if the boys are feeling good
none	none	 They ll jeer at me and they ll sneer at me and they ll call me a whiskey soak Have a drink 
6097-293621-0013	train-other-500	Well thankee kindly sir I don t mind if I do A drivelling dirty gin joint fiend the butt of the bar room joke Sunk and sodden and hopeless Another Well here s to you
none	none	 McGuffy is showing a bunch of the boys how Bob Fitzsimmons hit The barman is talking of Tammany Hall and why the ward boss got fired I ll just sneak into a corner and they ll let me alone a bit 
6097-293621-0015	train-other-500	The room is reeling round and round O God but I m tired I m tired Roses she wore on her breast that night
none	none	 Oh but their scent was sweet Alone we sat on the balcony and the fan palms arched above 
6097-293621-0016	train-other-500	The witching strain of a waltz by Strauss came up to our cool retreat
none	none	 And I prisoned her little hand in mine and I whispered my plea of love 
6097-293621-0017	train-other-500	Then sudden the laughter died on her lips and lowly she bent her head And oh there came in the deep dark eyes a look that was heaven to see And the moments went and I waited there and never a word was said
6097-293621-0018	train-other-500	And she plucked from her bosom a rose of red and shyly gave it to me Then the music swelled to a crash of joy and the lights blazed up like day And I held her fast to my throbbing heart and I kissed her bonny brow
6097-293621-0019	train-other-500	She is mine she is mine for evermore the violins seemed to say And the bells were ringing the New Year in O God I can hear them now Don t you remember that long last waltz with its sobbing sad refrain
6097-293621-0020	train-other-500	Don t you remember that last goodbye and the dear eyes dim with tears Don t you remember that golden dream
none	none	 with never a hint of pain 
6097-293621-0021	train-other-500	Of lives that would blend like an angel song
none	none	 in the bliss of the coming year Oh what have I lost What have I lost 
6097-293621-0022	train-other-500	Ethel forgive forgive The red red rose is faded now and it s fifty years ago Twere better to die a thousand deaths than live each day as I live
none	none	 I have sinned I have sunk to the lowest depths but oh I have suffered so 
6097-293621-0023	train-other-500	Hark Oh hark I can hear the bells Look I can see her there Fair as a dream but it fades And now I can hear the dreadful hum Of the crowded court See the Judge looks down
6097-293621-0024	train-other-500	NOT GUILTY my Lord I swear The bells I can hear the bells again Ethel I come I come Rouse up old man it s twelve o clock You can t sleep here you know Say ain t you got no sentiment
6097-293621-0025	train-other-500	Lift up your muddled head Have a drink to the glad New Year a drop before you go You darned old dirty hobo My God Here boys He s DEAD

6097-293621-0030	train-other-500	if you re a tramp in tatters While the blue sky bends above You ve got nearly all that matters You ve got God and God is love PREMONITION
6097-293621-0031	train-other-500	Twas a year ago and the moon was bright Oh I remember so well so well
none	none	 I walked with my love in a sea of light And the voice of my sweet was a silver bell 
6097-293621-0032	train-other-500	And sudden the moon grew strangely dull And sudden my love had taken wing I looked on the face of a grinning skull
none	none	 I strained to my heart a ghastly thing Twas but fantasy for my love lay still In my arms with her tender eyes aglow And she wondered why my lips were chill Why I was silent and kissed her so A year has gone and the moon is bright 
6097-293621-0033	train-other-500	A gibbous moon like a ghost of woe
none	none	 I sit by a new made grave to night And my heart is broken 
6097-293621-0034	train-other-500	it s strange you know THE TRAMPS Can you recall dear comrade when we tramped God s land together
none	none	 And we sang the old old Earth song for our youth was very sweet 
6097-293621-0035	train-other-500	When we drank and fought and lusted as we mocked at tie and tether Along the road to Anywhere the wide world at our feet Along the road to Anywhere when each day had its story
6097-293621-0036	train-other-500	When time was yet our vassal and life s jest was still unstale
none	none	 When peace unfathomed filled our hearts as bathed in amber glory 
6097-293621-0037	train-other-500	Along the road to Anywhere we watched the sunsets pale Alas the road to Anywhere is pitfalled with disaster There s hunger want and weariness yet O we loved it so
none	none	 As on we tramped exultantly 
6097-293621-0038	train-other-500	and no man was our master And no man guessed what dreams were ours as swinging heel and toe We tramped the road to Anywhere the magic road to Anywhere The tragic road to Anywhere such dear dim years ago

6097-293621-0040	train-other-500	Vintage of desperate years Hard as a harlot s smile
none	none	 Bitter as unshed tears 
6097-293621-0041	train-other-500	Little of joy or mirth Little of ease I sing Sagas of men of earth Humanly suffering Such as you all have done Savagely faring forth Sons of the midnight sun Argonauts of the North
6097-293621-0042	train-other-500	Far in the land God forgot Glimmers the lure of your trail Still in your lust are you taught Even to win is to fail Still must you follow and fight Under the vampire wing There in the long long night
6097-293621-0043	train-other-500	Hoping and vanquishing Husbandmen of the Wild Reaping a barren gain Scourged by desire reconciled Unto disaster and pain These my songs are for you You who are seared with the brand
