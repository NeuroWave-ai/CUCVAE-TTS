Language English Character set encoding ASCII START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TRAGEDY OF PUDD NHEAD WILSON Produced by An Anonymous Volunteer THE TRAGEDY OF PUDD NHEAD WILSON by Mark Twain A WHISPER TO THE READER There is no character howsoever good and fine but it can be destroyed by ridicule howsoever poor and witless Observe the ass for instance his character is about perfect he is the choicest spirit among all the humbler animals yet see what ridicule has brought him to Instead of feeling complimented when we are called an ass we are left in doubt Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar A person who is ignorant of legal matters is always liable to make mistakes when he tries to photograph a court scene with his pen and so I was not willing to let the law chapters in this book go to press without first subjecting them to rigid and exhausting revision and correction by a trained barrister if that is what they are called These chapters are right now in every detail for they were rewritten under the immediate eye of William Hicks who studied law part of a while in southwest Missouri thirty five years ago and then came over here to Florence for his health and is still helping for exercise and board in Macaroni Vermicelli s horse feed shed which is up the back alley as you turn around the corner out of the Piazza del Duomo just beyond the house where that stone that Dante used to sit on six hundred years ago is let into the wall when he let on to be watching them build Giotto s campanile and yet always got tired looking as Beatrice passed along on her way to get a chunk of chestnut cake to defend herself with in case of a Ghibelline outbreak before she got to school at the same old stand where they sell the same old cake to this day and it is just as light and good as it was then too and this is not flattery far from it He was a little rusty on his law but he rubbed up for this book and those two or three legal chapters are right and straight now He told me so himself Given under my hand this second day of January eighteen ninety three at the Villa Viviani village of Settignano three miles back of Florence on the hills the same certainly affording the most charming view to be found on this planet and with it the most dreamlike and enchanting sunsets to be found in any planet or even in any solar system and given too in the swell room of the house with the busts of Cerretani senators and other grandees of this line looking approvingly down upon me as they used to look down upon Dante and mutely asking me to adopt them into my family which I do with pleasure for my remotest ancestors are but spring chickens compared with these robed and stately antiques and it will be a great and satisfying lift for me that six hundred years will Mark Twain CHAPTER one Pudd nhead Wins His Name Tell the truth or trump but get the trick Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar The scene of this chronicle is the town of Dawson s Landing on the Missouri side of the Mississippi half a day s journey per steamboat below saint Louis In eighteen thirty it was a snug collection of modest one and two story frame dwellings whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from sight by climbing tangles of rose vines honeysuckles and morning glories Each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced with white palings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks marigolds touch me nots prince s feathers and other old fashioned flowers while on the windowsills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing moss rose plants and terra cotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium whose spread of intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint of the rose clad house front like an explosion of flame When there was room on the ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat the cat was there in sunny weather stretched at full length asleep and blissful with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose Then that house was complete and its contentment and peace were made manifest to the world by this symbol whose testimony is infallible A home without a cat and a well fed well petted and properly revered cat may be a perfect home perhaps but how can it prove title All along the streets on both sides at the outer edge of the brick sidewalks stood locust trees with trunks protected by wooden boxing and these furnished shade for summer and a sweet fragrancer in spring when the clusters of buds came forth The main street one block back from the river and running parallel with it was the sole business street It was six blocks long and in each block two or three brick stores three stories high towered above interjected bunches of little frame shops Swinging signs creaked in the wind the street s whole length The candy striped pole which indicates nobility proud and ancient along the palace bordered canals of Venice indicated merely the humble barbershop along the main street of Dawson s Landing On a chief corner stood a lofty unpainted pole wreathed from top to bottom with tin pots and pans and cups the chief tinmonger s noisy notice to the world when the wind blew that his shop was on hand for business at that corner The hamlet s front was washed by the clear waters of the great river its body stretched itself rearward up a gentle incline its most rearward border fringed itself out and scattered its houses about its base line of the hills the hills rose high enclosing the town in a half moon curve clothed with forests from foot to summit Steamboats passed up and down every hour or so Those belonging to the little Cairo line and the little Memphis line always stopped the big Orleans liners stopped for hails only or to land passengers or freight and this was the case also with the great flotilla of transients These latter came out of a dozen rivers the Illinois the Missouri the Upper Mississippi the Ohio the Monongahela the Tennessee the Red River the White River and so on and were bound every whither and stocked with every imaginable comfort or necessity which the Mississippi s communities could want from the frosty Falls of saint Anthony down through nine climates to torrid New Orleans Dawson s Landing was a slaveholding town with a rich slave worked grain and pork country back of it The town was sleepy and comfortable and contented It was fifty years old and was growing slowly very slowly in fact but still it was growing The chief citizen was York Leicester Driscoll about forty years old judge of the county court He was very proud of his old Virginian ancestry and in his hospitalities and his rather formal and stately manners he kept up its traditions He was fine and just and generous To be a gentleman a gentleman without stain or blemish was his only religion and to it he was always faithful He was respected esteemed and beloved by all of the community He was well off and was gradually adding to his store He and his wife were very nearly happy but not quite for they had no children The longing for the treasure of a child had grown stronger and stronger as the years slipped away but the blessing never came and was never to come With this pair lived the judge s widowed sister missus Rachel Pratt and she also was childless childless and sorrowful for that reason and not to be comforted The women were good and commonplace people and did their duty and had their reward in clear consciences and the community s approbation They were Presbyterians the judge was a freethinker Pembroke Howard lawyer and bachelor aged almost forty was another old Virginian grandee with proved descent from the First Families He was a fine majestic creature a gentleman according to the nicest requirements of the Virginia rule a devoted Presbyterian an authority on the code and a man always courteously ready to stand up before you in the field if any act or word of his had seemed doubtful or suspicious to you and explain it with any weapon you might prefer from bradawls to artillery He was very popular with the people and was the judge s dearest friend Then there was Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex another F F V of formidable caliber however with him we have no concern Percy Northumberland Driscoll brother to the judge and younger than he by five years was a married man and had had children around his hearthstone but they were attacked in detail by measles croup and scarlet fever and this had given the doctor a chance with his effective antediluvian methods so the cradles were empty He was a prosperous man with a good head for speculations and his fortune was growing On the first of February eighteen thirty two boy babes were born in his house one to him one to one of his slave girls Roxana by name Roxana was twenty years old She was up and around the same day with her hands full for she was tending both babes missus Percy Driscoll died within the week Roxy remained in charge of the children She had her own way for mister Driscoll soon absorbed himself in his speculations and left her to her own devices In that same month of February Dawson s Landing gained a new citizen This was mister David Wilson a young fellow of Scotch parentage He had wandered to this remote region from his birthplace in the interior of the State of New York to seek his fortune He was twenty five years old college bred and had finished a post college course in an Eastern law school a couple of years before He was a homely freckled sandy haired young fellow with an intelligent blue eye that had frankness and comradeship in it and a covert twinkle of a pleasant sort But for an unfortunate remark of his he would no doubt have entered at once upon a successful career at Dawson s Landing But he made his fatal remark the first day he spent in the village and it gaged him He had just made the acquaintance of a group of citizens when an invisible dog began to yelp and snarl and howl and make himself very comprehensively disagreeable whereupon young Wilson said much as one who is thinking aloud I wish I owned half of that dog Why somebody asked Because I would kill my half The group searched his face with curiosity with anxiety even but found no light there no expression that they could read They fell away from him as from something uncanny and went into privacy to discuss him One said Pears to be a fool Pears said another Is I reckon you better say Said he wished he owned half of the dog the idiot said a third What did he reckon would become of the other half if he killed his half Do you reckon he thought it would live Why he must have thought it unless he IS the downrightest fool in the world because if he hadn t thought it he would have wanted to own the whole dog knowing that if he killed his half and the other half died he would be responsible for that half just the same as if he had killed that half instead of his own Don t it look that way to you gents Yes it does If he owned one half of the general dog it would be so if he owned one end of the dog and another person owned the other end it would be so just the same particularly in the first case because if you kill one half of a general dog there ain t any man that can tell whose half it was but if he owned one end of the dog maybe he could kill his end of it and No he couldn t either he couldn t and not be responsible if the other end died which it would In my opinion that man ain t in his right mind In my opinion he hain t got any mind No three said Well he s a lummox anyway That s what he is said No four He s a labrick just a Simon pure labrick if there was one Yes sir he s a dam fool That s the way I put him up said No five Anybody can think different that wants to but those are my sentiments I m with you gentlemen said No six Perfect jackass yes and it ain t going too far to say he is a pudd nhead If he ain t a pudd nhead I ain t no judge that s all mister Wilson stood elected The incident was told all over the town and gravely discussed by everybody Within a week he had lost his first name Pudd nhead took its place In time he came to be liked and well liked too but by that time the nickname had got well stuck on and it stayed That first day s verdict made him a fool and he was not able to get it set aside or even modified The nickname soon ceased to carry any harsh or unfriendly feeling with it but it held its place and was to continue to hold its place for twenty long years CHAPTER two Driscoll Spares His Slaves Adam was but human this explains it all He did not want the apple for the apple s sake he wanted it only because it was forbidden The mistake was in not forbidding the serpent then he would have eaten the serpent Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar Pudd nhead Wilson had a trifle of money when he arrived and he bought a small house on the extreme western verge of the town Between it and Judge Driscoll s house there was only a grassy yard with a paling fence dividing the properties in the middle He hired a small office down in the town and hung out a tin sign with these words on it D A V I D W I L S O N ATTORNEY AND COUNSELOR AT LAW SURVEYING CONVEYANCING et cetera But his deadly remark had ruined his chance at least in the law No clients came He took down his sign after a while and put it up on his own house with the law features knocked out of it It offered his services now in the humble capacities of land surveyor and expert accountant Now and then he got a job of surveying to do and now and then a merchant got him to straighten out his books With Scotch patience and pluck he resolved to live down his reputation and work his way into the legal field yet Poor fellow he could foresee that it was going to take him such a weary long time to do it He had a rich abundance of idle time but it never hung heavy on his hands for he interested himself in every new thing that was born into the universe of ideas and studied it and experimented upon it at his house One of his pet fads was palmistry To another one he gave no name neither would he explain to anybody what its purpose was but merely said it was an amusement In fact he had found that his fads added to his reputation as a pudd nhead there he was growing chary of being too communicative about them The fad without a name was one which dealt with people s finger marks He carried in his coat pocket a shallow box with grooves in it and in the grooves strips of glass five inches long and three inches wide Along the lower edge of each strip was pasted a slip of white paper He asked people to pass their hands through their hair thus collecting upon them a thin coating of the natural oil and then making a thumb mark on a glass strip following it with the mark of the ball of each finger in succession Under this row of faint grease prints he would write a record on the strip of white paper thus JOHN SMITH right hand and add the day of the month and the year then take Smith s left hand on another glass strip and add name and date and the words left hand The strips were now returned to the grooved box and took their place among what Wilson called his records He often studied his records examining and poring over them with absorbing interest until far into the night but what he found there if he found anything he revealed to no one Sometimes he copied on paper the involved and delicate pattern left by the ball of the finger and then vastly enlarged it with a pantograph so that he could examine its web of curving lines with ease and convenience One sweltering afternoon it was the first day of July eighteen thirty he was at work over a set of tangled account books in his workroom which looked westward over a stretch of vacant lots when a conversation outside disturbed him It was carried on in yells which showed that the people engaged in it were not close together Say Roxy how does yo baby come on This from the distant voice Fust rate How does you come on Jasper This yell was from close by Oh I s middlin hain t got noth n to complain of I s gwine to come a court n you bimeby Roxy You is you black mud cat Yah yah yah I got somep n better to do den sociat n wid niggers as black as you is Is ole Miss Cooper s Nancy done give you de mitten Roxy followed this sally with another discharge of carefree laughter You s jealous Roxy dat s what s de matter wid you you hussy yah yah yah Dat s de time I got you Oh yes you got me hain t you Clah to goodness if dat conceit o yo n strikes in Jasper it gwine to kill you sho If you b longed to me I d sell you down de river fo you git too fur gone Fust time I runs acrost yo marster I s gwine to tell him so This idle and aimless jabber went on and on both parties enjoying the friendly duel and each well satisfied with his own share of the wit exchanged for wit they considered it Wilson stepped to the window to observe the combatants he could not work while their chatter continued Over in the vacant lots was Jasper young coal black and of magnificent build sitting on a wheelbarrow in the pelting sun at work supposably whereas he was in fact only preparing for it by taking an hour s rest before beginning In front of Wilson s porch stood Roxy with a local handmade baby wagon in which sat her two charges one at each end and facing each other From Roxy s manner of speech a stranger would have expected her to be black but she was not Only one sixteenth of her was black and that sixteenth did not show She was of majestic form and stature her attitudes were imposing and statuesque and her gestures and movements distinguished by a noble and stately grace Her complexion was very fair with the rosy glow of vigorous health in her cheeks her face was full of character and expression her eyes were brown and liquid and she had a heavy suit of fine soft hair which was also brown but the fact was not apparent because her head was bound about with a checkered handkerchief and the hair was concealed under it Her face was shapely intelligent and comely even beautiful She had an easy independent carriage when she was among her own caste and a high and sassy way withal but of course she was meek and humble enough where white people were To all intents and purposes Roxy was as white as anybody but the one sixteenth of her which was black outvoted the other fifteen parts and made her a Negro She was a slave and salable as such Her child was thirty one parts white and he too was a slave and by a fiction of law and custom a Negro He had blue eyes and flaxen curls like his white comrade but even the father of the white child was able to tell the children apart little as he had commerce with them by their clothes for the white babe wore ruffled soft muslin and a coral necklace while the other wore merely a coarse tow linen shirt which barely reached to its knees and no jewelry The white child s name was Thomas a Becket Driscoll the other s name was Valet de Chambre no surname slaves hadn t the privilege Roxana had heard that phrase somewhere the fine sound of it had pleased her ear and as she had supposed it was a name she loaded it on to her darling It soon got shorted to Chambers of course Wilson knew Roxy by sight and when the duel of wits begun to play out he stepped outside to gather in a record or two Jasper went to work energetically at once perceiving that his leisure was observed Wilson inspected the children and asked How old are they Roxy Bofe de same age sir five months Bawn de fust o Feb uary They re handsome little chaps One s just as handsome as the other too A delighted smile exposed the girl s white teeth and s

none	none	Bless yo soul Misto Wilson it s pow ful nice o you to say dat ca se one of em ain t on y a nigger Mighty prime little nigger I al ays says but dat s ca se it s mine o course How do you tell them apart Roxy when they haven t any clothes on Roxy laughed a laugh proportioned to her size and said Oh I kin tell em part Misto Wilson but I bet Marse Percy couldn t not to save his life Wilson chatted along for awhile and presently got Roxy s fingerprints for his collection right hand and left on a couple of his glass strips then labeled and dated them and took the records of both children and labeled and dated them also Two months later on the third of September he took this trio of finger marks again He liked to have a series two or three takings at intervals during the period of childhood these to be followed at intervals of several years The next day that is to say on the fourth of September something occurred which profoundly impressed Roxana mister Driscoll missed another small sum of money which is a way of saying that this was not a new thing but had happened before In truth it had happened three times before Driscoll s patience was exhausted He was a fairly humane man toward slaves and other animals he was an exceedingly humane man toward the erring of his own race Theft he could not abide and plainly there was a thief in his house Necessarily the thief must be one of his Negros Sharp measures must be taken He called his servants before him There were three of these besides Roxy a man a woman and a boy twelve years old They were not related mister Driscoll said You have all been warned before It has done no good This time I will teach you a lesson I will sell the thief Which of you is the guilty one They all shuddered at the threat for here they had a good home and a new one was likely to be a change for the worse The denial was general None had stolen anything not money anyway a little sugar or cake or honey or something like that that Marse Percy wouldn t mind or miss but not money never a cent of money They were eloquent in their protestations but mister Driscoll was not moved by them He answered each in turn with a stern Name the thief The truth was all were guilty but Roxana she suspected that the others were guilty but she did not know them to be so She was horrified to think how near she had come to being guilty herself she had been saved in the nick of time by a revival in the colored Methodist Church a fortnight before at which time and place she got religion The very next day after that gracious experience while her change of style was fresh upon her and she was vain of her purified condition her master left a couple dollars unprotected on his desk and she happened upon that temptation when she was polishing around with a dustrag She looked at the money awhile with a steady rising resentment then she burst out with Dad blame dat revival I wisht it had a be n put off till tomorrow Then she covered the tempter with a book and another member of the kitchen cabinet got it She made this sacrifice as a matter of religious etiquette as a thing necessary just now but by no means to be wrested into a precedent no a week or two would limber up her piety then she would be rational again and the next two dollars that got left out in the cold would find a comforter and she could name the comforter Was she bad Was she worse than the general run of her race No They had an unfair show in the battle of life and they held it no sin to take military advantage of the enemy in a small way in a small way but not in a large one They would smouch provisions from the pantry whenever they got a chance or a brass thimble or a cake of wax or an emery bag or a paper of needles or a silver spoon or a dollar bill or small articles of clothing or any other property of light value and so far were they from considering such reprisals sinful that they would go to church and shout and pray the loudest and sincerest with their plunder in their pockets A farm smokehouse had to be kept heavily padlocked or even the colored deacon himself could not resist a ham when Providence showed him in a dream or otherwise where such a thing hung lonesome and longed for someone to love But with a hundred hanging before him the deacon would not take two that is on the same night On frosty nights the humane Negro prowler would warm the end of the plank and put it up under the cold claws of chickens roosting in a tree a drowsy hen would step on to the comfortable board softly clucking her gratitude and the prowler would dump her into his bag and later into his stomach perfectly sure that in taking this trifle from the man who daily robbed him of an inestimable treasure his liberty he was not committing any sin that God would remember against him in the Last Great Day Name the thief For the fourth time mister Driscoll had said it and always in the same hard tone And now he added these words of awful import I give you one minute He took out his watch If at the end of that time you have not confessed I will not only sell all four of you BUT I will sell you DOWN THE RIVER It was equivalent to condemning them to hell No Missouri Negro doubted this Roxy reeled in her tracks and the color vanished out of her face the others dropped to their knees as if they had been shot tears gushed from their eyes their supplicating hands went up and three answers came in the one instant I done it I done it I done it have mercy marster Lord have mercy on us po niggers Very good said the master putting up his watch I will sell you here though you don t deserve it You ought to be sold down the river The culprits flung themselves prone in an ecstasy of gratitude and kissed his feet declaring that they would never forget his goodness and never cease to pray for him as long as they lived They were sincere for like a god he had stretched forth his mighty hand and closed the gates of hell against them He knew himself that he had done a noble and gracious thing and was privately well pleased with his magnanimity and that night he set the incident down in his diary so that his son might read it in after years and be thereby moved to deeds of gentleness and humanity himself CHAPTER three Roxy Plays a Shrewd Trick Whoever has lived long enough to find out what life is knows how deep a debt of gratitude we owe to Adam the first great benefactor of our race He brought death into the world Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar Percy Driscoll slept well the night he saved his house minions from going down the river but no wink of sleep visited Roxy s eyes A profound terror had taken possession of her Her child could grow up and be sold down the river The thought crazed her with horror If she dozed and lost herself for a moment the next moment she was on her feet flying to her child s cradle to see if it was still there Then she would gather it to her heart and pour out her love upon it in a frenzy of kisses moaning crying and saying Dey sha n t oh dey sha nt yo po mammy will kill you fust Once when she was tucking him back in its cradle again the other child nestled in its sleep and attracted her attention She went and stood over it a long time communing with herself What has my po baby done dat he couldn t have yo luck He hain t done nuth n God was good to you why warn t he good to him Dey can t sell you down de river I hates yo pappy he hain t got no heart for niggers he hain t anyways I hates him en I could kill him She paused awhile thinking then she burst into wild sobbings again and turned away saying Oh I got to kill my chile dey ain t no yuther way killin him wouldn t save de chile fum goin down de river Oh I got to do it yo po mammy s got to kill you to save you honey She gathered her baby to her bosom now and began to smother it with caresses Mammy s got to kill you how kin I do it But yo mammy ain t gwine to desert you no no dah don t cry she gwine wid you she gwine to kill herself too Come along honey come along wid mammy we gwine to jump in de river den troubles o dis worl is all over dey don t sell po niggers down the river over yonder She stared toward the door crooning to the child and hushing it midway she stopped suddenly She had caught sight of her new Sunday gown a cheap curtain calico thing a conflagration of gaudy colors and fantastic figures She surveyed it wistfully longingly Hain t ever wore it yet she said en it s just lovely Then she nodded her head in response to a pleasant idea and added No I ain t gwine to be fished out wid everybody lookin at me in dis mis able ole linsey woolsey She put down the child and made the change She looked in the glass and was astonished at her beauty She resolved to make her death toilet perfect She took off her handkerchief turban and dressed her glossy wealth of hair like white folks she added some odds and ends of rather lurid ribbon and a spray of atrocious artificial flowers finally she threw over her shoulders a fluffy thing called a cloud in that day which was of a blazing red complexion Then she was ready for the tomb She gathered up her baby once more but when her eye fell upon its miserably short little gray tow linen shirt and noted the contrast between its pauper shabbiness and her own volcanic eruption of infernal splendors her mother heart was touched and she was ashamed No dolling mammy ain t gwine to treat you so De angels is gwine to mire you jist as much as dey does yo mammy Ain t gwine to have em putt n dey han s up fo dey eyes en sayin to David and Goliah en dem yuther prophets Dat chile is dress to indelicate fo dis place By this time she had stripped off the shirt Now she clothed the naked little creature in one of Thomas a Becket s snowy long baby gowns with its bright blue bows and dainty flummery of ruffles Dah now you s fixed She propped the child in a chair and stood off to inspect it Straightway her eyes begun to widen with astonishment and admiration and she clapped her hands and cried out Why it do beat all I never knowed you was so lovely Marse Tommy ain t a bit puttier not a single bit She stepped over and glanced at the other infant she flung a glance back at her own then one more at the heir of the house Now a strange light dawned in her eyes and in a moment she was lost in thought She seemed in a trance when she came out of it she muttered When I uz a washin em in de tub yistiddy he own pappy asked me which of em was his n She began to move around like one in a dream She undressed Thomas a Becket stripping him of everything and put the tow linen shirt on him She put his coral necklace on her own child s neck Then she placed the children side by side and after earnest inspection she muttered Now who would b lieve clo es could do de like o dat Dog my cats if it ain t all I kin do to tell t other fum which let alone his pappy She put her cub in Tommy s elegant cradle and said You s young Marse Tom fum dis out en I got to practice and git used to memberin to call you dat honey or I s gwine to make a mistake sometime en git us bofe into trouble Dah now you lay still en don t fret no mo Marse Tom Oh thank de lord in heaven you s saved you s saved Dey ain t no man kin ever sell mammy s po little honey down de river now She put the heir of the house in her own child s unpainted pine cradle and said contemplating its slumbering form uneasily I s sorry for you honey I s sorry God knows I is but what kin I do what could I do Yo pappy would sell him to somebody sometime en den he d go down de river sho en I couldn t couldn t couldn t stan it She flung herself on her bed and began to think and toss toss and think By and by she sat suddenly upright for a comforting thought had flown through her worried mind T ain t no sin white folks has done it It ain t no sin glory to goodness it ain t no sin Dey s done it yes en dey was de biggest quality in de whole bilin too kings She began to muse she was trying to gather out of her memory the dim particulars of some tale she had heard some time or other At last she said Now I s got it now I member It was dat ole nigger preacher dat tole it de time he come over here fum Illinois en preached in de nigger church He said dey ain t nobody kin save his own self can t do it by faith can t do it by works can t do it no way at all Free grace is de on y way en dat don t come fum nobody but jis de Lord en he kin give it to anybody He please saint or sinner he don t kyer He do jis as He s a mineter He s lect out anybody dat suit Him en put another one in his place and make de fust one happy forever en leave t other one to burn wid Satan De preacher said it was jist like dey done in Englan one time long time ago De queen she lef her baby layin aroun one day en went out callin an one o de niggers roun bout de place dat was mos white she come in en see de chile layin aroun en tuck en put her own chile s clo s on de queen s

DEY done it en not on y jis common white folks nuther but de biggest quality dey is in de whole bilin Oh I s so glad I member bout dat She got lighthearted and happy and went to the cradles and spent what was left of the night practicing She would give her own child a light pat and say humbly Lay still Marse Tom then give the real Tom a pat and say with severity Lay still Chambers Does you want me to take somep n to you As she progressed with her practice she was surprised to see how steadily and surely the awe which had kept her tongue reverent and her manner humble toward her young master was transferring itself to her speech and manner toward the usurper and how similarly handy she was becoming in transferring her motherly curtness of speech and peremptoriness of manner to the unlucky heir of the ancient house of Driscoll She took occasional rests from practicing and absorbed herself in calculating her chances Dey ll sell dese niggers today fo stealin de money den dey ll buy some mo dat don t now de chillen so dat s all right When I takes de chillen out to git de air de minute I s roun de corner I s gwine to gaum dey mouths all roun wid jam den dey can t nobody notice dey s changed Yes I gwine ter do dat till I s safe if it s a year Dey ain t but one man dat I s afeard of en dat s dat Pudd nhead Wilson Dey calls him a pudd nhead en says he s a fool My lan dat man ain t no mo fool den I is He s de smartes man in dis town lessn it s Jedge Driscoll or maybe Pem Howard Blame dat man he worries me wid dem ornery glasses o his n I b lieve he s a witch But nemmine I s gwine to happen aroun dah one o dese days en let on dat I reckon he wants to print a chillen s fingers ag in en if HE don t notice dey s changed I bound dey ain t nobody gwine to notice it en den I s safe sho But I reckon I ll tote along a hoss shoe to keep off de witch work The new Negros gave Roxy no trouble of course The master gave her none for one of his speculations was in jeopardy and his mind was so occupied that he hardly saw the children when he looked at them and all Roxy had to do was to get them both into a gale of laughter when he came about then their faces were mainly cavities exposing gums and he was gone again before the spasm passed and the little creatures resumed a human aspect Within a few days the fate of the speculation became so dubious that mister Percy went away with his brother the judge to see what could be done with it It was a land speculation as usual and it had gotten complicated with a lawsuit The men were gone seven weeks Before they got back Roxy had paid her visit to Wilson and was satisfied Wilson took the fingerprints labeled them with the names and with the date October the first put them carefully away and continued his chat with Roxy who seemed very anxious that he should admire the great advance in flesh and beauty which the babes had made since he took their fingerprints a month before He complimented their improvement to her contentment and as they were without any disguise of jam or other stain she trembled all the while and was miserably frightened lest at any moment he But he didn t He discovered nothing and she went home jubilant and dropped all concern about the matter permanently out of her mind CHAPTER four The Ways of the Changelings Adam and Eve had many advantages but the principal one was that they escaped teething Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar There is this trouble about special providences namely there is so often a doubt as to which party was intended to be the beneficiary In the case of the children the bears and the prophet the bears got more real satisfaction out of the episode than the prophet did because they got the children Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar This history must henceforth accommodate itself to the change which Roxana has consummated and call the real heir Chambers and the usurping little slave Thomas a Becket shortening this latter name to Tom for daily use as the people about him did Tom was a bad baby from the very beginning of his usurpation He would cry for nothing he would burst into storms of devilish temper without notice and let go scream after scream and squall after squall then climax the thing with holding his breath that frightful specialty of the teething nursling in the throes of which the creature exhausts its lungs then is convulsed with noiseless squirmings and twistings and kickings in the effort to get its breath while the lips turn blue and the mouth stands wide and rigid offering for inspection one wee tooth set in the lower rim of a hoop of red gums and when the appalling stillness has endured until one is sure the lost breath will never return a nurse comes flying and dashes water in the child s face and presto the lungs fill and instantly discharge a shriek or a yell or a howl which bursts the listening ear and surprises the owner of it into saying words which would not go well with a halo if he had one The baby Tom would claw anybody who came within reach of his nails and pound anybody he could reach with his rattle He would scream for water until he got it and then throw cup and all on the floor and scream for more He was indulged in all his caprices howsoever troublesome and exasperating they might be he was allowed to eat anything he wanted particularly things that would give him the stomach ache When he got to be old enough to begin to toddle about and say broken words and get an idea of what his hands were for he was a more consummate pest than ever Roxy got no rest while he was awake He would call for anything and everything he saw simply saying Awnt it want it which was a command When it was brought he said in a frenzy and motioning it away with his hands Don t awnt it don t awnt it and the moment it was gone he set up frantic yells of Awnt it awnt it and Roxy had to give wings to her heels to get that thing back to him again before he could get time to carry out his intention of going into convulsions about it What he preferred above all other things was the tongs This was because his father had forbidden him to have them lest he break windows and furniture with them The moment Roxy s back was turned he would toddle to the presence of the tongs and say Like it and cock his eye to one side or see if Roxy was observed then Awnt it and cock his eye again then Hab it with another furtive glance and finally Take it and the prize was his The next moment the heavy implement was raised aloft the next there was a crash and a squall and the cat was off on three legs to meet an engagement Roxy would arrive just as the lamp or a window went to irremediable smash Tom got all the petting Chambers got none Tom got all the delicacies Chambers got mush and milk and clabber without sugar In consequence Tom was a sickly child and Chambers wasn t Tom was fractious as Roxy called it and overbearing Chambers was meek and docile With all her splendid common sense and practical everyday ability Roxy was a doting fool of a mother She was this toward her child and she was also more than this by the fiction created by herself he was become her master the necessity of recognizing this relation outwardly and of perfecting herself in the forms required to express the recognition had moved her to such diligence and faithfulness in practicing these forms that this exercise soon concreted itself into habit it became automatic and unconscious then a natural result followed deceptions intended solely for others gradually grew practically into self deceptions as well the mock reverence became real reverence the mock homage real homage the little counterfeit rift of separation between imitation slave and imitation master widened and widened and became an abyss and a very real one and on one side of it stood Roxy the dupe of her own deceptions and on the other stood her child no longer a usurper to her but her accepted and recognized master He was her darling her master and her deity all in one and in her worship of him she forgot who she was and what he had been In babyhood Tom cuffed and banged and scratched Chambers unrebuked and Chambers early learned that between meekly bearing it and resenting it the advantage all lay with the former policy The few times that his persecutions had moved him beyond control and made him fight back had cost him very dear at headquarters not at the hands of Roxy for if she ever went beyond scolding him sharply for forgett n who his young marster was she at least never extended her punishment beyond a box on the ear No Percy Driscoll was the person He told Chambers that under no provocation whatever was he privileged to lift his hand against his little master Chambers overstepped the line three times and got three such convincing canings from the man who was his father and didn t know it that he took Tom s cruelties in all humility after that and made no more experiments Outside the house the two boys were together all through their boyhood Chambers was strong beyond his years and a good fighter strong because he was coarsely fed and hard worked about the house and a good fighter because Tom furnished him plenty of practice on white boys whom he hated and was afraid of Chambers was his constant bodyguard to and from school he was present on the playground at recess to protect his charge He fought himself into such a formidable reputation by and by that Tom could have changed clothes with him and ridden in peace like Sir Kay in Launcelot s armor He was good at games of skill too Tom staked him with marbles to play keeps with and then took all the winnings away from him In the winter season Chambers was on hand in Tom s worn out clothes with holy red mittens and holy shoes and pants holy at the knees and seat to drag a sled up the hill for Tom warmly clad to ride down on but he never got a ride himself He built snowmen and snow fortifications under Tom s directions He was Tom s patient target when Tom wanted to do some snowballing but the target couldn t fire back Chambers carried Tom s skates to the river and strapped them on him then trotted around after him on the ice so as to be on hand when he wanted but he wasn t ever asked to try the skates himself In summer the pet pastime of the boys of Dawson s Landing was to steal apples peaches and melons from the farmer s fruit wagons mainly on account of the risk they ran of getting their heads laid open with the butt of the farmer s whip Tom was a distinguished adept at these thefts by proxy Chambers did his stealing and got the peach stones apple cores and melon rinds for his share Tom always made Chambers go in swimming with him and stay by him as a protection When Tom had had enough he would slip out and tie knots in Chamber s shirt dip the knots in the water and make them hard to undo then dress himself and sit by and laugh while the naked shiverer tugged at the stubborn knots with his teeth Tom did his humble comrade these various ill turns partly out of native viciousness and partly because he hated him for his superiorities of physique and pluck and for his manifold cleverness Tom couldn t dive for it gave him splitting headaches Chambers could dive without inconvenience and was fond of doing it He excited so much admiration one day among a crowd of white boys by throwing back somersaults from the stern of a canoe that it wearied Tom s spirit and at last he shoved the canoe underneath Chambers while he was in the air so he came down on his head in the canoe bottom and while he lay unconscious several of Tom s ancient adversaries saw that their long desired opportunity was come and they gave the false heir such a drubbing that with Chamber s best help he was hardly able to drag himself home afterward When the boys was fifteen and upward Tom was showing off in the river one day when he was taken with a cramp and shouted for help It was a common trick with the boys particularly if a stranger was present to pretend a cramp and howl for help then when the stranger came tearing hand over hand to the rescue the howler would go on struggling and howling till he was close at hand then replace the howl with a sarcastic smile and swim blandly away while the town boys assailed the dupe with a volley of jeers and laughter Tom had never tried this joke as yet but was supposed to be trying it now so the boys held warily back but Chambers believed his master was in earnest therefore he swam out and arrived in time unfortunately and saved his life This was the last feather Tom had managed to endure everything else but to have to remain publicly and permanently under such an obligation as this to a nigger and to this nigger of all niggers this was too much He heaped insults upon Chambers for pretending to think he was in earnest in calling for help and said that anybody but a blockheaded nigger would have known he was funning and left him alone Tom s enemies were in strong force here so they came out with their opinions quite freely They laughed at him and called him coward liar sneak and other sorts of pet names and told him they meant to call Chambers by a new name after this and make it common in the town Tom Driscoll s nigger pappy to signify that he had had a second birth into this life and that Chambers was the author of his new being Tom grew frantic under these taunts and shouted Knock their heads off Chambers Knock their heads off What do you stand there with your hands in your pockets for Chambers expostulated and said But Marse Tom dey s too many of em dey s Do you hear me Please Marse Tom don t make me Dey s so many of em dat Tom sprang at him and drove his pocketknife into him two or three times before the boys could snatch him away and give the wounded lad a chance to escape He was considerably hurt but not seriously If the blade had been a little longer his career would have ended there Tom had long ago taught Roxy her place It had been many a day now since she had ventured a caress or a fondling epithet in his quarter Such things from a nigger were repulsive to him and she had been warned to keep her distance and remember who she was She saw her darling gradually cease from being her son she saw THAT detail perish utterly all that was left was master master pure and simple and it was not a gentle mastership either She saw herself sink from the sublime height of motherhood to the somber depths of unmodified slavery the abyss of separation between her and her boy was complete She was merely his chattel now his convenience his dog his cringing and helpless slave the humble and unresisting victim of his capricious temper and vicious nature Sometimes she could not go to sleep even when worn out with fatigue because her rage boiled so high over the day s experiences with her boy She would mumble and mutter to herself He struck me en I warn t no way to blame struck me in de face right before folks En he s al ays callin me nigger wench en hussy en all dem mean names when I s doin de very bes I kin Oh Lord I done so much for him I lif him away up to what he is en dis is what I git for it Sometimes when some outrage of peculiar offensiveness stung her to the heart she would plan schemes of vengeance and revel in the fancied spectacle of his exposure to the world as an imposter and a slave but in the midst of these joys fear would strike her she had made him too strong she could prove nothing and heavens she might get sold down the river for her pains So her schemes always went for nothing and she laid them aside in impotent rage against the fates and against herself for playing the fool on that fatal September day in not providing herself with a witness for use in the day when such a thing might be needed for the appeasing of her vengeance hungry heart And yet the moment Tom happened to be good to her and kind and this occurred every now and then all her sore places were healed and she was happy happy and proud for this was her son her nigger son lording it among the whites and securely avenging their crimes against her race There were two grand funerals in Dawson s Landing that fall the fall of eighteen forty five One was that of Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex the other that of Percy Driscoll On his deathbed Driscoll set Roxy free and delivered his idolized ostensible son solemnly into the keeping of his brother the judge and his wife Those childless people were glad to get him Childless people are not difficult to please Judge Driscoll had gone privately to his brother a month before and bought Chambers He had heard that Tom had been trying to get his father to sell the boy down the river and he wanted to prevent the scandal for public sentiment did not approve of that way of treating family servants for light cause or for no cause Percy Driscoll had worn himself out in trying to save his great speculative landed estate and had died without succeeding He was hardly in his grave before the boom collapsed and left his envied young devil of an heir a pauper But that was nothing his uncle told him he should be his heir and have all his fortune when he died so Tom was comforted Roxy had no home now so she resolved to go around and say good by to her friends and then clear out and see the world that is to say she would go chambermaiding on a steamboat the darling ambition of her race and sex Her last call was on the black giant Jasper She found him chopping Pudd nhead Wilson s winter provision of wood Wilson was chatting with him when Roxy arrived He asked her how she could bear to go off chambermaiding and leave her boys and chaffingly offered to copy off a series of their fingerprints reaching up to their twelfth year for her to remember them by but she sobered in a moment wondering if he suspected anything then she said she believed she didn t want them Wilson said to himself The drop of black blood in her is superstitious she thinks there s some devilry some witch business about my glass mystery somewhere she used to come here with an old horseshoe in her hand it could have been an accident but I doubt it CHAPTER five The Twins Thrill Dawson s Landing Training is everything The peach was once a bitter almond cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college education Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar Remark of doctor Baldwin s concerning upstarts We don t care to eat toadstools that think they are truffles Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar missus York Driscoll enjoyed two years of bliss with that prize Tom bliss that was troubled a little at times it is true but bliss nevertheless then she died and her husband and his childless sister missus Pratt continued this bliss business at the old stand Tom was petted and indulged and spoiled to his entire content or nearly that This went on till he was nineteen then he was sent to Yale He went handsomely equipped with conditions but otherwise he was not an object of distinction there He remained at Yale two years and then threw up the struggle He came home with his manners a good deal improved he had lost his surliness and brusqueness and was rather pleasantly soft and smooth now he was furtively and sometimes openly ironical of speech and given to gently touching people on the raw but he did it with a good natured semiconscious air that carried it off safely and kept him from getting into trouble He was as indolent as ever and showed no very strenuous desire to hunt up an occupation People argued from this that he preferred to be supported by his uncle until his uncle s shoes should become vacant He brought back one or two new habits with him one of which he rather openly practiced tippling but concealed another which was gambling It would not do to gamble where his uncle could hear of it he knew that quite well Tom s Eastern polish was not popular among the young people They could have endured it perhaps if Tom had stopped there but he wore gloves and that they couldn t stand and wouldn t so he was mainly without society He brought home with him a suit of clothes of such exquisite style and cut in fashion Eastern fashion city fashion that it filled everybody with anguish and was regarded as a peculiarly wanton affront He enjoyed the feeling which he was exciting and paraded the town serene and happy all day but the young fellows set a tailor to work that night and when Tom started out on his parade next morning he found the old deformed Negro bell ringer straddling along in his wake tricked out in a flamboyant curtain calico exaggeration of his finery and imitating his fancy Eastern graces as well as he could Tom surrendered and after that clothed himself in the local fashion But the dull country town was tiresome to him since his acquaintanceship with livelier regions and it grew daily more and more so He began to make little trips to saint Louis for refreshment There he found companionship to suit him and pleasures to his taste along with more freedom in some particulars than he could have at home So during the next two years his visits to the city grew in frequency and his tarryings there grew steadily longer in duration He was getting into deep waters He was taking chances privately which might get him into trouble some day in fact did Judge Driscoll had retired from the bench and from all business activities in eighteen fifty and had now been comfortably idle three years He was president of the Freethinkers Society and Pudd nhead Wilson was the other member The society s weekly discussions were now the old lawyer s main interest in life Pudd nhead was still toiling in obscurity at the bottom of the ladder under the blight of that unlucky remark which he had let fall twenty three years before about the dog Judge Driscoll was his friend and claimed that he had a mind above the average but that was regarded as one of the judge s whims and it failed to modify the public opinion Or rather that was one of the reasons why it failed but there was another and better one If the judge had stopped with bare assertion it would have had a good deal of effect but he made the mistake of trying to prove his position For some years Wilson had been privately at work on a whimsical almanac for his amusement a calendar with a little dab of ostensible philosophy usually in ironical form appended to each date and the judge thought that these quips and fancies of Wilson s were neatly turned and cute so he carried a handful of them around one day and read them to some of the chief citizens But irony was not for those people their mental vision was not focused for it They read those playful trifles in the solidest terms and decided without hesitancy that if there had ever been any doubt that Dave Wilson was a pudd nhead which there hadn t this revelation removed that doubt for good and all That is just the way in this world an enemy can partly ruin a man but it takes a good natured injudicious friend to complete the thing and make it perfect After this the judge felt tenderer than ever toward Wilson and surer than ever that his calendar had merit Judge Driscoll could be a freethinker and still hold his place in society because he was the person of most consequence to the community and therefore could venture to go his own way and follow out his own notions The other member of his pet organization was allowed the like liberty because he was a cipher in the estimation of the public and nobody attached any importance to what he thought or did He was liked he was welcome enough all around but he simply didn t count for anything The Widow Cooper affectionately called Aunt Patsy by everybody lived in a snug and comely cottage with her daughter Rowena who was nineteen romantic amiable and very pretty but otherwise of no consequence Rowena had a couple of young brothers also of no consequence The widow had a large spare room which she let to a lodger with board when she could find one but this room had been empty for a year now to her sorrow Her income was only sufficient for the family support and she needed the lodging money for trifling luxuries But now at last on a flaming June day she found herself happy her tedious wait was ended her year worn advertisement had been answered and not by a village applicant no no this letter was from away off yonder in the dim great world to the North it was from saint Louis She sat on her porch gazing out with unseeing eyes upon the shining reaches of the mighty Mississippi her thoughts steeped in her good fortune Indeed it was specially good fortune for she was to have two lodgers instead of one She had read the letter to the family and Rowena had danced away to see to the cleaning and airing of the room by the slave woman Nancy and the boys had rushed abroad in the town to spread the great news for it was a matter of public interest and the public would wonder and not be pleased if not informed Presently Rowena returned all ablush with joyous excitement and begged for a rereading of the letter It was framed thus HONORED MADAM My brother and I have seen your advertisement by chance and beg leave to take the room you offer We are twenty four years of age and twins We are Italians by birth but have lived long in the various countries of Europe and several years in the United States Our names are Luigi and Angelo Capello You desire but one guest but dear madam if you will allow us to pay for two we will not incommode you We shall be down Thursday Italians How romantic Just think Ma there s never been one in this town and everybody will be dying to see them and they re all OURS Think of that Yes I reckon they ll make a grand stir Oh indeed they

Tuesday it s a cruel long time to wait Here comes Judge Driscoll in at the gate He s heard about it I ll go and open the door The judge was full of congratulations and curiosity The letter was read and discussed Soon Justice Robinson arrived with more congratulations and there was a new reading and a new discussion This was the beginning Neighbor after neighbor of both sexes followed and the procession drifted in and out all day and evening and all Wednesday and Thursday The letter was read and reread until it was nearly worn out everybody admired its courtly and gracious tone and smooth and practiced style everybody was sympathetic and excited and the Coopers were steeped in happiness all the while The boats were very uncertain in low water in these primitive times This time the Thursday boat had not arrived at ten at night so the people had waited at the landing all day for nothing they were driven to their homes by a heavy storm without having had a view of the illustrious foreigners Eleven o clock came and the Cooper house was the only one in the town that still had lights burning The rain and thunder were booming yet and the anxious family were still waiting still hoping At last there was a knock at the door and the family jumped to open it Two Negro men entered each carrying a trunk and proceeded upstairs toward the guest room Then entered the twins the handsomest the best dressed the most distinguished looking pair of young fellows the West had ever seen One was a little fairer than the other but otherwise they were exact duplicates CHAPTER six Swimming in Glory Let us endeavor so to live that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar Habit is habit and not to be flung out of the window by any man but coaxed downstairs a step at a time Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar At breakfast in the morning the twins charm of manner and easy and polished bearing made speedy conquest of the family s good graces All constraint and formality quickly disappeared and the friendliest feeling succeeded Aunt Patsy called them by their Christian names almost from the beginning She was full of the keenest curiosity about them and showed it they responded by talking about themselves which pleased her greatly It presently appeared that in their early youth they had known poverty and hardship As the talk wandered along the old lady watched for the right place to drop in a question or two concerning that matter and when she found it she said to the blond twin who was now doing the biographies in his turn while the brunette one rested

none	none	Oh we don t mind it at all madam in our case it was merely misfortune and nobody s fault Our parents were well to do there in Italy and we were their only child We were of the old Florentine nobility Rowena s heart gave a great bound her nostrils expanded and a fine light played in her eyes and when the war broke out my father was on the losing side and had to fly for his life

none	none	My brother and I were ten years old and well educated for that age very studious very fond of our books and well grounded in the German French Spanish and English languages Also we were marvelous musical prodigies if you will allow me to say it it being only the truth Our father survived his misfortunes only a month our mother soon followed him and we were alone in the world Our parents could have made themselves comfortable by exhibiting us as a show and they had many and large offers but the thought revolted their pride and they said they would starve and die first 
1445_139387_000006_000002	train-clean-360	But what they wouldn t consent to do we had to do without the formality of consent 
none	none	We were seized for the debts occasioned by their illness and their funerals and placed among the attractions of a cheap museum in Berlin to earn the liquidation money It took us two years to get out of that slavery We traveled all about Germany receiving no wages and not even our keep We had to be exhibited for nothing and beg our bread Well madam the rest is not of much consequence 
1445_139387_000007_000001	train-clean-360	When we escaped from that slavery at twelve years of age we were in some respects men 
1445_139387_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Experience had taught us some valuable things among others how to take care of ourselves how to avoid and defeat sharks and sharpers and how to conduct our own business for our own profit and without other people s help

none	none	At this point Nancy the slave woman thrust her head in at the door and exclaimed Ole Missus de house is plum jam full o people en dey s jes a spi lin to see de general lemen She indicated the twins with a nod of her head and tucked it back out of sight again It was a proud occasion for the widow and she promised herself high satisfaction in showing off her fine foreign birds before her neighbors and friends simple folk who had hardly ever seen a foreigner of any kind and never one of any distinction or style Yet her feeling was moderate indeed when contrasted with Rowena s 
1445_139387_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Rowena was in the clouds she walked on air this was to be the greatest day the most romantic episode in the colorless history of that dull country town 
none	none	She was to be familiarly near the source of its glory and feel the full flood of it pour over her and about her the other girls could only gaze and envy not partake The widow was ready Rowena was ready so also were the foreigners The party moved along the hall the twins in advance and entered the open parlor door whence issued a low hum of conversation 
1445_139387_000012_000001	train-clean-360	The twins took a position near the door the widow stood at Luigi s side Rowena stood beside Angelo and the march past and the introductions began

none	none	None of them had ever seen a person bearing a title of nobility before and none had been expecting to see one now consequently the title came upon them as a kind of pile driving surprise and caught them unprepared 
1445_139387_000017_000002	train-clean-360	A few tried to rise to the emergency and got out an awkward My lord or Your lordship or something of that sort but the great majority were overwhelmed by the unaccustomed word and its dim and awful associations with gilded courts and stately ceremony and anointed kingship so they only fumbled through the handshake and passed on speechless 
none	none	Now and then as happens at all receptions everywhere a more than ordinary friendly soul blocked the procession and kept it waiting while he inquired how the brothers liked the village and how long they were going to stay and if their family was well and dragged in the weather and hoped it would get cooler soon and all that sort of thing so as to be able to say when he got home I had quite a long talk with them but nobody did or said anything of a regrettable kind and so the great affair went through to the end in a creditable and satisfactory fashion 
1445_139387_000018_000000	train-clean-360	General conversation followed and the twins drifted about from group to group talking easily and fluently and winning approval compelling admiration and achieving favor from all 
none	none	The widow followed their conquering march with a proud eye and every now and then Rowena said to herself with deep satisfaction And to think they are ours all ours There were no idle moments for mother or daughter Eager inquiries concerning the twins were pouring into their enchanted ears all the time each was the constant center of a group of breathless listeners each recognized that she knew now for the first time the real meaning of that great word Glory and perceived the stupendous value of it and understood why men in all ages had been willing to throw away meaner happiness treasure life itself to get a taste of its sublime and supreme joy 
1445_139387_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Napoleon and all his kind stood accounted for and justified 
none	none	When Rowena had at last done all her duty by the people in the parlor she went upstairs to satisfy the longings of an overflow meeting there for the parlor was not big enough to hold all the comers 
1445_139387_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Again she was besieged by eager questioners and again she swam in sunset seas of glory 
1445_139387_000020_000002	train-clean-360	When the forenoon was nearly gone she recognized with a pang that this most splendid episode of her life was almost over that nothing could prolong it that nothing quite its equal could ever fall to her fortune again 
none	none	But never mind it was sufficient unto itself the grand occasion had moved on an ascending scale from the start and was a noble and memorable success If the twins could but do some crowning act now to climax it something usual something startling something to concentrate upon themselves the company s loftiest admiration something in the nature of an electric surprise 
1445_139387_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Here a prodigious slam banging broke out below and everybody rushed down to see 
none	none	It was the twins knocking out a classic four handed piece on the piano in great style Rowena was satisfied satisfied down to the bottom of her heart 
1445_139387_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The young strangers were kept long at the piano 
1445_139387_000022_000001	train-clean-360	The villagers were astonished and enchanted with the magnificence of their performance and could not bear to have them stop 
none	none	All the music that they had ever heard before seemed spiritless prentice work and barren of grace and charm when compared with these intoxicating floods of melodious sound They realized that for once in their lives they were hearing masters CHAPTER seven The Unknown Nymph One of the most striking differences between a cat and a lie is that a cat has only nine lives Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar The company broke up reluctantly and drifted toward their several homes chatting with vivacity and all agreeing that it would be many a long day before Dawson s Landing would see the equal of this one again The twins had accepted several invitations while the reception was in progress and had also volunteered to play some duets at an amateur entertainment for the benefit of a local charity Society was eager to receive them to its bosom Judge Driscoll had the good fortune to secure them for an immediate drive and to be the first to display them in public They entered his buggy with him and were paraded down the main street everybody flocking to the windows and sidewalks to see The judge showed the strangers the new graveyard and the jail and where the richest man lived and the Freemasons hall and the Methodist church and the Presbyterian church and where the Baptist church was going to be when they got some money to build it with and showed them the town hall and the slaughterhouse and got out the independent fire company in uniform and had them put out an imaginary fire then he let them inspect the muskets of the militia company and poured out an exhaustless stream of enthusiasm over all these splendors and seemed very well satisfied with the responses he got for the twins admired his admiration and paid him back the best they could though they could have done better if some fifteen or sixteen hundred thousand previous experiences of this sort in various countries had not already rubbed off a considerable part of the novelty in it The judge laid himself out hospitality to make them have a good time and if there was a defect anywhere it was not his fault He told them a good many humorous anecdotes and always forgot the nub but they were always able to furnish it for these yarns were of a pretty early vintage and they had had many a rejuvenating pull at them before And he told them all about his several dignities and how he had held this and that and the other place of honor or profit and had once been to the legislature and was now president of the Society of Freethinkers He said the society had been in existence four years and already had two members and was firmly established He would call for the brothers in the evening if they would like to attend a meeting of it Accordingly he called for them and on the way he told them all about Pudd nhead Wilson in order that they might get a favorable impression of him in advance and be prepared to like him This scheme succeeded the favorable impression was achieved Later it was confirmed and solidified when Wilson proposed that out of courtesy to the strangers the usual topics be put aside and the hour be devoted to conversation upon ordinary subjects and the cultivation of friendly relations and good fellowship a proposition which was put to vote and carried The hour passed quickly away in lively talk and when it was ended the lonesome and neglected Wilson was richer by two friends than he had been when it began He invited the twins to look in at his lodgings presently after disposing of an intervening engagement and they accepted with pleasure Toward the middle of the evening they found themselves on the road to his house Pudd nhead was at home waiting for them and putting in his time puzzling over a thing which had come under his notice that morning The matter was this He happened to be up very early at dawn in fact and he crossed the hall which divided his cottage through the center and entered a room to get something there The window of the room had no curtains for that side of the house had long been unoccupied and through this window he caught sight of something which surprised and interested him It was a young woman a young woman where properly no young woman belonged for she was in Judge Driscoll s house and in the bedroom over the judge s private study or sitting room This was young Tom Driscoll s bedroom He and the judge the judge s widowed sister missus Pratt and three Negro servants were the only people who belonged in the house Who then might this young lady be The two houses were separated by an ordinary yard with a low fence running back through its middle from the street in front to the lane in the rear The distance was not great and Wilson was able to see the girl very well the window shades of the room she was in being up and the window also The girl had on a neat and trim summer dress patterned in broad stripes of pink and white and her bonnet was equipped with a pink veil She was practicing steps gaits and attitudes apparently she was doing the thing gracefully and was very much absorbed in her work Who could she be and how came she to be in young Tom Driscoll s room Wilson had quickly chosen a position from which he could watch the girl without running much risk of being seen by her and he remained there hoping she would raise her veil and betray her face But she disappointed him After a matter of twenty minutes she disappeared and although he stayed at his post half an hour longer she came no more Toward noon he dropped in at the judge s and talked with missus Pratt about the great event of the day the levee of the distinguished foreigners at Aunt Patsy Cooper s He asked after her nephew Tom and she said he was on his way home and that she was expecting him to arrive a little before night and added that she and the judge were gratified to gather from his letters that he was conducting himself very nicely and creditably at which Wilson winked to himself privately Wilson did not ask if there was a newcomer in the house but he asked questions that would have brought light throwing answers as to that matter if missus Pratt had had any light to throw so he went away satisfied that he knew of things that were going on in her house of which she herself was not aware He was now awaiting for the twins and still puzzling over the problem of who that girl might be and how she happened to be in that young fellow s room at daybreak in the morning CHAPTER eight Marse Tom Tramples His Chance The holy passion of Friendship is of so sweet and steady and loyal and enduring a nature that it will last through a whole lifetime if not asked to lend money Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar Consider well the proportions of things It is better to be a young June bug than an old bird of paradise Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar It is necessary now to hunt up Roxy At the time she was set free and went away chambermaiding she was thirty five She got a berth as second chambermaid on a Cincinnati boat in the New Orleans trade the Grand Mogul A couple of trips made her wonted and easygoing at the work and infatuated her with the stir and adventure and independence of steamboat life Then she was promoted and become head chambermaid She was a favorite with the officers and exceedingly proud of their joking and friendly way with her During eight years she served three parts of the year on that boat and the winters on a Vicksburg packet But now for two months she had had rheumatism in her arms and was obliged to let the washtub alone So she resigned But she was well fixed rich as she would have described it for she had lived a steady life and had banked four dollars every month in New Orleans as a provision for her old age She said in the start that she had put shoes on one bar footed nigger to tromple on her with and that one mistake like that was enough she would be independent of the human race thenceforth forevermore if hard work and economy could accomplish it When the boat touched the levee at New Orleans she bade good by to her comrades on the Grand Mogul and moved her kit ashore But she was back in a hour The bank had gone to smash and carried her four hundred dollars with it She was a pauper and homeless Also disabled bodily at least for the present The officers were full of sympathy for her in her trouble and made up a little purse for her She resolved to go to her birthplace she had friends there among the Negros and the unfortunate always help the unfortunate she was well aware of that those lowly comrades of her youth would not let her starve She took the little local packet at Cairo and now she was on the homestretch Time had worn away her bitterness against her son and she was able to think of him with serenity She put the vile side of him out of her mind and dwelt only on recollections of his occasional acts of kindness to her She gilded and otherwise decorated these and made them very pleasant to contemplate She began to long to see him She would go and fawn upon him slavelike for this would have to be her attitude of course and maybe she would find that time had modified him and that he would be glad to see his long forgotten old nurse and treat her gently That would be lovely that would make her forget her woes and her poverty Her poverty That thought inspired her to add another castle to her dream maybe he would give her a trifle now and then maybe a dollar once a month say any little thing like that would help oh ever so much By the time she reached Dawson s Landing she was her old self again her blues were gone she was in high feather She would get along surely there were many kitchens where the servants would share their meals with her and also steal sugar and apples and other dainties for her to carry home or give her a chance to pilfer them herself which would answer just as well And there was the church She was a more rabid and devoted Methodist than ever and her piety was no sham but was strong and sincere Yes with plenty of creature comforts and her old place in the amen corner in her possession again she would be perfectly happy and at peace thenceforward to the end She went to Judge Driscoll s kitchen first of all She was received there in great form and with vast enthusiasm Her wonderful travels and the strange countries she had seen and the adventures she had had made her a marvel and a heroine of romance The Negros hung enchanted upon a great story of her experiences interrupting her all along with eager questions with laughter exclamations of delight and expressions of applause and she was obliged to confess to herself that if there was anything better in this world than steamboating it was the glory to be got by telling about it The audience loaded her stomach with their dinners and then stole the pantry bare to load up her basket Tom was in saint Louis The servants said he had spent the best part of his time there during the previous two years Roxy came every day and had many talks about the family and its affairs Once she asked why Tom was away so much The ostensible Chambers said De fac is ole marster kin git along better when young marster s away den he kin when he s in de town yes en he love him better too so he gives him fifty dollahs a month No is dat so Chambers you s a jokin ain t you Clah to goodness I ain t Mammy Marse Tom tole me so

Disen whiched him Dissenhurrit him What s dat What do you mean Means he bu sted de will Bu s ted de will He wouldn t ever treat him so Take it back you mis able imitation nigger dat I bore in sorrow en tribbilation Roxy s pet castle an occasional dollar from Tom s pocket was tumbling to ruin before her eyes She could not abide such a disaster as that she couldn t endure the thought of it Her remark amused Chambers Yah yah yah Jes listen to dat If I s imitation what is you Bofe of us is imitation white dat s what we is en pow ful good imitation too Yah yah yah We don t mount to noth n as

self Valet de Chambers you wouldn t talk sich foolishness as dat Well den ole Marse forgive him en fixed up de will ag in do dat satisfy you Yes she was satisfied now and quite happy and sentimental over it She kept coming daily and at last she was told that Tom had come home She began to tremble with emotion and straightway sent to beg him to let his po ole nigger Mammy have jes one sight of him en die for joy Tom was stretched at his lazy ease on a sofa when Chambers brought the petition Time had not modified his ancient detestation of the humble drudge and protector of his boyhood it was still bitter and uncompromising He sat up and bent a severe gaze upon the face of the young fellow whose name he was unconsciously using and whose family rights he was enjoying He maintained the gaze until the victim of it had become satisfactorily pallid with terror then he said What does the old rip want with me The petition was meekly repeated Who gave you permission to come and disturb me with the social attentions of niggers Tom had risen The other young man was trembling now visibly He saw what was coming and bent his head sideways and put up his left arm to shield it Tom rained cuffs upon the head and its shield saying no word the victim received each blow with a beseeching Please Marse Tom oh please Marse Tom Seven blows then Tom said Face the door march He followed behind with one two three solid kicks The last one helped the pure white slave over the door sill and he limped away mopping his eyes with his old ragged sleeve Tom shouted after him Send her in Then he flung himself panting on the sofa again and rasped out the remark He arrived just at the right moment I was full to the brim with bitter thinkings and nobody to take it out of How refreshing it was I feel better Tom s mother entered now closing the door behind her and approached her son with all the wheedling and supplication servilities that fear and interest can impart to the words and attitudes of the born slave She stopped a yard from her boy and made two or three admiring exclamations over his manly stature and general handsomeness and Tom put an arm under his head and hoisted a leg over the sofa back in order to look properly indifferent My lan how you is growed honey Clah to goodness I wouldn t a knowed you Marse Tom Deed I wouldn t Look at me good does you member old Roxy Does you know yo old nigger mammy honey Well now I kin lay down en die in peace ca se I se seed Cut it short Goddamn it cut it short What is it you want You heah dat Jes the same old Marse Tom al ays so gay and funnin wid de ole mammy I uz jes as shore Cut it short I tell you and get along What do you want This was a bitter disappointment Roxy had for so many days nourished and fondled and petted her notion that Tom would be glad to see his old nurse and would make her proud and happy to the marrow with a cordial word or two that it took two rebuffs to convince her that he was not funning and that her beautiful dream was a fond and foolish variety a shabby and pitiful mistake She was hurt to the heart and so ashamed that for a moment she did not quite know what to do or how to act Then her breast began to heave the tears came and in her forlornness she was moved to try that other dream of hers an appeal to her boy s charity and so upon the impulse and without reflection she offered her supplication Oh Marse Tom de po ole mammy is in sich hard luck dese days en she s kinder crippled in de arms and can t work en if you could gimme a dollah on y jes one little dol Tom was on his feet so suddenly that the supplicant was startled into a jump herself A dollar give you a dollar I ve a notion to strangle you Is that your errand here Clear out And be quick about it Roxy backed slowly toward the door When she was halfway she stopped and said mournfully Marse Tom I nussed you when you was a little baby en I raised you all by myself tell you was most a young man en now you is young en rich en I is po en gitt n ole en I come heah b leavin dat you would he p de ole mammy long down de little road dat s lef twix her en de grave en Tom relished this tune less than any that he had preceded it for it began to wake up a sort of echo in his conscience so he interrupted and said with decision though without asperity that he was not in a situation to help her and wasn t going to do it Ain t you ever gwine to he p me Marse Tom No Now go away and don t bother me any more Roxy s head was down in an attitude of humility But now the fires of her old wrongs flamed up in her breast and began to burn fiercely She raised her head slowly till it was well up and at the same time her great frame unconsciously assumed an erect and masterful attitude with all the majesty and grace of her vanished youth in it She raised her finger and punctuated with it You has said de word You has had yo chance en you has trompled it under yo foot When you git another one you ll git down on yo knees en beg for it A cold chill went to Tom s heart he didn t know why for he did not reflect that such words from such an incongruous source and so solemnly delivered could not easily fail of that effect However he did the natural thing he replied with bluster and mockery You ll give me a chance you Perhaps I d better get down on my knees now But in case I don t just for argument s sake what s going to happen pray Dis is what is gwine to happen I s gwine as straight to yo uncle as I kin walk en tell him every las thing I knows bout you Tom s cheek blenched and she saw it Disturbing thoughts began to chase each other through his head How can she know And yet she must have found out she looks it I ve had the will back only three months and am already deep in debt again and moving heaven and earth to save myself from exposure and destruction with a reasonably fair show of getting the thing covered up if I m let alone and now this fiend has gone and found me out somehow or other I wonder how much she knows Oh oh oh it s enough to break a body s heart But I ve got to humor her there s no other way Then he worked up a rather sickly sample of a gay laugh and a hollow chipperness of manner and said Well well Roxy dear old friends like you and me mustn t quarrel Here s your dollar now tell me what you know He held out the wildcat bill she stood as she was and made no movement It was her turn to scorn persuasive foolery now and she did not waste it She said with a grim implacability in voice and manner which made Tom almost realize that even a former slave can remember for ten minutes insults and injuries returned for compliments and flatteries received and can also enjoy taking revenge for them when the opportunity offers What does I know I ll tell you what I knows I knows enough to bu saint dat will to flinders en more mind you more Tom was aghast More he said What do you call more Where s there any room for more Roxy laughed a mocking laugh and said scoffingly with a toss of her head and her hands on her hips Yes oh I reckon co se you d like to know wid yo po little ole rag dollah What you reckon I s gwine to tell you for you ain t got no money I s gwine to tell yo uncle en I ll do it dis minute too he ll gimme FIVE dollahs for de news en mighty glad too She swung herself around disdainfully and started away Tom was in a panic He seized her skirts and implored her to wait She turned and said loftily Look a heah what uz it I tole you You you I don t remember anything What was it you told me I tole you dat de next time I give you a chance you d git down on yo knees en beg for it Tom was stupefied for a moment He was panting with excitement Then he said Oh Roxy you wouldn t require your young master to do such a horrible thing You can t mean it I ll let you know mighty quick whether I means it or not You call me names en as good as spit on me when I comes here po en ornery en umble to praise you for bein growed up so fine and handsome en tell you how I used to nuss you en tend you en watch you when you uz sick en hadn t no mother but me in de whole worl en beg you to give de po ole nigger a dollah for to get her som n to eat en you call me names names dad blame you Yassir I gives you jes one chance mo and dat s now en it las on y half a second you hear Tom slumped to his knees and began to beg saying You see I m begging and it s honest begging too Now tell me Roxy tell me The heir of two centuries of unatoned insult and outrage looked down on him and seemed to drink in deep draughts of satisfaction Then she said Fine nice young white general l man kneelin down to a nigger wench I s wanted to see dat jes once befo I s called Now Gabr el blow de hawn I s ready Git up Tom did it He said humbly Now Roxy don t punish me any more I deserved what I ve got but be good and let me off with that Don t go to uncle Tell me I ll give you the five dollars Yes I bet you will en you won t stop dah nuther But I ain t gwine to tell you heah Good gracious no Is you feared o de ha nted house N no Well den you come to de ha nted house bout ten or leven tonight en climb up de ladder ca se de sta rsteps is broke down en you ll find me I s a roostin in de ha nted house ca se I can t ford to roos nowher s else She started toward the door but stopped and said Gimme de dollah bill He gave it to her She examined it and said H m like enough de bank s bu sted She started again but halted again Has you got any whisky Yes a little Fetch it He ran to his room overhead and brought down a bottle which was two thirds full She tilted it up and took a drink Her eyes sparkled with satisfaction and she tucked the bottle under her shawl saying It s prime I ll take it along Tom humbly held the door for her and she marched out as grim and erect as a grenadier CHAPTER nine Tom Practices Sycophancy Why is it that we rejoice at a birth and grieve at a funeral It is because we are not the person involved Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar It is easy to find fault if one has that disposition There was once a man who not being able to find any other fault with his coal complained that there were too many prehistoric toads in it Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar Tom flung himself on the sofa and put his throbbing head in his hands and rested his elbows on his knees He rocked himself back and forth and moaned I ve knelt to a nigger wench he muttered I thought I had struck the deepest depths of degradation before but oh dear it was nothing to this Well there is one consolation such as it is I ve struck bottom this time there s nothing lower But that was a hasty conclusion At ten that night he climbed the ladder in the haunted house pale weak and wretched Roxy was standing in the door of one of the rooms waiting for she had heard him This was a two story log house which had acquired the reputation a few years ago of being haunted and that was the end of its usefulness Nobody would live in it afterward or go near it by night and most people even gave it a wide berth in the daytime As it had no competition it was called the haunted house It was getting crazy and ruinous now from long neglect It stood three hundred yards beyond Pudd nhead Wilson s house with nothing between but vacancy It was the last house in the town at that end Tom followed Roxy into the room She had a pile of clean straw in the corner for a bed some cheap but well kept clothing was hanging on the wall there was a tin lantern freckling the floor with little spots of light and there were various soap and candle boxes scattered about which served for chairs The two sat down Roxy said Now den I ll tell you straight off en I ll begin to k leck de money later on I ain t in no hurry What does you reckon I s gwine to tell you Well you you oh Roxy don t make it too hard for me Come right out and tell me you ve found out somehow what a shape I m in on account of dissipation and foolishness Disposition en foolishness NO sir dat ain t it Dat jist ain t nothin at all longside o what I knows Tom stared at her and said Why Roxy what do you mean She rose and gloomed above him like a Fate I means dis en it s de Lord s truth You ain t no more kin to ole Marse Driscoll den I is dat s what I means and her eyes flamed with triumph What Yassir en dat ain t all You s a nigger bawn a nigger and a slave en you s a nigger en a slave dis minute en

Driscoll en yo s name s Valet de Chambers en you ain t GOT no fambly name beca se niggers don t have em Tom sprang up and seized a billet of wood and raised it but his mother only laughed at him and said Set down you pup Does you think you kin skyer me It ain t in you nor de likes of you I reckon you d shoot me in de back maybe if you got a chance for dat s jist yo style I knows you throo en throo but I don t mind gitt n killed beca se all dis is down in writin and it s in safe hands too en de man dat s got it knows whah to look for de right man when I gits killed Oh bless yo soul if you puts yo mother up for as big a fool as you is you s pow ful mistaken I kin tell you Now den you set still en behave yo self en don t you git up ag in till I tell you Tom fretted and chafed awhile in a whirlwind of disorganizing sensations and emotions and finally said with something like settled conviction The whole thing is moonshine now then go ahead and do your worst I m done with you Roxy made no answer She took the lantern and started for the door Tom was in a cold panic in a moment Come back come back he wailed I didn t mean it Roxy I take it all back and I ll never say it again Please come back Roxy The woman stood a moment then she said gravely Dat s one thing you s got to stop Valet de Chambers You can t call me Roxy same as if you was my equal Chillen don t speak to dey mammies like dat You ll call me ma or mammy dat s what you ll call me leastways when de ain t nobody aroun Say it It cost Tom a struggle but he got it out Dat s all right don t you ever forgit it ag in if you

I ll tramp as straight to de judge as I kin walk en tell him who you is en prove it Does you b lieve me when I says dat Oh groaned Tom I more than believe it I know it Roxy knew her conquest was complete She could have proved nothing to anybody and her threat of writings was a lie but she knew the person she was dealing with and had made both statements without any doubt as to the effect they would produce She went and sat down on her candle box and the pride and pomp of her victorious attitude made it a throne She said Now den Chambers we s gwine to talk business en dey ain t gwine to be no mo foolishness In de fust place you gits fifty dollahs a month you s gwine to han over half of it to yo ma Plank it out But Tom had only six dollars in the world He gave her that and promised to start fair on next month s pension Chambers how much is you in debt Tom shuddered and said Nearly three hundred dollars How is you gwine to pay it Tom groaned out Oh I don t know don t ask me such awful questions But she stuck to her point until she wearied a confession out of him he had been prowling about in disguise stealing small valuables from private houses in fact he made a good deal of a raid on his fellow villagers a fortnight before when he was supposed to be in saint Louis but he doubted if he had sent away enough stuff to realize the required amount and was afraid to make a further venture in the present excited state of the town His mother approved of his conduct and offered to help but this frightened him He tremblingly ventured to say that if she would retire from the town he should feel better and safer and could hold his head higher and was going on to make an argument but she interrupted and surprised him pleasantly by saying she was ready it didn t make any difference to her where she stayed so that she got her share of the pension regularly She said she would not go far and would call at the haunted house once a month for her money Then she said I don t hate you so much now but I ve hated you a many a year and anybody would Didn t I change you off en give you a good fambly en a good name en made you a white general l man en rich wid store clothes on en what did I git for it You despised me all de time en was al ays sayin mean hard things to me befo folks en wouldn t ever let me forgit I s a nigger en en She fell to sobbing and broke down Tom said But you know I didn t know you were my mother and besides Well nemmine bout dat now let it go I s gwine to fo git it Then she added fiercely En don t ever make me remember it ag in or you ll be sorry I tell you When they were parting Tom said in the most persuasive way he could command Ma would you mind telling me who was my father He had supposed he was asking an embarrassing question He was mistaken Roxy drew herself up with a proud toss of her head and said Does I mine tellin you No dat I don t You ain t got no casion to be shame o yo father I kin tell you He wuz de highest quality in dis whole town ole Virginny stock Fust famblies he wuz Jes as good stock as de Driscolls en de Howards de bes day dey ever seed She put on a little prouder air if possible and added impressively Does you member Cunnel Cecil Burleigh Essex dat died de same year yo young Marse Tom Driscoll s pappy died en all de Masons en Odd Fellers en Churches turned out en give him de bigges funeral dis town ever seed Dat s de man Under the inspiration of her soaring complacency the departed graces of her earlier days returned to her and her bearing took to itself a dignity and state that might have passed for queenly if her surroundings had been a little more in keeping with it Dey ain t another nigger in dis town dat s as highbawn as you is Now den go long En jes you hold yo head up as high as you want to you has de right en dat I kin swah CHAPTER ten The Nymph Revealed All say How hard it is that we have to die a strange complaint to come from the mouths of people who have had to live Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar When angry count four when very angry swear Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar Every now and then after Tom went to bed he had sudden wakings out of his sleep and his first thought was Oh joy it was all a dream Then he laid himself heavily down again with a groan and the muttered words A nigger I am a nigger Oh I wish I was dead He woke at dawn with one more repetition of this horror and then he resolved to meddle no more with that treacherous sleep He began to think Sufficiently bitter thinkings they were They wandered along something after this fashion Why were niggers and whites made What crime did the uncreated first nigger commit that the curse of birth was decreed for him And why is this awful difference made between white and black How hard the nigger s fate seems this morning yet until last night such a thought never entered my head He sighed and groaned an hour or more away Then Chambers came humbly in to say that breakfast was nearly ready Tom blushed scarlet to see this aristocratic white youth cringe to him a nigger and call him Young Marster He said roughly Get out of my sight and when the youth was gone he muttered He has done me no harm poor wretch but he is an eyesore to me now for he is Driscoll the young gentleman and I am a oh I wish I was dead A gigantic eruption like that of Krakatoa a few years ago with the accompanying earthquakes tidal waves and clouds of volcanic dust changes the face of the surrounding landscape beyond recognition bringing down the high lands elevating the low making fair lakes where deserts had been and deserts where green prairies had smiled before The tremendous catastrophe which had befallen Tom had changed his moral landscape in much the same way Some of his low places he found lifted to ideals some of his ideas had sunk to the valleys and lay there with the sackcloth and ashes of pumice stone and sulphur on their ruined heads For days he wandered in lonely places thinking thinking thinking trying to get his bearings It was new work If he met a friend he found that the habit of a lifetime had in some mysterious way vanished his arm hung limp instead of involuntarily extending the hand for a shake It was the nigger in him asserting its humility and he blushed and was abashed And the nigger in him was surprised when the white friend put out his hand for a shake with him He found the nigger in him involuntarily giving the road on the sidewalk to a white rowdy and loafer When Rowena the dearest thing his heart knew the idol of his secret worship invited him in the nigger in him made an embarrassed excuse and was afraid to enter and sit with the dread white folks on equal terms The nigger in him went shrinking and skulking here and there and yonder and fancying it saw suspicion and maybe detection in all faces tones and gestures So strange and uncharacteristic was Tom s conduct that people noticed it and turned to look after him when he passed on and when he glanced back as he could not help doing in spite of his best resistance and caught that puzzled expression in a person s face it gave him a sick feeling and he took himself out of view as quickly as he could He presently came to have a hunted sense and a hunted look and then he fled away to the hilltops and the solitudes He said to himself that the curse of Ham was upon him He dreaded his meals the nigger in him was ashamed to sit at the white folk s table and feared discovery all the time and once when Judge Driscoll said What s the matter with you You look as meek as a nigger he felt as secret murderers are said to feel when the accuser says Thou art the man Tom said he was not well and left the table His ostensible aunt s solicitudes and endearments were become a terror to him and he avoided them And all the time hatred of his ostensible uncle was steadily growing in his heart for he said to himself He is white and I am his chattel his property his goods and he can sell me just as he could his dog For as much as a week after this Tom imagined that his character had undergone a pretty radical change But that was because he did not know himself In several ways his opinions were totally changed and would never go back to what they were before but the main structure of his character was not changed and could not be changed One or two very important features of it were altered and in time effects would result from this if opportunity offered effects of a quite serious nature too Under the influence of a great mental and moral upheaval his character and his habits had taken on the appearance of complete change but after a while with the subsidence of the storm both began to settle toward their former places He dropped gradually back into his old frivolous and easygoing ways and conditions of feeling and manner of speech and no familiar of his could have detected anything in him that differentiated him from the weak and careless Tom of other days The theft raid which he had made upon the village turned out better than he had ventured to hope It produced the sum necessary to pay his gaming debts and saved him from exposure to his uncle and another smashing of the will He and his mother learned to like each other fairly well She couldn t love him as yet because there warn t nothing to him as she expressed it but her nature needed something or somebody to rule over and he was better than nothing Her strong character and aggressive and commanding ways compelled Tom s admiration in spite of the fact that he got more illustrations of them than he needed for his comfort However as a rule her conversation was made up of racy tales about the privacies of the chief families of the town for she went harvesting among their kitchens every time she came to the village and Tom enjoyed this It was just in his line She always collected her half of his pension punctually and he was always at the haunted house to have a chat with her on these occasions Every now and then she paid him a visit there on between days also Occasions he would run up to saint Louis for a few weeks and at last temptation caught him again He won a lot of money but lost it and with it a deal more besides which he promised to raise as soon as possible For this purpose he projected a new raid on his town He never meddled with any other town for he was afraid to venture into houses whose ins and outs he did not know and the habits of whose households he was not acquainted with He arrived at the haunted house in disguise on the Wednesday before the advent of the twins after writing his Aunt Pratt that he would not arrive until two days after and laying in hiding there with his mother until toward daylight Friday morning when he went to his uncle s house and entered by the back way with his own key and slipped up to his room where he could have the use of the mirror and toilet articles He had a suit of girl s clothes with him in a bundle as a disguise for his raid and was wearing a suit of his mother s clothing with black gloves and veil By dawn he was tricked out for his raid but he caught a glimpse of Pudd nhead Wilson through the window over the way and knew that Pudd nhead had caught a glimpse of him So he entertained Wilson with some airs and graces and attitudes for a while then stepped out of sight and resumed the other disguise and by and by went down and out the back way and started downtown to reconnoiter the scene of his intended labors But he was ill at ease He had changed back to Roxy s dress with the stoop of age added to the disguise so that Wilson would not bother himself about a humble old women leaving a neighbor s house by the back way in the early morning in case he was still spying But supposing Wilson had seen him leave and had thought it suspicious and had also followed him The thought made Tom cold He gave up the raid for the day and hurried back to the haunted house by the obscurest route he knew His mother was gone but she came back by and by with the news of the grand reception at Patsy Cooper s and soon persuaded him that the opportunity was like a special Providence it was so inviting and perfect So he went raiding after all and made a nice success of it while everybody was gone to Patsy Cooper s Success gave him nerve and even actual intrepidity insomuch indeed that after he had conveyed his harvest to his mother in a back alley he went to the reception himself and added several of the valuables of that house to his takings After this long digression we have now arrived once more at the point where Pudd nhead Wilson while waiting for the arrival of the twins on that same Friday evening sat puzzling over the strange apparition of that morning a girl in young Tom Driscoll s bedroom fretting and guessing and puzzling over it and wondering who the shameless creature might be CHAPTER eleven Pudd nhead s Thrilling Discovery There are three infallible ways of pleasing an author and the three form a rising scale of compliment one to tell him you have read one of his books two to tell him you have read all of his books three to ask him to let you read the manuscript of his forthcoming book No one admits you to his respect No two admits you to his admiration No three carries you clear into his heart Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar As to the Adjective when in doubt strike it out Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar The twins arrived presently and talk began It flowed along chattily and sociably and under its influence the new friendship gathered ease and strength Wilson got out his Calendar by request and read a passage or two from it which the twins praised quite cordially This pleased the author so much that he complied gladly when they asked him to lend them a batch of the work to read at home In the course of their wide travels they had found out that there are three sure ways of pleasing an author they were now working the best of the three There was an interruption now Young Driscoll appeared and joined the party He pretended to be seeing the distinguished strangers for the first time when they rose to shake hands but this was only a blind as he had already had a glimpse of them at the reception while robbing the house The twins made mental note that he was smooth faced and rather handsome and smooth and undulatory in his movements graceful in fact Angelo thought he had a good eye Luigi thought there was something veiled and sly about it Angelo thought he had a pleasant free and easy way of talking Luigi thought it was more so than was agreeable Angelo thought he was a sufficiently nice young man Luigi reserved his decision Tom s first contribution to the conversation was a question which he had put to Wilson a hundred times before It was always cheerily and good natured put and always inflicted a little pang for it touched a secret sore but this time the pang was sharp since strangers were present Well how does the law come on Had a case yet Wilson bit his lip but answered No not yet with as much indifference as he could assume Judge Driscoll had generously left the law feature out of Wilson s biography which he had furnished to the twins Young Tom laughed pleasantly and said Wilson s a lawyer gentlemen but he doesn t practice now The sarcasm bit but Wilson kept himself under control and said without passion I don t practice it is true It is true that I have never had a case and have had to earn a poor living for twenty years as an expert accountant in a town where I can t get a hold of a set of books to untangle as often as I should like But it is also true that I did myself well for the practice of the law By the time I was your age Tom I had chosen a profession and was soon competent to enter upon it Tom winced I never got a chance to try my hand at it and I may never get a chance and yet if I ever do get it I shall be found ready for I have kept up my law studies all these years That s it that s good grit I like to see it I ve a notion to throw all my business your way My business and your law practice ought to make a pretty gay team Dave and the young fellow laughed again If you will throw Wilson had thought of the girl in Tom s bedroom and was going to say If you will throw the surreptitious and disreputable part of your business my way it may amount to something but thought better of it and said However this matter doesn t fit well in a general conversation All right we ll change the subject I guess you were about to give me another dig anyway so I m willing to change How s the Awful Mystery flourishing these days Wilson s got a scheme for driving plain window glass panes out of the market by decorating it with greasy finger marks and getting rich by selling it at famine prices to the crowned heads over in Europe to outfit their palaces with Fetch it out Dave Wilson brought three of his glass strips and said I get the subject to pass the fingers of his right hand through his hair so as to get a little coating of the natural oil on them and then press the balls of them on the glass A fine and delicate print of the lines in the skin results and is permanent if it doesn t come in contact with something able to rub it off You begin Tom Why I think you took my finger marks once or twice before Yes but you were a little boy the last time only about twelve years old That s so Of course I ve changed entirely since then and variety is what the crowned heads want I guess He passed his fingers through his crop of short hair and pressed them one at a time on the glass Angelo made a print of his fingers on another glass and Luigi followed with a third Wilson marked the glasses with names and dates and put them away Tom gave one of his little laughs and said I thought I wouldn t say anything but if variety is what you are after you have wasted a piece of glass The hand print of one twin is the same as the hand print of the fellow twin Well it s done now and I like to have them both anyway said Wilson returned to his place But look here Dave said Tom you used to tell people s fortunes too when you took their finger marks Dave s just an all round genius a genius of the first water gentlemen a great scientist running to seed here in this village a prophet with the kind of honor that prophets generally get at home for here they don t give shucks for his scientifics and they call his skull a notion factory hey Dave ain t it so But never mind he ll make his mark someday finger mark you know he he But really you want to let him take a shy at your palms once it s worth twice the price of admission or your money s returned at the door Why he ll read your wrinkles as easy as a book and not only tell you fifty or sixty things that s going to happen to you but fifty or sixty thousand that ain t Come Dave show the gentlemen what an inspired jack at all science we ve got in this town and don t know it Wilson winced under this nagging and not very courteous chaff and the twins suffered with him and for him They rightly judged now that the best way to relieve him would be to take the thing in earnest and treat it with respect ignoring Tom s rather overdone raillery so Luigi said We have seen something of palmistry in our wanderings and know very well what astonishing things it can do If it isn t a science and one of the greatest of them too I don t know what its other name ought to be In the Orient Tom looked surprised and incredulous He said That juggling a science But really you ain t serious are you Yes entirely so Four years ago we had our hands read out to us as if our plans had been covered with print Well do you mean to say there was actually anything in it asked Tom his incredulity beginning to weaken a little There was this much in it said Angelo what was told us of our characters was minutely exact we could have not have bettered it ourselves Next two or three memorable things that have happened to us were laid bare things which no one present but ourselves could have known about Why it s rank sorcery exclaimed Tom who was now becoming very much interested And how did they make out with what was going to happen to you in the future On the whole quite fairly said Luigi Two or three of the most striking things foretold have happened since much the most striking one of all happened within that same year Some of the minor prophesies have come true some of the minor and some of the major ones have not been fulfilled yet and of course may never be still I should be more surprised if they failed to arrive than if they didn t Tom was entirely sobered and profoundly impressed He said apologetically Dave I wasn t meaning to belittle that science I was only chaffing chattering I reckon I d better say I wish you would look at their palms Come won t you Why certainly if you want me to but you know I ve had no chance to become an expert and don t claim to be one When a past event is somewhat prominently recorded in the palm I can generally detect that but minor ones often escape me not always of course but often but I haven t much confidence in myself when it comes to reading the future I am talking as if palmistry was a daily study with me but that is not so I haven t examined half a dozen hands in the last half dozen years you see the people got to joking about it and I stopped to let the talk die down I ll tell you what we ll do Count Luigi I ll make a try at your past and if I have any success there no on the whole I ll let the future alone that s really the affair of an expert He took Luigi s hand Tom said Wait don t look yet Dave Count Luigi here s paper and pencil Set down that thing that you said was the most striking one that was foretold to you and happened less than a year afterward and give it to me so I can see if Dave finds it in your hand Luigi wrote a line privately and folded up the piece of paper and handed it to Tom saying I ll tell you when to look at it if he finds it Wilson began to study Luigi s palm tracing life lines heart lines head lines and so on and noting carefully their relations with the cobweb of finer and more delicate marks and lines that enmeshed them on all sides he felt of the fleshy cushion at the base of the thumb and noted its shape he felt of the fleshy side of the hand between the wrist and the base of the little finger and noted its shape also he painstakingly examined the fingers observing their form proportions and natural manner of disposing themselves when in repose All this process was watched by the three spectators with absorbing interest their heads bent together over Luigi s palm and nobody disturbing the stillness with a word Wilson now entered upon a close survey of the palm again and his revelations began He mapped out Luigi s character and disposition his tastes aversions proclivities ambitions and eccentricities in a way which sometimes made Luigi wince and the others laugh but both twins declared that the chart was artistically drawn and was correct Next Wilson took up Luigi s history He proceeded cautiously and with hesitation now moving his finger slowly along the great lines of the palm and now and then halting it at a star or some such landmark and examining that neighborhood minutely He proclaimed one or two past events Luigi confirmed his correctness and the search went on Presently Wilson glanced up suddenly with a surprised expression Here is a record of an incident which you would perhaps not wish me to Bring it out said Luigi good naturedly I promise you sha n t embarrass me But Wilson still hesitated and did not seem quite to know what to do Then he said I think it is too delicate a matter to to I believe I would rather write it or whisper it to you and let you decide for yourself whether you want it talked out or not That will answer said Luigi Write it Wilson wrote something on a slip of paper and handed it to Luigi who read it to himself and said to Tom Unfold your slip and read it mister Driscoll Tom said IT WAS PROPHESIED THAT I WOULD KILL A MAN IT CAME TRUE BEFORE THE YEAR WAS OUT Tom added Great Scott Luigi handed Wilson s paper to Tom and said Now read this one Tom read YOU HAVE KILLED SOMEONE BUT WHETHER MAN WOMAN OR CHILD I DO NOT MAKE OUT Caesar s ghost commented Tom with astonishment It beats anything that was ever heard of Why a man s own hand is his deadliest enemy Just think of that a man s own hand keeps a record of the deepest and fatalest secrets of his life and is treacherously ready to expose himself to any black magic stranger that comes along But what do you let a person look at your hand for with that awful thing printed on it Oh said Luigi reposefully I don t mind it I killed the man for good reasons and I don t regret it What were the reasons Well he needed killing I ll tell you why he did it since he won t say himself said Angelo warmly He did it to save my life that s what he did it for So it was a noble act and not a thing to be hid in the dark So it was so it was said Wilson To do such a thing to save a brother s life is a great and fine action Now come said Luigi it is very pleasant to hear you say these things but for unselfishness or heroism or magnanimity the circumstances won t stand scrutiny You overlook one detail suppose I hadn t saved Angelo s life what would have become of mine If I had let the man kill him wouldn t he have killed me too I saved my own life you see Yes that is your way of talking said Angelo but I know you I don t believe you thought of yourself at all I keep that weapon yet that Luigi killed the man with and I ll show it to you sometime That incident makes it interesting and it had a history before it came into Luigi s hands which adds to its interest It was given to Luigi by a great Indian prince the Gaikowar of Baroda and it had been in his family two or three centuries It killed a good many disagreeable people who troubled the hearthstone at one time or another It isn t much too look at except it isn t shaped like other knives or dirks or whatever it may be called here I ll draw it for you He took a sheet of paper and made a rapid sketch There it is a broad and murderous blade with edges like a razor for sharpness The devices engraved on it are the ciphers or names of its long line of possessors I had Luigi s name added in Roman letters myself with our coat of arms as you see You notice what a curious handle the thing has It is solid ivory polished like a mirror and is four or five inches long round and as thick as a large man s wrist with the end squared off flat for your thumb to rest on for you grasp it with your thumb resting on the blunt end so and lift it along and strike downward The Gaikowar showed us how the thing was done when he gave it to Luigi and before that night was ended Luigi had used the knife and the Gaikowar was a man short by reason of it The sheath is magnificently ornamented with gems of great value You will find a sheath more worth looking at than the knife itself of course Tom said to himself It s lucky I came here I would have sold that knife for a song I supposed the jewels were glass But go on don t stop said Wilson Our curiosity is up now to hear about the homicide Tell us about that Well briefly the knife was to blame for that all around A native servant slipped into our room in the palace in the night to kill us and steal the knife on account of the fortune encrusted on its sheath without a doubt Luigi had it under his pillow we were in bed together There was a dim night light burning I was asleep but Luigi was awake and he thought he detected a vague form nearing the bed He slipped the knife out of the sheath and was ready and unembarrassed by hampering bedclothes for the weather was hot and we hadn t any Suddenly that native rose at the bedside and bent over me with his right hand lifted and a dirk in it aimed at my throat but Luigi grabbed his wrist pulled him downward and drove his own knife into the man s neck That is the whole story Wilson and Tom drew deep breaths and after some general chat about the tragedy Pudd nhead said taking Tom s hand Now Tom I ve never had a look at your palms as it happens perhaps you ve got some little questionable privacies that need hel lo Tom had snatched away his hand and was looking a good deal confused Why he s blushing said Luigi Tom darted an ugly look at him and said sharply Well if I am it ain t because I m a murderer Luigi s dark face flushed but before he could speak or move Tom added with anxious haste Oh I beg a thousand pardons I didn t mean that it was out before I thought and I m very very sorry you must forgive me Wilson came to the rescue and smoothed things down as well as he could and in fact was entirely successful as far as the twins were concerned for they felt sorrier for the affront put upon him by his guest s outburst of ill manners than for the insult offered to Luigi But the success was not so pronounced with the offender Tom tried to seem at his ease and he went through the motions fairly well but at bottom he felt resentful toward all the three witnesses of his exhibition in fact he felt so annoyed at them for having witnessed it and noticed it that he almost forgot to feel annoyed at himself for placing it before them However something presently happened which made him almost comfortable and brought him nearly back to a state of charity and friendliness This was a little spat between the twins not much of a spat but still a spat and before they got far with it they were in a decided condition of irritation while pretending to be actuated by more respectable motives By his help the fire got warmed up to the blazing point and he might have had the happiness of seeing the flames show up in another moment but for the interruption of a knock on the door an interruption which fretted him as much as it gratified Wilson Wilson opened the door The visitor was a good natured ignorant energetic middle aged Irishman named John Buckstone who was a great politician in a small way and always took a large share in public matters of every sort One of the town s chief excitements just now was over the matter of rum There was a strong rum party and a strong anti rum party Buckstone was training with the rum party and he had been sent to hunt up the twins and invite them to attend a mass meeting of that faction He delivered his errand and said the clans were already gathering in the big hall over the market house Luigi accepted the invitation cordially Angelo less cordially since he disliked crowds and did not drink the powerful intoxicants of America In fact he was even a teetotaler sometimes when it was judicious to be one The twins left with Buckstone and Tom Driscoll joined the company with them uninvited In the distance one could see a long wavering line of torches drifting down the main street and could hear the throbbing of the bass drum the clash of cymbals the squeaking of a fife or two and the faint roar of remote hurrahs The tail end of this procession was climbing the market house stairs when the twins arrived in its neighborhood when they reached the hall it was full of people torches smoke noise and enthusiasm They were conducted to the platform by Buckstone Tom Driscoll still following and were delivered to the chairman in the midst of a prodigious explosion of welcome When the noise had moderated a little the chair proposed that our illustrious guests be at once elected by complimentary acclamation to membership in our ever glorious organization the paradise of the free and the perdition of the slave This eloquent discharge opened the floodgates of enthusiasm again and the election was carried with thundering unanimity Then arose a storm of cries Wet them down Wet them down Give them a drink Glasses of whisky were handed to the twins Luigi waves his aloft then brought it to his lips but Angelo set his down There was another storm of cries What s the matter with the other one What is the blond one going back on us for Explain Explain The chairman inquired and then reported We have made an unfortunate mistake gentlemen I find that the Count Angelo Capello is opposed to our creed is a teetotaler in fact and was not intending to apply for membership with us He desires that we reconsider the vote by which he was elected What is the pleasure of the house There was a general burst of laughter plentifully accented with whistlings and catcalls but the energetic use of the gavel presently restored something like order Then a man spoke from the crowd and said that while he was very sorry that the mistake had been made it would not be possible to rectify it at the present meeting According to the bylaws it must go over to the next regular meeting for action He would not offer a motion as none was required He desired to apologize to the gentlemen in the name of the house and begged to assure him that as far as it might lie in the power of the Sons of Liberty his temporary membership in the order would be made pleasant to him This speech was received with great applause mixed with cries of That s the talk He s a good fellow anyway if he is a teetotaler Drink his health Give him a rouser and no heeltaps Glasses were handed around and everybody on the platform drank Angelo s health while the house bellowed forth in song For he s a jolly good fel low For he s a jolly good fel low For he s a jolly good fe el low Which nobody can deny Tom Driscoll drank It was his second glass for he had drunk Angelo s the moment that Angelo had set it down The two drinks made him very merry almost idiotically so and he began to take a most lively and prominent part in the proceedings particularly in the music and catcalls and side remarks The chairman was still standing at the front the twins at his side The extraordinarily close resemblance of the brothers to each other suggested a witticism to Tom Driscoll and just as the chairman began a speech he skipped forward and said with an air of tipsy confidence to the audience Boys I move that he keeps still and lets this human philopena snip you out a speech The descriptive aptness of the phrase caught the house and a mighty burst of laughter followed Luigi s southern blood leaped to the boiling point in a moment under the sharp humiliation of this insult delivered in the presence of four hundred strangers It was not in the young man s nature to let the matter pass or to delay the squaring of the account He took a couple of strides and halted behind the unsuspecting joker Then he drew back and delivered a kick of such titanic vigor that it lifted Tom clear over the footlights and landed him on the heads of the front row of the Sons of Liberty Even a sober person does not like to have a human being emptied on him when he is not doing any harm a person who is not sober cannot endure such an attention at all The nest of Sons of Liberty that Driscoll landed in had not a sober bird in it in fact there was probably not an entirely sober one in the auditorium Driscoll was promptly and indignantly flung on the heads of Sons in the next row and these Sons passed him on toward the rear and then immediately began to pummel the front row Sons who had passed him to them This course was strictly followed by bench after bench as Driscoll traveled in his tumultuous and airy flight toward the door so he left behind him an ever lengthening wake of raging and plunging and fighting and swearing humanity Down went group after group of torches and presently above the deafening clatter of the gavel roar of angry voices and crash of succumbing benches rose the paralyzing cry of fire The fighting ceased instantly the cursing ceased for one distinctly defined moment there was a dead hush a motionless calm where the tempest had been then with one impulse the multitude awoke to life and energy again and went surging and struggling and swaying this way and that its outer edges melting away through windows and doors and gradually lessening the pressure and relieving the mass The fireboys were never on hand so suddenly before for there was no distance to go this time their quarters being in the rear end of the market house There was an engine company and a hook and ladder company Half of each was composed of rummies and the other half of anti rummies after the moral and political share and share alike fashion of the frontier town of the period Enough anti rummies were loafing in quarters to man the engine and the ladders In two minutes they had their red shirts and helmets on they never stirred officially in unofficial costume and as the mass meeting overhead smashed through the long row of windows and poured out upon the roof of the arcade the deliverers were ready for them with a powerful stream of water which washed some of them off the roof and nearly drowned the rest But water was preferable to fire and still the stampede from the windows continued and still the pitiless drenching assailed it until the building was empty then the fireboys mounted to the hall and flooded it with water enough to annihilate forty times as much fire as there was there for a village fire company does not often get a chance to show off and so when it does get a chance it makes the most of it Such citizens of that village as were of a thoughtful and judicious temperament did not insure against fire they insured against the fire company CHAPTER twelve The Shame of Judge Driscoll Courage is resistance to fear mastery of fear not absence of fear Except a creature be part coward it is not a compliment to say it is brave it is merely a loose misapplication of the word Consider the flea incomparably the bravest of all the creatures of God if ignorance of fear were courage Whether you are asleep or awake he will attack you caring nothing for the fact that in bulk and strength you are to him as are the massed armies of the earth to a sucking child he lives both day and night and all days and nights in the very lap of peril and the immediate presence of death and yet is no more afraid than is the man who walks the streets of a city that was threatened by an earthquake ten centuries before When we speak of Clive Nelson and Putnam as men who didn t know what fear was we ought always to add the flea and put him at the head of the procession Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar Judge Driscoll was in bed and asleep by ten o clock on Friday night and he was up and gone a fishing before daylight in the morning with his friend Pembroke Howard These two had been boys together in Virginia when that state still ranked as the chief and most imposing member of the Union and they still coupled the proud and affectionate adjective old with her name when they spoke of her In Missouri a recognized superiority attached to any person who hailed from Old Virginia and this superiority was exalted to supremacy when a person of such nativity could also prove descent from the First Families of that great commonwealth The Howards and Driscolls were of this aristocracy In their eyes it was a nobility It had its unwritten laws and they were as clearly defined and as strict as any that could be found among the printed statutes of the land The F F V was born a gentleman his highest duty in life was to watch over that great inheritance and keep it unsmirched He must keep his honor spotless Those laws were his chart his course was marked out on it if he swerved from it by so much as half a point of the compass it meant shipwreck to his honor that is to say degradation from his rank as a gentleman These laws required certain things of him which his religion might forbid then his religion must yield the laws could not be relaxed to accommodate religions or anything else Honor stood first and the laws defined what it was and wherein it differed in certain details from honor as defined by church creeds and by the social laws and customs of some of the minor divisions of the globe that had got crowded out when the sacred boundaries of Virginia were staked out If Judge Driscoll was the recognized first citizen of Dawson s Landing Pembroke Howard was easily its recognized second citizen He was called the great lawyer an earned title He and Driscoll were of the same age a year or two past sixty Although Driscoll was a freethinker and Howard a strong and determined Presbyterian their warm intimacy suffered no impairment in consequence They were men whose opinions were their own property and not subject to revision and amendment suggestion or criticism by anybody even their friends The day s fishing finished they came floating downstream in their skiff talking national politics and other high matters and presently met a skiff coming up from town with a man in it who said I reckon you know one of the new twins gave your nephew a kicking last night Judge Did WHAT Gave him a kicking The old judge s lips paled and his eyes began to flame He choked with anger for a moment then he got out what he was trying to say Well well go on Give me the details The man did it At the finish the judge was silent a minute turning over in his mind the shameful picture of Tom s flight over the footlights then he said as if musing aloud H m I don t understand it I was asleep at home He didn t wake me Thought he was competent to manage his affair without my help I reckon His face lit up with pride and pleasure at that thought and he said with a cheery complacency I like that it s the true old blood hey Pembroke Howard smiled an iron smile and nodded his head approvingly Then the news bringer spoke again But Tom beat the twin on the trial The judge looked at the man wonderingly and said The trial What trial Why Tom had him up before Judge Robinson for assault and battery The old man shrank suddenly together like one who has received a death stroke Howard sprang for him as he sank forward in a swoon and took him in his arms and bedded him on his back in the boat He sprinkled water in his face and said to the startled visitor Go now don t let him come to and find you here You see what an effect your heedless speech has had you ought to have been more considerate than to blurt out such a cruel piece of slander as that I m right down sorry I did it now mister Howard and I wouldn t have done it if I had thought but it ain t slander it s perfectly true just as I told him He rowed away Presently the old judge came out of his faint and looked up piteously into the sympathetic face that was bent over him Say it ain t true Pembroke tell me it ain t true he said in a weak voice There was nothing weak in the deep organ tones that responded You know it s a lie as well as I do old friend He is of the best blood of the Old Dominion God bless you for saying it said the old gentleman fervently Ah Pembroke it was such a blow Howard stayed by his friend and saw him home and entered the house with him It was dark and past supper time but the judge was not thinking of supper he was eager to hear the slander refuted from headquarters and as eager to have Howard hear it too Tom was sent for and he came immediately He was bruised and lame and was not a happy looking object His uncle made him sit down and said We have been hearing about your adventure Tom with a handsome lie added for embellishment Now pulverize that lie to dust What measures have you taken How does the thing stand Tom answered guilelessly It don t stand at all it s all over I had him up in court and beat him Pudd nhead Wilson defended him first case he ever had and lost it The judge fined the miserable hound five dollars for the assault Howard and the judge sprang to their feet with the opening sentence why neither knew then they stood gazing vacantly at each other Howard stood a moment then sat mournfully down without saying anything The judge s wrath began to kindle and he burst out You cur You scum You vermin Do you mean to tell me that blood of my race has suffered a blow and crawled to a court of law about it Answer me Tom s head drooped and he answered with an eloquent silence His uncle stared at him with a mixed expression of amazement and shame and incredulity that was sorrowful to see At last he said Which of the twins was it Count Luigi You have challenged him N no hesitated Tom turning pale You will challenge him tonight Howard will carry it Tom began to turn sick and to show it He turned his hat round and round in his hand his uncle glowering blacker and blacker upon him as the heavy seconds drifted by then at last he began to stammer and said piteously Oh please don t ask me to do it uncle He is a murderous devil I never could I I m afraid of him Old Driscoll s mouth opened and closed three times before he could get it to perform its office then he stormed out A coward in my family A Driscoll a coward Oh what have I done to deserve this infamy He tottered to his secretary in the corner repeated that lament again and again in heartbreaking tones and got out of a drawer a paper which he slowly tore to bits scattering the bits absently in his track as he walked up and down the room still grieving and lamenting At last he said There it is shreds and fragments once more my will Once more you have forced me to disinherit you you base son of a most noble father Leave my sight Go before I spit on you The young man did not tarry Then the judge turned to Howard You will be my second old friend Of course There is pen and paper Draft the cartel and lose no time The Count shall have it in his hands in fifteen minutes said Howard Tom was very heavyhearted His appetite was gone with his property and his self respect He went out the back way and wandered down the obscure lane grieving and wondering if any course of future conduct however discreet and carefully perfected and watched over could win back his uncle s favor and persuade him to reconstruct once more that generous will which had just gone to ruin before his eyes He finally concluded that it could He said to himself that he had accomplished this sort of triumph once already and that what had been done once could be done again He would set about it He would bend every energy to the task and he would score that triumph once more cost what it might to his convenience limit as it might his frivolous and liberty loving life To begin he says to himself I ll square up with the proceeds of my raid and then gambling has got to be stopped and stopped short off It s the worst vice I ve got from my standpoint anyway because it s the one he can most easily find out through the impatience of my creditors He thought it expensive to have to pay two hundred dollars to them for me once Expensive that Why it cost me the whole of his fortune but of course he never thought of that some people can t think of any but their own side of a case If he had known how deep I am in now the will would have gone to pot without waiting for a duel to help Three hundred dollars It s a pile But he ll never hear of it I m thankful to say The minute I ve cleared it off I m safe and I ll never touch a card again Anyway I won t while he lives I make oath to that I m entering on my last reform I know it yes and I ll win but after that if I ever slip again I m gone CHAPTER thirteen Tom Stares at Ruin When I reflect upon the number of disagreeable people who I know have gone to a better world I am moved to lead a different life Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar October This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks in The others are July January September April November May March June December August and February Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar Thus mournfully communing with himself Tom moped along the lane past Pudd nhead Wilson s house and still on and on between fences enclosing vacant country on each hand till he neared the haunted house then he came moping back again with many sighs and heavy with trouble He sorely wanted cheerful company Rowena His heart gave a bound at the thought but the next thought quieted it the detested twins would be there He was on the inhabited side of Wilson s house and now as he approached it he noticed that the sitting room was lighted This would do others made him feel unwelcome sometimes but Wilson never failed in courtesy toward him and a kindly courtesy does at least save one s feelings even if it is not professing to stand for a welcome Wilson heard footsteps at his threshold then the clearing of a throat It s that fickle tempered dissipated young goose poor devil he find friends pretty scarce today likely after the disgrace of carrying a personal assault case into a law court A dejected knock Come in Tom entered and dropped into a chair without saying anything Wilson said kindly Why my boy you look desolate Don t take it so hard Try and forget you have been kicked Oh dear said Tom wretchedly it s not that Pudd nhead it s not that It s a thousand times worse than that oh yes a million times worse Why Tom what do you mean Has Rowena Flung me No but the old man has Wilson said to himself Aha and thought of the mysterious girl in the bedroom The Driscolls have been making discoveries Then he said aloud gravely Tom there are some kinds of dissipation which Oh shucks this hasn t got anything to do with dissipation He wanted me to challenge that derned Italian savage and I wouldn t do it Yes of course he would do that said Wilson in a meditative matter of course way but the thing that puzzled me was why he didn t look to that last night for one thing and why he let you carry such a matter into a court of law at all either before the duel or after it It s no place for it It was not like him I couldn t understand it How did it happen It happened because he didn t know anything about it He was asleep when I got home last night And you didn t wake him Tom is that possible Tom was not getting much comfort here He fidgeted a moment then said I didn t choose to tell him that s all He was going a fishing before dawn with Pembroke Howard and if I got the twins into the common calaboose and I thought sure I could I never dreamed of their slipping out on a paltry fine for such an outrageous offense well once in the calaboose they would be disgraced and uncle wouldn t want any duels with that sort of characters and wouldn t allow any Tom I am ashamed of you I don t see how you could treat your good old uncle so I am a better friend of his than you are for if I had known the circumstances I would have kept that case out of court until I got word to him and let him have the gentleman s chance You would exclaimed Tom with lively surprise And it your first case And you know perfectly well there never would have been any case if he had got that chance don t you And you d have finished your days a pauper nobody instead of being an actually launched and recognized lawyer today And you would really have done that would you Certainly Tom looked at him a moment or two then shook his head sorrowfully and said I believe you upon my word I do I don t know why I do but I do Pudd nhead Wilson I think you re the biggest fool I ever saw Thank you Don t mention it Well he has been requiring you to fight the Italian and you have refused You degenerate remnant of an honorable line I m thoroughly ashamed of you Tom Oh that s nothing I don t care for anything now that the will s torn up again Tom tell me squarely didn t he find any fault with you for anything but those two things carrying the case into court and refusing to fight He watched the young fellow s face narrowly but it was entirely reposeful and so also was the voice that answered No he didn t find any other fault with me If he had had any to find he would have begun yesterday for he was just in the humor for it He drove that jack pair around town and showed them the sights and when he came home he couldn t find his father s old silver watch that don t keep time and he thinks so much of and couldn t remember what he did with it three or four days ago when he saw it last and when I suggested that it probably wasn t lost but stolen it put him in a regular passion and he said I was a fool which convinced me without any trouble that that was just what he was afraid had happened himself but did not want to believe it because lost things stand a better chance of being found again than stolen ones Whe ew whistled Wilson Score another one the list Another what Another theft Theft Yes theft That watch isn t lost it s stolen There s been another raid on the town and just the same old mysterious sort of thing that has happened once before as you remember You don t mean it It s as sure as you are born Have you missed anything yourself No That is I did miss a silver pencil case that Aunt Mary Pratt gave me last birthday You ll find it stolen that s what you ll find No I sha n t for when I suggested theft about the watch and got such a rap I went and examined my room and the pencil case was missing but it was only mislaid and I found it again You are sure you missed nothing else Well nothing of consequence I missed a small plain gold ring worth two or three dollars but that will turn up I ll look again In my opinion you ll not find it There s been a raid I tell you Come in mister Justice Robinson entered followed by Buckstone and the town constable Jim Blake They sat down and after some wandering and aimless weather conversation Wilson said By the way We ve just added another to the list of thefts maybe two Judge Driscoll s old silver watch is gone and Tom here has missed a gold ring Well it is a bad business said the justice and gets worse the further it goes The Hankses the Dobsons the Pilligrews the Ortons the Grangers the Hales the Fullers the Holcombs in fact everybody that lives around about Patsy Cooper s had been robbed of little things like trinkets and teaspoons and suchlike small valuables that are easily carried off It s perfectly plain that the thief took advantage of the reception at Patsy Cooper s when all the neighbors were in her house and all their niggers hanging around her fence for a look at the show to raid the vacant houses undisturbed Patsy is miserable about it miserable on account of the neighbors and particularly miserable on account of her foreigners of course so miserable on their account that she hasn t any room to worry about her own little losses It s the same old raider said Wilson I suppose there isn t any doubt about that Constable Blake doesn t think so No you re wrong there said Blake The other times it was a man there was plenty of signs of that as we know in the profession though we never got hands on him but this time it s a woman Wilson thought of the mysterious girl straight off She was always in his mind now But she failed him again Blake continued She s a stoop shouldered old woman with a covered basket on her arm in a black veil dressed in mourning I saw her going aboard the ferryboat yesterday Lives in Illinois I reckon but I don t care where she lives I m going to get her she can make herself sure of that What makes you think she s the thief Well there ain t any other for one thing and for another some nigger draymen that happened to be driving along saw her coming out of or going into houses and told me so and it just happens that they was robbed every time It was granted that this was plenty good enough circumstantial evidence A pensive silence followed which lasted some moments then Wilson said There s one good thing anyway She can t either pawn or sell Count Luigi s costly Indian dagger My said Tom Is that gone Yes Well that was a haul But why can t she pawn it or sell it Because when the twins went home from the Sons of Liberty meeting last night news of the raid was sifting in from everywhere and Aunt Patsy was in distress to know if they had lost anything They found that the dagger was gone and they notified the police and pawnbrokers everywhere It was a great haul yes but the old woman won t get anything out of it because she ll get caught Did they offer a reward asked Buckstone Yes five hundred dollars for the knife and five hundred more for the thief What a leather headed idea exclaimed the constable The thief das n t go near them nor send anybody Whoever goes is going to get himself nabbed for their ain t any pawnbroker that s going to lose the chance to If anybody had noticed Tom s face at that time the gray green color of it might have provoked curiosity but nobody did He said to himself I m gone I never can square up the rest of the plunder won t pawn or sell for half of the bill Oh I know it I m gone I m gone and this time it s for good Oh this is awful I don t know what to do nor which way to turn Softly softly said Wilson to Blake I planned their scheme for them at midnight last night and it was all finished up shipshape by two this morning They ll get their dagger back and then I ll explain to you how the thing was done There were strong signs of a general curiosity and Buckstone said Well you have whetted us up pretty sharp Wilson and I m free to say that if you don t mind telling us in confidence Oh I d as soon tell as not Buckstone but as long as the twins and I agreed to say nothing about it we must let it stand so But you can take my word for it you won t be kept waiting three days Somebody will apply for that reward pretty promptly and I ll show you the thief and the dagger both very soon afterward The constable was disappointed and also perplexed He said It may all be yes and I hope it will but I m blamed if I can see my way through it It s too many for yours truly The subject seemed about talked out Nobody seemed to have anything further to offer After a silence the justice of the peace informed Wilson that he and Buckstone and the constable had come as a committee on the part of the Democratic party to ask him to run for mayor for the little town was about to become a city and the first charter election was approaching It was the first attention which Wilson had ever received at the hands of any party it was a sufficiently humble one but it was a recognition of his debut into the town s life and activities at last it was a step upward and he was deeply gratified He accepted and the committee departed followed by young Tom CHAPTER fourteen Roxana Insists Upon Reform The true Southern watermelon is a boon apart and not to be mentioned with commoner things It is chief of this world s luxuries king by the grace of God over all the fruits of the earth When one has tasted it he knows what the angels eat It was not a Southern watermelon that Eve took we know it because she repented Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar About the time that Wilson was bowing the committee out Pembroke Howard was entering the next house to report He found the old judge sitting grim and straight in his chair waiting Well Howard the news The best in the world Accepts does he and the light of battle gleamed joyously in the Judge s eye Accepts Why he jumped at it Did did he Now that s fine that s very fine I like that When is it to be Now Straight off Tonight An admirable fellow admirable Admirable He s a darling Why it s an honor as well as a pleasure to stand up before such a man Come off with you Go and arrange everything and give him my heartiest compliments A rare fellow indeed an admirable fellow as you have said I ll have him in the vacant stretch between Wilson s and the haunted house within the hour and I ll bring my own pistols Judge Driscoll began to walk the floor in a state of pleased excitement but presently he stopped and began to think began to think of Tom Twice he moved toward the secretary and twice he turned away again but finally he said This may be my last night in the world I must not take the chance He is worthless and unworthy but it is largely my fault He was entrusted to me by my brother on his dying bed and I have indulged him to his hurt instead of training him up severely and making a man of him I have violated my trust and I must not add the sin of desertion to that I have forgiven him once already and would subject him to a long and hard trial before forgiving him again if I could live but I must not run that risk No I must restore the will But if I survive the duel I will hide it away and he will not know and I will not tell him until he reforms and I see that his reformation is going to be permanent He redrew the will and his ostensible nephew was heir to a fortune again As he was finishing his task Tom wearied with another brooding tramp entered the house and went tiptoeing past the sitting room door He glanced in and hurried on for the sight of his uncle was nothing but terrors for him tonight But his uncle was writing That was unusual at this late hour What could he be writing A chill of anxiety settled down upon Tom s heart Did that writing concern him He was afraid so He reflected that when ill luck begins it does not come in sprinkles but in showers He said he would get a glimpse of that document or know the reason why He heard someone coming and stepped out of sight and hearing It was Pembroke Howard What could be hatching Howard said with great satisfaction Everything s right and ready He s gone to the battleground with his second and the surgeon also with his brother I ve arranged it all with Wilson Wilson s his second We are to have three shots apiece Good How is the moon Bright as day nearly Perfect for the distance fifteen yards No wind not a breath hot and still All good all first rate Here Pembroke read this and witness it Pembroke read and witnessed the will then gave the old man s hand a hearty shake and said Now that s right York but I knew you would do it You couldn t leave that poor chap to fight along without means or profession with certain defeat before him and I knew you wouldn t for his father s sake if not for his own For his dead father s sake I couldn t I know for poor Percy but you know what Percy was to me But mind Tom is not to know of this unless I fall tonight I understand I ll keep the secret The judge put the will away and the two started for the battleground In another minute the will was in Tom s hands His misery vanished his feelings underwent a tremendous revulsion He put the will carefully back in its place and spread his mouth and swung his hat once twice three times around his head in imitation of three rousing huzzahs no sound issuing from his lips He fell to communing with himself excitedly and joyously but every now and then he let off another volley of dumb hurrahs He said to himself I ve got the fortune again but I ll not let on that I know about it And this time I m going to hang on to it I take no more risks I ll gamble no more I ll drink no more because well because I ll not go where there is any of that sort of thing going on again It s the sure way and the only sure way I might have thought of that sooner well yes if I had wanted to But now dear me I ve had a scare this time and I ll take no more chances Not a single chance more Land I persuaded myself this evening that I could fetch him around without any great amount of effort but I ve been getting more and more heavyhearted and doubtful straight along ever since If he tells me about this thing all right but if he doesn t I sha n t let on I well I d like to tell Pudd nhead Wilson but no I ll think about that perhaps I won t He whirled off another dead huzzah and said I m reformed and this time I ll stay so sure He was about to close with a final grand silent demonstration when he suddenly recollected that Wilson had put it out of his power to pawn or sell the Indian knife and that he was once more in awful peril of exposure by his creditors for that reason His joy collapsed utterly and he turned away and moped toward the door moaning and lamenting over the bitterness of his luck He dragged himself upstairs and brooded in his room a long time disconsolate and forlorn with Luigi s Indian knife for a text At last he sighed and said When I supposed these stones were glass and this ivory bone the thing hadn t any interest for me because it hadn t any value and couldn t help me out of my trouble But now why now it is full of interest yes and of a sort to break a body s heart It s a bag of gold that has turned to dirt and ashes in my hands It could save me and save me so easily and yet I ve got to go to ruin It s like drowning with a life preserver in my reach All the hard luck comes to me and all the good luck goes to other people Pudd nhead Wilson for instance even his career has got a sort of a little start at last and what has he done to deserve it I should like to know Yes he has opened his own road but he isn t content with that but must block mine It s a sordid selfish world and I wish I was out of it He allowed the light of the candle to play upon the jewels of the sheath but the flashings and sparklings had no charm for his eye they were only just so many pangs to his heart I must not say anything to Roxy about this thing he said She is too daring She would be for digging these stones out and selling them and then why she would be arrested and the stones traced and then The thought made him quake and he hid the knife away trembling all over and glancing furtively about like a criminal who fancies that the accuser is already at hand Should he try to sleep Oh no sleep was not for him his trouble was too haunting too afflicting for that He must have somebody to mourn with He would carry his despair to Roxy He had heard several distant gunshots but that sort of thing was not uncommon and they had made no impression upon him He went out at the back door and turned westward He passed Wilson s house and proceeded along the lane and presently saw several figures approaching Wilson s place through the vacant lots These were the duelists returning from the fight he thought he recognized them but as he had no desire for white people s company he stooped down behind the fence until they were out of his way Roxy was feeling fine She said Whah was you child Warn t you in it In what In de duel Duel Has there been a duel company se dey has De ole Jedge has be n havin a duel wid one o dem twins Great Scott Then he added to himself That s what made him remake the will he thought he might get killed and it softened him toward me And that s what he and Howard were so busy about Oh dear if the twin had only killed him I should be out of my What is you mumblin bout Chambers Whah was you Didn t you know dey was gwine to be a duel No I didn t The old man tried to get me to fight one with Count Luigi but he didn t succeed so I reckon he concluded to patch up the family honor himself He laughed at the idea and went rambling on with a detailed account of his talk with the judge and how shocked and ashamed the judge was to find that he had a coward in his family He glanced up at last and got a shock himself Roxana s bosom was heaving with suppressed passion and she was glowering down upon him with measureless contempt written in her face En you refuse to fight a man dat kicked you stid o jumpin at de chance En you ain t got no mo feelin den to come en tell me dat fetched sich a po lowdown ornery rabbit into de worl Pah it make me sick It s de nigger in you dat s what it is Thirty one parts o you is white en on y one part nigger en dat po little one part is yo soul Tain t wuth savin tain t wuth totin out on a shovel en throwin en de gutter You has disgraced yo birth What would yo pa think o you It s enough to make him turn in his grave The last three sentences stung Tom into a fury and he said to himself that if his father were only alive and in reach of assassination his mother would soon find that he had a very clear notion of the size of his indebtedness to that man and was willing to pay it up in full and would do it too even at risk of his life but he kept this thought to himself that was safest in his mother s present state Whatever has come o yo Essex blood Dat s what I can t understan En it ain t on y jist Essex blood dat s in you not by a long sight deed it ain t My great great great gran father en yo great great great great gran father was Ole Cap n John Smith de highest blood dat Ole Virginny ever turned out en his great great gran mother or somers along back dah was Pocahontas de Injun queen en her husbun was a nigger king outen Africa en yit here you is a slinkin outen a duel en disgracin our whole line like a ornery lowdown hound Yes it s de nigger in you She sat down on her candle box and fell into a reverie Tom did not disturb her he sometimes lacked prudence but it was not in circumstances of this kind Roxana s storm went gradually down but it died hard and even when it seemed to be quite gone it would now and then break out in a distant rumble so to speak in the form of muttered ejaculations One of these was Ain t nigger enough in him to show in his fingernails en dat takes mighty little yit dey s enough to pain his soul Presently she muttered Yassir enough to paint a whole thimbleful of em At last her ramblings ceased altogether and her countenance began to clear a welcome sight to Tom who had learned her moods and knew she was on the threshold of good humor now He noticed that from time to time she unconsciously carried her finger to the end of her nose He looked closer and said Why Mammy the end of your nose is skinned How did that come She sent out the sort of wholehearted peal of laughter which God had vouchsafed in its perfection to none but the happy angels in heaven and the bruised and broken black slave on the earth and said Dad fetch dat duel I be n in it myself Gracious did a bullet do that Yassir you bet it did Well I declare Why how did that happen Happened dis away I uz a sett n here kinder dozin in de dark en che bang goes a gun right out dah I skips along out towards

dear he will live to find me out and sell me to some nigger trader yet yes and he would do it in a minute Then he said aloud in a grave tone Mother we are in an awful fix Roxana caught her breath with a spasm and said Chile What you hit a body so sudden for like dat What s be n en gone en happen Well there s one thing I didn t tell you When I wouldn t fight he tore up the will again and Roxana s face turned a dead white and she said Now you s done done forever Dat s de end Bofe un us is gwine to starve to Wait and hear me through can t you I reckon that when he resolved to fight himself he thought he might get killed and not have a chance to forgive me any more in this life so he made the will again and I ve seen it and it s all right But Oh thank goodness den we s safe ag in safe en so what did you want to come here en talk sich dreadful Hold ON I tell you and let me finish The swag I gathered won t half square me up and the first thing we know my creditors well you know what ll

know now that I am reformed and permanently Permanently and beyond the reach of any human temptation Den g long home en begin CHAPTER fifteen The Robber Robbed Nothing so needs reforming as other people s habits Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar Behold the fool saith Put not all thine eggs in the one basket which is but a manner of saying Scatter your money and your attention but the wise man saith Put all your eggs in the one basket and WATCH THAT BASKET Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar What a time of it Dawson s Landing was having All its life it had been asleep but now it hardly got a chance for a nod so swiftly did big events and crashing surprises come along in one another s wake Friday morning first glimpse of Real Nobility also grand reception at Aunt Patsy Cooper s also great robber raid Friday evening dramatic kicking of the heir of the chief citizen in presence of four hundred people Saturday morning emergence as practicing lawyer of the long submerged Pudd nhead Wilson Saturday night duel between chief citizen and titled stranger The people took more pride in the duel than in all the other events put together perhaps It was a glory to their town to have such a thing happen there In their eyes the principals had reached the summit of human honor Everybody paid homage to their names their praises were in all mouths Even the duelists subordinates came in for a handsome share of the public approbation wherefore Pudd nhead Wilson was suddenly become a man of consequence When asked to run for the mayoralty Saturday night he was risking defeat but Sunday morning found him a made man and his success assured The twins were prodigiously great now the town took them to its bosom with enthusiasm Day after day and night after night they went dining and visiting from house to house making friends enlarging and solidifying their popularity and charming and surprising all with their musical prodigies and now and then heightening the effects with samples of what they could do in other directions out of their stock of rare and curious accomplishments They were so pleased that they gave the regulation thirty days notice the required preparation for citizenship and resolved to finish their days in this pleasant place That was the climax The delighted community rose as one man and applauded and when the twins were asked to stand for seats in the forthcoming aldermanic board and consented the public contentment was rounded and complete Tom Driscoll was not happy over these things they sunk deep and hurt all the way down He hated the one twin for kicking him and the other one for being the kicker s brother Now and then the people wondered why nothing was heard of the raider or of the stolen knife or the other plunder but nobody was able to throw any light on that matter Nearly a week had drifted by and still the thing remained a vexed mystery On Sunday Constable Blake and Pudd nhead Wilson met on the street and Tom Driscoll joined them in time to open their conversation for them He said to Blake You are not looking well Blake you seem to be annoyed about something Has anything gone wrong in the detective business I believe you fairly and justifiably claim to have a pretty good reputation in that line isn t it so which made Blake feel good and look it but Tom added for a country detective which made Blake feel the other way and not only look it but betray it in his voice Yes sir I have got a reputation and it s as good as anybody s in the profession too country or no country Oh I beg pardon I didn t mean any offense What I started out to ask was only about the old woman that raided the town the stoop shouldered old woman you know that you said you were going to catch and I knew you would too because you have the reputation of never boasting and well you you ve caught the old woman Damn the old woman Why sho you don t mean to say you haven t caught her No I haven t caught her If anybody could have caught her I could but nobody couldn t I don t care who he is I am sorry real sorry for your sake because when it gets around that a detective has expressed himself confidently and then Don t you worry that s all don t you worry and as for the town the town needn t worry either She s my meat make yourself easy about that I m on her track I ve got clues that That s good Now if you could get an old veteran detective down from saint Louis to help you find out what the clues mean and where they lead to and then I m plenty veteran enough myself and I don t need anybody s help I ll have her inside of a we inside of a month That I ll swear to Tom said carelessly I suppose that will answer yes that will answer But I reckon she is pretty old and old people don t often outlive the cautious pace of the professional detective when he has got his clues together and is out on his still hunt Blake s dull face flushed under this gibe but before he could set his retort in order Tom had turned to Wilson and was saying with placid indifference of manner and voice Who got the reward Pudd nhead Wilson winced slightly and saw that his own turn was come What reward Why the reward for the thief and the other one for the knife Wilson answered and rather uncomfortably to judge by his hesitating fashion of delivering himself Well the well in face nobody has claimed it yet Tom seemed surprised Why is that so Wilson showed a trifle of irritation when he replied Yes it s so And what of it Oh nothing Only I thought you had struck out a new idea and invented a scheme that was going to revolutionize the timeworn and ineffectual methods of the He stopped and turned to Blake who was happy now that another had taken his place on the gridiron Blake didn t you understand him to intimate that it wouldn t be necessary for you to hunt the old woman down B George he said he d have thief and swag both inside of three days he did by hokey and that s just about a week ago Why I said at the time that no thief and no thief s pal was going to try to pawn or sell a thing where he knowed the pawnbroker could get both rewards by taking HIM into camp with the swag It was the blessedest idea that ever I struck You d change your mind said Wilson with irritated bluntness if you knew the entire scheme instead of only part of it Well said the constable pensively I had the idea that it wouldn t work and up to now I m right anyway Very well then let it stand at that and give it a further show It has worked at least as well as your own methods you perceive The constable hadn t anything handy to hit back with so he discharged a discontented sniff and said nothing After the night that Wilson had partly revealed his scheme at his house Tom had tried for several days to guess out the secret of the rest of it but had failed Then it occurred to him to give Roxana s smarter head a chance at it He made up a supposititious case and laid it before her She thought it over and delivered her verdict upon it Tom said to himself She s hit it sure He thought he would test that verdict now and watch Wilson s face so he said reflectively Wilson you re not a fool a fact of recent discovery Whatever your scheme was it had sense in it Blake s opinion to the contrary notwithstanding I don t ask you to reveal it but I will suppose a case a case which you will answer as a starting point for the real thing I am going to come at and that s all I want You offered five hundred dollars for the knife and five hundred for the thief We will suppose for argument s sake that the first reward is advertised and the second offered by private letter to pawnbrokers and Blake slapped his thigh and cried out By Jackson he s got you Pudd nhead Now why couldn t I or any fool have thought of that Wilson said to himself Anybody with a reasonably good head would have thought of it I am not surprised that Blake didn t detect it I am only surprised that Tom did There is more to him than I supposed He said nothing aloud and Tom went on Very well The thief would not suspect that there was a trap and he would bring or send the knife and say he bought it for a song or found it in the road or something like that and try to collect the reward and be arrested wouldn t he Yes said Wilson I think so said Tom There can t be any doubt of it Have you ever seen that knife No Has any friend of yours Not that I know of Well I begin to think I understand why your scheme failed What do you mean Tom What are you driving at asked Wilson with a dawning sense of discomfort Why that there isn t any such knife Look here Wilson said Blake Tom Driscoll s right for a thousand dollars if I had it Wilson s blood warmed a little and he wondered if he had been played upon by those strangers it certainly had something of that look But what could they gain by it He threw out that suggestion Tom replied Gain Oh nothing that you would value maybe But they are strangers making their way in a new community Is it nothing to them to appear as pets of an Oriental prince at no expense Is it nothing to them to be able to dazzle this poor town with thousand dollar rewards at no expense Wilson there isn t any such knife or your scheme would have fetched it to light Or if there is any such knife they ve got it yet I believe myself that they ve seen such a knife for Angelo pictured it out with his pencil too swiftly and handily for him to have been inventing it and of course I can t swear that they ve never had it but this I ll go bail for if they had it when they came to this town they ve got it yet Blake said It looks mighty reasonable the way Tom puts it it most certainly does Tom responded turning to leave You find the old woman Blake and if she can t furnish the knife go and search the twins Tom sauntered away Wilson felt a good deal depressed He hardly knew what to think He was loath to withdraw his faith from the twins and was resolved not to do it on the present indecisive evidence but well he would think and then decide how to act Blake what do you think of this matter Well Pudd nhead I m bound to say I put it up the way Tom does They hadn t the knife or if they had it they ve got it yet The men parted Wilson said to himself I believe they had it if it had been stolen the scheme would have restored it that is certain And so I believe they ve got it Tom had no purpose in his mind when he encountered those two men When he began his talk he hoped to be able to gall them a little and get a trifle of malicious entertainment out of it But when he left he left in great spirits for he perceived that just by pure luck and no troublesome labor he had accomplished several delightful things he had touched both men on a raw spot and seen them squirm he had modified Wilson s sweetness for the twins with one small bitter taste that he wouldn t be able to get out of his mouth right away and best of all he had taken the hated twins down a peg with the community for Blake would gossip around freely after the manner of detectives and within a week the town would be laughing at them in its sleeve for offering a gaudy reward for a bauble which they either never possessed or hadn t lost Tom was very well satisfied with himself Tom s behavior at home had been perfect during the entire week His uncle and aunt had seen nothing like it before They could find no fault with him anywhere Saturday evening he said to the Judge I ve had something preying on my mind uncle and as I am going away and might never see you again I can t bear it any longer I made you believe I was afraid to fight that Italian adventurer I had to get out of it on some pretext or other and maybe I chose badly being taken unawares but no honorable person could consent to meet him in the field knowing what I knew about him Indeed What was that Count Luigi is a confessed assassin Incredible It s perfectly true Wilson detected it in his hand by palmistry and charged him with it and cornered him up so close that he had to confess but both twins begged us on their knees to keep the secret and swore they would lead straight lives here and it was all so pitiful that we gave our word of honor never to expose them while they kept the promise You would have done it yourself uncle You are right my boy I would A man s secret is still his own property and sacred when it has been surprised out of him like that You did well and I am proud of you Then he added mournfully But I wish I could have been saved the shame of meeting an assassin on the field of honor It couldn t be helped uncle If I had known you were going to challenge him I should have felt obliged to sacrifice my pledged word in order to stop it but Wilson couldn t be expected to do otherwise than keep silent Oh no Wilson did right and is in no way to blame Tom Tom you have lifted a heavy load from my heart I was stung to the very soul when I seemed to have discovered that I had a coward in my family You may imagine what it cost ME to assume such a part uncle Oh I know it poor boy I know it And I can understand how much it has cost you to remain under that unjust stigma to this time But it is all right now and no harm is done You have restored my comfort of mind and with it your own and both of us had suffered enough The old man sat awhile plunged in thought then he looked up with a satisfied light in his eye and said That this assassin should have put the affront upon me of letting me meet him on the field of honor as if he were a gentleman is a matter which I will presently settle but not now I will not shoot him until after election I see a way to ruin them both before I will attend to that first Neither of them shall be elected that I promise You are sure that the fact that he is an assassin has not got abroad Perfectly certain of it sir It will be a good card I will fling a hint at it from the stump on the polling day It will sweep the ground from under both of them There s not a doubt of it It will finish them That and outside work among the voters will to a certainty I want you to come down here by and by and work privately among the rag tag and bobtail You shall spend money among them I will furnish it Another point scored against the detested twins Really it was a great day for Tom He was encouraged to chance a parting shot now at the same target and did it You know that wonderful Indian knife that the twins have been making such a to do about Well there s no track or trace of it yet so the town is beginning to sneer and gossip and laugh Half the people believe they never had any such knife the other half believe they had it and have got it still I ve heard twenty people talking like that today Yes Tom s blemishless week had restored him to the favor of his aunt and uncle His mother was satisfied with him too Privately she believed she was coming to love him but she did not say so She told him to go along to saint Louis now and she would get ready and follow Then she smashed her whisky bottle and said Dah now I s a gwine to make you walk as straight as a string Chambers en so I s bown you ain t gwine to git no bad example out o yo mammy I tole you you couldn t go into no bad comp ny Well you s gwine into my comp ny en I s gwine to fill de bill Now den trot along trot along Tom went aboard one of the big transient boats that night with his heavy satchel of miscellaneous plunder and slept the sleep of the unjust which is serener and sounder than the other kind as we know by the hanging eve history of a million rascals But when he got up in the morning luck was against him again a brother thief had robbed him while he slept and gone ashore at some intermediate landing

1445_139397_000003_000003	train-clean-360	It made him wince secretly for she was a nigger That he was one himself was far from reconciling him to that despised race 
1445_139397_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Roxana poured out endearments upon him to which he responded uncomfortably but as well as he could 
1445_139397_000004_000001	train-clean-360	And she tried to comfort him but that was not possible 
1445_139397_000004_000002	train-clean-360	These intimacies quickly became horrible to him and within the hour he began to try to get up courage enough to tell her so and require that they be discontinued or very considerably modified 
1445_139397_000004_000003	train-clean-360	But he was afraid of her and besides there came a lull now for she had begun to think 
1445_139397_000004_000004	train-clean-360	She was trying to invent a saving plan 
1445_139397_000004_000005	train-clean-360	Finally she started up and said she had found a way out 
none	none	Tom was almost suffocated by the joy of this sudden good news Roxana said Here is de plan en she ll win sure I s a nigger en nobody ain t gwine to doubt it dat hears me talk I s wuth six hund d dollahs Take en sell me en pay off dese gamblers 
1445_139397_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Tom was dazed 
none	none	He was not sure he had heard aright He was dumb for a moment then he said Do you mean that you would be sold into slavery to save me Ain t you my chile En does you know anything dat a mother won t do for her chile Day ain t nothin a white mother won t do for her chile Who made em so De Lord done it En who made de niggers De Lord made em In de inside mothers is all de same De good lord he made em so I s gwine to be sole into slavery en in a year you s gwine to buy yo ole mammy free ag in I ll show you how

1445_139397_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Tom s hopes began to rise and his spirits along with them

1445_139397_000014_000001	train-clean-360	He did not want to commit this treachery but luck threw the man in his way and this saved him the necessity of going up country to hunt up a purchaser with the added risk of having to answer a lot of questions whereas this planter was so pleased with Roxy that he asked next to none at all 
none	none	Besides the planter insisted that Roxy wouldn t know where she was at first and that by the time she found out she would already have been contented 
1445_139397_000015_000000	train-clean-360	So Tom argued with himself that it was an immense advantaged for Roxy to have a master who was pleased with her as this planter manifestly was 
none	none	In almost no time his flowing reasonings carried him to the point of even half believing he was doing Roxy a splendid surreptitious service in selling her down the river And then he kept diligently saying to himself all the time It s for only a year In a year I buy her free again she ll keep that in mind and it ll reconcile her Yes the little deception could do no harm and everything would come out right and pleasant in the end anyway By agreement the conversation in Roxy s presence was all about the man s up country farm and how pleasant a place it was and how happy the slaves were there so poor Roxy was entirely deceived and easily for she was not dreaming that her own son could be guilty of treason to a mother who in voluntarily going into slavery slavery of any kind mild or severe or of any duration brief or long was making a sacrifice for him compared with which death would have been a poor and commonplace one She lavished tears and loving caresses upon him privately and then went away with her owner went away brokenhearted and yet proud to do it Tom scored his accounts and resolved to keep to the very letter of his reform and never to put that will in jeopardy again He had three hundred dollars left According to his mother s plan he was to put that safely away and add her half of his pension to it monthly In one year this fund would buy her free again For a whole week he was not able to sleep well so much the villainy which he had played upon his trusting mother preyed upon his rag of conscience but after that he began to get comfortable again and was presently able to sleep like any other miscreant The boat bore Roxy away from saint Louis at four in the afternoon and she stood on the lower guard abaft the paddle box and watched Tom through a blur of tears until he melted into the throng of people and disappeared then she looked no more but sat there on a coil of cable crying till far into the night 
1445_139397_000018_000001	train-clean-360	When she went to her foul steerage bunk at last between the clashing engines it was not to sleep but only to wait for the morning and waiting grieve

none	none	At dawn she got up and went listlessly and sat down on the cable coil again She passed many a snag whose break could have told her a thing to break her heart for it showed a current moving in the same direction that the boat was going but her thoughts were elsewhere and she did not notice But at last the roar of a bigger and nearer break than usual brought her out of her torpor and she looked up and her practiced eye fell upon that telltale rush of water 
1445_139397_000019_000006	train-clean-360	For one moment her petrified gaze fixed itself there

be overdone In Rome along at first you are full of regrets that Michelangelo died but by and by you only regret that you didn t see him do it Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar JULY four Statistics show that we lose more fools on this day than in all the other days of the year put together This proves by the number left in stock that one Fourth of July per year is now inadequate the country has grown so Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar The summer weeks dragged by and then the political campaign opened opened in pretty warm fashion and waxed hotter and hotter daily The twins threw themselves into it with their whole heart for their self love was engaged Their popularity so general at first had suffered afterward mainly because they had been TOO popular and so a natural reaction had followed Besides it had been diligently whispered around that it was curious indeed VERY curious that that wonderful knife of theirs did not turn up IF it was so valuable or IF it had ever existed And with the whisperings went chucklings and nudgings and winks and such things have an effect The twins considered that success in the election would reinstate them and that defeat would work them irreparable damage Therefore they worked hard but not harder than Judge Driscoll and Tom worked against them in the closing days of the canvass Tom s conduct had remained so letter perfect during two whole months now that his uncle not only trusted him with money with which to persuade voters but trusted him to go and get it himself out of the safe in the private sitting room The closing speech of the campaign was made by Judge Driscoll and he made it against both of the foreigners It was disastrously effective He poured out rivers of ridicule upon them and forced the big mass meeting to laugh and applaud He scoffed at them as adventurers mountebanks sideshow riffraff dime museum freaks he assailed their showy titles with measureless derision he said they were back alley barbers disguised as nobilities peanut peddlers masquerading as gentlemen organ grinders bereft of their brother monkey At last he stopped and stood still He waited until the place had become absolutely silent and expectant then he delivered his deadliest shot delivered it with ice cold seriousness and deliberation with a significant emphasis upon the closing words he said he believed that the reward offered for the lost knife was humbug and bunkum and that its owner would know where to find it whenever he should have occasion TO ASSASSINATE SOMEBODY Then he stepped from the stand leaving a startled and impressive hush behind him instead of the customary explosion of cheers and party cries The strange remark flew far and wide over the town and made an extraordinary sensation Everybody was asking What could he mean by that And everybody went on asking that question but in vain for the judge only said he knew what he was talking about and stopped there Tom said he hadn t any idea what his uncle meant and Wilson whenever he was asked what he thought it meant parried the question by asking the questioner what HE thought it meant Wilson was elected the twins were defeated crushed in fact and left forlorn and substantially friendless Tom went back to saint Louis happy Dawson s Landing had a week of repose now and it needed it But it was in an expectant state for the air was full of rumors of a new duel Judge Driscoll s election labors had prostrated him but it was said that as soon as he was well enough to entertain a challenge he would get one from Count Luigi The brothers withdrew entirely from society and nursed their humiliation in privacy They avoided the people and went out for exercise only late at night when the streets were deserted CHAPTER eighteen Roxana Commands Gratitude and treachery are merely the two extremities of the same procession You have seen all of it that is worth staying for when the band and the gaudy officials have gone by Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar THANKSGIVING DAY Let us all give humble hearty and sincere thanks now but the turkeys In the island of Fiji they do not use turkeys they use plumbers It does not become you and me to sneer at Fiji Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar The Friday after the election was a rainy one in saint Louis It rained all day long and rained hard apparently trying its best to wash that soot blackened town white but of course not succeeding Toward midnight Tom Driscoll arrived at his lodgings from the theater in the heavy downpour and closed his umbrella and let himself in but when he would have shut the door he found that there was another person entering doubtless another lodger this person closed the door and tramped upstairs behind Tom Tom found his door in the dark and entered it and turned up the gas When he faced about lightly whistling he saw the back of a man The man was closing and locking his door from him His whistle faded out and he felt uneasy The man turned around a wreck of shabby old clothes sodden with rain and all a drip and showed a black face under an old slouch hat Tom was frightened He tried to order the man out but the words refused to come and the other man got the start He said in a low voice Keep still I s yo mother Tom sunk in a heap on a chair and gasped out It was mean of me and base I know it but I meant it for the best I did indeed I can swear it Roxana stood awhile looking mutely down on him while he writhed in shame and went on incoherently babbling self accusations mixed with pitiful attempts at explanation and palliation of his crime then she seated herself and took off her hat and her unkept masses of long brown hair tumbled down about her shoulders It warn t no fault o yo n dat dat ain t gray she said sadly noticing the hair I know it I know it I m a scoundrel But I swear I meant it for the best It was a mistake of course but I thought it was for the best I truly did Roxana began to cry softly and presently words began to find their way out between her sobs They were uttered lamentingly rather than angrily Sell a pusson down de river DOWN DE RIVER for de bes I wouldn t treat a dog so I is all broke down en wore out now en so I reckon it ain t in me to storm aroun no mo like I used to when I uz trompled on en bused I don t know but maybe it s so Leastways I s suffered so much dat mournin seem to come mo handy to me now den stormin These words should have touched Tom Driscoll but if they did that effect was obliterated by a stronger one one which removed the heavy weight of fear which lay upon him and gave his crushed spirit a most grateful rebound and filled all his small soul with a deep sense of relief But he kept prudently still and ventured no comment There was a voiceless interval of some duration now in which no sounds were heard but the beating of the rain upon the panes the sighing and complaining of the winds and now and then a muffled sob from Roxana The sobs became more and more infrequent and at last ceased Then the refugee began to talk again Shet down dat light a little More More yit A pusson dat is hunted don t like de light Dah dat ll do I kin see whah you is en dat s enough I s gwine to tell you de tale en cut it jes as short as I kin en den I ll tell you what you s got to do Dat man dat bought me ain t a bad man he s good enough as planters goes en if he could a had his way I d a be n a

dat uz bad for me for de mistis she fine it out en arter dat I jist ketched it at every turn dey warn t no mercy for me no mo Tom s heart was fired with fury against the planter s wife and he said to himself But for that meddlesome fool everything would have gone all right He added a deep and bitter curse against her The expression of this sentiment was fiercely written in his face and stood thus revealed to Roxana by a white glare of lightning which turned the somber dusk of the room into dazzling day at that moment She was pleased pleased and grateful for did not that expression show that her child was capable of grieving for his mother s wrongs and of feeling resentment toward her persecutors a thing which she had been doubting But her flash of happiness was only a flash and went out again and left her spirit dark for she said to herself He sole me down de river he can t feel for a body long dis ll pass en go Then she took up her tale again Bout ten days ago I uz sayin to myself dat I couldn t las many mo weeks I uz so wore out wid de awful work en de lashin s en so downhearted en misable En I didn t care no mo nuther life warn t wuth noth n to me if I got to go on like dat

t you reckon Tom had been gradually sinking into a state of ghastly terror and he said to himself now I m lost no matter what turn things take This man has said to me that he thinks there was something suspicious about that sale he said he had a letter from a passenger on the GRAND MOGUL saying that Roxy came here on that boat and that everybody on board knew all about the case so he says that her coming here instead of flying to a free state looks bad for me and that if I don t find her for him and that pretty soon he will make trouble for me I never believed that story I couldn t believe she would be so dead to all motherly instincts as to come here knowing the risk she would run of getting me into irremediable trouble And after all here she is And I stupidly swore I would help find her thinking it was a perfectly safe thing to promise If I venture to deliver her up she she but how can I help myself I ve got to do that or pay the money and where s the money to come from I I well I should think that if he would swear to treat her kindly hereafter and she says herself that he is a good man and if he would swear to never allow her to be overworked or ill fed or A flash of lightning exposed Tom s pallid face drawn and rigid with these worrying thoughts Roxana spoke up sharply now and there was apprehension in her voice Turn up dat light I want to see yo face better Dah now lemme look at you Chambers you s as white as yo shirt Has you see dat man Has he be n to see you Ye s When Monday noon Monday noon Was he on my track He well he thought he was That is he hoped he was This is the bill you saw He took it out of his pocket Read it to me She was panting with excitement and there was a dusky glow in her eyes that Tom could not translate with certainty but there seemed to be something threatening about it The handbill had the usual rude woodcut of a turbaned Negro woman running with the customary bundle on a stick over her shoulder and the heading in bold type one hundred dollars REWARD Tom read the bill aloud at least the part that described Roxana and named the master and his saint Louis address and the address of the Fourth street agency but he left out the item that applicants for the reward might also apply to mister Thomas Driscoll Gimme de bill Tom had folded it and was putting it in his pocket He felt a chilly streak creeping down his back but said as carelessly as he could The bill Why it isn t any use to you you can t read it What do you want with it Gimme de bill Tom gave it to her but with a reluctance which he could not entirely disguise Did you read it ALL to me Certainly I did Hole up yo han en swah to it Tom did it Roxana put the bill carefully away in her pocket with her eyes fixed upon Tom s face all the while then she said Yo s lyin What would I want to lie about it for I don t know but you is Dat s my opinion anyways But nemmine bout dat When I seed dat man I uz dat sk yerd dat I could sca cely wobble home Den I give a nigger man a dollar for dese clo es en I ain t be in in a house sence night ner day till now I blacked my face en laid hid in de cellar of a ole house dat s burnt down daytimes en robbed de sugar hogsheads en grain sacks on de wharf nights to git somethin to eat en never dast to try to buy noth n en I s mos starved En I never dast to come near dis place till dis rainy night when dey ain

Monday Yes I seed him de middle o dat arternoon He hunted you up didn t he Yes Did he give you de bill dat time No he hadn t got it printed yet Roxana darted a suspicious glance at him Did you he p him fix up de bill Tom cursed himself for making that stupid blunder and tried to rectify it by saying he remembered now that it WAS at noon Monday that the man gave him the bill Roxana said You s lyin ag in sho Then she straightened up and raised her finger Now den I s gwine to ask you a question en I wants to know how you s gwine to git aroun it You knowed he uz arter me en if you run off stid o stayin here to he p him he d know dey uz somethin wrong bout dis business en den he would inquire bout you en dat would take him to yo uncle en yo uncle would read de bill en see dat you be n sellin a free nigger down de river en you know HIM I reckon He d t ar up de will en kick you outen de house Now den you answer me dis question hain t you tole dat man dat I would be sho to come here en den you would fix it so he could set a trap en ketch me Tom recognized that neither lies nor arguments could help him any longer he was in a vise with the screw turned on and out of it there was no budging His face began to take on an ugly look and presently he said with a snarl Well what could I do You see yourself that I was in his grip and couldn t get out Roxy scorched him with a scornful gaze awhile then she said What could you do You could be Judas to yo own mother to save yo wuthless hide Would anybody b lieve it No a dog couldn t You is de lowdownest orneriest hound dat was ever pup d into dis worl en I s sponsible for it and she spat on him He made no effort to resent this Roxy reflected a moment then she said Now I ll tell you what you s gwine to do You s gwine to give dat man de money dat you s got laid up en make him wait till you kin go to de judge en git de res en buy me free agin Thunder What are you thinking of Go and ask him for three hundred dollars and odd What would I tell him I want it for pray Roxy s answer was delivered in a serene and level voice You ll tell him you s sole me to pay yo gamblin debts en dat you lied to me en was a villain en dat I quires you to git dat money en buy me back ag in Why you ve gone stark mad He would tear the will to shreds in a minute don t you know that Yes I does Then you don t believe I m idiot enough to go to him do you I don t b lieve nothin bout it I KNOWS you s a goin I knows it ca se you knows dat if you don t raise dat money I ll go to him myself en den he ll sell YOU down de river en you kin see how you like it Tom rose trembling and excited and there was an evil light in his eye He strode to the door and said he must get out of this suffocating place for a moment and clear his brain in the fresh air so that he could determine what to do The door wouldn t open Roxy smiled grimly and said I s got the key honey set down You needn t cle r up yo brain none to fine out what you gwine to do I knows what you s gwine to do Tom sat down and began to pass his hands through his hair with a helpless and desperate air Roxy said Is dat man in dis house Tom glanced up with a surprised expression and asked

s de key They were not followed Tom trembled every time a late straggler brushed by them on the street and half expected to feel the cold steel in his back Roxy was right at his heels and always in reach After tramping a mile they reached a wide vacancy on the deserted wharves and in this dark and rainy desert they parted As Tom trudged home his mind was full of dreary thoughts and wild plans but at last he said to himself wearily There is but the one way out I must follow her plan But with a variation I will not ask for the money and ruin myself I will ROB the old skinflint CHAPTER nineteen The Prophesy Realized Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar It were not best that we should all think alike it is difference of opinion that makes horse races Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar Dawson s Landing was comfortably finishing its season of dull repose and waiting patiently for the duel Count Luigi was waiting too but not patiently rumor said Sunday came and Luigi insisted on having his challenge conveyed Wilson carried it Judge Driscoll declined to fight with an assassin that is he added significantly in the field of honor Elsewhere of course he would be ready Wilson tried to convince him that if he had been present himself when Angelo told him about the homicide committed by Luigi he would not have considered the act discreditable to Luigi but the obstinate old man was not to be moved Wilson went back to his principal and reported the failure of his mission Luigi was incensed and asked how it could be that the old gentleman who was by no means dull witted held his trifling nephew s evidence in inferences to be of more value than Wilson s But Wilson laughed and said That is quite simple that is easily explicable I am not his doll his baby his infatuation his nature is The judge and his late wife never had any children The judge and his wife were past middle age when this treasure fell into their lap One must make allowances for a parental instinct that has been starving for twenty five or thirty years It is famished it is crazed with hunger by that time and will be entirely satisfied with anything that comes handy its taste is atrophied it can t tell mud cat from shad A devil born to a young couple is measurably recognizable by them as a devil before long but a devil adopted by an old couple is an angel to them and remains so through thick and thin Tom is this old man s angel he is infatuated with him Tom can persuade him into things which other people can t not all things I don t mean that but a good many particularly one class of things the things that create or abolish personal partialities or prejudices in the old man s mind The old man liked both of you Tom conceived a hatred for you That was enough it turned the old man around at once The oldest and strongest friendship must go to the ground when one of these late adopted darlings throws a brick at it It s a curious philosophy said Luigi It ain t philosophy at all it s a fact And there is something pathetic and beautiful about it too I think there is nothing more pathetic than to see one of these poor old childless couples taking a menagerie of yelping little worthless dogs to their hearts and then adding some cursing and squawking parrots and a jackass voiced macaw and next a couple of hundred screeching songbirds and presently some fetid guinea pigs and rabbits and a howling colony of cats It is all a groping and ignorant effort to construct out of base metal and brass filings so to speak something to take the place of that golden treasure denied them by Nature a child But this is a digression The unwritten law of this region requires you to kill Judge Driscoll on sight and he and the community will expect that attention at your hands though of course your own death by his bullet will answer every purpose Look out for him Are you healed that is fixed Yes he shall have his opportunity If he attacks me I will respond As Wilson was leaving he said The judge is still a little used up by his campaign work and will not get out for a day or so but when he does get out you want to be on the alert About eleven at night the twins went out for exercise and started on a long stroll in the veiled moonlight Tom Driscoll had landed at Hackett s Store two miles below Dawson s just about half an hour earlier the only passenger for that lonely spot and had walked up the shore road and entered Judge Driscoll s house without having encountered anyone either on the road or under the roof He pulled down his window blinds and lighted his candle He laid off his coat and hat and began his preparations He unlocked his trunk and got his suit of girl s clothes out from under the male attire in it and laid it by Then he blacked his face with burnt cork and put the cork in his pocket His plan was to slip down to his uncle s private sitting room below pass into the bedroom steal the safe key from the old gentleman s clothes and then go back and rob the safe He took up his candle to start His courage and confidence were high up to this point but both began to waver a little now Suppose he should make a noise by some accident and get caught say in the act of opening the safe Perhaps it would be well to go armed He took the Indian knife from its hiding place and felt a pleasant return of his wandering courage He slipped stealthily down the narrow stair his hair rising and his pulses halting at the slightest creak When he was halfway down he was disturbed to perceive that the landing below was touched by a faint glow of light What could that mean Was his uncle still up No that was not likely he must have left his night taper there when he went to bed Tom crept on down pausing at every step to listen He found the door standing open and glanced in What he saw pleased him beyond measure His uncle was asleep on the sofa on a small table at the head of the sofa a lamp was burning low and by it stood the old man s small cashbox closed Near the box was a pile of bank notes and a piece of paper covered with figures in pencil The safe door was not open Evidently the sleeper had wearied himself with work upon his finances and was taking a rest Tom set his candle on the stairs and began to make his way toward the pile of notes stooping low as he went When he was passing his uncle the old man stirred in his sleep and Tom stopped instantly stopped and softly drew the knife from its sheath with his heart thumping and his eyes fastened upon his benefactor s face After a moment or two he ventured forward again one step reached for his prize and seized it dropping the knife sheath Then he felt the old man s strong grip upon him and a wild cry of Help help rang in his ear Without hesitation he drove the knife home and was free Some of the notes escaped from his left hand and fell in the blood on the floor He dropped the knife and snatched them up and started to fly transferred them to his left hand and seized the knife again in his fright and confusion but remembered himself and flung it from him as being a dangerous witness to carry away with him He jumped for the stair foot and closed the door behind him and as he snatched his candle and fled upward the stillness of the night was broken by the sound of urgent footsteps approaching the house In another moment he was in his room and the twins were standing aghast over the body of the murdered man Tom put on his coat buttoned his hat under it threw on his suit of girl s clothes dropped the veil blew out his light locked the room door by which he had just entered taking the key passed through his other door into the black hall locked that door and kept the key then worked his way along in the dark and descended the black stairs He was not expecting to meet anybody for all interest was centered in the other part of the house now his calculation proved correct By the time he was passing through the backyard missus Pratt her servants and a dozen half dressed neighbors had joined the twins and the dead and accessions were still arriving at the front door As Tom quaking as with a palsy passed out at the gate three women came flying from the house on the opposite side of the lane They rushed by him and in at the gate asking him what the trouble was there but not waiting for an answer Tom said to himself Those old maids waited to dress they did the same thing the night Stevens s house burned down next door In a few minutes he was in the haunted house He lighted a candle and took off his girl clothes There was blood on him all down his left side and his right hand was red with the stains of the blood soaked notes which he has crushed in it but otherwise he was free from this sort of evidence He cleansed his hand on the straw and cleaned most of the smut from his face Then he burned the male and female attire to ashes scattered the ashes and put on a disguise proper for a tramp He blew out his light went below and was soon loafing down the river road with the intent to borrow and use one of Roxy s devices He found a canoe and paddled down downstream setting the canoe adrift as dawn approached and making his way by land to the next village where he kept out of sight till a transient steamer came along and then took deck passage for saint Louis He was ill at ease until Dawson s Landing was behind him then he said to himself All the detectives on earth couldn t trace me now there s not a vestige of a clue left in the world that homicide will take its place with the permanent mysteries and people won t get done trying to guess out the secret of it for fifty years In saint Louis next morning he read this brief telegram in the papers dated at Dawson s Landing Judge Driscoll an old and respected citizen was assassinated here about midnight by a profligate Italian nobleman or a barber on account of a quarrel growing out of the recent election The assassin will probably be lynched One of the twins soliloquized Tom How lucky It is the knife that has done him this grace We never know when fortune is trying to favor us I actually cursed Pudd nhead Wilson in my heart for putting it out of my power to sell that knife I take it back now Tom was now rich and independent He arranged with the planter and mailed to Wilson the new bill of sale which sold Roxana to herself then he telegraphed his Aunt Pratt Have seen the awful news in the papers and am almost prostrated with grief Shall start by packet today Try to bear up till I come When Wilson reached the house of mourning and had gathered such details as missus Pratt and the rest of the crowd could tell him he took command as mayor and gave orders that nothing should be touched but everything left as it was until Justice Robinson should arrive and take the proper measures as coroner He cleared everybody out of the room but the twins and himself The sheriff soon arrived and took the twins away to jail Wilson told them to keep heart and promised to do his best in their defense when the case should come to trial Justice Robinson came presently and with him Constable Blake They examined the room thoroughly They found the knife and the sheath Wilson noticed that there were fingerprints on the knife s handle That pleased him for the twins had required the earliest comers to make a scrutiny of their hands and clothes and neither these people nor Wilson himself had found any bloodstains upon them Could there be a possibility that the twins had spoken the truth when they had said they found the man dead when they ran into the house in answer to the cry for help He thought of that mysterious girl at once But this was not the sort of work for a girl to be engaged in No matter Tom Driscoll s room must be examined After the coroner s jury had viewed the body and its surroundings Wilson suggested a search upstairs and he went along The jury forced an entrance to Tom s room but found nothing of course The coroner s jury found that the homicide was committed by Luigi and that Angelo was accessory to it The town was bitter against the misfortunates and for the first few days after the murder they were in constant danger of being lynched The grand jury presently indicted Luigi for murder in the first degree and Angelo as accessory before the fact The twins were transferred from the city jail to the county prison to await trial Wilson examined the finger marks on the knife handle and said to himself Neither of the twins made those marks Then manifestly there was another person concerned either in his own interest or as hired assassin But who could it be That he must try to find out The safe was not opened the cashbox was closed and had three thousand dollars in it Then robbery was not the motive and revenge was Where had the murdered man an enemy except Luigi There was but that one person in the world with a deep grudge against him The mysterious girl The girl was a great trial to Wilson If the motive had been robbery the girl might answer but there wasn t any girl that would want to take this old man s life for revenge He had no quarrels with girls he was a gentleman Wilson had perfect tracings of the finger marks of the knife handle and among his glass records he had a great array of fingerprints of women and girls collected during the last fifteen or eighteen years but he scanned them in vain they successfully withstood every test among them were no duplicates of the prints on the knife The presence of the knife on the stage of the murder was a worrying circumstance for Wilson A week previously he had as good as admitted to himself that he believed Luigi had possessed such a knife and that he still possessed it notwithstanding his pretense that it had been stolen And now here was the knife and with it the twins Half the town had said the twins were humbugging when they claimed they had lost their knife and now these people were joyful and said I told you so If their fingerprints had been on the handle but useless to bother any further about that the fingerprints on the handle were NOT theirs that he knew perfectly Wilson refused to suspect Tom for first Tom couldn t murder anybody he hadn t character enough secondly if he could murder a person he wouldn t select his doting benefactor and nearest relative thirdly self interest was in the way for while the uncle lived Tom was sure of a free support and a chance to get the destroyed will revived again but with the uncle gone that chance was gone too It was true the will had really been revived as was now discovered but Tom could not have been aware of it or he would have spoken of it in his native talky unsecretive way Finally Tom was in saint Louis when the murder was done and got the news out of the morning journals as was shown by his telegram to his aunt These speculations were unemphasized sensations rather than articulated thoughts for Wilson would have laughed at the idea of seriously connecting Tom with the murder Wilson regarded the case of the twins as desperate in fact about hopeless For he argued that if a confederate was not found an enlightened Missouri jury would hang them sure if a confederate was found that would not improve the matter but simply furnish one more person for the sheriff to hang Nothing could save the twins but the discovery of a person who did the murder on his sole personal account an undertaking which had all the aspect of the impossible Still the person who made the fingerprints must be sought The twins might have no case WITH them but they certainly would have none without him So Wilson mooned around thinking thinking guessing guessing day and night and arriving nowhere Whenever he ran across a girl or a woman he was not acquainted with he got her fingerprints on one pretext or another and they always cost him a sigh when he got home for they never tallied with the finger marks on the knife handle As to the mysterious girl Tom swore he knew no such girl and did not remember ever seeing a girl wearing a dress like the one described by Wilson He admitted that he did not always lock his room and that sometimes the servants forgot to lock the house doors still in his opinion the girl must have made but few visits or she would have been discovered When Wilson tried to connect her with the stealing raid and thought she might have been the old woman s confederate if not the very thief disguised as an old woman Tom seemed stuck and also much interested and said he would keep a sharp eye out for this person or persons although he was afraid that she or they would be too smart to venture again into a town where everybody would now be on the watch for a good while to come Everybody was pitying Tom he looked so quiet and sorrowful and seemed to feel his great loss so deeply He was playing a part but it was not all a part The picture of his alleged uncle as he had last seen him was before him in the dark pretty frequently when he was away and called again in his dreams when he was asleep He wouldn t go into the room where the tragedy had happened This charmed the doting missus Pratt who realized now as she had never done before she said what a sensitive and delicate nature her darling had and how he adored his poor uncle CHAPTER twenty The Murderer Chuckles Even the clearest and most perfect circumstantial evidence is likely to be at fault after all and therefore ought to be received with great caution Take the case of any pencil sharpened by any woman if you have witnesses you will find she did it with a knife but if you take simply the aspect of the pencil you will say she did it with her teeth Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar The weeks dragged along no friend visiting the jailed twins but their counsel and Aunt Patsy Cooper and the day of trial came at last the heaviest day in Wilson s life for with all his tireless diligence he had discovered no sign or trace of the missing confederate Confederate was the term he had long ago privately accepted for that person not as being unquestionably the right term but as being the least possibly the right one though he was never able to understand why the twins did not vanish and escape as the confederate had done instead of remaining by the murdered man and getting caught there The courthouse was crowded of course and would remain so to the finish for not only in the town itself but in the country for miles around the trial was the one topic of conversation among the people missus Pratt in deep mourning and Tom with a weed on his hat had seats near Pembroke Howard the public prosecutor and back of them sat a great array of friends of the family The twins had but one friend present to keep their counsel in countenance their poor old sorrowing landlady She sat near Wilson and looked her friendliest In the nigger corner sat Chambers also Roxy with good clothes on and her bill of sale in her pocket It was her most precious possession and she never parted with it day or night Tom had allowed her thirty five dollars a month ever since he came into his property and had said that he and she ought to be grateful to the twins for making them rich but had roused such a temper in her by this speech that he did not repeat the argument afterward She said the old judge had treated her child a thousand times better than he deserved and had never done her an unkindness in his life so she hated these outlandish devils for killing him and shouldn t ever sleep satisfied till she saw them hanged for it She was here to watch the trial now and was going to lift up just one hooraw over it if the county judge put her in jail a year for it She gave her turbaned head a toss and said When dat verdic comes I s gwine to lif dat ROOF now I TELL you Pembroke Howard briefly sketched the state s case He said he would show by a chain of circumstantial evidence without break or fault in it anywhere that the principal prisoner at the bar committed the murder that the motive was partly revenge and partly a desire to take his own life out of jeopardy and that his brother by his presence was a consenting accessory to the crime a crime which was the basest known to the calendar of human misdeeds assassination that it was conceived by the blackest of hearts and consummated by the cowardliest of hands a crime which had broken a loving sister s heart blighted the happiness of a young nephew who was as dear as a son brought inconsolable grief to many friends and sorrow and loss to the whole community The utmost penalty of the outraged law would be exacted and upon the accused now present at the bar that penalty would unquestionably be executed He would reserve further remark until his closing speech He was strongly moved and so also was the whole house missus Pratt and several other women were weeping when he sat down and many an eye that was full of hate was riveted upon the unhappy prisoners Witness after witness was called by the state and questioned at length but the cross questioning was brief Wilson knew they could furnish nothing valuable for his side People were sorry for Pudd nhead Wilson his budding career would get hurt by this trial Several witnesses swore they heard Judge Driscoll say in his public speech that the twins would be able to find their lost knife again when they needed it to assassinate somebody with This was not news but now it was seen to have been sorrowfully prophetic and a profound sensation quivered through the hushed courtroom when those dismal words were repeated The public prosecutor rose and said that it was within his knowledge through a conversation held with Judge Driscoll on the last day of his life that counsel for the defense had brought him a challenge from the person charged at the bar with murder that he had refused to fight with a confessed assassin that is on the field of honor but had added significantly that he would be ready for him elsewhere Presumably the person here charged with murder was warned that he must kill or be killed the first time he should meet Judge Driscoll If counsel for the defense chose to let the statement stand so he would not call him to the witness stand mister Wilson said he would offer no denial Murmurs in the house It is getting worse and worse for Wilson s case missus Pratt testified that she heard no outcry and did not know what woke her up unless it was the sound of rapid footsteps approaching the front door She jumped up and ran out in the hall just as she was and heard the footsteps flying up the front steps and then following behind her as she ran to the sitting room There she found the accused standing over her murdered brother Here she broke down and sobbed Sensation in the court Resuming she said the persons entered behind her were mister Rogers and mister Buckstone Cross examined by Wilson she said the twins proclaimed their innocence declared that they had been taking a walk and had hurried to the house in response to a cry for help which was so loud and strong that they had heard it at a considerable distance that they begged her and the gentlemen just mentioned to examine their hands and clothes which was done and no blood stains found Confirmatory evidence followed from Rogers and Buckstone The finding of the knife was verified the advertisement minutely describing it and offering a reward for it was put in evidence and its exact correspondence with that description proved Then followed a few minor details and the case for the state was closed Wilson said that he had three witnesses the Misses Clarkson who would testify that they met a veiled young woman leaving Judge Driscoll s premises by the back gate a few minutes after the cries for help were heard and that their evidence taken with certain circumstantial evidence which he would call the court s attention to would in his opinion convince the court that there was still one person concerned in this crime who had not yet been found and also that a stay of proceedings ought to be granted in justice to his clients until that person should be discovered As it was late he would ask leave to defer the examination of his three witnesses until the next morning The crowd poured out of the place and went flocking away in excited groups and couples taking the events of the session over with vivacity and consuming interest and everybody seemed to have had a satisfactory and enjoyable day except the accused their counsel and their old lady friend There was no cheer among these and no substantial hope In parting with the twins Aunt Patsy did attempt a good night with a gay pretense of hope and cheer in it but broke down without finishing Absolutely secure as Tom considered himself to be the opening solemnities of the trial had nevertheless oppressed him with a vague uneasiness his being a nature sensitive to even the smallest alarms but from the moment that the poverty and weakness of Wilson s case lay exposed to the court he was comfortable once more even jubilant He left the courtroom sarcastically sorry for Wilson The Clarksons met an unknown woman in the back lane he said to himself THAT is his case I ll give him a century to find her in a couple of them if he likes A woman who doesn t exist any longer and the clothes that gave her her sex burnt up and the ashes thrown away oh certainly he ll find HER easy enough This reflection set him to admiring for the hundredth time the shrewd ingenuities by which he had insured himself against detection more against even suspicion Nearly always in cases like this there is some little detail or other overlooked some wee little track or trace left behind and detection follows but here there s not even the faintest suggestion of a trace left No more than a bird leaves when it flies through the air yes through the night you may say The man that can track a bird through the air in the dark and find that bird is the man to track me out and find the judge s assassin no other need apply And that is the job that has been laid out for poor Pudd nhead Wilson of all people in the world Lord it will be pathetically funny to see him grubbing and groping after that woman that don t exist and the right person sitting under his very nose all the time The more he thought the situation over the more the humor of it struck him Finally he said I ll never let him hear the last of that woman Every time I catch him in company to his dying day I ll ask him in the guileless affectionate way that used to gravel him so when I inquired how his unborn law business was coming along Got on her track yet hey Pudd nhead He wanted to laugh but that would not have answered there were people about and he was mourning for his uncle He made up his mind that it would be good entertainment to look in on Wilson that night and watch him worry over his barren law case and goad him with an exasperating word or two of sympathy and commiseration now and then Wilson wanted no supper he had no appetite He got out all the fingerprints of girls and women in his collection of records and pored gloomily over them an hour or more trying to convince himself that that troublesome girl s marks were there somewhere and had been overlooked But it was not so He drew back his chair clasped his hands over his head and gave himself up to dull and arid musings Tom Driscoll dropped in an hour after dark and said with a pleasant laugh as he took a seat Hello we ve gone back to the amusements of our days of neglect and obscurity for consolation have we and he took up one of the glass strips and held it against the light to inspect it Come cheer up old man there s no use in losing your grip and going back to this child s play merely because this big sunspot is drifting across your shiny new disk It ll pass and you ll be all right again and he laid the glass down Did you think you could win always Oh no said Wilson with a sigh I didn t expect that but I can t believe Luigi killed your uncle and I feel very sorry for him It makes me blue And you would feel as I do Tom if you were not prejudiced against those young fellows I don t know about that and Tom s countenance darkened for his memory reverted to his kicking I owe them no good will considering the brunet one s treatment of me that night Prejudice or no prejudice Pudd nhead I don t like them and when they get their deserts you re not going to find me sitting on the mourner s bench He took up another strip of glass and exclaimed Why here s old Roxy s label Are you going to ornament the royal palaces with nigger paw marks too By the date here I was seven months old when this was done and she was nursing me and her little nigger cub There s a line straight across her thumbprint How comes that and Tom held out the piece of glass to Wilson That is common said the bored man wearily Scar of a cut or a scratch usually and he took the strip of glass indifferently and raised it toward the lamp All the blood sank suddenly out of his face his hand quaked and he gazed at the polished surface before him with the glassy stare of a corpse Great heavens what s the matter with you Wilson Are you going to faint Tom sprang for a glass of water and offered it but Wilson shrank shuddering from him and said No no take it away His breast was rising and falling and he moved his head about in a dull and wandering way like a person who had been stunned Presently he said I shall feel better when I get to bed I have been overwrought today yes and overworked for many days Then I ll leave you and let you get to your rest Good night old man But as Tom went out he couldn t deny himself a small parting gibe Don t take it so hard a body can t win every time you ll hang somebody yet Wilson muttered to himself It is no lie to say I am sorry I have to begin with you miserable dog though you are He braced himself up with a glass of cold whisky and went to work again He did not compare the new finger marks unintentionally left by Tom a few minutes before on Roxy s glass with the tracings of the marks left on the knife handle there being no need for that for his trained eye but busied himself with another matter muttering from time to time Idiot that I was Nothing but a GIRL would do me a man in girl s clothes never occurred to me First he hunted out the plate containing the fingerprints made by Tom when he was twelve years old and laid it by itself then he brought forth the marks made by Tom s baby fingers when he was a suckling of seven months and placed these two plates with the one containing this subject s newly and unconsciously made record Now the series is complete he said with satisfaction and sat down to inspect these things and enjoy them But his enjoyment was brief He stared a considerable time at the three strips and seemed stupefied with astonishment At last he put them down and said I can t make it out at all hang it the baby s don t tally with the others He walked the floor for half an hour puzzling over his enigma then he hunted out the other glass plates He sat down and puzzled over these things a good while but kept muttering It s no use I can t understand it They don t tally right and yet I ll swear the names and dates are right and so of course they OUGHT to tally I never labeled one of these thing carelessly in my life There is a most extraordinary mystery here He was tired out now and his brains were beginning to clog He said he would sleep himself fresh and then see what he could do with this riddle He slept through a troubled and unrestful hour then unconsciousness began to shred away and presently he rose drowsily to a sitting posture Now what was that dream he said trying to recall it What was that dream It seemed to unravel that puz He landed in the middle of the floor at a bound without finishing the sentence and ran and turned up his light and seized his records He took a single swift glance at them and cried out It s so Heavens what a revelation And for twenty three years no man has ever suspected it CHAPTER twenty one Doom He is useless on top of the ground he ought to be under it inspiring the cabbages Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar APRIL one This is the day upon which we are reminded of what we are on the other three hundred and sixty four Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar Wilson put on enough clothes for business purposes and went to work under a high pressure of steam He was awake all over All sense of weariness had been swept away by the invigorating refreshment of the great and hopeful discovery which he had made He made fine and accurate reproductions of a number of his records and then enlarged them on a scale of ten to one with his pantograph He did these pantograph enlargements on sheets of white cardboard and made each individual line of the bewildering maze of whorls or curves or loops which consisted of the pattern of a record stand out bold and black by reinforcing it with ink To the untrained eye the collection of delicate originals made by the human finger on the glass plates looked about alike but when enlarged ten times they resembled the markings of a block of wood that has been sawed across the grain and the dullest eye could detect at a glance and at a distance of many feet that no two of the patterns were alike When Wilson had at last finished his tedious and difficult work he arranged his results according to a plan in which a progressive order and sequence was a principal feature then he added to the batch several pantograph enlargements which he had made from time to time in bygone years The night was spent and the day well advanced now By the time he had snatched a trifle of breakfast it was nine o clock and the court was ready to begin its sitting He was in his place twelve minutes later with his records Tom Driscoll caught a slight glimpse of the records and nudged his nearest friend and said with a wink Pudd nhead s got a rare eye to business thinks that as long as he can t win his case it s at least a noble good chance to advertise his window palace decorations without any expense Wilson was informed that his witnesses had been delayed but would arrive presently but he rose and said he should probably not have occasion to make use of their testimony An amused murmur ran through the room It s a clean backdown he gives up without hitting a lick Wilson continued I have other testimony and better This compelled interest and evoked murmurs of surprise that had a detectable ingredient of disappointment in them If I seem to be springing this evidence upon the court I offer as my justification for this that I did not discover its existence until late last night and have been engaged in examining and classifying it ever since until half an hour ago I shall offer it presently but first I wish to say a few preliminary words May it please the court the claim given the front place the claim most persistently urged the claim most strenuously and I may even say aggressively and defiantly insisted upon by the prosecution is this that the person whose hand left the bloodstained fingerprints upon the handle of the Indian knife is the person who committed the murder Wilson paused during several moments to give impressiveness to what he was about to say and then added tranquilly WE GRANT THAT CLAIM It was an electrical surprise No one was prepared for such an admission A buzz of astonishment rose on all sides and people were heard to intimate that the overworked lawyer had lost his mind Even the veteran judge accustomed as he was to legal ambushes and masked batteries in criminal procedure was not sure that his ears were not deceiving him and asked counsel what it was he had said Howard s impassive face betrayed no sign but his attitude and bearing lost something of their careless confidence for a moment Wilson resumed We not only grant that claim but we welcome it and strongly endorse it Leaving that matter for the present we will now proceed to consider other points in the case which we propose to establish by evidence and shall include that one in the chain in its proper place He had made up his mind to try a few hardy guesses in mapping out his theory of the origin and motive of the murder guesses designed to fill up gaps in it guesses which could help if they hit and would probably do no harm if they didn t To my mind certain circumstances of the case before the court seem to suggest a motive for the homicide quite different from the one insisted on by the state It is my conviction that the motive was not revenge but robbery It has been urged that the presence of the accused brothers in that fatal room just after notification that one of them must take the life of Judge Driscoll or lose his own the moment the parties should meet clearly signifies that the natural instinct of self preservation moved my clients to go there secretly and save Count Luigi by destroying his adversary Then why did they stay there after the deed was done missus Pratt had time although she did not hear the cry for help but woke up some moments later to run to that room and there she found these men standing and making no effort to escape If they were guilty they ought to have been running out of the house at the same time that she was running to that room If they had had such a strong instinct toward self preservation as to move them to kill that unarmed man what had become of it now when it should have been more alert than ever Would any of us have remained there Let us not slander our intelligence to that degree Much stress has been laid upon the fact that the accused offered a very large reward for the knife with which this murder was done that no thief came forward to claim that extraordinary reward that the latter fact was good circumstantial evidence that the claim that the knife had been stolen was a vanity and a fraud that these details taken in connection with the memorable and apparently prophetic speech of the deceased concerning that knife and the final discovery of that very knife in the fatal room where no living person was found present with the slaughtered man but the owner of the knife and his brother form an indestructible chain of evidence which fixed the crime upon those unfortunate strangers But I shall presently ask to be sworn and shall testify that there was a large reward offered for the THIEF also and it was offered secretly and not advertised that this fact was indiscreetly mentioned or at least tacitly admitted in what was supposed to be safe circumstances but may NOT have been The thief may have been present himself Tom Driscoll had been looking at the speaker but dropped his eyes at this point In that case he would retain the knife in his possession not daring to offer it for sale or for pledge in a pawnshop There was a nodding of heads among the audience by way of admission that this was not a bad stroke I shall prove to the satisfaction of the jury that there WAS a person in Judge Driscoll s room several minutes before the accused entered it This produced a strong sensation the last drowsy head in the courtroom roused up now and made preparation to listen If it shall seem necessary I will prove by the Misses Clarkson that they met a veiled person ostensibly a woman coming out of the back gate a few minutes after the cry for help was heard This person was not a woman but a man dressed in woman s clothes Another sensation Wilson had his eye on Tom when he hazarded this guess to see what effect it would produce He was satisfied with the result and said to himself It was a success he s hit The object of that person in that house was robbery not murder It is true that the safe was not open but there was an ordinary cashbox on the table with three thousand dollars in it It is easily supposable that the thief was concealed in the house that he knew of this box and of its owner s habit of counting its contents and arranging his accounts at night if he had that habit which I do not assert of course that he tried to take the box while its owner slept but made a noise and was seized and had to use the knife to save himself from capture and that he fled without his booty because he heard help coming I have now done with my theory and will proceed to the evidences by which I propose to try to prove its soundness Wilson took up several of his strips of glass When the audience recognized these familiar mementos of Pudd nhead s old time childish puttering and folly the tense and funereal interest vanished out of their faces and the house burst into volleys of relieving and refreshing laughter and Tom chirked up and joined in the fun himself but Wilson was apparently not disturbed He arranged his records on the table before him and said I beg the indulgence of the court while I make a few remarks in explanation of some evidence which I am about to introduce and which I shall presently ask to be allowed to verify under oath on the witness stand Every human being carries with him from his cradle to his grave certain physical marks which do not change their character and by which he can always be identified and that without shade of doubt or question These marks are his signature his physiological autograph so to speak and this autograph can not be counterfeited nor can he disguise it or hide it away nor can it become illegible by the wear and mutations of time This signature is not his face age can change that beyond recognition it is not his hair for that can fall out it is not his height for duplicates of that exist it is not his form for duplicates of that exist also whereas this signature is each man s very own there is no duplicate of it among the swarming populations of the globe The audience were interested once more This autograph consists of the delicate lines or corrugations with which Nature marks the insides of the hands and the soles of the feet If you will look at the balls of your fingers you that have very sharp eyesight you will observe that these dainty curving lines lie close together like those that indicate the borders of oceans in maps and that they form various clearly defined patterns such as arches circles long curves whorls et cetera and that these patterns differ on the different fingers Every man in the room had his hand up to the light now and his head canted to one side and was minutely scrutinizing the balls of his fingers there were whispered ejaculations of Why it s so I never noticed that before The patterns on the right hand are not the same as those on the left Ejaculations of Why that s so too Taken finger for finger your patterns differ from your neighbor s Comparisons were made all over the house even the judge and jury were absorbed in this curious work The patterns of a twin s right hand are not the same as those on his left One twin s patterns are never the same as his fellow twin s patterns the jury will find that the patterns upon the finger balls of the twins hands follow this rule An examination of the twins hands was begun at once You have often heard of twins who were so exactly alike that when dressed alike their own parents could not tell them apart Yet there was never a twin born in to this world that did not carry from birth to death a sure identifier in this mysterious and marvelous natal autograph That once known to you his fellow twin could never personate him and deceive you Wilson stopped and stood silent Inattention dies a quick and sure death when a speaker does that The stillness gives warning that something is coming All palms and finger balls went down now all slouching forms straightened all heads came up all eyes were fastened upon Wilson s face He waited yet one two three moments to let his pause complete and perfect its spell upon the house then when through the profound hush he could hear the ticking of the clock on the wall he put out his hand and took the Indian knife by the blade and held it aloft where all could see the sinister spots upon its ivory handle then he said in a level and passionless voice Upon this haft stands the assassin s natal autograph written in the blood of that helpless and unoffending old man who loved you and whom you all loved There is but one man in the whole earth whose hand can duplicate that crimson sign he paused and raised his eyes to the pendulum swinging back and forth and please God we will produce that man in this room before the clock strikes noon Stunned distraught unconscious of its own movement the house half rose as if expecting to see the murderer appear at the door and a breeze of muttered ejaculations swept the place Order in the court sit down This from the sheriff He was obeyed and quiet reigned again Wilson stole a glance at Tom and said to himself He is flying signals of distress now even people who despise him are pitying him they think this is a hard ordeal for a young fellow who has lost his benefactor by so cruel a stroke and they are right He resumed his speech For more than twenty years I have amused my compulsory leisure with collecting these curious physical signatures in this town At my house I have hundreds upon hundreds of them Each and every one is labeled with name and date not labeled the next day or even the next hour but in the very minute that the impression was taken When I go upon the witness stand I will repeat under oath the things which I am now saying I have the fingerprints of the court the sheriff and every member of the jury There is hardly a person in this room white or black whose natal signature I cannot produce and not one of them can so disguise himself that I cannot pick him out from a multitude of his fellow creatures and unerringly identify him by his hands And if he and I should live to be a hundred I could still do it The interest of the audience was steadily deepening now I have studied some of these signatures so much that I know them as well as the bank cashier knows the autograph of his oldest customer While I turn my back now I beg that several persons will be so good as to pass their fingers through their hair and then press them upon one of the panes of the window near the jury and that among them the accused may set THEIR finger marks Also I beg that these experimenters or others will set their fingers upon another pane and add again the marks of the accused but not placing them in the same order or relation to the other signatures as before for by one chance in a million a person might happen upon the right marks by pure guesswork ONCE therefore I wish to be tested twice He turned his back and the two panes were quickly covered with delicately lined oval spots but visible only to such persons as could get a dark background for them the foliage of a tree outside for instance Then upon call Wilson went to the window made his examination and said This is Count Luigi s right hand this one three signatures below is his left Here is Count Angelo s right down here is his left Now for the other pane here and here are Count Luigi s here and here are his brother s He faced about Am I right A deafening explosion of applause was the answer The bench said This certainly approaches the miraculous Wilson turned to the window again and remarked pointing with his finger This is the signature of mister Justice Robinson Applause This of Constable Blake Applause This of John Mason juryman Applause This of the sheriff Applause I cannot name the others but I have them all at home named and dated and could identify them all by my fingerprint records He moved to his place through a storm of applause which the sheriff stopped and also made the people sit down for they were all standing and struggling to see of course Court jury sheriff and everybody had been too absorbed in observing Wilson s performance to attend to the audience earlier Now then said Wilson I have here the natal autographs of the two children thrown up to ten times the natural size by the pantograph so that anyone who can see at all can tell the markings apart at a glance We will call the children A and B Here are A s finger marks taken at the age of five months Here they are again taken at seven months Tom started They are alike you see Here are B s at five months and also at seven months They too exactly copy each other but the patterns are quite different from A s you observe I shall refer to these again presently but we will turn them face down now Here thrown up ten sizes are the natal autographs of the two persons who are here before you accused of murdering Judge Driscoll I made these pantograph copies last night and will so swear when I go upon the witness stand I ask the jury to compare them with the finger marks of the accused upon the windowpanes and tell the court if they are the same He passed a powerful magnifying glass to the foreman One juryman after another took the cardboard and the glass and made the comparison Then the foreman said to the judge Your honor we are all agreed that they are identical Wilson said to the foreman Please turn that cardboard face down and take this one and compare it searchingly by the magnifier with the fatal signature upon the knife handle and report your finding to the court Again the jury made minute examinations and again reported We find them to be exactly identical your honor Wilson turned toward the counsel for the prosecution and there was a clearly recognizable note of warning in his voice when he said May it please the court the state has claimed strenuously and persistently that the bloodstained fingerprints upon that knife handle were left there by the assassin of Judge Driscoll You have heard us grant that claim and welcome it He turned to the jury Compare the fingerprints of the accused with the fingerprints left by the assassin and report The comparison began As it proceeded all movement and all sound ceased and the deep silence of an absorbed and waiting suspense settled upon the house and when at last the words came THEY DO NOT EVEN RESEMBLE a thundercrash of applause followed and the house sprang to its feet but was quickly repressed by official force and brought to order again Tom was altering his position every few minutes now but none of his changes brought repose nor any small trifle of comfort When the house s attention was become fixed once more Wilson said gravely indicating the twins with a gesture These men are innocent I have no further concern with them Another outbreak of applause began but was promptly checked We will now proceed to find the guilty Tom s eyes were starting from their sockets yes it was a cruel day for the bereaved youth everybody thought We will return to the infant autographs of A and B I will ask the jury to take these large pantograph facsimilies of A s marked five months and seven months Do they tally The foreman responded Perfectly Now examine this pantograph taken at eight months and also marked A Does it tally with the other two The surprised response was NO THEY DIFFER WIDELY You are quite right Now take these two pantographs of B s autograph marked five months and seven months Do they tally with each other Yes perfectly Take this third pantograph marked B eight months Does it tally with B s other two BY NO MEANS Do you know how to account for those strange discrepancies I will tell you For a purpose unknown to us but probably a selfish one somebody changed those children in the cradle This produced a vast sensation naturally Roxana was astonished at this admirable guess but not disturbed by it To guess the exchange was one thing to guess who did it quite another Pudd nhead Wilson could do wonderful things no doubt but he couldn t do impossible ones Safe She was perfectly safe She smiled privately Between the ages of seven months and eight months those children were changed in the cradle he made one of this effect collecting pauses and added and the person who did it is in this house Roxy s pulses stood still The house was thrilled as with an electric shock and the people half rose as if to seek a glimpse of the person who had made that exchange Tom was growing limp the life seemed oozing out of him Wilson resumed A was put into B s cradle in the nursery B was transferred to the kitchen and became a Negro and a slave Sensation confusion of angry ejaculations but within a quarter of an hour he will stand before you white and free Burst of applause checked by the officers From seven months onward until now A has still been a usurper and in my finger record he bears B s name Here is his pantograph at the age of twelve Compare it with the assassin s signature upon the knife handle Do they tally The foreman answered TO THE MINUTEST DETAIL Wilson said solemnly The murderer of your friend and mine York Driscoll of the generous hand and the kindly spirit sits in among you Valet de Chambre Negro and slave falsely called Thomas a Becket Driscoll make upon the window the fingerprints that will hang you Tom turned his ashen face imploring toward the speaker made some impotent movements with his white lips then slid limp and lifeless to the floor Wilson broke the awed silence with the words There is no need He has confessed Roxy flung herself upon her knees covered her face with her hands and out through her sobs the words struggled De Lord have mercy on me po misasble sinner dat I is The clock struck twelve The court rose the new prisoner handcuffed was removed CONCLUSION It is often the case that the man who can t tell a lie thinks he is the best judge of one Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar OCTOBER twelve THE DISCOVERY It was wonderful to find America but it would have been more wonderful to miss it Pudd nhead Wilson s Calendar The town sat up all night to discuss the amazing events of the day and swap guesses as to when Tom s trial would begin Troop after troop of citizens came to serenade Wilson and require a speech and shout themselves hoarse over every sentence that fell from his lips for all his sentences were golden now all were marvelous His long fight against hard luck and prejudice was ended he was a made man for good And as each of these roaring gangs of enthusiasts marched away some remorseful member of it was quite sure to raise his voice and say And this is the man the likes of us have called a pudd nhead for more than twenty years He has resigned from that position friends Yes but it isn t vacant we re elected The twins were heroes of romance now and with rehabilitated reputations But they were weary of Western adventure and straightway retired to Europe Roxy s heart was broken The young fellow upon whom she had inflicted twenty three years of slavery continued the false heir s pension of thirty five dollars a month to her but her hurts were too deep for money to heal the spirit in her eye was quenched her martial bearing departed with it and the voice of her laughter ceased in the land In her church and its affairs she found her only solace The real heir suddenly found himself rich and free but in a most embarrassing situation He could neither read nor write and his speech was the basest dialect of the Negro quarter His gait his attitudes his gestures his bearing his laugh all were vulgar and uncouth his manners were the manners of a slave Money and fine clothes could not mend these defects or cover them up they only made them more glaring and the more pathetic The poor fellow could not endure the terrors of the white man s parlor and felt at home and at peace nowhere but in the kitchen The family pew was a misery to him yet he could nevermore enter into the solacing refuge of the nigger gallery that was closed to him for good and all But we cannot follow his curious fate further that would be a long story The false heir made a full confession and was sentenced to imprisonment for life But now a complication came up The Percy Driscoll estate was in such a crippled shape when its owner died that it could pay only sixty percent of its great indebtedness and was settled at that rate But the creditors came forward now and complained that inasmuch as through an error for which THEY were in no way to blame the false heir was not inventoried at the time with the rest of the property great wrong and loss had thereby been inflicted upon them They rightly claimed that Tom was lawfully their property and had been so for eight years that they had already lost sufficiently in being deprived of his services during that long period and ought not to be required to add anything to that loss that if he had been delivered up to them in the first place they would have sold him and he could not have murdered Judge Driscoll therefore it was not that he had really committed the murder the guilt lay with the erroneous inventory Everybody saw that there was reason in this Everybody granted that if Tom were white and free it would be unquestionably right to punish him it would be no loss to anybody but to shut up a valuable slave for life that was quite another matter As soon as the Governor understood the case he pardoned Tom at once and the creditors sold him down the river 
1445_139404_000001_000000	train-clean-360	AUTHOR S NOTE TO THOSE EXTRAORDINARY TWINS 
none	none	A man who is not born with the novel writing gift has a troublesome time of it when he tries to build a novel I know this from experience He has no clear idea of his story in fact he has no story He merely has some people in his mind and an incident or two also a locality and he trusts he can plunge those people into those incidents with interesting results So he goes to work To write a novel 
1445_139404_000002_000006	train-clean-360	No that is a thought which comes later in the beginning he is only proposing to tell a little tale a very little tale a six page tale 
none	none	But as it is a tale which he is not acquainted with and can only find out what it is by listening as it goes along telling itself it is more than apt to go on and on and on till it spreads itself into a book I know about this because it has happened to me so many times And I have noticed another thing that as the short tale grows into the long tale the original intention or motif is apt to get abolished and find itself superseded by a quite different one It was so in the case of a magazine sketch which I once started to write a funny and fantastic sketch about a prince and a pauper it presently assumed a grave cast of its own accord and in that new shape spread itself out into a book 
1445_139404_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Much the same thing happened with PUDD NHEAD WILSON 
1445_139404_000003_000003	train-clean-360	I had a sufficiently hard time with that tale because it changed itself from a farce to a tragedy while I was going along with it a most embarrassing circumstance 
none	none	But what was a great deal worse was that it was not one story but two stories tangled together and they obstructed and interrupted each other at every turn and created no end of confusion and annoyance I could not offer the book for publication for I was afraid it would unseat the reader s reason I did not know what was the matter with it for I had not noticed as yet that it was two stories in one 
1445_139404_000003_000006	train-clean-360	It took me months to make that discovery 
1445_139404_000003_000007	train-clean-360	I carried the manuscript back and forth across the Atlantic two or three times and read it and studied over it on shipboard and at last I saw where the difficulty lay 
1445_139404_000003_000008	train-clean-360	I had no further trouble 
1445_139404_000003_000009	train-clean-360	I pulled one of the stories out by the roots and left the other a kind of literary Caesarean operation 
none	none	Would the reader care to know something about the story which I pulled out He has been told many a time how the born and trained novelist works won t he let me round and complete his knowledge by telling him how the jackleg does it 
1445_139404_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Originally the story was called THOSE EXTRAORDINARY TWINS 
1445_139404_000005_000001	train-clean-360	I meant to make it very short 
none	none	I had seen a picture of a youthful Italian freak or freaks which was or which were on exhibition in our cities a combination consisting of two heads and four arms joined to a single body and a single pair of legs and I thought I would write an extravagantly fantastic little story with this freak of nature for hero or heroes a silly young miss for heroine and two old ladies and two boys for the minor parts I lavishly elaborated these people and their doings of course But the tale kept spreading along and spreading along and other people got to intruding themselves and taking up more and more room with their talk and their affairs 
1445_139404_000005_000005	train-clean-360	Among them came a stranger named Pudd nhead Wilson and a woman named Roxana and presently the doings of these two pushed up into prominence a young fellow named Tom Driscoll whose proper place was away in the obscure background 
none	none	Before the book was half finished those three were taking things almost entirely into their own hands and working the whole tale as a private venture of their own a tale which they had nothing at all to do with by rights When the book was finished and I came to look around to see what had become of the team I had originally started out with Aunt Patsy Cooper Aunt Betsy Hale and two boys and Rowena the lightweight heroine they were nowhere to be seen they had disappeared from the story some time or other 
1445_139404_000006_000001	train-clean-360	I hunted about and found them found them stranded idle forgotten and permanently useless 
none	none	It was very awkward It was awkward all around but more particularly in the case of Rowena because there was a love match on between her and one of the twins that constituted the freak and I had worked it up to a blistering heat and thrown in a quite dramatic love quarrel wherein Rowena scathingly denounced her betrothed for getting drunk and scoffed at his explanation of how it had happened and wouldn t listen to it and had driven him from her in the usual forever way and now here she sat crying and brokenhearted for she had found that he had spoken only the truth that it was not he but the other of the freak that had drunk the liquor that made him drunk that her half was a prohibitionist and had never drunk a drop in his life and altogether tight as a brick three days in the week was wholly innocent of blame and indeed when sober was constantly doing all he could to reform his brother the other half who never got any satisfaction out of drinking anyway because liquor never affected him Yes here she was stranded with that deep injustice of hers torturing her poor torn heart 
1445_139404_000007_000000	train-clean-360	I didn t know what to do with her 
none	none	I was as sorry for her as anybody could be but the campaign was over the book was finished she was sidetracked and there was no possible way of crowding her in anywhere I could not leave her there of course it would not do After spreading her out so and making such a to do over her affairs it would be absolutely necessary to account to the reader for her 
1445_139404_000007_000004	train-clean-360	I thought and thought and studied and studied but I arrived at nothing 
1445_139404_000007_000005	train-clean-360	I finally saw plainly that there was really no way but one I must simply give her the grand bounce 
1445_139404_000007_000006	train-clean-360	It grieved me to do it for after associating with her so much I had come to kind of like her after a fashion notwithstanding she was such an ass and said such stupid irritating things and was so nauseatingly sentimental 
none	none	Still it had to be done 
1445_139404_000007_000008	train-clean-360	So at the top of Chapter XVII I put a Calendar remark concerning July the Fourth and began the chapter with this statistic 
none	none	Rowena went out in the backyard after supper to see the fireworks and fell down the well and got drowned 
1445_139404_000009_000000	train-clean-360	It seemed abrupt but I thought maybe the reader wouldn t notice it because I changed the subject right away to something else 
none	none	Anyway it loosened up Rowena from where she was stuck and got her out of the way and that was the main thing It seemed a prompt good way of weeding out people that had got stalled and a plenty good enough way for those others so I hunted up the two boys and said They went out back one night to stone the cat and fell down the well and got drowned Next I searched around and found old Aunt Patsy and Aunt Betsy Hale where they were around and said They went out back one night to visit the sick and fell down the well and got drowned I was going to drown some others but I gave up the idea partly because I believed that if I kept that up it would arouse attention and perhaps sympathy with those people and partly because it was not a large well and would not hold any more anyway 
1445_139404_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Still the story was unsatisfactory 
none	none	Here was a set of new characters who were become inordinately prominent and who persisted in remaining so to the end and back yonder was an older set who made a large noise and a great to do for a little while and then suddenly played out utterly and fell down the well 
1445_139404_000010_000002	train-clean-360	There was a radical defect somewhere and I must search it out and cure it 
none	none	The defect turned out to be the one already spoken of two stories in one a farce and a tragedy So I pulled out the farce and left the tragedy This left the original team in but only as mere names not as characters Their prominence was wholly gone they were not even worth drowning so I removed that detail 
1445_139404_000011_000004	train-clean-360	Also I took the twins apart and made two separate men of them 
none	none	They had no occasion to have foreign names now but it was too much trouble to remove them all through so I left them christened as they were and made no explanation End of the Project
