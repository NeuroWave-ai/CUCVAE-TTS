EBOOK ROBINSON CRUSOE Produced by Bruce W Miller ROBINSON CRUSOE IN WORDS OF ONE SYLLABLE By Mary Godolphin PREFACE The production of a book which is adapted to the use of the youngest readers needs but few words of excuse or apology The nature of the work seems to be sufficiently explained by the title itself and the author s task has been chiefly to reduce the ordinary language into words of one syllable But although as far as the subject matter is concerned the book can lay no claims to originality it is believed that the idea and scope of its construction are entirely novel for the One Syllable literature of the present day furnishes little more than a few short unconnected sentences and those chiefly in spelling books The deep interest which De Foe s story has never failed to arouse in the minds of the young induces the author to hope that it may be acceptable in its present form It should be stated that exceptions to the rule of using words of one syllable exclusively have been made in the case of the proper names of the boy Xury and of the man Friday and in the titles of the illustrations that accompany this work ROBINSON CRUSOE IN WORDS OF ONE SYLLABLE I was born at York on the first of March in the sixth year of the reign of King Charles the First From the time when I was quite a young child I had felt a great wish to spend my life at sea and as I grew so did this taste grow more and more strong till at last I broke loose from my school and home and found my way on foot to Hull where I soon got a place on board a ship When we had set sail but a few days a squall of wind came on and on the fifth night we sprang a leak All hands were sent to the pumps but we felt the ship groan in all her planks and her beams quake from stem to stern so that it was soon quite clear there was no hope for her and that all we could do was to save our lives The first thing was to fire off guns to show that we were in need of help and at length a ship which lay not far from us sent a boat to our aid But the sea was too rough for it to lie near our ship s side so we threw out a rope which the men in the boat caught and made fast and by this means we all got in Still in so wild a sea it was in vain to try to get on board the ship which had sent out the men or to use our oars in the boat and all we could do was to let it drive to shore In the space of half an hour our own ship struck on a rock and went down and we saw her no more We made but slow way to the land which we caught sight of now and then when the boat rose to the top of some high wave and there we saw men who ran in crowds to and fro all bent on one thing and that was to save us At last to our great joy we got on shore where we had the luck to meet with friends who gave us the means to get back to Hull and if I had now had the good sense to go home it would have been well for me The man whose ship had gone down said with a grave look Young lad you ought to go to sea no more it is not the kind of life for you Why Sir will you go to sea no more then That is not the same kind of thing I was bred to the sea but you were not and came on board my ship just to find out what a life at sea was like and you may guess what you will come to if you do not go back to your home God will not bless you and it may be that you have brought all this woe on us I spoke not a word more to him which way he went I knew not nor did I care to know for I was hurt at this rude speech Shall I go home thought I or shall I go to sea Shame kept me from home and I could not make up my mind what course of life to take As it has been my fate through life to choose for the worst so I did now I had gold in my purse and good clothes on my back and to sea I went once more But I had worse luck this time than the last for when we were far out at sea some Turks in a small ship came on our track in full chase We set as much sail as our yards would bear so as to get clear from them But in spite of this we saw our foes gain on us and we felt sure that they would come up with our ship in a few hours time At last they caught us but we brought our guns to bear on them which made them shear off for a time yet they kept up a fire at us as long as they were in range The next time the Turks came up some of their men got on board our ship and set to work to cut the sails and do us all kinds of harm So as ten of our men lay dead and most of the rest had wounds we gave in The chief of the Turks took me as his prize to a port which was held by the Moors He did not use me so ill as at first I thought he would have done but he set me to work with the rest of his slaves This was a change in my life which I did not think had been in store for me How my heart sank with grief at the thought of those whom I had left at home nay to whom I had not had the grace so much as to say Good bye when I went to sea nor to give a hint of what I meant to do Yet all that I went through at this time was but a taste of the toils and cares which it has since been my lot to bear I thought at first that the Turk might take me with him when next he went to sea and so I should find some way to get free but the hope did not last long for at such times he left me on shore to see to his crops This kind of life I led for two years and as the Turk knew and saw more of me he made me more and more free He went out in his boat once or twice a week to catch a kind of flat fish and now and then he took me and a boy with him for we were quick at this kind of sport and he grew quite fond of me One day the Turk sent me in the boat to catch some fish with no one else but a man and a boy While we were out so thick a fog came on that though we were out not half a mile from the shore we quite lost sight of it for twelve hours and when the sun rose the next day our boat was at least ten miles out at sea The wind blew fresh and we were all much in want of food but at last with the help of our oars and sail we got back safe to land When the Turk heard how we had lost our way he said that the next time he went out he would take a boat that would hold all we could want if we were kept out at sea So he had quite a state room built in the long boat of his ship as well as a room for us slaves One day he sent me to trim the boat as he had two friends who would go in it to fish with him But when the time came they did not go so he sent me with the man and the boy whose name was Xury to catch some fish for the guests that were to sup with him Now the thought struck me all at once that this would be a good chance to set off with the boat and get free So in the first place I took all the food that I could lay my hands on and I told the man that it would be too bold of us to eat of the bread that had been put in the boat for the Turk He said he thought so too and he brought down a small sack of rice and some rusks While the man was on shore I put up some wine a large lump of wax a saw an axe a spade some rope and all sorts of things that might be of use to us I knew where the Turk s case of wine was and I put that in the boat while the man was on shore By one more trick I got all that I had need of I said to the boy the Turk s guns are in the boat but there is no shot Do you think you could get some You know where it is kept and we may want to shoot a fowl or two So he brought a case and a pouch which held all that we could want for the guns These I put in the boat and then set sail out of the port to fish The wind blew from the North or North West which was a bad wind for me for had it been South I could have made for the coast of Spain But blow which way it might my mind was made up to get off and to leave the rest to fate I then let down my lines to fish but I took care to have bad sport and when the fish bit I would not pull them up for the Moor was not to see them I said to him This will not do we shall catch no fish here we ought to sail on a bit Well the Moor thought there was no harm in this He set the sails and as the helm was in my hands I ran the boat out a mile or more and then brought her to as if I meant to fish Now thought I the time has come for me to get free I gave the helm to the boy and then took the Moor round the waist and threw him out of the boat Down he went but soon rose up for he swam like a duck He said he would go all round the world with me if I would but take him in I had some fear lest he should climb up the boat s side and force his way back so I brought my gun to point at him and said You can swim to land with ease if you choose make haste then to get there but if you come near the boat you shall have a shot through the head for I mean to be a free man from this hour He then swam for the shore and no doubt got safe there as the sea was so calm At first I thought I would take the Moor with me and let Xury swim to land but the Moor was not a man that I could trust When he was gone I said to Xury If you will swear to be true to me you shall be a great man in time if not I must throw you out of the boat too The poor boy gave me such a sweet smile as he swore to be true to me that I could not find it in my heart to doubt him While the man was still in view for he was on his way to the land we stood out to sea with the boat so that he and those that saw us from the shore might think we had gone to the straits mouth for no one went to the South coast as a tribe of men dwelt there who were known to kill and eat their foes We then bent our course to the East so as to keep in with the shore and as we had a fair wind and a smooth sea by the next day at noon we were not less than one hundred fifty miles out of the reach of the Turk I had still some fear lest I should be caught by the Moors so I would not go on shore in the day time But when it grew dark we made our way to the coast and came to the mouth of a stream from which we thought we could swim to land and then look round us But as soon as it was quite dark we heard strange sounds barks roars grunts and howls The poor lad said he could not go on shore till dawn 
7769-99395-0001	train-other-500	Well said I
none	none	 then we must give it up but it may be that in the day time we shall be seen by men who for all we know would do us more harm than wild beasts Then we give them the shoot gun said Xury with a laugh and make them run away I was glad to see so much mirth in the boy and gave him some bread and rice We lay still at night but did not sleep long for in a few hours time some huge beasts came down to the sea to bathe The poor boy shook from head to foot at the sight One of these beasts came near our boat and though it was too dark to see him well we heard him puff and blow and knew that he must be a large one by the noise he made At last the brute came as near to the boat as two oars length so I shot at him and he swam to the shore The roar and cries set up by beasts and birds at the noise of my gun would seem to show that we had made a bad choice of a place to land on but be that as it would to shore we had to go to find some fresh spring so that we might fill our casks Xury said if I would let him go with one of the jars he would find out if the springs were fit to drink and if they were sweet he would bring the jar back full Why should you go said I 
7769-99395-0000	train-other-500	Why should not I go and you stay in the boat At this Xury said if wild mans come they eat me you go way
none	none	 I could not but love the lad for this kind speech Well said I we will both go and if the wild men come we must kill them 
7769-99395-0002	train-other-500	they shall not eat you or me
none	none	 I gave Xury some rum from the Turk s case to cheer him up and we went on shore The boy went off with his gun full a mile from the spot where we stood 
7769-99395-0003	train-other-500	and came back with a hare that he had shot which we were glad to cook and eat
none	none	 but the good news which he brought was that he had found a spring 
7769-99395-0004	train-other-500	and had seen no wild men I made a guess
none	none	 that the Cape de Verd Isles were not far off 
7769-99395-0005	train-other-500	for I saw the top of the Great Peak which I knew was near them My one hope was that if I kept near the coast I should find some ship that would take us on board and then and not till then
7769-99395-0006	train-other-500	should I feel a free man
none	none	 In a word I put the whole of my fate on this chance 
7769-99395-0007	train-other-500	that I must meet with some ship or die
none	none	 On the coast we saw some men 
7769-99395-0008	train-other-500	who stood to look at us They were black and wore no clothes
none	none	 I would have gone on shore to them but Xury 
7769-99395-0009	train-other-500	who knew best said Not you go Not you go So I brought the boat as near the land as I could that I might talk to them and they kept up with me a long way
none	none	 I saw that one of them had a lance in his hand 
7769-99395-0010	train-other-500	I made signs that they should bring me some food and they on their part made signs for me to stop my boat So I let down the top of my sail and lay by
none	none	 while two of them ran off 
7769-99395-0011	train-other-500	and in less than half an hour they came back with some dry meat and a sort of corn which is grown in this part of the world
none	none	 This we should have been glad to get but knew not how to do so for we durst not go on shore to them 
7769-99395-0012	train-other-500	nor did they dare to come to us At last they took a safe way for us all for they brought the food to the shore where they set it down
none	none	 and then went a long way off while we took it in We made signs to show our thanks for we had not a thing that we could spare to give them 
7769-99395-0013	train-other-500	But as good luck would have it we were at hand to take a great prize for them for two wild beasts of the same kind as the first I spoke of came in full chase from the hills down to the sea
none	none	 They swam as if they had come for sport The men flew from them in fear all but the one who held the lance 
7769-99395-0014	train-other-500	One of these beasts came near our boat so I lay in wait for him with my gun and as soon as the brute was in range I shot him through the head Twice he sank down in the sea and twice he came up
7769-99395-0015	train-other-500	and then just swam to the land where he fell down dead The men were in as much fear at the sound of my gun as they had been at the sight of the beasts But when I made signs for them to come to the shore
7769-99395-0016	train-other-500	they took heart and came They at once made for their prize and by the help of a rope which they slung round him they brought him safe on the beach
none	none	 We now left our wild men and went on and on for twelve days more 
7769-99395-0017	train-other-500	The land in front of us ran out four or five miles like a bill and we had to keep some way from the coast to make this point so that we lost sight of the shore
none	none	 I gave the helm to Xury and sat down to think what would be my best course to take 
7769-99395-0018	train-other-500	when all at once I heard the lad cry out A ship with a sail A ship with a sail
none	none	 He did not show much joy at the sight for he thought that this ship had been sent out to take him back 
7769-99395-0019	train-other-500	but I knew well from the look of her that she was not one of the Turk s I made all the sail I could to come in the ship s way
none	none	 and told Xury to fire a gun 
7769-99395-0020	train-other-500	in the hope that if those on deck could not hear the sound they might see the smoke This they did see and then let down their sails so that we might come up to them
none	none	 and in three hours time we were at the ship s side 
7769-99395-0021	train-other-500	The men spoke to us in French
none	none	 but I could not make out what they meant 
7769-99395-0022	train-other-500	At last a Scot on board said in my own tongue Who are you Whence do you come I told him in a few words how I had got free from the Moors Then the man who had charge of the ship bade me come on board
none	none	 and took me in with Xury and all my goods 
7769-99395-0023	train-other-500	I told him that he might take all I had but he said
none	none	 You shall have your goods back when we come to land 
7769-99395-0024	train-other-500	for I have but done for you what you would have done for me had I been in the same plight
none	none	 He gave me a good round sum for my boat and said that I should have the same sum for Xury if I would part with him 
7769-99395-0025	train-other-500	But I told him that as it was by the boy s help that I had got free
none	none	 I was loath to sell him 
7769-99395-0026	train-other-500	He said it was just and right in me to feel thus but at the same time if I could make up my mind to part with him he should be set free in two years time So
none	none	 as the poor slave had a wish to go with him I did not say no I got to All Saints Bay in three weeks 
7769-99395-0027	train-other-500	and was now a free man I had made a good sum by all my store
none	none	 and with this I went on land But I did not at all know what to do next 
7769-99395-0028	train-other-500	At length I met with a man whose case was much the same as my own and we both took some land to farm My stock like his was low but we made our farms serve to keep us in food
7769-99395-0029	train-other-500	though not more than that
none	none	 We both stood in need of help and I saw now that I had done wrong to part with my boy I did not at all like this kind of life What thought I have I come all this way to do that which I could have done as well at home with my friends 
7769-99395-0030	train-other-500	round me And to add to my grief the kind friend who had brought me here in his ship now meant to leave these shores On my first start to sea when a boy
7769-99395-0031	train-other-500	I had put a small sum in the hands of an aunt and this my friend said I should do well to spend on my farm So when he got home he sent some of it in cash
none	none	 and laid out the rest in cloth stuffs baize 
7769-99395-0032	train-other-500	and such like goods My aunt had put a few pounds in my friend s hands as a gift to him
none	none	 to show her thanks for all that he had done for me 
7769-99395-0033	train-other-500	and with this sum he was so kind as to buy me a slave In the mean time I had bought a slave so now I had two
none	none	 and all went on well for the next year But soon my plans grew too large for my means 
7769-99395-0034	train-other-500	One day some men came to ask me to take charge of a slave ship to be sent out by them They said they would give me a share in the slaves and pay the cost of the stock
7769-99395-0035	train-other-500	This would have been a good thing for me if I had not had farms and land
none	none	 but it was wild and rash to think of it now 
7769-99395-0036	train-other-500	for I had made a large sum
none	none	 and ought to have gone on in the same way for three or four years more 
7769-99395-0037	train-other-500	Well I told these men that I would go with all my heart if they would look to my farm in the mean time which they said they would do So
none	none	 I made my will and went on board this ship on the same day on which eight years since I had left Hull 
7769-99395-0038	train-other-500	She had six guns twelve men and a boy We took with us saws chains toys beads bits of glass
none	none	 and such like ware to suit the taste of those with whom we had to trade We were not more than twelve days from the Line when a high wind took us off 
7769-99395-0039	train-other-500	we knew not where All at once there was a cry of
none	none	 Land 
7769-99395-0040	train-other-500	and the ship struck on a bank of sand in which she sank so deep that we could not get her off
none	none	 At last we found that we must make up our minds to leave her and get to shore as well as we could 
7769-99395-0041	train-other-500	There had been a boat at her stern but we found it had been torn off by the force of the waves One small boat was still left on the ship s side so
none	none	 we got in it There we were all of us on the wild sea 
7769-99395-0042	train-other-500	The heart of each now grew faint our cheeks were pale and our eyes were dim for there was but one hope and that was to find some bay and so get in the lee of the land
7769-99395-0043	train-other-500	We now gave up our whole souls to God The sea grew more and more rough and its white foam would curl and boil
none	none	 At last the waves in their wild sport 
7769-99395-0044	train-other-500	burst on the boat s side
none	none	 and we were all thrown out I could swim well but the force of the waves made me lose my breath too much to do so 
7769-99395-0045	train-other-500	At length one large wave took me to the shore and left me high and dry though half dead with fear
none	none	 I got on my feet and made the best of my way for the land 
7769-99395-0046	train-other-500	but just then the curve of a huge wave rose up as high as a hill and this I had no strength to keep from so it took me back to the sea
7769-99395-0047	train-other-500	I did my best to float on the top and held my breath to do so The next wave was quite as high and shut me up in its bulk I held my hands down tight to my side
7769-99395-0048	train-other-500	and then my head shot out at the top of the waves This gave me heart and breath too and soon my feet felt the ground I stood quite still for a short time to let the sea run back from me
7769-99395-0049	train-other-500	and then I set off with all my might to the shore
none	none	 but yet the waves caught me and twice more did they take me back 
7769-99395-0050	train-other-500	and twice more land me on the shore I thought the last wave would have been the death of me
none	none	 for it drove me on a piece of rock 
7769-99395-0051	train-other-500	and with such force as to leave me in a kind of swoon which thank God did not last long
none	none	 At length 
7769-99395-0052	train-other-500	to my great joy I got up to the cliffs close to the shore where I found some grass out of the reach of the sea There I sat down safe on land at last
7769-99395-0053	train-other-500	I could but cry out in the words of the Psalm They that go down to the sea in ships these men see the works of the Lord in the deep For at His word the storms rise
none	none	 the winds blow and lift up the waves 
7769-99395-0054	train-other-500	then do they mount to the sky and from thence go down to the deep My soul faints I reel to and fro and am at my wit s end
7769-99395-0055	train-other-500	then the Lord brings me out of all my fears
none	none	 I felt so wrapt in joy that all I could do was to walk up and down the coast 
7769-99395-0056	train-other-500	now lift up my hands now fold them on my breast and thank God for all that He had done for me when the rest of the men were lost
none	none	 All lost but I 
7769-99395-0057	train-other-500	and I was safe I now cast my eyes round me
none	none	 to find out what kind of a place it was that I had been thus thrown in 
7769-99395-0058	train-other-500	like a bird in a storm Then all the glee I felt at first left me
none	none	 for I was wet and cold and had no dry clothes to put on no food to eat and not a friend to help me There were wild beasts here but I had no gun to shoot them with or to keep me from their jaws 
7769-99396-0000	train-other-500	I had but a knife and a pipe It now grew dark
none	none	 and where was I to go for the night 
7769-99396-0001	train-other-500	I thought the top of some high tree would be a good place to keep me out of harm s way and that there I might sit and think of death for as yet I had no hopes of life
none	none	 Well I went to my tree and made a kind of nest to sleep in 
7769-99396-0002	train-other-500	Then I cut a stick to keep off the beasts of prey in case they should come and fell to sleep just as if the branch I lay on had been a bed of down When I woke up it was broad day
7769-99396-0003	train-other-500	the sky too was clear and the sea calm
none	none	 But I saw from the top of the tree that in the night the ship had left the bank of sand 
7769-99396-0004	train-other-500	and lay but a mile from me while the boat was on the beach two miles on my right I went some way down by the shore to get to the boat
none	none	 but an arm of the sea half a mile broad kept me from it At noon the tide went a long way out 
7769-99396-0005	train-other-500	so that I could get near the ship and here I found
none	none	 that if we had but made up our minds to stay on board 
7769-99396-0006	train-other-500	we should all have been safe
none	none	 I shed tears at the thought for I could not help it 
7769-99396-0007	train-other-500	yet as there was no use in that it struck me that the best thing for me to do was to swim to the ship I soon threw off my clothes took to the sea and swam up to the wreck
7769-99396-0008	train-other-500	But how was I to get on deck I had swam twice round the ship when a piece of rope caught my eye
none	none	 which hung down from her side so low 
7769-99396-0009	train-other-500	that at first the waves hid it By the help of this rope I got on board I found that there was a bulge in the ship and that she had sprung a leak
7769-99396-0010	train-other-500	You may be sure that my first thought was to look round for some food and I soon made my way to the bin where the bread was kept and ate some of it as I went to and fro for there was no time to lose
7769-99396-0011	train-other-500	There was too some rum of which I took a good draught and this gave me heart What I stood most in need of was a boat to take the goods to shore
none	none	 But it was vain to wish for that which could not be had 
7769-99396-0012	train-other-500	and as there were some spare yards in the ship two or three large planks of wood and a spare mast or two I fell to work with these to make a raft I put four spars side by side
7769-99396-0013	train-other-500	and laid short bits of plank on them cross ways to make my raft strong Though these planks would bear my own weight they were too slight to bear much of my freight So
none	none	 I took a saw 
7769-99396-0014	train-other-500	which was on board and cut a mast in three lengths and these gave great strength to the raft I found some bread and rice a Dutch cheese and some dry goat s flesh There had been some wheat
7769-99396-0015	train-other-500	but the rats had got at it and it was all gone My next task was to screen my goods from the spray of the sea
none	none	 and it did not take me long to do this for there were three large chests on board which held all 
7769-99396-0016	train-other-500	and these I put on the raft When the high tide came up it took off my coat and shirt which I had left on the shore but there were some fresh clothes in the ship
7769-99396-0017	train-other-500	See here is a prize said I out loud
none	none	 though there were none to hear me 
7769-99396-0018	train-other-500	now I shall not starve For I found four large guns But how was my raft to be got to land I had no sail no oars
7769-99396-0019	train-other-500	and a gust of wind would make all my store slide off
none	none	 Yet there were three things which I was glad of 
7769-99396-0020	train-other-500	a calm sea a tide which set in to the shore and a slight breeze to blow me there I had the good luck to find some oars in a part of the ship in which I had made no search till now
none	none	 With these I put to sea and for half a mile my raft went well 
7769-99396-0021	train-other-500	but soon I found it drove to one side At length I saw a creek to which with some toil I took my raft and now the beach was so near that I felt my oar touch the ground
7769-99396-0022	train-other-500	Here I had well nigh lost my freight for the shore lay on a slope so that there was no place to land on save where one end of the raft would lie so high and one end so low
7769-99396-0023	train-other-500	that all my goods would fall off To wait till the tide came up was all that could be done So when the sea was a foot deep I thrust the raft
none	none	 on a flat piece of ground to moor her there 
7769-99396-0024	train-other-500	and stuck my two oars in the sand one on each side of the raft Thus I let her lie till the ebb of the tide and when it went down she was left safe on land with all her freight
7769-99396-0025	train-other-500	I saw that there were birds on the isle and I shot one of them Mine must have been the first gun that had been heard there since the world was made for at the sound of it
7769-99396-0026	train-other-500	whole flocks of birds flew up with loud cries from all parts of the wood
none	none	 The shape of the beak of the one I shot was like that of a hawk but the claws were not so large I now went back to my raft to land my stores 
7769-99396-0027	train-other-500	and this took up the rest of the day What to do at night I knew not
none	none	 nor where to find a safe place to land my stores on I did not like to lie down on the ground 
7769-99396-0028	train-other-500	for fear of beasts of prey as well as snakes but there was no cause for these fears as I have since found I put the chests and boards round me as well as I could
7769-99396-0029	train-other-500	and made a kind of hut for the night As there was still a great store of things left in the ship which would be of use to me
none	none	 I thought that I ought to bring them to land at once 
7769-99396-0030	train-other-500	for I knew that the first storm would break up the ship
none	none	 So I went on board 
7769-99396-0031	train-other-500	and took good care this time not to load my raft too much The first thing I sought for was the tool chest and in it were some bags of nails spikes saws
none	none	 knives and such things but best of all I found a stone to grind my tools on There were two or three flasks some large bags of shot 
7769-99396-0032	train-other-500	and a roll of lead but this last I had not the strength to hoist up to the ship s side so as to get it on my raft There were some spare sails too which I brought to shore
none	none	 I had some fear lest my stores might be run off with by beasts of prey if not by men but I found all safe and sound when I went back and no one had come there but a wild cat 
7769-99396-0033	train-other-500	which sat on one of the chests When I came up I held my gun at her but as she did not know
none	none	 what a gun was this did not rouse her She ate a piece of dry goat s flesh and then took her leave 
7769-99396-0034	train-other-500	Now that I had two freights of goods at hand I made a tent with the ship s sails to stow them in and cut the poles for it from the wood
none	none	 I now took all the things out of the casks and chests 
7769-99396-0035	train-other-500	and put the casks in piles round the tent
none	none	 to give it strength and when this was done I shut up the door with the boards 
7769-99396-0036	train-other-500	spread one of the beds which I had brought from the ship on the ground laid two guns close to my head and went to bed for the first time I slept all night for I was much in need of rest
7769-99396-0037	train-other-500	The next day I was sad and sick at heart
none	none	 for I felt how dull it was to be thus cut off from all the rest of the world I had no great wish for work 
7769-99396-0038	train-other-500	but there was too much to be done for me to dwell long on my sad lot
none	none	 Each day as it came I went off to the wreck to fetch more things 
7769-99396-0039	train-other-500	and I brought back as much as the raft would hold One day I had put too great a load on the raft which made it sink down on one side so that the goods were lost in the sea
none	none	 but at this I did not fret as the chief part of the freight was some rope which would not have been of much use to me The twelve days that I had been in the isle 
7769-99396-0040	train-other-500	were spent in this way and I had brought to land all that one pair of hands could lift though if the sea had been still calm I might have brought the whole ship piece by piece The last time
7769-99396-0041	train-other-500	I swam to the wreck the wind blew so hard that I made up my mind to go on board next time at low tide I found some tea and some gold coin but as to the gold it made me laugh to look at it
7769-99396-0042	train-other-500	O drug said I Thou art of no use to me
none	none	 I care not to save thee Stay where thou art 
7769-99396-0043	train-other-500	till the ship go down then go thou with it
none	none	 Still I thought I might as well just take it 
7769-99396-0044	train-other-500	so I put it in a piece of the sail
none	none	 and threw it on deck that I might place it on the raft Bye and bye the wind blew from the shore 
7769-99396-0045	train-other-500	so I had to swim back with all speed for I knew that at the turn of the tide I should find it hard work to get to land at all But in spite of the high wind I came to my home all safe
7769-99396-0046	train-other-500	At dawn of day I put my head out and cast my eyes on the sea When lo no ship was there
none	none	 This change in the face of things and the loss of such a friend quite struck me down Yet I was glad to think that I had brought to shore all that could be of use to me 
7769-99396-0047	train-other-500	I had now to look out for some spot where I could make my home Half way up a hill there was a small plain four or five score feet long and twice as broad and
7769-99396-0048	train-other-500	as it had a full view of the sea I thought that it would be a good place for my house I first dug a trench round a space which took in twelve yards and in this I drove
7769-99396-0049	train-other-500	two rows of stakes till they stood firm like piles five and a half feet from the ground I made the stakes close and tight with bits of rope
7769-99396-0050	train-other-500	and put small sticks on the top of them in the shape of spikes This made so strong a fence that no man or beast could get in The door of my house was on the top and I had to climb up to it by steps
7769-99396-0051	train-other-500	which I took in with me so that no one else might come up by the same way Close to the back of the house stood a high rock in which I made a cave
none	none	 and laid all the earth that I had dug out of it 
7769-99396-0052	train-other-500	round my house to the height of a foot and a half I had to go out once a day in search of food
none	none	 The first time I saw some goats but they were too shy and swift of foot 
7769-99396-0053	train-other-500	to let me get near them At last I lay in wait for them close to their own haunts
none	none	 If they saw me in the vale though they might be on high ground they would run off wild with fear 
7769-99396-0054	train-other-500	but if they were in the vale and I on high ground they took no heed of me The first goat I shot had a kid by her side and when the old one fell
7769-99396-0055	train-other-500	the kid stood near her till I took her off on my back and then the young one ran by my side
none	none	 I put down the goat and brought the kid home to tame it but as it was too young to feed I had to kill it At first I thought that for the lack of pen and ink I should lose all note of time so I made a large post in the shape of a cross on which I cut these words 
7769-99397-0000	train-other-500	I came on these shores on the eighth day of June in the year sixteen fifty nine On the side of this post I made a notch each day as it came and this I kept up till the last
none	none	 I have not yet said a word of my four pets which were two cats a dog and a bird 
7769-99397-0001	train-other-500	You may guess how fond I was of them for they were all the friends left to me I brought the dog and two cats from the ship The dog would fetch things for me at all times and by his bark
7769-99397-0002	train-other-500	his whine his growl and his tricks he would all but talk to me
none	none	 yet he could not give me thought for thought If I could but have had some one near me to find fault with 
7769-99397-0003	train-other-500	or to find fault with me what a treat it would have been Now that I had brought ink from the ship I wrote down a sketch of each day as it came not so much to leave to those who might read it
7769-99397-0004	train-other-500	when I was dead and gone as to get rid of my own thoughts and draw me from the fears which all day long dwelt on my mind
none	none	 till my head would ache with the weight of them I was a long way out of the course of ships and oh how dull it was to be cast on this lone spot with no one to love no one to make me laugh no one to make me weep 
7769-99397-0005	train-other-500	no one to make me think It was dull to roam day by day from the wood to the shore
none	none	 and from the shore back to the wood and feed on my own thoughts all the while 
7769-99397-0006	train-other-500	So much for the sad view of my case but like most things it had a bright side as well as a dark one For here was I safe on land
7769-99397-0007	train-other-500	while all the rest of the ship s crew were lost
none	none	 Well thought I 
7769-99397-0008	train-other-500	God who shapes our ways and led me by the hand then can save me from this state now
none	none	 or send some one to be with me 
7769-99397-0009	train-other-500	true I am cast on a rough and rude part of the globe but there are no beasts of prey on it to kill or hurt me
none	none	 God has sent the ship so near to me that I have got from it all things to meet my wants for the rest of my days Let life be what it may there is sure to be much to thank God for 
7769-99397-0010	train-other-500	and I soon gave up all dull thoughts
none	none	 and did not so much 
7769-99397-0011	train-other-500	as look out for a sail My goods from the wreck had been in the cave for more than ten months and it was time now to put them right as they took up all the space and left me no room to turn in
7769-99397-0012	train-other-500	so I made my small cave a large one and dug it out a long way back in the sand rock Then I brought the mouth of it up to the fence and so made a back way to my house
7769-99397-0013	train-other-500	This done I put shelves on each side to hold my goods which made my cave look like a shop full of stores To make these shelves I cut down a tree and with the help of a saw an axe a plane
7769-99397-0014	train-other-500	and some more tools I made boards A chair and a desk to write on came next I rose in good time and set to work till noon then I ate my meal
none	none	 then I went out with my gun 
7769-99397-0015	train-other-500	and to work once more till the sun had set and then to bed
none	none	 It took me more than a week to change the shape and size of my cave 
7769-99397-0016	train-other-500	but I had made it far too large for in course of time the earth fell in from the roof
none	none	 and 
7769-99397-0017	train-other-500	had I been in it when this took place I should have lost my life I had now to set up posts in my cave with planks on the top of them so as to make a roof of wood
none	none	 One day when out with my gun I shot a wild cat 
7769-99397-0018	train-other-500	the skin of which made me a cap
none	none	 and I found some birds of the dove tribe which built their nests in the holes of rocks 
7769-99397-0019	train-other-500	I had to go to bed at dusk till I made a lamp of goat s fat which I put in a clay dish and this
none	none	 with a piece of hemp for a wick made a good light 
7769-99397-0020	train-other-500	As I had found a use for the bag which had held the fowl s food on board ship I shook out from it the husks of corn This was just at the time when the great rains fell
7769-99397-0021	train-other-500	and in the course of a month blades of rice corn and rye sprang up As time went by and the grain was ripe I kept it and took care to sow it each year
none	none	 but I could not boast of a crop of wheat as will be shown bye and bye for three years 
7769-99397-0022	train-other-500	A thing now took place on the isle which no one could have dreamt of and which struck me down with fear It was this the ground shook with great force
none	none	 which threw down earth from the rock with a loud crash 
7769-99397-0023	train-other-500	once more there was a shock and now the earth fell from the roof of my cave
none	none	 The sea did not look the same as it had done 
7769-99397-0024	train-other-500	for the shocks were just as strong there as on land
none	none	 The sway of the earth made me feel sick 
7769-99397-0025	train-other-500	and there was a noise and a roar all around me
none	none	 The same kind of shock came a third time 
7769-99397-0026	train-other-500	and when it had gone off I sat quite still on the ground for I knew not what to do
none	none	 Then the clouds grew dark the wind rose 
7769-99397-0027	train-other-500	trees were torn up by the roots
none	none	 the sea was a mass of foam and froth 
7769-99397-0028	train-other-500	and a great part of the isle was laid waste with the storm I thought that the world had come to an end In three hours time all was calm
7769-99397-0029	train-other-500	but rain fell all that night and a great part of the next day Now though quite worn out I had to move my goods which were in the cave to some safe place
7769-99397-0030	train-other-500	I knew that tools would be my first want and that I should have to grind mine on the stone
none	none	 as they were blunt and worn with use But as it took both hands to hold the tool I could not turn the stone 
7769-99397-0031	train-other-500	so I made a wheel by which I could move it with my foot This was no small task but I took great pains with it and at length it was done
7769-99397-0032	train-other-500	The rain fell for some days and a cold chill came on me in short I was ill I had pains in my head and could get no sleep at night
none	none	 and my thoughts were wild and strange 
7769-99397-0033	train-other-500	At one time I shook with cold and then a hot fit came on
none	none	 with faint sweats 
7769-99397-0034	train-other-500	which would last six hours at a time Ill as I was I had to go out with my gun to get food I shot a goat but it was a great toil to bring it home and still more to cook it
7769-99397-0035	train-other-500	I spent the next day in bed and felt half dead from thirst yet too weak to stand up to get some drink I lay and wept like a child Lord look on me
7769-99397-0036	train-other-500	Lord look on me would I cry for hours At last the fit left me and I slept
none	none	 and did not wake till dawn 
7769-99397-0037	train-other-500	I dreamt that I lay on the ground and saw a man come down from a great black cloud in a flame of light When he stood on the earth it shook as it had done a few days since
none	none	 and all the world to me was full of fire 
7769-99397-0038	train-other-500	He came up and said As I see
none	none	 that all these things have not brought thee to pray 
7769-99397-0039	train-other-500	now thou shalt die Then I woke and found it was a dream Weak and faint I was in dread all day lest my fit should come on
7769-99397-0040	train-other-500	Too ill to get out with my gun I sat on the shore to think
none	none	 and thus ran my thoughts What is this sea which is all round me and whence is it 
7769-99397-0041	train-other-500	There can be no doubt that the hand that made it made the air the earth the sky And who is that It is God
none	none	 who hath made all things Well then if God hath made all things 
7769-99397-0042	train-other-500	it must be He who guides them and if so
none	none	 no one thing in the whole range of His works can take place 
7769-99397-0043	train-other-500	and He not know it Then God must know how sick and sad I am and He wills me to be here O why hath God done this to me Then some voice would seem to say
7769-99397-0044	train-other-500	Dost thou ask why God hath done this to thee Ask why thou wert not shot by the Moors who came on board the ship and took the lives of thy mates
7769-99397-0045	train-other-500	Ask why thou wert not torn by the beasts of prey on the coasts
none	none	 Ask why thou didst not go down in the deep sea with the rest of the crew but didst come to this isle 
7769-99397-0046	train-other-500	and art safe A sound sleep then fell on me and when I woke it must have been three o clock the next day by the rays of the sun nay it may have been more than that
none	none	 for I think that this must have been the day that I did not mark on my post 
7769-99397-0047	train-other-500	as I have since found that there was one notch too few I now took from my store
none	none	 the Book of God s Word which I had brought from the wreck not one page of which I had yet read 
7769-99397-0048	train-other-500	My eyes fell on five words that would seem to have been put there for my good at this time so well did they cheer my faint hopes and touch the true source of my fears
none	none	 They were these 
7769-99397-0049	train-other-500	I will not leave thee And they have dwelt in my heart to this day I laid down the book to pray My cry was O Lord
7769-99397-0050	train-other-500	help me to love and learn thy ways This was the first time in all my life that I had felt a sense that God was near and heard me
none	none	 As for my dull life here it was not worth a thought 
7769-99397-0051	train-other-500	for now a new strength had come to me and there was a change in my griefs as well as in my joys
none	none	 I had now been in the isle twelve months and I thought it was time to go all round it in search of its woods 
7769-99397-0052	train-other-500	springs and creeks So I set off and brought back with me limes and grapes in their prime large and ripe
none	none	 I had hung the grapes in the sun to dry and in a few days time went to fetch them 
7769-99397-0053	train-other-500	that I might lay up a store The vale on the banks of which they grew was fresh and green
none	none	 and a clear bright stream ran through it 
7769-99397-0054	train-other-500	which gave so great a charm to the spot as to make me wish to live there But
none	none	 there was no view of the sea from this vale 
7769-99397-0055	train-other-500	while from my house no ships could come on my side of the isle and not be seen by me yet the cool soft banks were so sweet and new to me that much of my time was spent there
none	none	 In the first of the three years in which I had grown corn 
7769-99397-0056	train-other-500	I had sown it too late in the next it was spoilt by the drought
none	none	 but the third years crop had sprung up well I found that the hares would lie in it night and day for which there was no cure but to plant a thick hedge all round it and this took me more than three weeks to do I shot the hares in the day time and when it grew dark I made fast the dog s chain to the gate and there he stood to bark all night In a short time the corn grew strong and at last ripe but just as the hares had hurt it in the blade so now the birds ate it in the ear At the noise of my gun whole flocks of them would fly up and at this rate I saw that there would be no corn left so I made up my mind to keep a look out night and day I hid by the side of a hedge and could see the birds sit on the trees and watch and then come down one by one at first Now each grain of wheat was as it were a small loaf of bread to me So the great thing was to get rid of these birds My plan was this I shot three and hung them up like thieves to scare all that came to the corn and from this time as long as the dead ones hung there not a bird came near When the corn was ripe I made a scythe out of the swords from the ship and got in my crop Few of us think of the cost at which a loaf of bread is made Of course there was no plough here to turn up the earth and no spade to dig it with so I made one with wood but this was soon worn out and for want of a rake I made use of the bough of a tree When I had got the corn home I had to thrash it part the grain from the chaff and store it up Then came the want of a mill to grind it of sieves to clean it and of yeast to make bread of it Still my bread was made though I had no tools and no one could say that I did not earn it by the sweat of my brow When the rain kept me in doors it was good fun to teach my pet bird Poll to talk but so mute were all things round me that the sound of my own voice made me start My chief wants now were jars pots cups and plates but I knew not how I could make them At last I went in search of some clay and found some a mile from my house but it was quite a joke to see the queer shapes and forms that I made out of it For some of my pots and jars were too weak to bear their own weight and they would fall out here and in there in all sorts of ways while some when they were put in the sun to bake would crack with the heat of its rays You may guess what my joy was when at last a pot was made which would stand the heat of the fire so that I could boil the meat for broth The next thing to be made was a sieve to part the grain from the husks Goat s hair was of no use to me as I could not weave or spin so I made a shift for two years with a thin kind of stuff which I had brought from the ship But to grind the corn with the stones was the worst of all such hard work did I find it To bake the bread I burnt some wood down to an ash which I threw on the hearth to heat it and then set my loaves on the hearth and in this way my bread was made The next thing to turn my thoughts to was the ship s boat which lay on the high ridge of sand where it had been thrust by the storm which had cast me on these shores But it lay with the keel to the sky so I had to dig the sand from it and turn it up with the help of a pole When I had done this I found it was all in vain for I had not the strength to launch it So all I could do now was to make a boat of less size out of a tree and I found one that was just fit for it which grew not far from the shore but I could no more stir this than I could the ship s boat What was to be done I first dug the ground flat and smooth all the way from the boat to the sea so as to let it slide down but this plan did not turn out well so I thought I would try a new way which was to make a trench so as to bring the sea up to the boat as the boat could not be brought to the sea But to do this I must have dug down to a great depth which would take one man some years to do And when too late I found it was not wise to work out a scheme till I had first thought of the cost and toil Well thought I I must give up the boat and with it all my hopes to leave the isle But I have this to think of I am lord of the whole isle in fact a king I have wood with which I might build a fleet and grapes if not corn to freight it with though all my wealth is but a few gold coins For these I had no sort of use and could have found it in my heart to give them all for a peck of peas and some ink which last I stood much in need of But it was best to dwell more on what I had than on what I had not I now must needs try once more to build a boat but this time it was to have a mast for which the ship s sails would be of great use I made a deck at each end to keep out the spray of the sea a bin for my food and a rest for my gun with a flap to screen it from the wet More than all the boat was one of such a size that I could launch it My first cruise was up and down the creek but soon I got bold and made the whole round of my isle I took with me bread cakes and a pot full of rice some rum half a goat two great coats one of which was to lie on and one to put on at night I set sail in the sixth year of my reign On the East side of the isle there was a large ridge of rocks which lay two miles from the shore and a shoal of sand lay for half a mile from the rocks to the beach To get round to this point I had to sail a great way out to sea and here I all but lost my life But I got back to my home at last On my way there quite worn out with the toils of the boat I lay down in the shade to rest my limbs and slept But judge if you can what a start I gave when a voice woke me out of my sleep and spoke my name three times A voice in this wild place To call me by name too Then the voice said Where are you Where have you been How came you here But now I saw it all for at the top of the hedge sat Poll who did but say the words she had been taught by me I now went in search of some goats and laid snares for them with rice for a bait I had set the traps in the night and found they had all stood though the bait was gone So I thought of a new way to take them which was to make a pit and lay sticks and grass on it so as to hide it and in this way I caught an old goat and some kids But the old goat was much too fierce for me so I let him go I brought all the young ones home and let them fast a long time till at last they fed from my hand and were quite tame I kept them in a kind of park in which there were trees to screen them from the sun At first my park was three miles round but it struck me that in so great a space the kids would soon get as wild as if they had the range of the whole vale and that it would be as well to give them less room so I had to make a hedge which took me three months to plant My park held a flock of twelve goats and in two years more there were more than two score My dog sat at meals with me and one cat on each side of me on stools and we had Poll to talk to us Now for a word or two as to the dress in which I made a tour round the isle I could but think how droll it would look in the streets of the town in which I was born I wore a high cap of goat s skin with a flap that hung down to keep the sun and rain from my neck a coat made from the skin of a goat too the skirts of which came down to my hips and the same on my legs with no shoes but flaps of the fur round my shins I had a broad belt of the same round my waist which drew on with two thongs and from it on my right side hung a saw and an axe and on my left side a pouch for the shot My beard had not been cut since I came here But no more need be said of my looks for there were few to see me A strange sight was now in store for me which was to change the whole course of my life in the isle One day at noon while on a stroll down to a part of the shore that was new to me what should I see on the sand but the print of a man s foot I felt as if I was bound by a spell and could not stir from the spot Bye and bye I stole a look round me but no one was in sight What could this mean I went three or four times to look at it There it was the print of a man s foot toes heel and all the parts of a foot How could it have come there My head swam with fear and as I left the spot I made two or three steps and then took a look round me then two steps more and did the same thing I took fright at the stump of an old tree and ran to my house as if for my life How could aught in the shape of a man come to that shore and I not know it Where was the ship that brought him Then a vague dread took hold of my mind that some man or set of men had found me out and it might be that they meant to kill me or rob me of all I had How strange a thing is the life of man One day we love that which the next day we hate One day we seek what the next day we shun One day we long for the thing which the next day we fear and so we go on Now from the time that I was cast on this isle my great source of grief was that I should be thus cut off from the rest of my race Why then should the thought that a man might be near give me all this pain Nay why should the mere sight of the print of a man s foot make me quake with fear It seems most strange yet not more strange than true Once it struck me that it might be the print of my own foot when first the storm cast me on these shores Could I have come this way from the boat Should it in truth turn out to be the print of my own foot I should be like a boy who tells of a ghost and feels more fright at his own tale than those do whom he meant to scare Fear kept me in doors for three days till the want of food drove me out At last I was so bold as to go down to the coast to look once more at the print of the foot to see if it was the same shape as my own I found it was not so large by a great deal so it was clear there were men in the isle Just at this time my good watch dog fell down dead at my feet He was old and worn out and in him I lost my best guard and friend One day as I went from the hill to the coast a scene lay in front of me which made me sick at heart The spot was spread with the bones of men There was a round place dug in the earth where a fire had been made and here some men had come to feast Now that I had seen this sight I knew not how to act I kept close to my home and would scarce stir from it save to milk my flock of goats To feel safe was now more to me than to be well fed and I did not care to drive a nail or chop a stick of wood lest the sound of it should be heard much less would I fire a gun As to my bread and meat I had to bake it at night when the smoke could not be seen But I soon found the way to burn wood with turf at the top of it which made it like chark or dry coal and this I could use by day as it had no smoke I found in the wood where I went to get the sticks for my fire a cave so large that I could stand in it but I made more haste to get out than in for two large eyes as bright as stars shone out from it with a fierce glare I took a torch and went to see what they could be and found that there was no cause for fear for the eyes were those of an old gray goat which had gone there to die of old age I gave him a push to try to get him out of the cave but he could not rise from the ground where he lay so I left him there to die as I could not save his life I found the width of the cave was twelve feet but part of it near the end was so low that I had to creep on my hands and feet to go in What the length of it was I could not tell for my light went out and I had to give up my search The next day I went to the cave with large lights made of goat s fat and when I got to the end I found that the roof rose to two score feet or more As my lights shone on the walls and roof of the cave a sight burst on my view the charms of which no tongue could tell for the walls shone like stars What was in the rock to cause this it was hard to say they might be gems or bright stones or gold But let them be what they may this cave was a mine of wealth to me for at such time as I felt dull or sad the bright scene would flash on my mind s eye and fill it with joy A score of years had gone by with no new sight to rest my eyes on till this scene burst on them I felt as if I should like to spend the rest of my life here and at its close lie down to die in this cave like the old goat As I went home I was struck by the sight of some smoke which came from a fire no more than two miles off From this time I lost all my peace of mind Day and night a dread would haunt me that the men who had made this fire would find me out I went home and drew up my steps but first I made all things round me look wild and rude To load my gun was the next thing to do and I thought it would be best to stay at home and hide But this was not to be borne long I had no spy to send out and all I could do was to get to the top of the hill and keep a good look out At last through my glass I could see a group of wild men join in a dance round their fire As soon a they had left I took two guns and slung a sword on my side then with all speed I set off to the top of the hill once more to have a good view This time I made up my mind to go up to the men but not with a view to kill them for I felt that it would be wrong to do so With such a load of arms it took me two hours to reach the spot where the fire was and by the time I got there the men had all gone but I saw them in four boats out at sea Down on the shore there was a proof of what the work of these men had been The signs of their feast made me sick at heart and I shut my eyes I durst not fire my gun when I went out for food on that side the isle lest there should be some of the men left who might hear it and so find me out This state of things went on for a year and three months and for all that time I saw no more men On the twelfth of May a great storm of wind blew all day and night As it was dark I sat in my house and in the midst of the gale I heard a gun fire My guess was that it must have been from some ship cast on shore by the storm So I set a light to some wood on top of the hill that those in the ship if ship it should be might know that some one was there to aid them I then heard two more guns fire When it was light I went to the South side of the isle and there lay the wreck of a ship cast on the rocks in the night by the storm She was too far off for me to see if there were men on board Words could not tell how much I did long to bring but one of the ship s crew to the shore So strong was my wish to save the life of those on board that I could have laid down my own life to do so There are some springs in the heart which when hope stirs them drive the soul on with such a force that to lose all chance of the thing one hopes for would seem to make one mad and thus was it with me Now I thought was the time to use my boat so I set to work at once to fit it out I took on board some rum of which I still had a good deal left some dry grapes a bag of rice some goat s milk and cheese and then put out to sea A dread came on me at the thought of the risk I had run on the same rocks but my heart did not quite fail me though I knew that as my boat was small if a gale of wind should spring up all would be lost Then I found that I must go back to the shore till the tide should turn and the ebb come on I made up my mind to go out the next day with the high tide so I slept that night in my boat At dawn I set out to sea and in less than two hours I came up to the wreck What a scene was there The ship had struck on two rocks The stern was torn by the force of the waves the masts were swept off ropes and chains lay strewn on the deck and all was wrapt in gloom As I came up to the wreck a dog swam to me with a yelp and a whine I took him on board my boat and when I gave him some bread he ate it like a wolf and as to drink he would have burst if I had let him take his fill of it I went to the cook s room where I found two men but they were both dead The tongue was mute the ear was deaf the eye was shut and the lip was stiff still the sad tale was told for each had his arm round his friend s neck and so they must have sat to wait for death What a change had come on the scene once so wild with the lash of the waves and the roar of the wind All was calm now death had done its work and all had felt its stroke save the dog and he was the one thing that still had life I thought the ship must have come from Spain and there was much gold on board I took some of the chests and put them in my boat but did not wait to see what they held and with this spoil and three casks of rum I came back I found all things at home just as I had left them my goats my cats and my bird The scene in the cook s room was in my mind day and night and to cheer me up I drank some of the rum I then set to work to bring my freight from the shore where I had left it In the chests were two great bags of gold and some bars of the same and near these lay three small flasks and three bags of shot which were a great prize From this time all went well with me for two years but it was not to last One day as I stood on the hill I saw six boats on the shore What could this mean Where were the men who had brought them And what had they come for I saw through my glass that there were a score and a half at least on the east side of the isle They had meat on the fire round which I could see them dance They then took a man from one of the boats who was bound hand and foot but when they came to loose his bonds he set off as fast as his feet would take him and in a straight line to my house To tell the truth when I saw all the rest of the men run to catch him my hair stood on end with fright In the creek he swam like a fish and the plunge which he took brought him through it in a few strokes All the men now gave up the chase but two and they swam through the creek but by no means so fast as the slave had done Now I thought was the time for me to help the poor man and my heart told me it would be right to do so I ran down my steps with my two guns and went with all speed up the hill and then down by a short cut to meet them I gave a sign to the poor slave to come to me and at the same time went up to meet the two men who were in chase of him I made a rush at the first of these to knock him down with the stock of my gun and he fell I saw the one who was left aim at me with his bow so to save my life I shot him dead The smoke and noise from my gun gave the poor slave who had been bound such a shock that he stood still on the spot as if he had been in a trance I gave a loud shout for him to come to me and I took care to show him that I was a friend and made all the signs I could think of to coax him up to me At length he came knelt down to kiss the ground and then took hold of my foot and set it on his head All this meant that he was my slave and I bade him rise and made much of him But there was more work to be done yet for the man who had had the blow from my gun was not dead I made a sign for my slave as I shall now call him to look at him At this he spoke to me and though I could not make out what he said yet it gave me a shock of joy for it was the first sound of a man s voice that I had heard for all the years I had been on the isle The man whom I had struck with the stock of my gun sat up and my slave who was in great fear of him made signs for me to lend him my sword which hung in a belt at my side With this he ran up to the man and with one stroke cut off his head When he had done this he brought me back my sword with a laugh and put it down in front of me I did not like to see the glee with which he did it and I did not feel that my own life was quite safe with such a man He in his turn could but lift up his large brown hands with awe to think that I had put his foe to death while I stood so far from him But as to the sword he and the rest of his tribe made use of swords of wood and this was why he knew so well how to wield mine He made signs to me to let him go and see the man who had been shot and he gave him a turn round first on this side then on that and when he saw the wound made in his breast by the shot he stood quite still once more as if he had lost his wits I made signs for him to come back for my fears told me that the rest of the men might come in search of their friends I did not like to take my slave to my house nor to my cave so I threw down some straw from the rice plant for him to sleep on and gave him some bread and a bunch of dry grapes to eat He was a fine man with straight strong limbs tall and young His hair was thick like wool and black His head was large and high and he had bright black eyes He was of a dark brown hue his face was round and his nose small but not flat he had a good mouth with thin lips with which he could give a soft smile and his teeth were as white as snow I had been to milk my goats in the field close by and when he saw me he ran to me and lay down on the ground to show me his thanks He then put his head on the ground and set my foot on his head as he had done at first He took all the means he could think of to let me know that he would serve me all his life and I gave a sign to show that I thought well of him The next thing was to think of some name to call him by I chose that of the sixth day of the week Friday as he came to me on that day I took care not to lose sight of him all that night and when the sun rose I made signs for him to come to me that I might give him some clothes for he wore none We then went up to the top of the hill to look out for the men but as we could not see them or their boats it was clear that they had left the isle My slave has since told me that they had had a great fight with the tribe that dwelt next to them and that all those men whom each side took in war were their own by right My slave s foes had four who fell to their share of whom he was one I now set to work to make my man a cap of hare s skin and gave him a goat s skin to wear round his waist It was a great source of pride to him to find that his clothes were as good as my own At night I kept my guns sword and bow close to my side but there was no need for this as my slave was in sooth most true to me He did all that he was set to do with his whole heart in the work and I knew that he would lay down his life to save mine What could a man do more than that And oh the joy to have him here to cheer me in this lone isle I did my best to teach him so like a child as he was to do and feel all that was right I found him apt and full of fun and he took great pains to learn all that I could tell him Our lives ran on in a calm smooth way and but for the vile feasts which were held on the shores I felt no wish to leave the isle As my slave had by no means lost his zest for these meals it struck me that the best way to cure him was to let him taste the flesh of beasts so I took him with me one day to the wood for some sport I saw a she goat in the shade with her two kids I caught Friday by the arm and made signs to him not to stir and then shot one of the kids but the noise of the gun gave the poor man a great shock He did not see the kid nor did he know that it was dead He tore his dress off his breast to feel if there was a wound there then he knelt down to me and took hold of my knees to pray of me not to kill him To show poor Friday that his life was quite safe I led him by the hand and told him to fetch the kid By and by I saw a hawk in a tree so I bade him look at the gun the hawk and the ground and then I shot the bird But my poor slave gave still more signs of fear this time than he did at first for he shook from head to foot He must have thought that some fiend of death dwelt in the gun and I think that he would have knelt down to it as well as to me but he would not so much as touch the gun for some time though he would speak to it when he thought I was not near Once he told me that what he said to it was to ask it not to kill him I brought home the bird and made broth of it Friday was much struck to see me eat salt with it and made a wry face but I in my turn took some that had no salt with it and I made a wry face at that The next day I gave him a piece of kid s flesh which I had hung by a string in front of the fire to roast My plan was to put two poles one on each side of the fire and a stick on the top of them to hold the string When my slave came to taste the flesh he took the best means to let me know how good he thought it The next day I set him to beat out and sift some corn I let him see me make the bread and he soon did all the work I felt quite a love for his true warm heart and he soon learnt to talk to me One day I said Do the men of your tribe win in fight He told me with a smile that they did Well then said I How came they to let their foes take you They run one two three and make go in the boat that time Well and what do the men do with those they take Eat them all up This was not good news for me but I went on and said Where do they take them Go to next place where they think Do they come here Yes yes they come here come else place too Have you been here with them twice Yes come there He meant the North West side of the isle so to this spot I took him the next day He knew the place and told me he was there once with a score of men To let me know this he put a score of stones all of a row and made me count them Are not the boats lost on your shore now and then He said that there was no fear and that no boats were lost He told me that up a great way by the moon that is where the moon then came up there dwelt a tribe of white men like me with beards I felt sure that they must have come from Spain to work the gold mines I put this to him Could I go from this isle and join those men Yes yes you may go in two boats It was hard to see how one man could go in two boats but what he meant was a boat twice as large as my own One day I said to my slave Do you know who made you But he could not tell at all what these words meant So I said Do you know who made the sea the ground we tread on the hills and woods He said it was Beek whose home was a great way off and that he was so old that the sea and the land were not so old as he If this old man has made all things why do not all things bow down to him My slave gave a grave look and said All things say O to him Where do the men in your land go when they die All go to Beek I then held my hand up to the sky to point to it and said God dwells there He made the world and all things in it The moon and the stars are the work of his hand God sends the wind and the rain on the earth and the streams that flow He hides the face of the sky with clouds makes the grass to grow for the beasts of the field and herbs for the use of man God s love knows no end When we pray He draws near to us and hears us It was a real joy to my poor slave to hear me talk of these things He sat still for a long time then gave a sigh and told me that he would say O to Beek no more for he was but a short way off and yet could not hear till men went up the hill to speak to him Did you go up the hill to speak to him said I No Okes go up to Beek not young mans What do Okes say to him They say O Now that I brought my man Friday to know that Beek was not the true God such was the sense he had of my worth that I had fears lest I should stand in the place of Beek I did my best to call forth his faith in Christ and make it strong and clear till at last thanks be to the Lord I brought him to the love of Him with the whole grasp of his soul To please my poor slave I gave him a sketch of my whole life I told him where I was born and where I spent my days when a child He was glad to hear tales of the land of my birth and of the trade which we keep up in ships with all parts of the known world I gave him a knife and a belt which made him dance with joy One day as we stood on the top of the hill at the east side of the isle I saw him fix his eyes on the main land and stand for a long time to gaze at it then jump and sing and call out to me What do you see said I Oh joy said he with a fierce glee in his eyes Oh glad There see my land Why did he strain his eyes to stare at this land as if he had a wish to be there It put fears in my mind which made me feel far less at my ease with him Thought I if he should go back to his home he will think no more of what I have taught him and done for him He will be sure to tell the rest of his tribe all my ways and come back with it may be scores of them and kill me and then dance round me as they did round the men the last time they came on my isle But these were all false fears though they found a place in my mind a long while and I was not so kind to him now as I had been From this time I made it a rule day by day to find out if there were grounds for my fears or not I said Do you not wish to be once more in your own land Yes I be much O glad to be at my own land What would you do there Would you turn wild and be as you were No no I would tell them to be good tell them eat bread corn milk no eat man more Why they would kill you No no they no kill they love learn He then told me that some white men who had come on their shores in a boat had taught them a great deal Then will you go back to your land with me He said he could not swim so far so I told him he should help me to build a boat to go in Then he said If you go I go I go why they would eat me No me make them much love you Then he told me as well as he could how kind they had been to some white men I brought out the large boat to hear what he thought of it but he said it was too small We then went to look at the old ship s boat which as it had been in the sun for years was not at all in a sound state The poor man made sure that it would do But how were we to know this I told him we should build a boat as large as that and that he should go home in it He spoke not a word but was grave and sad What ails you said I Why you grieve mad with your man What do you mean I am not cross with you No cross no cross with me Why send your man home to his own land then Did you not tell me you would like to go back Yes yes we both there no wish self there if you not there And what should I do there You do great deal much good you teach wild men be good men you tell them know God pray God and lead new life We soon set to work to make a boat that would take us both The first thing was to look out for some large trees that grew near the shore so that we could launch our boat when it was made My slave s plan was to burn the wood to make it the right shape but as mine was to hew it I set him to work with my tools and in two months time we had made a good strong boat but it took a long while to get her down to the shore Friday had the whole charge of her and large as she was he made her move with ease and said he thought she go there well though great blow wind He did not know that I meant to make a mast and sail I cut down a young fir tree for the mast and then I set to work at the sail It made me laugh to see my man stand and stare when he came to watch me sail the boat But he soon gave a jump a laugh and a clap of the hands when he saw the sail jibe and fall first on this side then on that The next thing to do was to stow our boat up in the creek where we dug a small dock and when the tide was low we made a dam to keep out the sea The time of year had now come for us to set sail so we got out all our stores to put them in the boat One day I sent Friday to the shore to get a sort of herb that grew there I soon heard him cry out to me O grief O bad O bad O out there boats one two three Keep a stout heart said I to cheer him The poor man shook with fear for he thought that the men who brought him here had now come back to kill him Can you fight said I Me shoot but me saw three boats one two three Have no fear those that we do not kill will be sure to take fright at the sound of our guns Now will you stand by me and do just as you are bid Me die when you bid die I gave him a good draught of rum and when he had drunk this he took up an axe and two guns each of which had a charge of swan shot I took two guns as well and put large shot in them and then hung my great sword by my side From the top of the bill I saw with the help of my glass that the boats had each brought eight men and one slave They had come on shore near the creek where a grove of young trees grew close down to the sea They had with them three slaves bound hand and foot and you who read this may guess what they were brought here for I felt that I must try and save them from so hard a fate and that to do this I should have to put some of their foes to death So we set forth on our way I gave Friday strict charge to keep close to me and not to fire till I told him to do so We went full a mile out of our way that we might get round to the wood to bide there But we had not gone far when my old qualms came back to me and I thought Is it for me to dip my hands in man s blood Why should I kill those who have done me no harm and mean not to hurt me Nay who do not so much as know that they are in the wrong when they hold these feasts Are not their ways a sign that God has left them with the rest of their tribe to their own dull hearts God did not call me to be a judge for Him He who said Thou shalt not kill said it for me as well as the rest of the world A throng of thoughts like these would rush on my mind as if to warn me to pause till I felt sure that there was more to call me to the work than I then knew of I took my stand in the wood to watch the men at their feast and then crept on with Friday close at my heels Thus we went till we came to the skirts of the wood Then I said to Friday Go up to the top of that tree and bring me word if you can see the men He went and quick as thought came back to say that they were all round the fire and that the man who was bound on the sand would be the next they would kill But when he told me that it was a white man one of my own race I felt the blood boil in my veins Two of the gang had gone to loose the white man from his bonds so now was the time to fire At the sound of our guns we saw all the men jump up from the ground where they sat It must have been the first gun the I had heard in their lives They knew not which way to look I now threw down my piece and took up a small gun Friday did the same and I gave him the word to fire The men ran right and left with yells and screams I now made a rush out of the wood that they might see me with my man Friday at my heels of course We gave a loud shout and ran up to the white man as fast as we could There he lay on the hot sand I cut the flag or rush by which he was bound but he was too weak to stand or speak so I gave him some rum He let me know by all the signs that he could think of how much he stood in my debt for all that I had done for him I said We will talk of that bye and bye but now we must do what we can to save our lives Friday who was free to go where he chose flew here and there and put all the men to the rout They fled in full haste to their boats and were soon out at sea and so we got rid of our foes at last The man whom we had found on the sand told us that his name was Carl and that he came from Spain But there was one more man to claim our care for the black men had left a small boat on the sands and in this I saw a poor wretch who lay half dead He could not so much as look up so tight was he bound neck and heels When I cut the bonds from him he gave a deep groan for he thought that all this was but to lead him out to die Friday then came up and I bade him speak to the old man in his own tongue and tell him that he was free This good news gave him strength and he sat up in the boat But when Friday came to hear him talk and to look him in the face it brought the tears to my eyes to see him kiss and hug the poor old man and dance round him with joy then weep wring his hands and beat his own face and head and then laugh once more sing and leap For a long time he could not speak to me so as to let me know what all this meant But at length he told me that he was the son of this poor old man and that his name was Jaf It would be a hard task for me to tell of all the quaint signs Friday made to show his joy He went in and out of the boat five or six times sat down by old Jaf and held the poor old man s head close to his breast to warm it then he set to work to rub his arms and feet which were cold and stiff from the bonds I told Friday to give him some rum and bread but he said None Bad dog eat all up self He then ran off straight to the house and took no heed of my calls but went as swift as a deer In an hour s time he came back with a jug in his hand The good soul had gone all the way to the house that Jaf might have a fresh draught from my well and with it he brought two cakes one of which I bade him take to Carl who lay in the shade of a tree His limbs were stiff and cold and he was too weak to say a word I set my man to rub his feet with rum and while he did so I saw Friday turn his head round from time to time to steal a look at the old man Then we brought Carl and Jaf home from the boat on our backs as they could not walk The door of my house was at the top and the poor sick men could not climb the steps by which I got in so we made for them a tent of old sails I was now a king of these three men as well as Lord of the isle and I felt proud to say They all owe their lives to their king and would lay them down for him if he bade them do so But I did not think that my reign was so soon to come to an end The next thing for us to do was to give Carl and Jaf some food and to kill and roast a kid to which we all four sat down and I did my best to cheer them Carl in a few days grew quite strong and I set him to work to dig some land for seed for it was clear we should want more corn now that we had two more mouths to fill So we put in the ground all the stock of grain I had and thus we all four had as much work as we could do for some time When the crop grew and was ripe we found we had a good store of grain We made a plan that Carl and Jaf should go back to the main land to try if they could get some of the white men who had been cast on shore there to come and live with us so they got out the boat and took with them two guns and food for eight days They were to come back in a week s time and I bade them hang out a sign when they came in sight so that we might know who they were 
8058-99402-0000	train-other-500	One day Friday ran up to me in great glee and said They are back They are back A mile from shore there was a boat with a sail which stood in for the land
8058-99402-0001	train-other-500	but I knew it could not be the one which our two friends had gone out in for it was on the wrong side of the isle for that I saw too through my glass a ship out at sea There were twelve men in the boat three of whom were bound in chains
8058-99402-0002	train-other-500	and four had fire arms Bye and bye I saw one of the men raise his sword to those who were in chains and I felt sure that all was not right Then I saw that the three men who had been bound were set free
8058-99402-0003	train-other-500	and when they had come on shore they lay on the ground in the shade of a tree I was soon at their side for their looks so sad and worn brought to my mind the first few hours I had spent in this wild spot
8058-99402-0004	train-other-500	where all to me was wrapt in gloom I went up to these men and said Who are you Sirs They gave a start at my voice and at my strange dress and made a move as if they would fly from me I said
8058-99402-0005	train-other-500	Do not fear me for it may be that you have a friend at hand though you do not think it He must be sent from the sky then said one of them with a grave look and he took off his hat to me at the same time
8058-99402-0006	train-other-500	All help is from thence Sir I said but what can I do to aid you You look as if you had some load of grief on your breast I saw one of the men lift his sword as if to kill you
8058-99402-0007	train-other-500	The tears ran down the poor man s face as he said Is this a god or is it but a man Have no doubt on that score Sir said I for a god would not have come with a dress like this
8058-99402-0008	train-other-500	No do not fear nor raise your hopes too high for you see but a man yet one who will do all he can to help you Your speech shows me that you come from the same land as I do
8058-99402-0009	train-other-500	I will do all I can to serve you Tell me your case Our case Sir is too long to you while they who would kill us are so near My name is Paul To be short Sir my crew have thrust me out of my ship
8058-99402-0010	train-other-500	which you see out there and have left me here to die It was as much as I could do to make them sheath their swords which you saw were drawn to slay me They have set me down in this isle with these two men my friend here and the ship s mate
8058-99402-0011	train-other-500	Where have they gone said I There in the wood close by I fear they may have seen and heard us If they have they will be sure to kill us all Have they fire arms They have four guns one of which is in the boat
8058-99402-0012	train-other-500	Well then leave all to me There are two of the men said he who are worse than the rest All but these I feel sure would go back to work the ship I thought it was best to speak out to Paul at once and I said
8058-99402-0013	train-other-500	Now if I save your life there are two things which you must do But he read my thoughts and said If you save my life you shall do as you like with me and my ship and take her where you please I saw that the two men in whose charge the boat had been left
8058-99402-0014	train-other-500	had come on shore so the first thing I did was to send Friday to fetch from it the oars the sail and the gun And now the ship might be said to be in our hands When the time came for the men to go back to the ship they were in a great rage
none	none	 for as the boat had now no sail 
8058-99402-0015	train-other-500	nor oars they knew not how to get out to their ship We heard them say that it was a strange sort of isle for that sprites had come to the boat to take off the sails and oars
8058-99402-0016	train-other-500	We could see them run to and fro with great rage then go and sit in the boat to rest and then come on shore once more When they drew near to us Paul and Friday would fain have had me fall on them at once But my wish was to spare them
8058-99402-0017	train-other-500	and kill as few as I could I told two of my men to creep on their hands and feet close to the ground so that they might not be seen and when they got up to the men not to fire till I gave the word They had not stood thus long when three of the crew came up to us
8058-99402-0018	train-other-500	Till now we had but heard their voice but when they came so near as to be seen Paul and Friday stood up and shot at them Two of the men fell dead and they were the worst of the crew and the third ran off
8058-99402-0019	train-other-500	At the sound of the guns I came up but it was so dark that the men could not tell if there were three of us or three score It fell out just as I could wish for I heard the men ask To whom must we yield and where are they
8058-99402-0020	train-other-500	Friday told them that Paul was there with the king of the isle who had brought with him a crowd of men At this one of the crew said If Paul will spare our lives we will yield Then said Friday you shall know the king s will
8058-99402-0021	train-other-500	Then Paul said to them You know my voice if you lay down your arms the king will spare your lives They fell on their knees to beg the same of me I took good care that they did not see me but I gave them my word that they should all live
8058-99402-0022	train-other-500	that I should take four of them to work the ship and that the rest would be bound hand and foot for the good faith of the four This was to show them what a stern king I was Of course I soon set them free and I put them in a way to take my place on the isle
none	none	 I told them of all my ways taught them how to mind the goats how to work the farm and make the bread 
8058-99402-0023	train-other-500	I gave them a house to live in fire arms tools
none	none	 and my two tame cats in fact all but Poll and my gold As I sat on the top of the hill Paul came up to me 
8058-99402-0024	train-other-500	He held out his hand to point to the ship and with much warmth took me to his arms and said My dear friend there is your ship For she is all yours and so are we and all that is in her
none	none	 I cast my eyes to the ship which rode half a mile off the shore at the mouth of the creek and near the place where I had brought my rafts to the land 
8058-99402-0025	train-other-500	Yes there she stood the ship that was to set me free and to take me where I might choose to go She set her sails to the wind and her flags threw out their gay stripes in the breeze Such a sight was too much for me and I fell down faint with joy
8058-99402-0026	train-other-500	Paul then took out a flask which he had brought for me and gave me a dram which I drank but for a good while I could not speak to him
none	none	 Friday and Paul then went on board the ship and Paul took charge of her once more 
8058-99402-0027	train-other-500	We did not start that night but at noon the next day I left the isle That lone isle where I had spent so great a part of my life not much less than thrice ten long years When I came back to the dear land of my birth
8058-99402-0028	train-other-500	all was strange and new to me I went to my old home at York but none of my friends were there and to my great grief I saw on the stone at their grave the sad tale of their death As they had thought
8058-99402-0029	train-other-500	of course that I was dead they had not left me their wealth and lands
none	none	 so that I stood much in want of means for it was but a small sum that I had brought with me from the isle 
8058-99402-0030	train-other-500	But in this time of need I had the luck to find my good friend who once took me up at sea He was now grown too old for work and had put his son in the ship in his place He did not know me at first
none	none	 but I was soon brought to his mind when I told him who I was I found from him that the land which I had bought on my way to the isle was now worth much As it was a long way off 
8058-99402-0031	train-other-500	I felt no wish to go and live there so I made up my mind to sell it and in the course of a few months I got for it a sum so large as to make me a rich man all at once Weeks months and years went by
8058-99402-0032	train-other-500	I had a farm a wife and two sons and was by no means young
none	none	 but still I could not get rid of a strong wish which dwelt in my thoughts by day and my dreams by night 
8058-99402-0033	train-other-500	and that was to set foot once more in my old isle I had now no need to work for food or for means of life all I had to do was to teach my boys to be wise and good to live at my ease and see my wealth grow day by day
8058-99402-0034	train-other-500	Yet the wish to go back to my wild haunts clung round me like a cloud and I could in no way drive it from me so true is it that what is bred in the bone will not come out of the flesh
8058-99402-0035	train-other-500	At length I lost my wife which was a great blow to me and my home was now so sad that I made up my mind to launch out once more on the broad sea and go with my man Friday
none	none	 to that lone isle where dwelt all my hopes 
8058-99402-0036	train-other-500	I took with me as large a store of tools clothes and such like goods as I had room for and men of skill in all kinds of trades to live in the isle When we set sail we had a fair wind for some time but one night the mate
8058-99402-0037	train-other-500	who was at the watch told me he saw a flash of fire and heard a gun go off At this we all ran on deck from whence we saw a great light and as there was no land that way we knew that it must be some ship on fire at sea which could not be far off
8058-99402-0038	train-other-500	for we heard the sound of the gun The wind was still fair so we made our way for the point where we saw the light and in half an hour it was but too plain that a large ship was on fire in the midst of the broad sea
8058-99402-0039	train-other-500	I gave the word to fire off five guns and we then lay by to wait till break of day But in the dead of the night the ship blew up in the air the flames shot forth and what there was left of the ship sank
none	none	 We hung out lights and our guns kept up a fire all night long to let the crew know that there was help at hand 
8058-99402-0040	train-other-500	At eight o clock the next day we found by the aid of the glass that two of the ship s boats were out at sea quite full of men They had seen us and had done their best to make us see them and in half an hour we came up with them
8058-99402-0041	train-other-500	It would be a hard task for me to set forth in words the scene which took place in my ship when the poor French folk for such they were came on board As to grief and fear these are soon told sighs tears and groans make up the sum of them
8058-99402-0042	train-other-500	but such a cause of joy as this was in sooth too much for them to bear weak and all but dead as they were Some would send up shouts of joy that rent the sky some would cry and wring their hands as if in the depths of grief
8058-99402-0043	train-other-500	some would dance laugh and sing not a few were dumb sick faint in a swoon or half mad and two or three were seen to give thanks to God In this strange group there was a young French priest who did his best to soothe those round him
8058-99402-0044	train-other-500	and I saw him go up to some of the crew and say to them Why do you scream and tear your hair and wring your hands my men Let your joy be free and full give it full range and scope
none	none	 but leave off this trick of the hands and lift them up in praise let your voice swell out not in screams but in hymns of thanks to God who has brought you out of so great a strait for this will add peace to your joy The next day 
8058-99403-0000	train-other-500	they were all in a right frame of mind so I gave them what stores I could spare and put them on board a ship that we met with on her way to France all save five who with the priest had a wish to join me
8058-99403-0001	train-other-500	But we had not set sail long when we fell in with a ship that had been blown out to sea by a storm and had lost her masts and worse than all her crew had not had an ounce of meat or bread for ten days
8058-99403-0002	train-other-500	I gave them all some food which they ate like wolves in the snow but I thought it best to check them as I had fears that so much all at once would cause the death of some of them
8058-99403-0003	train-other-500	There were a youth and a young girl in the ship who the mate said he thought must be dead but he had not had the heart to go near them for the food was all gone
8058-99403-0004	train-other-500	I found that they were faint for the want of it and as it were in the jaws of death but in a short time they both got well and as they had no wish to go back to their ship I took them with me
8058-99403-0005	train-other-500	So now I had eight more on board my ship than I had when I first set out In three months from the time when I left home I came in sight of my isle and I brought the ship safe up
8058-99403-0006	train-other-500	by the side of the creek which was near my old house I went up to Friday to ask if he knew where he was He took a look round him and soon with a clap of the hands said O yes O there O yes O there
8058-99403-0007	train-other-500	Bye and bye he set up a dance with such wild glee that it was as much as I could do to keep him on deck Well what think you Friday said I shall we find those whom we left still here
8058-99403-0008	train-other-500	Shall we see poor old Jaf He stood quite mute for a while but when I spoke of old Jaf whose son Friday was the tears ran down his face and the poor soul was as sad as could be
8058-99403-0009	train-other-500	No no said he no more no no more As we caught sight of some men at the top of the hill I gave word to fire three guns to show that we were friends
8058-99403-0010	train-other-500	and soon we saw smoke rise from the side of the creek I then went on shore in a boat with the priest and Friday and hung out a white flag of peace The first man I cast my eyes on at the creek was my old friend Carl
8058-99403-0011	train-other-500	who when I was last on the isle had been brought here in bonds I gave strict charge to the men in the boat not to go on shore but Friday could not be kept back
8058-99403-0012	train-other-500	for with his quick eye he had caught sight of old Jaf It brought the tears to our eyes to see his joy when he met the old man He gave him a kiss took him up in his arms set him down in the shade then stood a short way off to look at him
8058-99403-0013	train-other-500	as one would look at a work of art then felt him with his hand and all this time he was in full talk and told him one by one all the strange tales of what he had seen since they had last met
none	none	 As to my friend Carl 
8058-99403-0014	train-other-500	he came up to me and with much warmth shook my hands and then took me to my old house which he now gave up to me I could no more have found the place than if I had not been there at all The rows of trees stood so thick and close
8058-99403-0015	train-other-500	that the house could not be got at save by such blind ways as none but those who made them could find out Why have you built all these forts said I
8058-99403-0016	train-other-500	Carl told me that he felt sure I should say there was much need of them when I heard how they had spent their time since they had come to the isle
none	none	 He brought twelve men to the spot where I stood and said 
8058-99403-0017	train-other-500	Sir all these men owe their lives to you Then one by one they came up to me not as if they had been the mere crew of a ship but like men of rank who had come to kiss the hand of their king
none	none	 The first thing was to bear all that had been done in the isle since I had left it But I must first state that when we were on the point to set sail from the isle a feud sprang up on board our ship which we could not put down 
8058-99403-0018	train-other-500	till we had laid two of the men in chains The next day these two men stole each of them a gun and some small arms and took the ship s boat and ran off with it to join the three bad men on shore
8058-99403-0019	train-other-500	As soon as I found this out I sent the long boat on shore with twelve men and the mate and off they went to seek the two who had left the ship But their search was in vain nor could they find one of the rest
8058-99403-0020	train-other-500	for they had all fled to the woods when they saw the boat We had now lost five of the crew but the three first were so much worse than the last two that in a few days they sent them out of doors and would have no more to do with them
8058-99403-0021	train-other-500	nor would they for a long while give them food to eat So the two poor men had to live as well as they could by hard work and they set up their tents on the north shore of the isle to be out of the way of the wild men
8058-99403-0022	train-other-500	who were wont to land on the east side Here they built them two huts one to lodge in and one to lay up their stores in and the men from Spain gave them some corn for seed as well as some peas which I had left them
8058-99403-0023	train-other-500	They soon learned to dig and plant and hedge in their land in the mode which I had set for them and in short to lead good lives so that I shall now call them the two good men But when the three bad men saw this
8058-99403-0024	train-other-500	they were full of spite and came one day to tease and vex them They told them that the isle was their own and that no one else had a right to build on it if they did not pay rent The two good men thought at first that they were in jest
8058-99403-0025	train-other-500	and told them to come and sit down and see what fine homes they had built and say what rent they would ask
none	none	 But one of the three said they should soon see that they were not in jest and took a torch in his hand and put it to the roof of the but 
8058-99403-0026	train-other-500	and would have set it on fire had not one of the two good men trod the fire out with his feet The bad man was in such a rage at this that he ran at him with a pole he had in his hand
8058-99403-0027	train-other-500	and this brought on a fight the end of which was that the three men had to stand off But in a short time they came back and trod down the corn and shot the goats and young kids which the poor men had got to bring up tame for their store
8058-99403-0028	train-other-500	One day when the two men were out they came to their home and said Ha there s the nest but the birds are flown They then set to work to pull down both the huts and left not a stick nor scarce a sign on the ground to show where the tents had stood
8058-99403-0029	train-other-500	They tore up too all the goods and stock that they could find and when they had done this they told it all to the men of Spain and said You sirs shall have the same sauce if you do not mend your ways
8058-99403-0030	train-other-500	They then fell to blows and hard words but Carl had them bound in cords and took their arms from them The men of Spain then said they would do them no harm and if they would live at peace they would help them
none	none	 and that they should live with them as they had done till that time but they could not give them back their arms for three or four months 
8058-99403-0031	train-other-500	One night Carl whom I shall call the chief as he took the lead of all the rest felt a great weight on his mind and could get no sleep though he was quite well in health
none	none	 He lay still for some time but as he did not feel at case he got up and took a look out 
8058-99403-0032	train-other-500	But as it was too dark to see far and he heard no noise he went back to his bed Still it was all one he could not sleep and though he knew not why his thoughts would give him no rest He then woke up one of his friends
8058-99403-0033	train-other-500	and told him how it had been with him Say you so said he What if there should be some bad plot at work near us They then set off to the top of the hill where I was wont to go and from thence they saw the light of a fire quite a short way from them
8058-99403-0034	train-other-500	and heard the sounds of men not of one or two but of a great crowd We need not doubt that the chief and the man with him now ran back at once to tell all the rest what they had seen and when they heard the news
8058-99403-0035	train-other-500	they could not be kept close where they were but must all run out to see how things stood At last they thought that the best thing to do would be while it was dark to send old Jaf out as a spy to learn who they were and what they meant to do
8058-99403-0036	train-other-500	When the old man had been gone an hour or two he brought word back that he had been in the midst of the foes though they had not seen him and that they were in two sets or tribes who were at war and had come there to fight
8058-99403-0037	train-other-500	And so it was for in a short time they heard the noise of the fight which went on for two hours and at the end with three loud shouts or screams they left the isle in their boats
8058-99403-0038	train-other-500	Thus my friends were set free from all their fears and saw no more of their wild foes for some time One day a whim took the three bad men that they would go to the main land from whence the wild men came
8058-99403-0039	train-other-500	and try if they could not seize some of them and bring them home as slaves so as to make them do the hard part of their work for them The chief gave them all the arms and stores that they could want and a large boat to go in
8058-99403-0040	train-other-500	but when they bade them God speed no one thought that they would find their way back to the isle But lo in three weeks and a day they did in truth come back One of the two good men was the first to catch sight of them and tell the news to his friends
8058-99403-0041	train-other-500	The men said that they had found the land in two days and that the wild men gave them roots and fish to eat and were so kind as to bring down eight slaves to take back with them three of whom were men and five were girls
8058-99403-0042	train-other-500	So they gave their good hosts an axe an old key and a knife and brought off the slaves in their boat to the isle
none	none	 As the chief and his friends did not care to wed the young girls the five men who had been the crew of Paul s ship drew lots for choice so that each had a wife and the three men slaves were set to work for the two good men though there was not much for them to do But one of them ran off to the woods and they could not hear of him more They had good cause to think that he found his way home as in three or four weeks some wild men came to the isle and when they had had their feast and dance they went off in two days time So my friends might well fear that if this slave got safe home he would be sure to tell the wild men that they were in the isle and in what part of it they might be found And so it came to pass for in less than two months six boats of wild men with eight or ten men in each boat came to the north side of the isle where they had not been known to come up to that time The foe had brought their boats to land not more than a mile from the tent of the two good men and it was there that the slave who had run off had been kept These men had the good luck to see the boats when they were a long way off so that it took them quite an hour from that time to reach the shore My friends now had to think how that hour was to be spent The first thing they did was to bind the two slaves that were left and to take their wives and as much of their stores as they could to some dark place in the woods They then sent a third slave to the chief and his men to tell them the news and to ask for help They had not gone far in the woods when they saw to their great grief and rage that their huts were in flames and that the wild men ran to and fro like beasts in search of prey But still our men went on and did not halt till they came to a thick part of the wood where the large trunk of an old tree stood and in this tree they both took their post But they had not been there long when two of the wild men ran that way and they saw three more and then five more who all ran the same way as if they knew where they were Our two poor men made up their minds to let the first two pass and then take the three and the five in line as they came up but to fire at one at a time as the first shot might chance to hit all three So the man who was to fire put three or four balls in his gun and from a hole in the tree took a sure aim and stood still till the three wild men came so near that he could not miss them They soon saw that one of these three was the slave that had fled from them as they both knew him well and they made up their minds that they would kill him though they should both fire At the first shot two of the wild men fell dead and the third had a graze on his arm and though not much hurt sat down on the ground with loud screams and yells When the five men who came next heard the sound of the gun and the slave s cries they stood still at first as if they were struck dumb with fright So our two men both shot off their guns in the midst of them and then ran up and bound them safe with cords They then went to the thick part of the wood where they had put their wives and slaves to see if all were safe there and to their joy they found that though the wild men had been quite near them they had not found them out While they were here the chief and his men came up and told them that the rest had gone to take care of my old house and grove in case the troop of wild men should spread so far that way They then went back to the burnt huts and when they came in sight of the shore they found that their foes had all gone out to sea So they set to work to build up their huts and as all the men in the isle lent them their aid they were soon in a way to thrive once more For five or six months they saw no more of the wild men But one day a large fleet of more than a score of boats came in sight full of men who had bows darts clubs swords and such like arms of war and our friends were all in great fear As they came at dusk and at the East side of the isle our men had the whole night to think of what they should do And as they knew that the most safe way was to hide and lie in wait they first of all took down the huts which were built for the two good men and drove their goats to the cave for they thought the wild men would go straight there as soon as it was day and play the old game The next day they took up their post with all their force at the wood near the home of the two men to wait for the foe They gave no guns to the slaves but each of them had a long staff with a spike at the end of it and by his side an axe There were two of the wives who could not be kept back but would go out and fight with bows and darts The wild men came on with a bold and fierce mien not in a line but all in crowds here and there to the point were our men lay in wait for them When they were so near as to be in range of the guns our men shot at them right and left with five or six balls in each charge As the foe came up in close crowds they fell dead on all sides and most of those that they did not kill were much hurt so that great fear and dread came on them all Our men then fell on them from three points with the butt end of their guns swords and staves and did their work so well that the wild men set up a loud shriek and flew for their lives to the woods and hills with all the speed that fear and swift feet could help them to do As our men did not care to chase them they got to the shore where they had come to land and where the boats lay But their rout was not yet at an end for it blew a great storm that day from the sea so that they could not put off And as the storm went on all that night when the tide came up the surge of the sea drove most of their boats so high on the shore that they could not be got off save with great toil and the force of the waves on the beach broke some of them to bits At break of day our men went forth to find them and when they saw the state of things they got some dry wood from a dead tree and set their boats on fire When the foe saw this they ran all through the isle with loud cries as if they were mad so that our men did not know at first what to do with them for they trod all the corn down with their feet and tore up the vines just as the grapes were ripe and did a great deal of harm At last they brought old Jaf to them to tell them how kind they would be to them that they would save their lives and give them part of the isle to live in if they would keep in their own bounds and that they should have corn to plant and should make it grow for their bread They were but too glad to have such good terms of peace and they soon learnt to make all kinds of work with canes wood and sticks such as chairs stools and beds and this they did with great skill when they were once taught From this time till I came back to the isle my friends saw no more wild men I now told the chief that I had not come to take off his men but to bring more and to give them all such things as they would want to guard their homes from foes and cheer up their hearts The next day I made a grand feast for them all and the ship s cook and mate came on shore to dress it We brought out our rounds of salt beef and pork a bowl of punch some beer and French wines and Carl gave the cooks five whole kids to roast three of which were sent to the crew on board ship that they on their part might feast on fresh meat from shore I gave each of the men a shirt a coat a hat and a pair of shoes and I need not say how glad they were to meet with gifts so new to them Then I brought out the tools of which each man had a spade a rake an axe a crow a saw a knife and such like things as well as arms and all that they could want for the use of them As I saw there was a kind will on all sides I now took on shore the youth and the maid whom we had brought from the ship that we met on her way to France The girl had been well brought up and all the crew had a good word for her As they both had a wish to be left on the isle I gave them each a plot of ground on which they had tents and barns built I had brought out with me five men to live here one of whom could turn his hand to all sorts of things so I gave him the name of Jack of all Trades One day the French priest came to ask if I would leave my man Friday here for through him he said he could talk to the black men in their own tongue and teach them the things of God Need I add said he that it was for this cause that I came here I felt that I could not part with my man Friday for the whole world so I told the priest that if I could have made up my mind to leave him here I was quite sure that Friday would not part from me When I had seen that all things were in a good state on the isle I set to work to put my ship to rights to go home once more One day as I was on my way to it the youth whom I had brought from the ship that was burnt came up to me and said Sir you have brought a priest with you and while you are here we want him to wed two of us I made a guess that one of these must be the maid that I had brought to the isle and that it was the wish of the young man to make her his wife I spoke to him with some warmth in my tone and bade him turn it well in his mind first as the girl was not in the same rank of life as he had been brought up in But he said with a smile that I had made a wrong guess for it was Jack of all Trades that he had come to plead for It gave me great joy to hear this as the maid was as good a girl as could be and I thought well of Jack so on that day I gave her to him They were to have a large piece of ground to grow their crops on with a house to live in and sheds for their goats The isle was now set out in this way all the west end was left waste so that if the wild men should land on it they might come and go and hurt no one My old house I gave to the chief with all its woods which now spread out as far as the creek and the south end was for the white men and their wives It struck me that there was one gift which I had not thought of and that was the book of God s Word which I knew would give to those who could feel the words in it fresh strength for their work and grace to bear the ills of life Now that I had been in the isle quite a month I once more set sail on the fifth day of May and all my friends told me that they should stay there till I came to fetch them When we had been out three days though the sea was smooth and calm we saw that it was quite black on the land side and as we knew not what to make of it I sent the chief mate up the main mast to find out with his glass what it could be He said it was a fleet of scores and scores of small boats full of wild men who came fast at us with fierce looks As soon as we got near them I gave word to furl all sails and stop the ship and as there was nought to fear from them but fire to get the boats out and man them both well and so wait for them to come up In this way we lay by for them and in a short time they came up with us but as I thought they would try to row round and so close us in I told the men in the boats not to let them come too near This though we did not mean it brought us to a fight with them and they shot a cloud of darts at our boats We did not fire at them yet in half an hour they went back out to sea and then came straight to us till we were so near that they could hear us speak I bade my men keep close so as to be safe from their darts if they should shoot and get out the guns I then sent Friday on deck to call out to them in their own tongue and ask what they meant It may be that they did not know what he said but as soon as he spoke to them I heard him cry out that they would shoot This was too true for they let fly a thick cloud of darts and to my great grief poor Friday fell dead for there was no one else in their sight He was shot with three darts and three more fell quite near him so good was their aim I was so mad with rage at the loss of my dear Friday that I bade the men load five guns with small shot and four with large and we gave them such a fierce fire that in all their lives they could not have seen one like it Then a rare scene met our eyes dread and fear came on them all for their boats which were small were split and sunk three or four by one shot The men who were not dead had to swim and those who had wounds were left to sink for all the rest got off as fast as they could Our boat took up one poor man who had to swim for his life when the rest had fled for the space of half an hour In three hours time we could not see more than three or four of their boats and as a breeze sprang up we set sail At first the man whom we took on board would not eat or speak and we all had fears lest he should pine to death But when we had taught him to say a few words he told us that his friends the wild men had come out with their kin to have a great fight and that all they meant was to make us look at the grand sight So it was for this that poor Friday fell He who had been as good and true to me as man could be And now in deep grief I must take my leave of him We went on with a fair wind to All Saints Bay and here I found a sloop that I had brought with me from home that I might send men and stores for the use of my friends in the isle I taught the mate how to find the place and when he came back I found that he had done so with ease One of our crew had a great wish to go with the sloop and live on the isle if the chief would give him land to plant So I told him he should go by all means and gave him the wild man for his slave I found too that a man who had come with his wife and child and three slaves to hide from the king of Spain would like to go if he could have some land there though he had but a small stock to take with him so I put them all on board the sloop and saw them safe out of the bay on their way to the isle With them I sent three milch cows five calves a horse and a colt all of which as I heard went safe and sound I have now no more to say of my isle as I had left it for the last time but my life in lands no less far from home was not yet at an end From the Bay of All Saints we went straight to the Cape of Good Hope Here I made up my mind to part from the ship in which I had come from the Isle and with two of the crew to stay on land and leave the rest to go on their way I soon made friends with some men from France as well as from my own land and two Jews who had come out to the Cape to trade As I found that some goods which I had brought with me from home were worth a great deal I made a large sum by the sale of them When we had been at the Cape of Good Hope for nine months we thought that the best thing we could do would be to hire a ship and sail to the Spice Isles to buy cloves so we got a ship and men to work her and set out When we had bought and sold our goods in the course of trade we came back and then set out once more so that in short as we went from port to port to and fro I spent from first to last six years in this part of the world At length we thought we would go and seek new scenes where we could get fresh gains And a strange set of men we at last fell in with as you who read this tale will say when you look at the print in front of this page When we had put on shore we made friends with a man who got us a large house built with canes and a small kind of hut of the same near it It had a high fence of canes round it to keep out thieves of whom it seems there are not a few in that land The name of the town was Ching and we found that the fair or mart which was kept there would not be held for three or four months So we sent our ship back to the Cape as we meant to stay in this part of the world for some time and go from place to place to see what sort of a land it was and then come back to the fair at Ching We first went to a town which it was well worth our while to see and which must have been as near as I can guess quite in the heart of this land It was built with straight streets which ran in cross lines But I must own when I came home to the place of my birth I was much struck to hear my friends say such fine things of the wealth and trade of these parts of the world for I saw and knew that the men were a mere herd or crowd of mean slaves What is their trade to ours or to that of France and Spain What are their ports with a few junks and barks to our grand fleets One of our large ships of war would sink all their ships one line of French troops would beat all their horse and the same may be said of their ports which would not stand for one month such a siege as we could bring to bear on them In three weeks more we came to their chief town When we had laid in a large stock of tea shawls fans raw silks and such like goods we set out for the north As we knew we should run all kinds of risks on our way we took with us a strong force to act as a guard and to keep us from the wild hordes who rove from place to place all through the land Some of our men were Scots who had come out to trade here and had great wealth and I was glad to join them as it was by no means the first time that they had been here We took five guides with us and we all put our coin in one purse to buy food on the way and to pay the men who took charge of us One of us we chose out for our chief to take the lead in case we should have to fight for our lives and when the time came we had no small need of him On the sides of all the roads we saw men who made pots cups pans and such like ware out of a kind of earth which is in fact the chief trade in this part of the world One thing the guide said he would show me that was not to be seen in all the world else and this in good sooth I could not sneer at as I had done at most of the things I had seen here and this was a house that was built of a kind of ware such as most plates and cups are made of How big is it said I can we take it on the back of a horse On a horse said the guide why two score of men live in it He then took us to it and I found that it was in truth a large house built with lath and the best ware that can be made out of earth The sun shone hot on the walls which were quite white hard and smooth as glass with forms on them in blue paint On the walls of the rooms were small square tiles of the best ware with red blue and green paint of all shades and hues in rare forms done in good taste and as they use the same kind of earth to join the tiles with you could not see where the tiles met The floors of the rooms were made of the same ware and as strong as those we have at home and the same may be said of the roofs but they were of a dark shade If we had had more time to spare I should have been glad to have seen more of this house for there were the ponds for the fish the walks the yards and courts which were all made in the same way This odd sight kept me from my friends for two hours and when I had come up to them I had to pay a fine to our chief as they had to wait so long In two days more we came to the Great Wall which was made as a fort to keep the whole land safe and a great work it is It goes in a long track for miles and miles where the rocks are so high and steep that no foe could climb them or if they did no wall could stop them The Great Wall is as thick as it is high and it turns and winds in all sorts of ways We now saw for the first time some troops of the hordes I spoke of who rove from place to place to rob and kill all whom they meet with They know no real mode of war or skill in fight Each has a poor lean horse which is not fit to do good work Our chief gave some of us leave to go out and hunt as they call it and what was it but to hunt sheep These sheep are wild and swift of foot but they will not run far and you are sure of sport when you start in the chase They go in flocks of a score or two and like true sheep keep close when they fly In this sort of chase it was our hap to meet with some two score of the wild hordes but what sort of prey they had come to hunt I know not As soon as they saw us one of them blew some loud notes on a kind of horn with a sound that was quite new to me We all thought this was to call their friends round them and so it was for in a short time a fresh troop of the same size came to join them and they were all as far as we could judge a mile off One of the Scots was with us and as soon as he heard the horn he told us that we must lose no time but draw up in line and charge them at once We told him we would if he would take the lead They stood still and cast a wild gaze at us like a mere crowd drawn up in no line but as soon as they saw us come at them they let fly their darts which did not hit us for though their aim was true they fell short of us We now came to a halt to fire at them and then went at full speed to fall on them sword in hand for so the bold Scot that led us told us to do As soon as we came up to them they fled right and left The sole stand made was by three of them who had a kind of short sword in their hands and bows on their backs and who did all they could to call all the rest back to them The brave Scot rode close up to them and with his gun threw one off his horse shot the next and the third ran off and this was the end of our fight All the bad luck we met with was that the sheep that we had in chase got off We had not a man hurt but as for the foe five of them were dead and not a few had wounds while the rest fled at the mere noise of our guns Thus we went on our way from town to town and now and then met some of these wild hordes whom we had to fight and I need not add that each time we had the best of the fray At last we made our way to the chief town of the North Seas at the end of a year five months and three days from the time when we left Ching When I had been there six weeks and had bought some more goods I took ship and set sail for the land of my birth which I had left this time for ten years nine months and three days And now I must bring this tale of my life to a close while at the age of three score years and twelve I feel that the day is at hand when I shall go
