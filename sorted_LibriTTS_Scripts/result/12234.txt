none	none	PART I CHAPTER I mister SCARBOROUGH It will be necessary for the purpose of my story that I shall go back more than once from the point at which it begins so that I may explain with the least amount of awkwardness the things as they occurred which led up to the incidents that I am about to tell and I may as well say that these first four chapters of the book though they may be thought to be the most interesting of them all by those who look to incidents for their interest in a tale are in this way only preliminary The world has not yet forgotten the intensity of the feeling which existed when old mister Scarborough declared that his well known eldest son was not legitimate mister Scarborough himself had not been well known in early life He had been the only son of a squire in Staffordshire over whose grounds a town had been built and pottery works established In this way a property which had not originally been extensive had been greatly increased in value and mister Scarborough when he came into possession had found himself to be a rich man He had then gone abroad and had there married an English lady After the lapse of some years he had returned to Tretton Park as his place was named and there had lost his wife He had come back with two sons Mountjoy and Augustus and there at Tretton he had lived spending however a considerable portion of each year in chambers in the Albany He was a man who through many years had had his own circle of friends but as I have said before he was not much known in the world He was luxurious and self indulgent and altogether indifferent to the opinion of those around him But he was affectionate to his children and anxious above all things for their welfare or rather happiness Some marvellous stories were told as to his income which arose chiefly from the Tretton delf works and from the town of Tretton which had been built chiefly on his very park in consequence of the nature of the clay and the quality of the water As a fact the original four thousand a year to which his father had been born had grown to twenty thousand by nature of the operations which had taken place But the whole of this whether four thousand or twenty thousand was strictly entailed and mister Scarborough had been very anxious since his second son was born to create for him also something which might amount to opulence But they who knew him best knew that of all things he hated most the entail The boys were both educated at Eton and the elder went into the Guards having been allowed an intermediate year in order to learn languages on the Continent He had then become a cornet in the Coldstreams and had from that time lived a life of reckless expenditure His brother Augustus had in the mean time gone to Cambridge and become a barrister He had been called but two years when the story was made known of his father s singular assertion As from that time it became unnecessary for him to practise his profession no more was heard of him as a lawyer But they who had known the young man in the chambers of that great luminary mister Rugby declared that a very eminent advocate was now spoiled by a freak of fortune Of his brother Mountjoy or Captain Scarborough as he came to be known at an early period of his life the stories which were told in the world at large were much too remarkable to be altogether true But it was only too true that he lived as though the wealth at his command were without limit For some few years his father bore with him patiently doubling his allowance and paying his bills for him again and again He made up his mind with many regrets that enough had been done for his younger son who would surely by his intellect be able to do much for himself But then it became necessary to encroach on the funds already put by and at last there came the final blow when he discovered that Captain Scarborough had raised large sums on post obits from the Jews The Jews simply requested the father to pay the money or some portion of it which if

none	none	paid would satisfy them explaining to him that otherwise the whole property would at his death fall into their hands It need not here be explained how through one sad year these negotiations were prolonged but at last there came a time in which mister Scarborough sitting in his chambers in the Albany boldly declared his purpose He sent for his own lawyer mister Grey and greatly astonished that gentleman by declaring to him that Captain Scarborough was illegitimate At first mister Grey refused altogether to believe the assertion made to him He had been very conversant with the affairs of the family and had even dealt with marriage settlements on behalf of the lady in question He knew mister Scarborough well or rather had not known him but had heard much of him and therefore suspected him mister Grey was a thoroughly respectable man and mister Scarborough though upright and honorable in many dealings had not been thoroughly respectable He had lived with his wife off and on as people say Though he had saved much of his money for the purpose above described he had also spent much of it in a manner which did not approve itself to mister Grey mister Grey had thoroughly disliked the eldest son and had in fact been afraid of him The captain in the few interviews that had been necessary between them had attempted to domineer over the lawyer till there had at last sprung up a quarrel in which to tell the truth the father took the part of the son mister Grey had for a while been so offended as to find it necessary to desire mister Scarborough to employ another lawyer He had not however done so and the breach had never become absolute In these circumstances mister Scarborough had sent for mister Grey to come to him at the Albany and had there from his bed declared that his eldest son was illegitimate mister Grey had at first refused to accept the assertion as being worth anything and had by no means confined himself to polite language in expressing his belief I would much rather have nothing to do with it he had said when mister Scarborough insisted on the truth of his statement But the evidence is all here said mister Scarborough laying his hand on a small bundle of papers The difficulty would have been and the danger in causing Mountjoy to have been accepted in his brother s place There can be no doubt that I was not married till after Mountjoy was born mister Grey s curiosity was roused and he began to ask questions Why in the first place had mister Scarborough behaved so dishonestly Why had he originally not married his wife And then why had he married her If as he said the proofs were so easy how had he dared to act so directly in opposition to the laws of his country Why indeed had he been through the whole of his life so bad a man so bad to the woman who had borne his name so bad to the son whom he called illegitimate and so bad also to the other son whom he now intended to restore to his position solely with the view of defrauding the captain s creditors In answer to this mister Scarborough though he was suffering much at the time so much as to be considered near to his death had replied with the most perfect good humor He had done very well he thought by his wife whom he had married after she had consented to live with him on other terms He had done very well by his elder son for whom he had intended the entire property He had done well by his second son for whom he had saved his money It was now his first duty to save the property He regarded himself as being altogether unselfish and virtuous from his point of view When mister Grey had spoken about the laws of his country he had simply smiled though he was expecting a grievous operation on the following day As for marriage he had no great respect for it except as a mode of enabling men and women to live together comfortably As for the outraged laws of his country of which mister Grey spoke much he did not care a straw for such outrages nor indeed for the expressed opinion of mankind as to his conduct He was very soon about to leave the world and meant to do the best he could for his son Augustus The other son was past all hope He was hardly angry with his eldest son who had undoubtedly given him cause for just anger His apparent motives in telling the truth about him at last were rather those of defrauding the Jews who had expressed themselves to him with brutal audacity than that of punishing the one son or doing justice to the other but even of them he spoke with a cynical good humor triumphing in his idea of thoroughly getting the better of them I am consoled mister Grey he said when I think how probably it might all have been discovered after my death I should have destroyed all these and he laid his hands upon the papers but still there might have been discovery mister Grey could not but think that during the last twenty four years the period which had elapsed since the birth of the younger son no idea of such a truth had occurred to himself He did at last consent to take the papers in his hands and to read them through with care He took them away with that promise and with an assurance that he would bring them back on the day but one following should mister Scarborough then be alive mister Scarborough who seemed at that moment to have much life in him insisted on this proviso The surgeon is to be here to morrow you know and his coming may mean a great deal You will have the papers which are quite clear and will know what to do I shall see Mountjoy myself this evening I suppose he will have the grace to come as he does not know what he is coming for Then the father smiled again and the lawyer went mister Scarborough though he was very strong of heart did have some misgivings as the time came at which he was to see his son The communication which he had to make was certainly one of vital importance His son had some time since instigated him to come to terms with the family creditors as the captain boldly called them Seeing that I never owed a shilling in my life or my father before me it is odd that I should have family creditors the father had answered The property has then at any rate the son had said with a scowl But that was now twelve months since before mankind and the Jews among them had heard of mister Scarborough s illness Now there could be no question of dealing on favorable terms with these gentlemen mister Scarborough was therefore aware that the evil thing which he was about to say to his son would have lost its extreme bitterness It did not occur to him that in making such a revelation as to his son s mother he would inflict any great grief on his son s heart To be illegitimate would be he thought nothing unless illegitimacy carried with it loss of property He hardly gave weight enough to the feeling that the eldest son was the eldest son and too little to the triumph which was present to his own mind in saving the property for one of the family Augustus was but the captain s brother but he was the old squire s son The two brothers had hitherto lived together on fairly good terms for the younger had been able to lend money to the elder and the elder had found his brother neither severe or exacting How it might be between them when their relations with each other should be altogether changed mister Scarborough did not trouble himself to inquire The captain by his own reckless folly had lost his money had lost all that fortune would have given him as his father s eldest son After having done so what could it matter to him whether he were legitimate or illegitimate His brother as possessor of Tretton Park would be able to do much more for him than could be expected from a professional man working for his bread mister Scarborough had looked at the matter all round for the space of two years and during the latter year had slowly resolved on his line of action He had had no scruple in passing off his eldest born as legitimate and now would have none in declaring the truth to the world What scruple need he have seeing that he was so soon about to leave the world As to what took place at that interview between the father and the son very much was said among the clubs and in societies to which Captain Mountjoy Scarborough was well known but very little of absolute truth was ever revealed It was known that Captain Scarborough left the room under the combined authority of apothecaries and servants and that the old man had fainted from the effects of the interview He had undoubtedly told the son of the simple facts as he had declared them to mister Grey but had thought it to be unnecessary to confirm his statement by any proof Indeed the proofs such as they were the written testimony that is were at that moment in the hands of mister Grey and to mister Grey the father had at last referred the son But the son had absolutely refused to believe for a moment in the story and had declared that his father and mister Grey had conspired together to rob him of his inheritance and good name The interview was at last over and mister Scarborough at one moment fainting and in the next suffering the extremest agony was left alone with his thoughts Captain Scarborough when he left his father s rooms and found himself going out from the Albany into Piccadilly was an infuriated but at the same time a most wretched man He did believe that a conspiracy had been hatched and he was resolved to do his best to defeat it let the effect be what it might on the property but yet there was a strong feeling in his breast that the fraud would be successful No man could possibly be environed by worse circumstances as to his own condition He owed he knew not what amount of money to several creditors but then he owed which troubled him more gambling debts which he could only pay by his brother s assistance And now as he thought of it he felt convinced that his brother must be joined with his father and the lawyer in this conspiracy He felt also that he could meet neither mister Grey nor his brother without personally attacking them All the world might perish but he with his last breath would declare himself to be Captain Mountjoy Scarborough of Tretton Park and though he knew at the moment that he must perish as regarded social life among his comrades unless he could raise five hundred pounds from his brother yet he felt that were he to meet his brother he could not but fly at his throat and accuse him of the basest villany At that moment at the corner of Bond Street he did meet his brother What is this said he fiercely What is what said Augustus without any fierceness What is up now I have just come from my father And how is the governor If I were he I should be in a most awful funk I should hardly be able to think of anything but that man who is to come to morrow with his knives But he takes it all as cool as a cucumber There was something in this which at once shook though it did not remove the captain s belief and he said something as to the property Then there came questions and answers in which the captain did not reveal the story which had been told to him but the barrister did assert that he had as yet heard nothing as to anything of importance As to Tretton the captain believed his brother s manner rather than his words In fact the barrister had heard nothing as yet of what was to be done on his behalf The interview ended in the two men going and dining at a club where the captain told the whole story of his father s imagined iniquity Augustus received the tale almost in silence In reply to his brother s authoritative domineering speeches he said nothing To him it was all new but to him also it seemed certainly to be untrue He did not at all bring himself to believe that mister Grey was in the conspiracy but he had no scruple of paternal regard to make him feel that this father would not concoct such a scheme simply because he was his father It would be a saving of the spoil from the Amalekites and of this idea he did give a hardly expressed hint to his brother By George said the captain nothing of the kind shall be done with my consent Why no the barrister had answered I suppose that neither your consent nor mine is to be asked and it seems as though it were a farce ordered to be played over the poor governor s grave He has prepared a romance as to the truth or falsehood of which neither you nor I can possibly be called as witnesses It was clear to the captain that his brother had thought that the plot had been prepared by their father in anticipation of his own death Nevertheless by the younger brother s assistance the much needed sum of money was found for the supply of the elder s immediate wants The next day was the day of terror and nothing more was heard either then or for the following week of the old gentleman s scheme In two days it was understood that his death might be hourly expected but on the third it was thought that he might pull through as his younger son filially expressed himself He was constantly with his father but not a word passed his lips as to the property The elder son kept himself gloomily apart and indeed during a part of the next week was out of London Augustus Scarborough did call on mister Grey but only learned from him that it was at any rate true that the story had been told by his father mister Grey refused to make any farther communication simply saying that he would as yet express no opinion For myself said Augustus as he left the attorney s chambers I can only profess myself so much astonished as to have no opinion I suppose I must simply wait and see what Fortune intends to do with me At the end of a fortnight mister Scarborough had so far recovered his strength as to be able to be moved down to Tretton and thither he went It was not many days after that the world was first informed that Captain Scarborough was not his father s heir The world received the information with a great deal of expressed surprise and inward satisfaction satisfaction that the money lenders should be done out of their money that a professed gambler like Captain Scarborough should suddenly become an illegitimate nobody and more interesting still that a very wealthy and well conditioned if not actually respectable squire should have proved himself to be a most brazen faced rascal All of these were matters which gave extreme delight to the world at large At first there came little paragraphs without any name and then some hours afterward the names became known to the quidnuncs and in a short space of time were in possession of the very gentry who found themselves defrauded in this singular manner It is not necessary here that I should recapitulate all the circumstances of the original fraud for a gross fraud had been perpetrated After the perpetration of that fraud papers had been prepared by mister Scarborough himself with a great deal of ingenuity and the matter had been so arranged that but for his own declaration his eldest son would undoubtedly have inherited the property Now there was no measure to the clamor and the uproar raised by the money lenders mister Grey s outer office was besieged but his clerk simply stated that the facts would be proved on mister Scarborough s death as clearly as it might be possible to prove them The curses uttered against the old squire were bitter and deep but during this time he was still supposed to be lying at death s door and did not in truth himself expect to live many days The creditors of course believed that the story was a fiction None of them were enabled to see Captain Scarborough who after a short period disappeared altogether from the scene But they were one and all convinced that the matter had been arranged between him and his father There was one from whom better things were expected than to advance money on post obits to a gambler at a rate by which he was to be repaid one hundred pounds for every forty pounds on the death of a gentleman who was then supposed to be dying For it was proved afterward that this mister Tyrrwhit had made most minute inquiries among the old squire s servants as to the state of their master s health He had supplied forty thousand pounds for which he was to receive one hundred thousand pounds when the squire died alleging that he should have difficulty in recovering the money But he had collected the sum so advanced on better terms among his friends and had become conspicuously odious in the matter In about a month s time it was generally believed that mister Scarborough had so managed matters that his scheme would be successful A struggle was made to bring the matter at once into the law courts but the attempt for the moment failed It was said that the squire down at Tretton was too ill but that proceedings would be taken as soon as he was able to bear them Rumors were afloat that he would be taken into custody and it was even asserted that two policemen were in the house at Tretton But it was soon known that no policemen were there and that the squire was free to go whither he would or rather whither he could In fact though the will to punish him and even to arrest him was there no one had the power to do him an injury It was then declared that he had in no sense broken the law that no evil act of his could be proved that though he had wished his eldest son to inherit the property wrongfully he had only wished it and that he had now simply put his wishes into unison with the law and had undone the evil which he had hitherto only contemplated Indeed the world at large rather sympathized with the squire when mister Tyrrwhit s dealings became known for it was supposed by many that mister Tyrrwhit was to have become the sole owner of Tretton But the creditors were still loud and still envenomed They and their emissaries hung about Tretton and demanded to know where was the captain Of the captain s whereabouts his father knew nothing not even whether he was still alive for the captain had actually disappeared from the world and his creditors could obtain no tidings respecting him At this period and for long afterward they imagined that he and his father were in league together and were determined to try at law the question as to the legitimacy of his birth as soon as the old squire should be dead But the old squire did not die Though his life was supposed to be most precarious he still continued to live and became even stronger But he remained shut up at Tretton and utterly refused to see any emissary of any creditor To give mister Tyrrwhit his due it must be acknowledged that he personally sent no emissaries having contented himself with putting the

none	none	into the hands of a very sharp attorney But there were emissaries from others who after a while were excluded altogether from the park Here mister Scarborough continued to live coming out on to the lawn in his easy chair and there smoking his cigar and reading his French novel through the hot July days To tell the truth he cared very little for the emissaries excepting so far as they had been allowed to interfere with his own personal comfort In these days he had down with him two or three friends from London who were good enough to make up for him a whist table in the country but he found the chief interest in his life in the occasional visits of his younger son I look upon Mountjoy as utterly gone he said But he has utterly gone his other son replied As to that I care nothing
7717_104491_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 I do 
none	none	not believe that a man can be murdered without leaving a trace of his murder A man cannot even throw himself overboard without being missed I know nothing of his whereabouts nothing at all But I must say that his absence is a relief to me The only comfort left to me in this world is in your presence and in those material good things which I am still able to enjoy This assertion as to his ignorance about his eldest son the squire repeated again and again to his chosen heir feeling it was only probable that Augustus might participate in the belief which he knew to be only too common There was no doubt an idea prevalent that the squire and the captain were in league together to cheat the creditors and that the squire who in these days received much undeserved credit for Machiavellian astuteness knew more than any one else respecting his eldest son s affairs But in truth he at first knew nothing and in making these assurances to his younger son was altogether wasting his breath for his younger son knew everything CHAPTER II FLORENCE MOUNTJOY mister Scarborough had a niece one Florence Mountjoy to whom it had been intended that Captain Scarborough should be married There had been no considerations of money when the intention had been first formed for the lady was possessed of no more than ten thousand pounds which would have been as nothing to the prospects of the captain when the idea was first entertained But mister Scarborough was fond of people who belonged to him In this way he had been much attached to his late brother in law General Mountjoy and had perceived that his niece was beautiful and graceful and was in every way desirable as one who might be made in part thus to belong to himself Florence herself when the idea of the marriage was first suggested to her by her mother was only eighteen and received it with awe rather than with pleasure or abhorrence To her her cousin Mountjoy had always been a most magnificent personage He was only seven years her senior but he had early in life assumed the manners as he had also done the vices of mature age and loomed large in the girl s eyes as a man of undoubted wealth and fashion At that period three years antecedent to his father s declaration he had no doubt been much in debt but his debts had not been generally known and his father had still thought that a marriage with his cousin might serve to settle him to use the phrase which was common with himself From that day to this the courtship had gone on and the squire had taught himself to believe that the two cousins were all but engaged to each other He had so considered it at any rate for two years till during the last final year he had resolved to throw the captain overboard And even during this year there had been periods of hope for he had not finally made up his mind till but a short time before he had put it in practice No doubt he was fond of his niece in accordance with his own capability for fondness He would caress her and stroke her hair and took delight in having her near to him And of true love for such a girl his heart was quite capable He was a good natured fearless but not a selfish man to whom the fate in life of this poor girl was a matter of real concern And his eldest son who was by no means good natured had something of the same nature He did love truly after his own fashion of loving He would have married his cousin at any moment with or without her ten thousand pounds for of all human beings he was the most reckless And yet in his breast was present a feeling of honor of which his father knew nothing When it was explained to him that his mother s fair name was to be aspersed a mother whom he could but faintly remember the threat did bring with it its own peculiar agony But of this the squire neither felt or knew anything The lady had long been dead and could be none the better or the worse for aught that could be said of her To the captain it was not so and it was preferable to him to believe his father to be dishonest than his mother He at any rate was in truth in love with his cousin Florence and when the story was told to him one of its first effects was the bearing which it would have upon her mind It has been said that within two or three days after the communication he had left London He had done so in order that he might at once go down to Cheltenham and see his cousin There Miss Mountjoy lived with her mother The time had been when Florence Mountjoy had been proud of her cousin and to tell the truth of her feelings though she had never loved him she had almost done so Rumors had made their way through even to her condition of life and she in her innocence had gradually been taught to believe that Captain Scarborough was not a man whom she could be safe in loving And there had perhaps come another as to whom her feelings were different She had no doubt at first thought that she would be willing to become her cousin s wife but she had never said as much herself And now both her heart and mind were set against him Captain Scarborough as he went down to Cheltenham turned the matter over in his mind thinking within himself how best he might carry out his project His intention was to obtain from his cousin an assurance of her love and a promise that it should not be shaken by any stories which his father might tell respecting him For this purpose he he must make known to her the story his father had told him and his own absolute disbelief in it Much else must be confided to her He must acknowledge in part his own debts and must explain that his father had taken this course in order to defraud the creditors All this would be very difficult but he must trust in her innocence and generosity He thought that the condition of his affairs might be so represented that the story should tend rather to win her heart toward him than to turn it away Her mother had hitherto always been in his favor and he had in fact been received almost as an Apollo in the house at Cheltenham Florence he said I must see you alone for a few minutes I know that your mother will trust you with me This was spoken immediately on his arrival and missus Mountjoy at once left the room She had been taught to believe that it was her daughter s duty to marry her cousin and though she knew that the captain had done much to embarrass the property she thought that this would be the surest way to settle him The heir of Tretton Park was in her estimation so great a man that very much was to be endured at his hands The meeting between the two cousins was very long and when missus Mountjoy at last returned unannounced to the room she found her daughter in tears Oh Florence what is the matter asked her mother The poor girl said nothing but still continued to weep while the captain stood by looking as black as a thunder cloud What is it Mountjoy said missus Mountjoy turning to him I have told Florence some of my troubles said he and they seemed to have changed her mind toward me There was something in this which was detestable to Florence an unfairness a dishonesty in putting off upon his trouble that absence of love which she had at last been driven by his vows to confess She knew that it was not because of his present trouble which she understood to be terrible but which she could not in truth comprehend He had blurted it all out roughly the story as told by his father of his mother s dishonor of his own insignificance in the world of the threatened loss of the property of the heaviness of his debts and added his conviction that his father had invented it all and was in fact a thorough rascal The full story of his debts he kept back not with any predetermined falseness but because it is so difficult for a man to own that he has absolutely ruined himself by his own folly It was not wonderful that the girl should not have understood such a story as had then been told her Why was he defending his mother Why was he accusing his father The accusations against her uncle whom she did know were more fearful to her than these mysterious charges against her aunt whom she did not know from which her son defended her But then he had spoken passionately of his own love and she had understood that He had besought her to confess that she loved him and then she had at once become stubborn There was something in the word confess which grated against her feelings It seemed to imply a conviction on his part that she did love him She had never told him so and was now sure that it was not so When he had pressed her she could only weep But in her weeping she never for a moment yielded She never uttered a single word on which he could be enabled to build a hope Then he had become blacker and still blacker fiercer and still fiercer more and more earnest in his purpose till at last he asked her whom it was that she loved as she could not love him He knew well whom it was that he suspected and she knew also But he had no right to demand any statement from her on that head She did not think that the man loved her nor did she know what to say or to think of her own feelings Were he the other man to come to her she would only bid him go away but why she should so bid him she had hardly known But now this dark frowning captain with his big mustache and his military look and his general aspect of invincible power threatened the other man He came to Tretton as my friend he said and by Heaven if he stands in my way if he dare to cross between you and me he shall answer it with his life The name had not been mentioned but this had been very terrible to Florence and she could only weep He went away refusing to stay to dinner but said that on the following afternoon he would again return In the street of the town he met one of his creditors who had discovered his journey to Cheltenham and had followed him Oh Captain Mountjoy what is all dis that they are talking about in London What are they talking about De inheritance said the man who was a veritable Jew looking up anxiously in his face The man had his acceptance for a very large sum of money with an assurance that it should be paid on his father s death for which he had given him about two thousand pounds in cash You must ask my father But is it true You must ask my father Upon my word I can tell you nothing else He has concocted a tale of which I for one do not believe a word I never heard of the story till he condescended to tell it me the other day Whether it be true or whether it be false you and I mister Hart are in the same boat But you have had de money And you have got the bill You can t do anything by coming after me My father seems to have contrived a very clever plan by which he can rob you but he will rob me at the same time You may believe me or not as you please but that you will find to be the truth Then mister Hart left him but certainly did not believe a word the captain had said to him To her mother Florence would only disclose her persistent intention of not marrying her cousin missus Mountjoy over whose spirit the glamour of the captain s prestige was still potent said much in his favor Everybody had always intended the marriage and it would be the setting right of everything The captain no doubt owed a large sum of money but that would be paid by Florence s fortune So little did the poor lady know of the captain s condition When she had been told that there had been a great quarrel between the captain and his father she declared that the marriage would set that all right But mamma Captain Scarborough is not to have the property at all Then missus Mountjoy believing thoroughly in entails had declared that all Heaven could not prevent it But that makes no difference said the daughter if I I I loved him I would marry him so much the more if he had nothing Then missus Mountjoy declared that she could not understand it at all On the next day Captain Scarborough came according to his promise but nothing that he could say would induce Florence to come into his presence Her mother declared that she was so ill that it would be wicked to disturb her CHAPTER III HARRY ANNESLEY Together with Augustus Scarborough at Cambridge had been one Harry Annesley and he it was to whom the captain in his wrath had sworn to put an end if he should come between him and his love Harry Annesley had been introduced to the captain by his brother and an intimacy had grown up between them He had brought him to Tretton Park when Florence was there and Harry had since made his own way to Cheltenham and had endeavored to plead his own cause after his own fashion This he had done after the good old English plan which is said to be somewhat loutish but is not without its efficacy He had looked at her and danced with her and done the best with his gloves and his cravat and had let her see by twenty unmistakable signs that in order to be perfectly happy he must be near her Her gloves and her flowers and her other little properties were sweeter to him than any scents and were more valuable in his eyes than precious stones But he had never as yet actually asked her to love him But she was so quick a linguist that she had understood down to the last letter what all these tokens had meant Her cousin Captain Scarborough was to her magnificent powerful but terrible withal She had asked herself a thousand times whether it would be possible for her to love him and to become his wife She had never quite given even to herself an answer to this question till she had suddenly found herself enabled to do so by his over confidence in asking her to confess that she loved him She had never acknowledged anything even to herself as to Harry Annesley She had never told herself that it would be possible that he should ask her any such question She had a wild dreamy fearful feeling that although it would be possible to her to refuse her cousin it would be impossible that she should marry any other while he should still be desirous of making her his wife And now Captain Scarborough had threatened Harry Annesley not indeed by name but still clearly enough Any dream of her own in that direction must be a vain dream As Harry Annesley is going to be what is generally called the hero of this story it is necessary that something should be said of the particulars of his life and existence up to this period There will be found to be nothing very heroic about him He is a young man with more than a fair allowance of a young man s folly it may also be said of a young man s weakness But I myself am inclined to think that there was but little of a young man s selfishness with nothing of falseness or dishonesty and I am therefore tempted to tell his story He was the son of a clergyman and the eldest of a large family of children But as he was the acknowledged heir to his mother s brother who was the squire of the parish of which his father was rector it was not thought necessary that he should follow any profession This uncle was the Squire of Buston and was after all not a rich man himself His whole property did not exceed two thousand a year an income which fifty years since was supposed to be sufficient for the moderate wants of a moderate country gentleman but though Buston be not very far removed from the centre of everything being in Hertfordshire and not more than forty miles from London mister Prosper lived so retired a life and was so far removed from the ways of men that he apparently did not know but that his heir was as completely entitled to lead an idle life as though he were the son of a duke or a brewer It must not however be imagined that mister Prosper was especially attached to his nephew When the boy left the Charter house where his uncle had paid his school bills he was sent to Cambridge with an allowance of two hundred and fifty pounds a year and that allowance was still continued to him with an assurance that under no circumstances could it ever be increased At college he had been successful and left Cambridge with a college fellowship He therefore left it with one hundred and seventy five pounds added to his income and was considered by all those at Buston Rectory to be a rich young man But Harry did not find that his combined income amounted to riches amid a world of idleness At Buston he was constantly told by his uncle of the necessity of economy Indeed mister Prosper who was a sickly little man about fifty years of age always spoke of himself as though he intended to live for another half century He rarely walked across the park to the rectory and once a week on Sundays entertained the rectory family A sad occasion it generally was to the elder of the rectory children who were thus doomed to abandon the loud pleasantries of their own home for the sober Sunday solemnities of the Hall It was not that the Squire of Buston was peculiarly a religious man or that the rector was the reverse but the parson was joyous whereas the other was solemn The squire who never went to church because he was supposed to be ill made up for the deficiency by his devotional tendencies when the children were at the Hall He read through a sermon after dinner unintelligibly and even inaudibly At this his brother in law who had an evening service in his own church of course never was present but missus Annesley and the girls were there and the younger children But Harry Annesley had absolutely declined and his uncle having found out that he never attended the church service although he always left the Hall with his father made this a ground for a quarrel It at last came to pass that mister Prosper who was jealous and irritable would hardly speak to his nephew but the two hundred and fifty pounds went on with many bickerings on the subject between the parson and the squire Once when the squire spoke of discontinuing it Harry s father reminded him that the young man had been brought up in absolute idleness in conformity with his uncle s desire This the squire denied in strong language but Harry had not hitherto run loudly in debt nor kicked over the traces very outrageously and as he absolutely must be the heir the allowance was permitted to go on There was one lady who conceived all manner of bad things as to Harry Annesley because as she alleged of the want of a profession and of any fixed income missus Mountjoy Florence s mother was this lady Florence herself had read every word in Harry s language not knowing indeed that she had read anything but still never having missed a single letter missus Mountjoy also had read a good deal though not all and dreaded the appearance of Harry as a declared lover In her eyes Captain Scarborough was a very handsome very powerful and very grand personage but she feared that Florence was being induced to refuse her allegiance to this sovereign by the interference of her other very indifferent suitor What would be Buston and two thousand a year as compared with all the glories and limitless income of the great Tretton property Captain Scarborough with his mustaches and magnificence was just the man who would be sure to become a peer She had always heard the income fixed at thirty thousand a year What would a few debts signify to thirty thousand a year Such had been her thoughts up to the period of Captain Scarborough s late visit when he had come to Cheltenham and had renewed his demand for Florence s hand somewhat roughly He had spoken ambiguous words dreadful words declaring that an internecine quarrel had taken place between him and his father but these words though they had been very dreadful had been altogether misunderstood by missus Mountjoy The property she knew to be entailed and she knew that when a property was entailed the present owner of it had nothing to do with its future disposition Captain Scarborough at any rate was anxious for the marriage and missus Mountjoy was inclined to accept him encumbered as he now was with his father s wrath in preference to poor Harry Annesley In June Harry came up to London and there learned at his club the singular story in regard to old mister Scarborough and his son mister Scarborough had declared his son illegitimate and all the world knew now that he was utterly penniless and hopelessly in debt That he had been greatly embarrassed Harry had known for many months and added to that was now the fact very generally believed that he was not and never had been the heir to Tretton Park All that still increasing property about Tretton on which so many hopes had been founded would belong to his brother Harry as he heard the tale immediately connected it with Florence He had of course known the captain was a suitor to the girl s hand and there had been a time when he thought that his own hopes were consequently vain Gradually the conviction dawned upon him that Florence did not love the grand warrior that she was afraid of him rather and awe struck It would be terrible now were she brought to marry him by this feeling of awe Then he learned that the warrior had gone down to Cheltenham and in the restlessness of his spirit he pursued him When he reached Cheltenham the warrior had already gone The property is certainly entailed said missus Mountjoy He had called at once at the house and saw the mother but Florence was discreetly sent away to her own room when the dangerous young man was admitted He is not mister Scarborough s eldest son at all said Harry that is in the eye of the law Then he had to undertake that task very difficult for a young man of explaining to her all the circumstances of the case But there was something in them so dreadful to the lady s imagination that he failed for a long time to make her comprehend it Do you mean to say that mister Scarborough was not married to his own wife Not at first And that he knew it No doubt he knew it He confesses as much himself What a very wicked man he must be said missus Mountjoy Harry could only shrug his shoulder And he meant to rob Augustus all through Harry again shrugged his shoulder Is it not much more probable that if he could be so very wicked he would be willing to deny his eldest son in order to save paying the debts Harry could only declare that the facts were as he told them or at least that all London believed them to be so that at any rate Captain Mountjoy had gambled so recklessly as to put himself for ever and ever out of reach of a shilling of the property and that it was clearly the duty of missus Mountjoy as Florence s mother not to accept him as a suitor It was only by slow degrees that the conversation had arrived at this pass Harry had never as yet declared his own love either to the mother or daughter and now appeared simply as a narrator of this terrible story But at this point it did appear to him that he must introduce himself in another guise The fact is missus Mountjoy he said starting to his feet that I am in love with your daughter myself And therefore you have come here to vilify Captain Scarborough I have come said he at any rate to tell the truth If it be as I say you cannot think it right that he should marry your daughter I say nothing of myself but that at any rate cannot be It is no business of yours mister Annesley Except that I would fain think that her business should be mine But he could not prevail with missus Mountjoy either on this day or the next to allow him to see Florence and at last was obliged to leave Cheltenham without having done so CHAPTER IV CAPTAIN SCARBOROUGH S DISAPPEARANCE A few days after the visits to Cheltenham described in the last chapters Harry Annesley coming down a passage by the side of the Junior United Service Club into Charles Street suddenly met Captain Scarborough at two o clock in the morning Where Harry had been at that hour need not now be explained but it may be presumed that he had not been drinking tea with any of his female relatives Captain Scarborough had just come out of some neighboring club where he had certainly been playing and where to all appearances he had been drinking also That there should have been no policemen in the street was not remarkable but there was no one else there present to give any account of what took place during the five minutes in which the two men remained together Harry who was at the moment surprised by the encounter would have passed the captain by without notice had he been allowed to do so but this the captain perceived and stopped him suddenly taking him roughly by the collar of his coat This Harry naturally resented and before a word of intelligible explanation had been given the two young men had quarrelled Captain Scarborough had received a long letter from missus Mountjoy praying for explanation of circumstances which could not be explained and stating over and over again that all her information had come from Harry Annesley The captain now called him an interfering meddlesome idiot and shook him violently while holding him in his grasp This was a usage which Harry was not the man to endure and there soon arose a scuffle in which blows had passed between them The captain stuck to his prey shaking him again and again in his drunken wrath till Harry roused to a passion almost equal to that of his opponent flung him at last against the corner of the club railings and there left his foe sprawling upon the ground having struck his head violently against the ground as he fell Harry passed on to his own bed indifferent as it was afterwards said to the fate of his antagonist All this occupied probably five minutes in the doing but was seen by no human eye As the occurrence of that night was subsequently made the ground for heavy accusation against Harry Annesley it has been told here with sufficient minuteness to show what might be said in justification or in condemnation of his conduct to show what might be said if the truth were spoken For indeed in the discussions which arose on the subject much was said which was not true When he had retired from the scuffle on that night Harry had certainly not dreamed that any serious damage had been done to the man who had certainly been altogether to blame in his provocation of the quarrel Had he kept his temper and feelings completely under control and knocked down Captain Scarborough only in self defence had he not allowed himself to be roused to wrath by treatment which could not but give rise to wrath in a young man s bosom no doubt when his foe lay at his feet he would have stooped to pick him up and have tended his wounds But such was not Harry s character nor that of any of the young men with whom I have been acquainted Such however was the conduct apparently expected from him by many when the circumstances of those five minutes were brought to the light But on the other hand had passion not completely got the better of him had he not at the moment considered the attack made upon him to amount to misconduct so gross as to supersede all necessity for gentle usage on his own part he would hardly have left the man to live or die as chance would have it Boiling with passion he went his way and did leave the man on the pavement not caring much or rather not thinking much whether his victim might live or die On the next day Harry Annesley left London and went down to Buston having heard no word farther about the captain He did not start till late in the afternoon and during the day took some trouble to make himself conspicuous about the town but he heard nothing of Captain Scarborough Twice he walked along Charles Street and looked at the spot on which he had stood on the night before in what might have been deadly conflict Then he told himself that he had not been in the least wounded that the ferocious maddened man had attempted to do no more than shake him that his coat had suffered and not himself and that in return he had certainly struck the captain with all his violence There were probably some regrets but he said not a word on the subject to any one and so he left London For three or four days nothing was heard of the captain nor was anything said about him He had lodgings in town at which he was no doubt missed but he also had quarters at the barracks at which he did not often sleep but to which it was thought possible on the next morning that he might have betaken himself Before the evening of that day had come he had no doubt been missed but in the world at large no special mention was made of his absence for some time Then among the haunts which he was known to frequent questions began to be asked as to his whereabouts and to be answered by doubtful assertions that nothing had been seen or heard of him for the last sixty or seventy hours It must be remembered that at this time Captain Scarborough was still the subject of universal remark because of the story told as to his birth His father had declared him to be illegitimate and had thereby robbed all his creditors Captain Scarborough was a man quite remarkable enough to insure universal attention for such a tale as this but now added to his illegitimacy was his disappearance There was at first no idea that he had been murdered It became quickly known to all the world that he had on the night in question lost a large sum of money at a whist club which he frequented and in accordance with the custom of the club had not paid the money on the spot The fatal Monday had come round and the money undoubtedly was not paid Then he was declared a defaulter and in due process of time his name was struck off the club books with some serious increase of the ignominy hitherto sustained During the last fortnight or more Captain Scarborough s name had been subjected to many remarks and to much disgrace But this non payment of the money lost at whist was considered to be the turning point A man might be declared illegitimate and might in consequence of that or any other circumstance defraud all his creditors A man might conspire with his father with the object of doing this fraudulently as Captain Scarborough was no doubt thought to have done by most of his acquaintances All this he might do and not become so degraded but that his friends would talk to him and play cards with him But to have sat down to a whist table and not be able to pay the stakes was held to be so foul a disgrace that men did not wonder that he should have disappeared Such was the cause alleged for the captain s disappearance among his intimate friends but by degrees more than his intimate friends came to talk of it In a short time his name was in all the newspapers and there was not a constable in London whose mind was not greatly exercised on the matter All Scotland Yard and the police officers were busy mister Grey in Lincoln s Inn was much troubled on the matter By degrees facts had made themselves clear to his mind and he had become aware that the captain had been born before his client s marriage He was ineffably shocked at the old squire s villany in the matter but declared to all to whom he spoke openly on the subject that he did not see how the sinner could be punished He never thought that the father and son were in a conspiracy together Nor had he believed that they had arranged the young man s disappearance in order the more thoroughly to defraud the creditors They could not at any rate harm a man of whose whereabouts they were unaware and who for all they knew might be dead But the reader is already aware that this surmise on the part of mister Grey was unfounded The captain had been absent for three weeks when Augustus Scarborough went down for a second time to Tretton Park in order to discuss the matter with his father Augustus had with much equanimity and a steady fixed purpose settled himself down to the position as elder son He pretended no anger to his father for the injury intended and was only anxious that his own rights should be confirmed In this he found that no great difficulty stood in his way The creditors would contest his rights when his father should die but for such contest he would be prepared He had no doubt as to his own position but thought that it would be safer and that it would also probably be cheaper to purchase the acquiescence of all claimants than to encounter the expense of a prolonged trial to which there might be more than one appeal and of which the end after all would be doubtful No very great sum of money would probably be required No very great sum would at any rate be offered But such an arrangement would certainly be easier if his brother were not present to be confronted with the men whom he had duped The squire was still ill down at Tretton but not so ill but that he had his wits about him in all their clearness Some said that he was not ill at all but that in the present state of affairs the retirement suited him But the nature of the operation which he had undergone was known to many who would not have him harassed in his present condition In truth he had only to refuse admission to all visitors and to take care that his commands were carried out in order to avoid disagreeable intrusions Do you mean to say that a man can do such a thing as this and that no one can touch him for it This was an exclamation made by mister Tyrrwhit to his lawyer in a tone of aggrieved disgust He hasn t done anything said the lawyer He only thought of doing something and has since repented You cannot arrest a man because he had contemplated the picking of your pocket especially when he has shown that he is resolved not to pick it As far as I can learn nothing has been heard about him as yet said the son to the father Those limbs weren t his that were picked out of the Thames near Blackfriars Bridge They belonged to a poor cripple who was murdered two months since And that body that was found down among the Yorkshire Hills He was a peddler There is nothing to induce a belief that Mountjoy has killed himself or been killed In the former case his dead body would be found or his live body would be missing For the second there is no imaginable cause for suspicion Then where the devil is he said the anxious father Ah that s the difficulty But I can imagine no position in which a man might be more tempted to hide himself He is disgraced on every side and could hardly show his face in London after the money he has lost You would not have paid his gambling debts Certainly not said the father There must be an end to all things Nor could I Within the last month past he has drawn from me every shilling that I have had at my immediate command Why did you give em to him It would be difficult to explain all the reasons He was then my elder brother and it suited me to have him somewhat under my hand At any rate I did do so and am unable for the present to do more Looking round about I do not see where it was possible for him to raise a sovereign as soon as it was once known that he was nobody What will become of him said the father I don t like the idea of his being starved He can t live without something to live upon God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb said the son For lambs such as he there always seems to be pasture provided of one sort or another You would not like to have to trust to such pastures said the father Nor should I like to be hanged but I should have to be hanged if I had committed murder Think of the chances which he has had and the way in which he has misused them Although illegitimate he was to have had the whole property of which not a shilling belongs to him and he has not lost it because it was not his own but has simply gambled it away among the Jews What can happen to a man in such a condition better than to turn up as a hunter among the Rocky Mountains or as a gold digger in Australia In this last adventure he seems to have plunged horribly and to have lost over three thousand pounds You wouldn t have paid that for him Not again certainly not again Then what could he do better than disappear I suppose I shall have to make him an allowance some of these days and if he can live and keep himself dark I will do so There was in this a tacit allusion to his father s speedy death which was grim enough but the father passed it by without any expression of displeasure He certainly owed much to his younger son and was willing to pay it by quiescence Let them both forbear Such was the language which he held to himself in thinking of his younger son Augustus was certainly behaving well to him Not a word of rebuke had passed his lips as to the infamous attempt at spoliation which had been made The old squire felt grateful for his younger son s conduct but yet in his heart of hearts he preferred the elder He has denuded me of every penny said Augustus and I must ask you to refund me something of what has gone He has kept me very bare A man with so great a propensity for getting rid of money I think no father ever before had to endure You have had the last of it I do not know that If I live and he lets me know his whereabouts I cannot leave him penniless I do feel that a great injustice has been done him I don t exactly see it said Augustus Because you re too hard hearted to put yourself in another man s place He was my eldest son He thought that he was And should have remained so had there been a hope for him said the squire roused to temporary anger Augustus only shrugged his shoulders But there is no good talking about it Not the least in the world mister Grey I suppose knows the truth at last I shall have to get three or four thousand pounds from you or I too must resort to the Jews I shall do it at any rate under better circumstances than my brother Some arrangement was at last made which was satisfactory to the son and which we must presume that the father found to be endurable Then the son took his leave and went back to London with the understood intention of pushing the inquiries as to his brother s existence and whereabouts The sudden and complete disappearance of Captain Scarborough struck missus Mountjoy with the deepest awe It was not at first borne in upon her to believe that Captain Mountjoy Scarborough an officer in the Coldstreams and the acknowledged heir to the Tretton property had vanished away as a stray street sweeper might do or some milliner s lowest work woman But at last there were advertisements in all the newspapers and placards on all the walls and missus Mountjoy did understand that the captain was gone She could as yet hardly believe that he was no longer heir to Tretton and in such short discussions with Florence as were necessary on the subject she preferred to express no opinion whatever as to his conduct But she would by no means give way when urged to acknowledge that no marriage between Florence and the captain was any longer to be regarded as possible While the captain was away the matter should be left as if in abeyance but this by no means suited the young lady s views missus Mountjoy was not a reticent woman and had no doubt been too free in whispering among her friends something of her daughter s position This Florence had resented but it had still been done and in Cheltenham generally she was regarded as an engaged young lady It had been in vain that she had denied that it was so Her mother s word on such a subject was supposed to be more credible that her own and now this man with whom she was believed to be so closely connected had disappeared from the world among the most disreputable circumstances But when she explained the difficulty to her mother her mother bade her hold her tongue for the present and seemed to hold out a hope that the captain might at last be restored to his old position Let them restore him ever so much he would never be anything to me mamma Then missus Mountjoy would only shake her head and purse her lips On the evening of the day after the fracas in the street Harry Annesley went down to Buston and there remained for the next two or three days holding his tongue absolutely as to the adventure of that night There was no one at Buston to whom he would probably have made known the circumstances But there was clinging to it a certain flavor of disreputable conduct on his own part which sealed his lips altogether The louder and more frequent the tidings which reached his ears as to the captain s departure the more strongly did he feel that duty required him to tell what he knew upon the matter Many thoughts and many fears encompassed him At first was the idea that he had killed the man by the violence of his blow or that his death had been caused by the fall Then it occurred to him that it was impossible that Scarborough should have been killed and that no account should be given as to the finding of the body At last he persuaded himself that he could not have killed the man but he was assured at the same time that the disappearance must in some sort have been occasioned by what then took place And it could not but be that the captain if alive should be aware of the nature of the struggle which had taken place He heard chiefly from the newspapers the full record of the captain s illegitimacy he heard of his condition with the creditors he heard of those gambling debts which were left unpaid at the club He saw it also stated and repeated that these were the grounds for the man s disappearance It was quite credible that the man should disappear or endeavor to disappear under such a cloud of difficulties It did not require that he and his violence should be adduced as an extra cause Indeed had the man been minded to vanish before the encounter he might in all human probability have been deterred by the circumstances of the quarrel It gave no extra reason for his disappearance and could in no wise be counted with it were he to tell the whole story in Scotland Yard He had been grossly misused on the occasion and had escaped from such misusage by the only means in his power But still he felt that had he told the story people far and wide would have connected his name with the man s absence and worse again that Florence s name would have become entangled with it also For the first day or two he had from hour to hour abstained from telling all that he knew and then when the day or two were passed and when a week had run by when a fortnight had been allowed to go it was impossible for him not to hold his tongue He became nervous unhappy and irritated down at Buston with his father and mother and sister s but more especially with his uncle Previous to this his uncle for a couple of months had declined to see him now he was sent for to the Hall and interrogated daily on this special subject mister Prosper was aware that his nephew had been intimate with Augustus Scarborough and that he might therefore be presumed to know much about the family mister Prosper took the keenest interest in the illegitimacy and the impecuniosity and final disappearance of the captain and no doubt did in his cross examinations discover the fact that Harry was unwilling to answer his questions He found out for the first time that Harry was acquainted with the captain and also contrived to extract from him the name of Miss Mountjoy But he could learn nothing else beyond Harry s absolute unwillingness to talk upon the subject which was in itself much It must be understood that Harry was not specially reverential in these communications Indeed he gave his uncle to understand that he regarded his questions as impertinent and at last declared his intention of not coming to the Hall any more for the present Then mister Prosper whispered to his sister that he was quite sure that Harry Annesley knew more than he choose to say as to Captain Scarborough s whereabouts My dear Peter said missus Annesley I really think that you are doing poor Harry an injustice missus Annesley was always on her guard to maintain something like an affectionate intercourse between her own family and the squire My dear Anne you do not see into a millstone as far as I do You never did But Peter you really shouldn t say such things of Harry When all the police officers themselves are looking about to catch up anything in their way they would catch him up at a moment s notice if they heard that a magistrate of the county had expressed such an opinion Why don t he tell me said mister Prosper There s nothing to tell Ah that s your opinion because you can t see into a millstone I tell you that Harry knows more about this Captain Scarborough than any one else They were very intimate together Harry only just knew him Well you ll see I tell you that Harry s name will become mixed up with Captain Scarborough s and I hope that it will be in no discreditable manner I hope so that s all Harry in the mean time had returned to London in order to escape his uncle and to be on the spot to learn anything that might come in his way as to the now acknowledged mystery respecting the captain Such was the state of things at the commencement of the period to which my story refers CHAPTER V AUGUSTUS SCARBOROUGH Harry Annesley when he found himself in London could not for a moment shake off that feeling of nervous anxiety as to the fate of Mountjoy Scarborough which had seized hold of him In every newspaper which he took in his hand he looked first for the paragraph respecting the fate of the missing man which the paper was sure to contain in one of its columns It was his habit during these few days to breakfast at a club and he could not abstain from speaking to his neighbors about the wonderful Scarborough incident Every man was at this time willing to speak on the subject and Harry s interest might not have seemed to be peculiar but it became known that he had been acquainted with the missing man and Harry in conversation said much more than it would have been prudent for him to do on the understanding that he wished to remain unconnected with the story Men asked him questions as though he were likely to know and he would answer them asserting that he knew nothing but still leaving an impression behind that he did know more than he chose to avow Many inquiries were made daily at this time in Scotland Yard as to the captain These no doubt chiefly came from the creditors and their allies But Harry Annesley became known among those who asked for information as Henry Annesley esquire late of saint John s College Cambridge and even the police were taught to think that there was something noticeable in the interest which he displayed On the fourth day after his arrival in London just at that time of the year when everybody was supposed to be leaving town and when faded members of Parliament who allowed themselves to be retained for the purpose of final divisions were cursing their fate amid the heats of August Harry accepted an invitation to dine with Augustus Scarborough at his chambers in the Temple He understood when he accepted the invitation that no one else was to be there and must have been aware that it was the intention of the heir of Tretton to talk to him respecting his brother He had not seen Scarborough since he had been up in town and had not been desirous of seeing him but when the invitation came he had told himself that it would be better that he should accept it and that he would allow his host to say what he pleased to say on the subject he himself remaining reticent But poor Harry little knew the difficulty of reticency when the heart is full He had intended to be very reticent when he came up to London and had in fact done nothing but talk about the missing man as to whom he had declared that he would altogether hold his tongue The reader must here be pleased to remember that Augustus Scarborough was perfectly well aware of what had befallen his brother and must therefore have known among other things of the quarrel which had taken place in the streets He knew therefore that Harry was concealing his knowledge and could make a fair guess at the state of the poor fellow s mind He will guess he had said to himself that he did not leave him for dead on the ground or the body would be there to tell the tale But he must be ashamed of the part which he took in the street fight and be anxious to conceal it No doubt Mountjoy was the first offender but something had occurred which Annesley is unwilling should make its way either to his uncle s ears or to his father s or to mine or to the squire s or to those of Florence It was thus that Augustus Scarborough reasoned with himself when he asked Harry Annesley to dine with him It was not supposed by any of his friends that Augustus Scarborough would continue to live in the moderate chambers which he now occupied in the Temple but he had as yet made no sign of a desire to leave them They were up two pair of stairs and were not great in size but they were comfortable enough and even luxurious as a bachelor s abode I ve asked you to come alone said Augustus because there is such a crowd of things to be talked of about poor Mountjoy which are not exactly fitted for the common ear Yes indeed said Harry who did not however quite understand why it would be necessary that the heir should discuss with him the affairs of his unfortunate brother There had no doubt been a certain degree of intimacy between them but nothing which made it essential that the captain s difficulties should be exposed to him The matter which touched him most closely was the love which both the men had borne to Florence Mountjoy but Harry did not expect that any allusion to Florence would be made on the present occasion Did you ever hear of such a devil of a mess said Augustus No indeed It is not only that he has disappeared That is as nothing when compared with all the other incidents of this romantic tale Indeed it is the only natural thing in it Given all the other circumstances I should have foretold his disappearance as a thing certain to occur Why shouldn t such a man disappear if he can But how has he done it replied Harry Where has he gone to At this moment where is he Ah if you will answer all those questions and give your information in Scotland Yard the creditors no doubt will make up a handsome purse for you Not that they will ever get a shilling from him though he were to be seen walking down saint James s Street to morrow But they are a sanguine gentry these holders of bills and I really believe that if they could see him they would embrace him with the warmest affection In the mean time let us have some dinner and we will talk about poor Mountjoy when we have got rid of young Pitcher Young Pitcher is my laundress s son to the use of whose services I have been promoted since I have been known to be the heir of Tretton Then they sat down and dined and Augustus Scarborough made himself agreeable The small dinner was excellent of its kind and the wine was all that it ought to be During dinner not a word was said as to Mountjoy nor as to the affairs of the estate Augustus who was old for his age and had already practised himself much in London life knew well how to make himself agreeable There was plenty to be said while young Pitcher was passing in and out of the room so that there appeared no awkward vacancies of silence while one course succeeded the other The weather was very hot the grouse were very tempting everybody was very dull and members of Parliament more stupid than anybody else but a good time was coming Would Harry come down to Tretton and see the old governor There was not much to offer him in the way of recreation but when September came the partridges would abound Harry gave a half promise that he would go to Tretton for a week and Augustus Scarborough expressed himself as much gratified Harry at the moment thought of no reason why he should not go to Tretton and thus committed himself to the promise but he afterward felt that Tretton was of all places the last which he ought just at present to visit At last Pitcher and the cheese were gone and young Scarborough produced his cigars I want to smoke directly I ve done eating he said Drinking goes with smoking as well as it does with eating so there need be no stop for that Now tell me Annesley what is it that you think about Mountjoy There was an abruptness in the question which for the moment struck Harry dumb How was he to say what he thought about Mountjoy Scarborough even though he should have no feeling to prevent him from expressing the truth He knew or thought that he knew Mountjoy Scarborough to be a thorough blackguard one whom no sense of honesty kept from spending money and who was now a party to robbing his creditors without the slightest compunction for it was in Harry s mind that Mountjoy and his father were in league together to save the property by rescuing it from the hands of the Jews He would have thought the same as to the old squire only that the old squire had not interfered with him in reference to Florence Mountjoy And then there was present to his mind the brutal attack which had been made on himself in the street According to his views Mountjoy Scarborough was certainly a blackguard but he did not feel inclined quite to say so to the brother nor was he perfectly certain as to his host s honesty It might be that the three Scarboroughs were all in a league together and if so he had done very wrong as he then remembered to say that he would go down to Tretton When therefore he was asked the question he could only hold his tongue I suppose you have some scruple in speaking because he s my brother You may drop that altogether I think that his career has been what the novel reader would call romantic but what I who am not one of them should describe as unfortunate Well yes taking it altogether it has been unfortunate I am not a soft hearted fellow but I am driven to pity him The worst of it is that had not my father been induced at last to tell the truth from most dishonest causes he would not have been a bit better off than he is I doubt whether he could have raised another couple of thousand on the day when he went If he had done so then and again more and more to any amount you choose to think of it would have been the same with him I suppose so His lust for gambling was a bottomless quicksand which no possible amount of winning could ever have satiated Let him enter his club with five thousand pounds at his banker s and no misfortune could touch him He being such as he is or alas for aught we know such as he was the escape which the property has had cannot but be regarded as very fortunate I don t care to talk much of myself in particular though no wrong can have been done to a man more infinite than that which my father contrived for me I cannot understand your father said Harry In truth there was something in Scarborough s manner in speaking of his father which almost produced belief in Harry s mind He began to doubt whether Augustus was in the conspiracy No I should say not It is hard to understand that an English gentleman should have the courage to conceive such a plot and the wit to carry it out If Mountjoy had run only decently straight or not more than indecently crooked I should have been a younger brother practising law in the Temple to the end of my days The story of Esau and of Jacob is as nothing to it But that is not the most remarkable circumstance My father for purposes of his own which includes the absolute throwing over of Mountjoy s creditors changes his plan and is pleased to restore to me that of which he had resolved to rob me What father would dare to look in the face of the son whom he had thus resolved to defraud My father tells me the story with a gentle chuckle showing almost as much indifference to Mountjoy s ruin as to my recovered prosperity He has not a blush when he reveals it all He has not a word to say or as far as I can see a thought as to the world s opinion No doubt he is supposed to be dying I do presume that three or four months will see the end of him In the mean time he takes it all as quietly as though he had simply lent a five pound note to Mountjoy out of my pocket You at any rate will get your property Oh yes and that no doubt is his argument when he sees me He is delighted to have me down at Tretton and to tell the truth I do not feel the slightest animosity toward him But as I look at him I think him to be the most remarkable old gentleman that the world has ever produced He is quite unconscious that I have any ground of complaint against him He has probably thought that the circumstances of your brother s birth should not militate against his prospects But the law my dear fellow said Scarborough getting up from his chair and standing with his cigar between his finger and thumb the law thinks otherwise The making of all right and wrong in this world depends on the law The half crown in my pocket is merely mine because of the law He did choose to marry my mother before I was born but did not choose to go through that ceremony before my brother s time That may be a trifle to you or to my moral feeling may be a trifle but because of that trifle all Tretton will be my property and his attempt to rob me of it was just the same as though he should break into a bank and steal what he found there He knows that just as well as I do but to suit his own purposes he did it There was something in the way in which the young man spoke both of his father and mother which made Harry s flesh creep He could not but think of his own father and his own mother and his feelings in regard to them But here this man was talking of the misdoings of the one parent and the other with the most perfect sang froid Of course I understand all that said Harry There is a manner of doing evil so easy and indifferent as absolutely to quell the general feeling respecting it A man shall tell you that he has committed a murder in a tone so careless as to make you feel that a murder is nothing I don t suppose my father can be punished for his attempt to rob me of twenty thousand a year and therefore he talks to me about it as though it were a good joke Not only that but he expects me to receive it in the same way Upon the whole he prevails I find myself not in the least angry with him and rather obliged to him than otherwise for allowing me to be his eldest son What must Mountjoy s feelings be said Harry Exactly what must be Mountjoy s feelings There is no need to consider my father s but poor Mountjoy s I don t suppose that he can be dead I should think not While a man is alive he can carry himself off but when a fellow is dead it requires at least one or probably two to carry him Men do not wish to undertake such a work secretly unless they ve been concerned in the murder and then there will have been a noise which must have been heard or blood which must have been seen and the body will at last be forthcoming or some sign of its destruction I do not think he be dead I should hope not said Harry rather tamely and feeling that he was guilty of a falsehood by the manner in which he expressed his hope When was it you saw him last Scarborough asked the question with an abruptness which was predetermined but which did not quite take Harry aback About three months since in London said Harry going back in his memory to the last meeting which had occurred before the squire had declared his purpose Ah you haven t seen him then since he knew that he was nobody This he asked in an indifferent tone being anxious not to discover his purpose but in doing so he gave Harry great credit for his readiness of mind I have not seen him since he heard the news which must have astonished him more than any one else I wonder said Augustus how Florence Mountjoy has borne it Neither have I seen her I have been at Cheltenham but was not allowed to see her This he said with an assertion to himself that though he had lied as to one particular he would not lie as to any other I suppose she must have been much cut up by it all I have half a mind to declare to myself that she shall still have an opportunity of becoming the mistress of Tretton She was always afraid of Mountjoy but I do not know that she ever loved him She had become so used to the idea of marrying him that she would have given herself up in mere obedience I too think that she might do as a wife and I shall certainly make a better husband than Mountjoy would have done Miss Mountjoy will certainly do as a wife for any one who may be lucky enough to get her said Harry with a certain tone of magnificence which at the moment he felt to be overstrained and ridiculous Oh yes one has got to get her as you call it of course You mean to say that you are supposed to be in the running That is your own lookout I can only allege on my own behalf that it has always been considered to be an old family arrangement that Florence Mountjoy shall marry the heir to Tretton Park I am in that position now and I only throw it out as a hint that I may feel disposed to follow out the family arrangement Of course if other things come in the way there will be an end of it Come in This last invitation was given in consequence of a knock at the door The door was opened and there entered a policeman in plain clothes named Prodgers who seemed from his manner to be well acquainted with Augustus Scarborough The police for some time past had been very busy on the track of Mountjoy Scarborough but had not hitherto succeeded in obtaining any information Such activity as had been displayed cannot be procured without expense and it had been understood in this case that old mister Scarborough had refused to furnish the means Something he had supplied at first but had latterly declined even to subscribe to a fund He was not at all desirous he said that his son should be brought back to the world particularly as he had made it evident by his disappearance that he was anxious to keep out of the way Why should I pay the fellows It s no business of mine he had said to his son And from that moment he had declined to do more than make up the first subscription which had been suggested to him But the police had been kept very busy and it was known that the funds had been supplied chiefly by mister Tyrrwhit He was a resolute and persistent man and was determined to run down Mountjoy Scarborough as he called it if money would enable him to do so It was he who had appealed to the squire for assistance in this object and to him the squire had expressed his opinion that as his son did not seem anxious to be brought back he should not interfere in the matter Well Prodgers what news have you to day asked Augustus There is a man a wandering about down in Skye just here and there with nothing in particular to say for himself What sort of a looking fellow is he Well he s light and don t come up to the captain s marks but there s no knowing what disguises a fellow will put on I don t think he s got the captain s legs and a man can t change his legs Captain Scarborough would not remain loitering about in Skye where he would be known by half the autumn tourists who saw him That s just what I was saying to Wilkinson said Prodgers Wilkinson seems to think that a man may be anybody as long as nobody knows who he is That ain t the captain said I I m afraid he s got out of England said the captain s brother There s no place where he can be run down like New York or Paris or Melbourne and it s them they mostly go to We ve wired em all three and a dozen other ports of the kind We catches em mostly if they go abroad but when they remains at home they re uncommon troublesome There was a man wandering about in County Donegal We call Ireland at home because we ve so much to do with their police since the Land League came up but this chap was only an artist who couldn t pay his bill What do you think about it mister Annesley said the policeman turning short round upon Harry and addressing him a question Why should the policeman even have known his name Who I I don t think about it at all I have no means of thinking about it Because you have been so busy down there at the Yard I thought that as you was asking so many questions you was perhaps interested in the matter My friend mister Annesley said Augustus was acquainted with Captain Scarborough as he is with me It did seem as though he was more than usually interested all the same said the policeman I am more than usually interested replied Harry but I do not know that I am going to give you my reason As to his present existence I know absolutely nothing I dare say not If you d any information as was reliable I dare say as it would be forthcoming Well mister Scarborough you may be sure of this if we can get upon his trail we ll do so and I think we shall There isn t a port that hasn t been watched from two days after his disappearance and there isn t a port as won t be watched as soon as any English steamer touches em We ve got our eyes out and we means to use em Good night mister Scarborough good night mister Annesley and he bobbed his head to our friend Harry You say as there is a reason as is unknown Perhaps it won t be unknown always Good night gentlemen Then Constable Prodgers left the room Harry had been disconcerted by the policeman s remarks and showed that it was so as soon as he was alone with Augustus Scarborough I m afraid you think the man intended to be impertinent said Augustus No doubt he did but such men are allowed to be impertinent He sees an enemy of course in every one who pretends to know more than he knows himself or indeed in every one who does not You said something about having a reason of your own and he at once connected you with Mountjoy s disappearance Such creatures are necessary but from the little I ve seen of them I do not think that they make the best companions in the world I shall leave mister Prodgers to carry on his business to the man who employs him namely mister Tyrrwhit and I advise you to do the same Soon after that Harry Annesley took his leave but he could not divest himself of an opinion that both the policeman and his host had thought that he had some knowledge respecting the missing man Augustus Scarborough had said no word to that effect but there had been a something in his manner which had excited suspicion in Harry s mind And then Augustus had declared his purpose of offering his hand and fortune to Florence Mountjoy He to be suitor to Florence he so soon after Mountjoy had been banished from the scene And why should he have been told of it he of whose love for the girl he could not but think that Augustus Scarborough had been aware Then much perturbed in his mind he resolved as he returned to his lodgings that he would go down to Cheltenham on the following day CHAPTER VI HARRY ANNESLEY TELLS HIS SECRET Harry hurried down to Cheltenham hardly knowing what he was going to do or say when he got there He went to the hotel and dined alone What s all this that s up about Captain Mountjoy said a stranger coming and whispering to him at his table The inquirer was almost a stranger but Harry did know his name It was mister Baskerville the hunting man mister Baskerville was not rich and not especially popular and had no special amusement but that of riding two nags in the winter along the roads of Cheltenham in the direction which the hounds took It was still summer and the nags who had been made to do their work in London were picking up a little strength in idleness or as mister Baskerville called it getting into condition In the mean time mister Baskerville amused himself as well as he could by lying in bed and playing lawn tennis He sometimes dined at the hotel in order that the club might think that he was entertained at friends houses but the two places were nearly the same to him as he could achieve a dinner and half a pint of wine for five or six shillings at each of them A more empty existence or one would be inclined to say less pleasurable no one could pass but he had always a decent coat on his back and a smile on his face and five shillings in his pocket with which to pay for his dinner His asking what was up about Scarborough showed at any rate that he was very backward in the world s news I believe he has vanished said Harry Oh yes of course he s vanished Everybody knows that he vanished ever so long ago but where is he If you can tell them in Scotland Yard they will be obliged to you I suppose it is true the police are after him Dear me Forty thousand a year This is a very queer story about the property isn t it I don t know the story exactly and therefore can hardly say whether it is queer or not But about the younger son People say that the father has contrived that the younger son shall have the money What I hear is that the whole property is to be divided and that the captain is to have half on conditions that he keeps out of the way But I am sure that you know more about it You used to be intimate with both the brothers I have seen you down here with the captain Where is he And again he whispered into Harry s ear But he could not have selected any subject more distasteful and therefore Harry repulsed mister Baskerville not in the most courteous manner Hang it what airs that fellow gives himself he said to another friend of the same kidney That s young Annesley the son of a twopenny halfpenny parson down in Hertfordshire The kind of ways these fellows put on now are unbearable He hasn t got a horse to ride on but to hear him talk you d think he was mounted three days a week He s heir to old Prosper of Buston Hall How s that But is he I never heard that before What s Buston Hall worth Then mister Baskerville made up his mind to be doubly civil to Harry Annesley the next time he saw him Harry had to consider on that night in what manner he would endeavor to see Florence Mountjoy on the next day He was thoroughly discontented with himself as he walked about the streets of Cheltenham He had now not only allowed the disappearance of Scarborough to pass by without stating when and where and how he had last seen him but had directly lied on the subject He had told the man s brother that he had not seen him for some weeks previous whereas to have concealed his knowledge on such a subject was in itself held to be abominable He was ashamed of himself and the more so because there was no one to whom he could talk openly on the matter And it seemed to him as though all whom he met questioned him as to the man s disappearance as if they suspected him What was the man to him or the man s guilt or his father that he should be made miserable The man s attack upon him had been ferocious in its nature so brutal that when he had escaped from Mountjoy Scarborough s clutches there was nothing for him but to leave him lying in the street where in his drunkenness he had fallen And now in consequence of this misery had fallen upon himself Even this empty headed fellow Baskerville a man the poverty of whose character Harry perfectly understood had questioned him about Mountjoy Scarborough It could not he thought be possible that Baskerville could have had any reasons for suspicion and yet the very sound of the inquiry stuck in his ears On the next morning at eleven o clock he knocked at missus Mountjoy s house in Mountpellier Place and asked for the elder lady missus Mountjoy was out and Harry at once inquired for Florence The servant at first seemed to hesitate but at last showed Harry into the dining room There he waited five minutes which seemed to him to be half an hour and then Florence came to him Your mother is not at home he said putting out his hand No mister Annesley but I think she will be back soon Will you wait for her I do not know whether I am not glad that she should be out Florence I have something that I must tell you Something that you must tell me He had called her Florence once before on a happy afternoon which he well remembered but he was not thinking of that now Her name which was always in his mind had come to him naturally as though he had no time to pick and choose about names in the importance of the communication which he had to make Yes I don t believe that you were ever really engaged to your cousin Mountjoy No I never was she answered briskly Harry Annesley was certainly a handsome man but no young man living ever thought less of his own beauty He had fair wavy hair which he was always submitting to some barber very much to the unexpressed disgust of poor Florence because to her eyes the longer the hair grew the more beautiful was the wearer of it His forehead and eyes and nose were all perfect in their form Hyperion s curls the front of Jove himself An eye like Mars to threaten and command There was a peculiar brightness in his eye which would have seemed to denote something absolutely great in his character had it not been for the wavering indecision of his mouth There was as it were a vacillation in his lips which took away from the manliness of his physiognomy Florence who regarded his face as almost divine was yet conscious of some weakness about his mouth which she did not know how to interpret But yet without knowing why it was so she was accustomed to expect from him doubtful words half expressed words which would not declare to her his perfected thoughts as she would have them declared He was six feet high but neither broad nor narrow nor fat nor thin but a very Apollo in Florence s eye To the elders who knew him the quintessence of his beauty lay in the fact that he was altogether unconscious of it He was a man who counted nothing on his personal appearance for the performance of those deeds which he was most anxious to achieve The one achievement now essentially necessary to his happiness was the possession of Florence Mountjoy but it certainly never occurred to him that he was more likely to obtain this because he was six feet high or because his hair waved becomingly I have supposed so he said in answer to her last assertion You ought to have known it for certain I mean to say that had I ever been engaged to my cousin I should have been miserable at such a moment as this I never should have given him up because of the gross injustice done to him about the property But his disappearance in this dreadful way would I think have killed me As it is I can think of nothing else because he is my cousin It is very dreadful said Harry Have you any idea what can have happened to him Not in the least Have you None at all but But what I was the last person who saw him You saw him last At least I know no one who saw him after me Have you told them I have told no one but you I have come down here to Cheltenham on purpose to tell you Why me she said as though struck with fear at such an assertion on his part I must tell some one and I have not known whom else to tell His father appears not at all anxious about him His brother I do not altogether trust Were I to go to these men who are only looking after their money I should be communicating with his enemies Your mother already regards me as his enemy If I told the police I should simply be brought into a court of justice where I should be compelled to mention your name Why mine I must begin the story from the beginning One night I was coming home in London very late about two o clock when whom should I meet in the street suddenly but Mountjoy Scarborough It came out afterward that he had then been gambling but when he encountered me he was intoxicated He took me suddenly by the collar and shook me violently and did his best to maltreat me What words were spoken I cannot remember but his conduct to me was as that of a savage beast I struggled with him in the street as a man would struggle who is attacked by a wild dog I think that he did not explain the cause of his hatred though of course my memory as to what took place at that moment is disturbed and imperfect but I did know in my heart why it was that he had quarrelled with me Why was it Florence asked Because he thought that I had ventured to love you No no shrieked Florence he could not have thought that He did think so and he was right enough If I have never said so before I am bound at any rate to say it now He paused for a moment but she made him no answer In the struggle between us he fell on the pavement against a rail and then I left him Well He has never been heard of since On the following day in the afternoon I left London for Buston but nothing had been then heard of his disappearance I neither knew of it nor suspected it The question is when others were searching for him was I bound to go to the police and declare what I had suffered from him that night Why should I connect his going with the outrage which I had suffered But why not tell it all I should have been asked why he had quarrelled with me Ought I to have said that I did not know Ought I to have pretended that there was no cause I did know and there was a cause It was because he thought that I might prevail with you now that he was a beggar disowned by his own father I would never have given him up for that said Florence But do you not see that your name would have been brought in that I should have had to speak of you as though I thought it possible that you loved me Then he paused and Florence sat silent But another thought struck him now It occurred to him that under the plea put forward he would appear to seek shelter from his silence as to her name He was aware how anxious he was on his own behalf not to mention the occurrence in the street and it seemed that he was attempting to escape under the pretence of a fear that her name would be dragged in But independently of that I do not see why I should be subjected to the annoyance of letting it be known that I was thus attacked in the streets And the time has now gone by It did not occur to me when first he was missed that the matter would have been of such importance Now it is too late I suppose that you ought to have told his father I think that I ought to have done so But at any rate I have come to explain it all to you It was necessary that I should tell some one There seems to be no reason to suspect that the man has been killed Oh I hope not I hope not that He has been spirited away out of the way of his creditors For myself I think that it has all been done with his father s connivance Whether his brother be in the secret or not I cannot tell but I suspect he is There seems to be no doubt that Captain Scarborough himself has run so overhead into debt as to make the payment of his creditors impossible by anything short of the immediate surrender of the whole property Some month or two since they all thought that the squire was dying and that there would be nothing to do but to sell the property which would then be Mountjoy s and pay themselves Against this the dying man has rebelled and has come as it were out of the grave to disinherit the son who has already contrived to disinherit himself It is all an effort to save Tretton But it is dishonest said Florence No doubt about it Looking at it any way it is dishonest Either the inheritance must belong to Mountjoy still or it could not have been his when he was allowed to borrow money upon it I cannot understand it I thought it was entailed upon him Of course it is nothing to me It never could have been anything But now the creditors declare that they have been cheated and assert that Mountjoy is being kept out of the way to aid old mister Scarborough in the fraud I cannot but say that I think it is so But why he should have attacked me just at the moment of his going or why rather he should have gone immediately after he had attacked me I cannot say I have no concern whatever with him or his money though I hope I hope that I may always have much with you Oh Florence you surely have known what has been within my heart To this appeal she made no response but sat awhile considering what she would say respecting Mountjoy Scarborough and his affairs Am I to keep all this a secret she asked him at last You shall consider that for yourself I have not exacted from you any silence on the matter You may tell whom you please and I shall not consider that I have any ground of complaint against you Of course for my own sake I do not wish it to be told A great injury was done me and I do not desire to be dragged into this which would be another injury I suspect that Augustus Scarborough knows more than he pretends and I do not wish to be brought into the mess by his cunning Whether you will tell your mother you must judge yourself I shall tell nobody unless you bid me At that moment the door of the room was opened and missus Mountjoy entered with a frown upon her brow She had not yet given up all hope that Mountjoy might return and that the affairs of Tretton might be made to straighten themselves Mamma mister Annesley is here So I perceive my dear I have come to your daughter to tell her how dearly I love her said Harry boldly mister Annesley you should have come to me before speaking to my daughter Then I shouldn t have seen her at all You should have left that as it might be It is not at all a proper thing that a young gentleman should come and address a young lady in this way behind her only parent s back I asked for you and I did not know that you would not be at home You should have gone away at once at once You know how terribly the family is cut up by this great misfortune to our cousin Mountjoy Mountjoy Scarborough has been long engaged to Florence No mamma no never At any rate mister Annesley knows all about it And that knowledge ought to have kept him away at the present moment I must beg him to leave us now Then Harry took his hat and departed but he had great consolation in feeling that Florence had not repudiated his love which she certainly would have done had she not loved him in return She had spoken no word of absolute encouragement but there had much more of encouragement than of repudiation in her manner CHAPTER VII HARRY ANNESLEY GOES TO TRETTON Harry had promised to go down to Tretton and when the time came Augustus Scarborough did not allow him to escape from the visit He explained to him that in his father s state of health there would be no company to entertain him that there was only a maiden sister of his father s staying in the house and that he intended to take down into the country with him one Septimus Jones who occupied chambers on the same floor with him in London and whom Annesley knew to be young Scarborough s most intimate friend There will be a little shooting he said and I have bought two or three horses which you and Jones can ride Cannock Chase is one of the prettiest parts of England and as you care for scenery you can get some amusement out of that You ll see my father and hear no doubt what he has got to say for himself He is not in the least reticent in speaking of my brother s affairs There was a good deal in this which was not agreeable Miss Scarborough was sister to missus Mountjoy as well as to the squire and had been one of the family party most anxious to assure the marriage of Florence and the captain The late General Mountjoy had been supposed to be a great man in his way but had died before Tretton had become as valuable as it was now Hence the eldest son had been christened with his name and much of the Mountjoy prestige still clung to the family But Harry did not care much about the family except so far as Florence was concerned And then he had not been on peculiarly friendly terms with Septimus Jones who had always been submissive to Augustus and now that Augustus was a rich man and could afford to buy horses was likely to be more submissive than ever He went down to Tretton alone early in September and when he reached the house he found that the two young men were out shooting He asked for his own room but was instead immediately taken to the old squire whom he found lying on a couch in a small dressing room while his sister who had been reading to him was by his side After the usual greetings Harry made some awkward apology as to his intrusion at the sick man s bedside Why I ordered them to bring you in here said the squire you can t very well call that intrusion I have no idea of being shut up from the world before they nail me down in my coffin That will be a long time first we all hope said his sister

none	none	you hope it but I don t know that any one else does I don t for one And if I did what s the good of hoping I have a couple of diseases either of which is enough to kill a horse Then he mentioned his special maladies in a manner which made Harry shrink What are they talking about in London just at present he asked Just the old set of subjects said Harry I suppose they have got tired of me and my iniquities Harry could only smile and shake his head There has been such a complication of romances that one expects the story to run a little more than the ordinary nine days Men still do talk about Mountjoy And what are they saying Augustus declares that you are especially interested on the subject I don t know why I should be said Harry Nor I either When a fellow becomes no longer of any service to either man woman or beast I do not know why any should take an interest in him I suppose you didn t lend him money I was not likely to do that sir Then I cannot conceive how it can interest you whether he be in London or Kamtchatka It does not interest me the least in the world Were he to turn up here it would be a trouble and yet they expect me to subscribe largely to a fund for finding him What good could he do me if he were found Oh John he is your son said Miss Scarborough And would be just as good a son as Augustus only that he has turned out uncommonly badly I have not the slightest feeling in the world as to his birth and so I think I showed pretty plainly But nothing could stop him in his course and therefore I told the truth that s all In answer to this Harry found it quite impossible to say a word but got away to his bedroom and dressed for dinner as quickly as possible While he was still thus employed Augustus came into the room still dressed in his shooting clothes So you ve seen my father he said Yes I saw him And what did he say to you about Mountjoy Little or nothing that signifies He seems to think it unreasonable that he should be asked to pay for finding him seeing that the creditors expect to get the advantage of his presence when found He is about right there Oh yes but still he is his father It may be that it would be expected that he should interest himself in finding him Upon my word I don t agree with you If a thousand a year could be paid to keep Mountjoy out of the way I think it would be well expended But you were acting with the police Oh the police What do the police know about it Of course I talk it all over with them They have not the smallest idea where the man is and do not know how to go to work to discover him I don t say that my father is judicious in his brazen faced opposition to all inquiry He should pretend to be a little anxious as I do Not that there would be any use now in pretending to keep up appearances He has declared himself utterly indifferent to the law and has defied the world Never mind old fellow we shall eat the more dinner only I must go and prepare myself for it At dinner Harry found only Septimus Jones Augustus Scarborough and his aunt Miss Scarborough said a good deal about her brother and declared him to be much better Of course you know Augustus that Sir William Brodrick was down here for two days Only fancy replied he what one has to pay for two days of Sir William Brodrick in the country What can it matter said the generous spinster It matters exactly so many hundred pounds but no one will begrudge it if he does so many hundred pounds worth of good It will show at any rate that we have had the best advice said the lady Yes it will show that is exactly what people care about What did Sir William say Then during the first half of dinner a prolonged reference was made to mister Scarborough s maladies and to Sir William s opinion concerning them Sir William had declared that mister Scarborough s constitution was the most wonderful thing that he had ever met in his experience In spite of the fact that mister Scarborough s body was one mass of cuts and bruises and faulty places and that nothing would keep him going except the wearing of machinery which he was unwilling to wear yet the facilities for much personal enjoyment were left to him and Sir William declared that if he would only do exactly as he were told he might live for the next five years But everybody knows that he won t do anything that he is told said Augustus in a tone of voice which by no means expressed extreme sorrow From his father he led the conversation to the partridges and declared his conviction that with a little trouble and some expense a very good head of game might be got up at Tretton I suppose it wouldn t cost much said Jones who beyond ten shillings to a game keeper never paid sixpence for whatever shooting came in his way I don t know what you call much said Augustus but I think it may be done for three or four hundred a year I should like to calculate how many thousand partridges at that rate Sir William has taken back in his pocket What does it matter asked Miss Scarborough Only as a speculation Of course my father while he lives is justified in giving his whole income to doctors if he likes it but one gets into a manner of speaking about him as though he had done a good deal with his money in which he was not justified Don t talk in that way Augustus My dear aunt I am not at all inclined to be more open mouthed than he is Only reflect what it was that he was disposed to do with me and the good humor with which I have borne it I think I should hold my tongue about it said Harry Annesley And I think that in my place you would do no such thing To your nature it would be almost impossible to hold your tongue Your sense of justice would be so affronted that you would feel yourself compelled to discuss the injury done to you with all your intimate friends But with your father your quarrel would be eternal I made nothing of it and indeed if he pertinaciously held his tongue on the subject so should I But because he talks said Harry why should you Why should he not said Septimus Jones Upon my word I don t see the justice of it I am not speaking of justice but of feeling Upon my word I wish you would hold your tongues about it at any rate till my back is turned said the old lady Then Augustus finished the conversation I am determined to treat it all as though it were a joke and as a joke one to be spoken of lightly It was a strong measure certainly this attempt to rob me of twenty or thirty thousand pounds a year But it was done in favor of my brother and therefore let it pass I am at a loss to conceive what my father has done with his money He hasn t given Mountjoy at any rate more than a half of his income for the last five or six years and his own personal expenses are very small Yet he tells me that he has the greatest difficulty in raising a thousand pounds and positively refuses in his present difficulties to add above five hundred a year to my former allowance No father who had thoroughly done his duty by his son could speak in a more fixed and austere manner And yet he knows that every shilling will be mine as soon as he goes The servant who was waiting upon them had been in and out of the room while this was said and must have heard much of it But to that Augustus seemed to be quite indifferent And indeed the whole family story was known to every servant in the house It is true that gentlemen and ladies who have servants do not usually wish to talk about their private matters before all the household even though the private matters may be known but this household was unlike all others in that respect There was not a housemaid about the rooms or a groom in the stables who did not know how terrible a reprobate their master had been You will see your father before you go to bed Miss Scarborough said to her nephew as she left the room Certainly if he will send to say that he wishes it He does wish it most anxiously I believe that to be your imagination At any rate I will come say in an hour s time He would be just as pleased to see Harry Annesley for the matter of that or mister Grey or the inspector of police Any one whom he could shock or pretend to shock by the peculiarity of his opinions would do as well By that time however Miss Scarborough had left the room Then the three men sat and talked and discussed the affairs of the family generally New leases had just been granted for adding manufactories to the town of Tretton and as far as outward marks of prosperity went all was prosperous I expect to have a water mill on the lawn before long said Augustus These mechanics have it all their own way If they were to come and tell me that they intended to put up a wind mill in my bedroom to morrow morning I could only take off my hat to them When a man offers you five per cent where you ve only had four he is instantly your lord and master It doesn t signify how vulgar he is or how insolent or how exacting Associations of the tenderest kind must all give way to trade But the shooting which lies to the north and west of us is I think safe for the present I suppose I must go and see what my father wants or I shall be held to have neglected my duty to my affectionate parent Capital fellow Augustus Scarborough said Jones as soon as their host had left them I was at Cambridge with him and he was popular there He ll be more popular now that he s the heir to Tretton I don t know any fellow that I can get along better with than Scarborough I think you were a little hard upon him about his father you know In his position he ought to hold his tongue It s the strangest thing that has turned up in the whole course of my experience You see if he didn t talk about it people wouldn t quite understand what it was that his father has done It s only matter of report now and the creditors no doubt do believe that when old Scarborough goes off the hooks they will be able to walk in and take possession He has got to make the world think that he is the heir and that will go a long way You may be sure he doesn t talk as he does without having a reason for it He s the last man I know to do anything without a reason The evening dragged along very slowly while Jones continued to tell all that he knew of his friend s character But Augustus Scarborough did not return and soon after ten o clock when Harry Annesley could smoke no more cigars and declared that he had no wish to begin upon brandy and water after his wine he went to his bed CHAPTER VIII HARRY ANNESLEY TAKES A WALK There was the devil to pay with my father last night after I went to him said Scarborough to Harry next morning He now and then suffers agonies of pain and it is the most difficult thing in the world to get him right again But anything equal to his courage I never before met How is he this morning Very weak and unable to exert himself But I cannot say that he is otherwise much the worse You won t see him this morning but to morrow you will or next day Don t you be shy about going to him when he sends for you He likes to show the world that he can bear his sufferings with a light heart and is ready to die to morrow without a pang or a regret Who was the fellow who sent for a fellow to let him see how a Christian could die I can fancy my father doing the same thing only there would be nothing about Christianity in the message He would bid you come and see a pagan depart in peace and would be very unhappy if he thought that your dinner would be disturbed by the ceremony Now come down to breakfast and then we ll go out shooting For three days Harry remained at Tretton and ate and drank and shot and rode always in young Scarborough s company During this time he did not see the old squire and understood from Miss Scarborough s absence that he was still suffering from his late attack The visit was to be prolonged for one other day and he was told that on that day the squire would send for him I m sick of these eternal partridges said Augustus No man should ever shoot partridges two days running Jones can go out by himself He won t have to tip the game keeper any more for an additional day and so it will be all gain to him You ll see my father in the afternoon after lunch and we will go and take a walk now Harry started for his walk and his companion immediately began again about the property I m beginning to think said he that it s nearly all up with the governor These attacks come upon him worse and worse and always leave him absolutely prostrate Then he will do nothing to prevent them To assure himself a week of life he will not endure an hour of discomfort It is plucky you know He is in all respects as brave a man as I have known He sets God and man at absolute defiance and always does it with the most profound courtesy If he goes to the infernal regions he will insist upon being the last of the company to enter the door And he will be prepared with something good humored to say as soon as he has been ushered in He was very much troubled about you yesterday What has he to say of me Nothing in the least uncivil but he has an idea in his head which nothing on earth will put out of it and in which but for your own word I should be inclined to agree Harry when this was said stood still on the mountain side and looked full into his companion s face He felt at the moment that the idea had some reference to Mountjoy Scarborough and his disappearance They were together on the heathy unenclosed ground of Cannock Chase and had already walked some ten or twelve miles He thinks you know where Mountjoy is Why should I know Or at any rate that you have seen him since any of us He professes not to care a straw for Mountjoy or his whereabouts and declares himself under obligation to those who have contrived his departure Nevertheless he is curious What have I to do with Mountjoy Scarborough That s just the question What have you to do with him He suggests that there have been words between you as to Florence which has caused Mountjoy to vanish I don t profess to explain anything beyond that nor indeed do I profess to agree with my father But the odd thing is that Prodgers the policeman has the same thing running in his head Because I have shown some anxiety about your brother in Scotland Yard No doubt Prodgers says that you ve shown more anxiety than was to be expected from a mere acquaintance I quite acknowledge that Prodgers is as thick headed an idiot as you shall catch on a summer s day but that s his opinion For myself I know your word too well to doubt it Harry walked on in silence thinking or trying to think what on the spur of the moment he had better do He was minded to speak out the whole truth and declare to himself that it was nothing to him what Augustus Scarborough might say or think And there was present to him a feeling that his companion was dealing unfairly with him and was endeavoring in some way to trap him and lead him into a difficulty But he had made up his mind as it were not to know anything of Mountjoy Scarborough and to let those five minutes in the street be as though they had never been He had been brutally attacked and had thought it best to say nothing on the subject He would not allow his secret such as it was to be wormed out of him Scarborough was endeavoring to extort from him that which he had resolved to conceal and he determined at last that he would not become a puppet in his hands I don t see why you should care a straw about it said Scarborough Nor do I At any rate you repeat your denial It will be well that I should let my father know that he is mistaken and also that ass Prodgers Of course with my father it is sheer curiosity Indeed if he thought that you were keeping Mountjoy under lock and key he would only admire your dexterity in so preserving him Any bold line of action that was contrary to the law recommends itself to his approbation But Prodgers has a lurking idea that he should like to arrest you What for Simply because he thinks you know something that he doesn t know As he s a detective that in his mind is quite enough for arresting any man I may as well give him my assurance then that he is mistaken Why should your assurance go for more than mine Give him nothing of the kind I may give him at any rate my assurance that I believe your word If you do believe it you can do so But you repeat your assertion that you saw nothing of Mountjoy just before his disappearance This is an amount of cross questioning which I do not take in good part and to which I will not submit Here Scarborough affected to laugh loudly I know nothing of your brother and care almost as little He has professed to admire a young lady to whom I am not indifferent and has I believe expressed a wish to make her his wife He is also her cousin and the lady in question has no doubt been much interested about him It is natural that she should be so Quite natural seeing that she has been engaged to him for twelve months Of that I know nothing But my interest about your brother has been because of her You can explain all this about your brother if you please or can let it alone But for myself I decline to answer any more questions If Prodgers thinks that he can arrest me let him come and try The idea of your flying into a passion because I have endeavored to explain it all to you At any rate I have your absolute denial and that will enable me to deal both with my father and Prodgers To this Harry made no answer and the two young men walked back to Tretton together without many more words between them When Harry had been in the house about half an hour and had already eaten his lunch somewhat sulkily a message came to him from Miss Scarborough requiring his presence He went to her and was told by her that mister Scarborough would now see him He was aware that mister Scarborough never saw Septimus Jones and that there was something peculiar in the sending of this message to him Why should the man who was supposed to have but a few weeks to live be so anxious to see one who was comparatively a stranger to him I am so glad you have come in before dinner mister Annesley because my brother is so anxious to see you and I am afraid you ll go too early in the morning Then he followed her and again found mister Scarborough on a couch in the same room to which he had been first introduced I ve had a sharp bout of it since I saw you before said the sick man So we heard sir There is no saying how many or rather how few bouts of this kind it will take to polish me off But I think I am entitled to some little respite now The apothecary from Tretton was here this morning and I believe has done me just as much good as Sir William Brodrick His charge will be ten shillings while Sir William demanded three hundred pounds But it would be mean to go out with no one but the Tretton apothecary to look after one I suppose Sir William s knowledge has been of some service His dexterity with his knife has been of more So you and Augustus have been quarrelling about Mountjoy Not that I know of He says so and I believe his word on such a subject sooner than yours You are likely to quarrel without knowing it and he is not He thinks that you know what has become of Mountjoy Does he Why should he think so when I told him that I know nothing I tell you that I know absolutely nothing I am ignorant whether he is dead or alive He is not dead said the father I suppose not but I know nothing about him Why your second son You mean my eldest according to law or rather my only son Why Augustus Scarborough continued Harry Annesley should take upon himself to suspect that I know aught of his brother I cannot say He has some cock and bull story about a policeman whom he professes to believe to be ignorant of his own business This policeman he says is anxious to arrest me To make you give evidence before a magistrate said his father He did not dare to tell me that he suspected me himself There I knew you had quarrelled I deny it altogether I have not quarrelled with Augustus Scarborough He is welcome to his suspicions if he chooses to entertain them I should have liked him better if he had not brought me down to Tretton so as to extract from me whatever he can I shall be more guarded in future in speaking of Mountjoy Scarborough but to you I give my positive assurance which I do not doubt you will believe that I know nothing respecting him An honest indignation gleamed in his eyes as he spoke but still there were the signs of that vacillation about his mouth which Florence had been able to read but not to interpret Yes said the squire after a pause I believe you You haven t that kind of ingenuity which enables a man to tell a lie and stick to it I have It s a very great gift if a man be enabled to restrain his appetite for lying Harry could only smile when he heard the squire s confession Only think how I have lied about Mountjoy and how successful my lies might have been but for his own folly People do judge you a little harshly now said Harry What s the odd s I care nothing for their judgment I endeavored to do justice to my own child and very nearly did it I was very nearly successful in rectifying the gross injustice of the world Why should a little delay in a ceremony in which he had no voice have robbed him of his possessions I determined that he should have Tretton and I determined also to make it up to Augustus by denying myself the use of my own wealth Things have gone wrongly not by my own folly I could not prevent the mad career which Mountjoy has run but do you think that I am ashamed because the world knows what I have done Do you suppose my death bed will be embittered by the remembrance that I have been a liar Not in the least I have done the best I could for my two sons and in doing it have denied myself many advantages How many a man would have spent his money on himself thinking nothing of his boys and then have gone to his grave with all the dignity of a steady Christian father Of the two men I prefer myself but I know that I have been a liar What was Harry Annesley to say in answer to such an address as this There was the man stretched on his bed before him haggard unshaved pale and grizzly with a fire in his eyes but weakness in his voice bold defiant self satisfied and yet not selfish He had lived through his life with the one strong resolution of setting the law at defiance in reference to the distribution of his property but chiefly because he had thought the law to be unjust Then when the accident of his eldest son s extravagance had fallen upon him he had endeavored to save his second son and had thought without the slightest remorse of the loss which was to fall on the creditors He had done all this in such a manner that as far as Harry knew the law could not touch him though all the world was aware of his iniquity And now he lay boasting of what he had done It was necessary that Harry should say something as he rose from his seat and he lamely expressed a wish that mister Scarborough might quickly recover No my dear fellow said the squire men do not recover when they are brought to such straits as I am in Nor do I wish it Were I to live Augustus would feel the second injustice to be quite intolerable His mind is lost in amazement at what I had contemplated And he feels that the matter can only be set right between him and fortune by my dying at once If he were to understand that I were to live ten years longer I think that he would either commit a murder or lose his senses But there is enough for both of you said Harry There is no such word in the language as enough An estate can have but one owner and Augustus is anxious to be owner here I do not blame him in the least Why should he desire to spare a father s rights when that father showed himself so willing to sacrifice his Good bye Annesley I am sorry you are going for I like to have some honest fellow to talk to You are not to suppose that because I have done this thing I am indifferent to what men shall say of me I wish them to think me good though I have chosen to run counter to the prejudices of the world Then Harry escaped from the room and spent the remaining evening with Augustus Scarborough and Septimus Jones The conversation was devoted chiefly to the partridges and horses and was carried on by Septimus with severity toward Harry and by Scarborough with an extreme civility which was the more galling of the two CHAPTER IX 
5933-104482-0000	train-other-500	AUGUSTUS HAS HIS OWN DOUBTS That s an impertinent young puppy said Septimus Jones as soon as the fly which was to carry Harry Annesley to the station had left the hall door on the following morning
5933-104482-0001	train-other-500	It may be presumed that mister Jones would not thus have expressed himself unless his friend Augustus Scarborough had dropped certain words in conversation in regard to Harry to the same effect
none	none	 And it may be presumed also that Augustus would not have dropped such words without a purpose of letting his friend know that Harry was to be abused 
5933-104482-0002	train-other-500	Augustus Scarborough had made up his mind looking at the matter all round that more was to be got by abusing Harry than by praising him The young man has a good opinion of himself certainly
5933-104482-0003	train-other-500	He thinks himself to be a deal better than anybody else continued Jones whereas I for one don t see it And he has a way with him of pretending to be quite equal to his companions let them be who they may which to me is odious
5933-104482-0004	train-other-500	He was down upon you and down upon your father Of course your father has made a most fraudulent attempt but what the devil is it to him The other young man made no answer but only smiled
5933-104482-0005	train-other-500	The opinion expressed by mister Jones as to Harry Annesley had only been a reflex of that felt by Augustus Scarborough But the reflex as is always the case when the looking glass is true was correct
5933-104482-0006	train-other-500	Scarborough had known Harry Annesley for a long time as time is counted in early youth and had by degrees learned to hate him thoroughly
5933-104482-0007	train-other-500	He was a little the elder and had at first thought to domineer over his friend But the friend had resisted and had struggled manfully to achieve what he considered an equality in friendship
5933-104482-0008	train-other-500	Now Scarborough you may as well take it once for all that I am not going to be talked down If you want to talk a fellow down you can go to Walker Brown or Green Then when you are tired of the occupation you can come back to me
5933-104482-0009	train-other-500	It was thus that Annesley had been wont to address his friend But his friend had been anxious to talk down this special young man for special purposes and had been conscious of some weakness in the other s character which he thought entitled him to do so
5933-104482-0010	train-other-500	But the weakness was not of that nature and he had failed Then had come the rivalry between Mountjoy and Harry which had seemed to Augustus to be the extreme of impudence From of old he had been taught to regard his brother Mountjoy as the first of young men
5933-104482-0011	train-other-500	among commoners the first in prospects and the first in rank and to him Florence Mountjoy had been allotted as a bride How he had himself learned first to envy and then to covet this allotted bride need not here be told
5933-104482-0012	train-other-500	But by degrees it had come to pass that Augustus had determined that his spendthrift brother should fall under his own power and that the bride should be the reward
none	none	 How it was that two brothers so different in character and yet so alike in their selfishness should have come to love the same girl with a true intensity of purpose and that Harry Annesley whose character was essentially different 
5933-104482-0013	train-other-500	and who was in no degree selfish should have loved her also must be left to explain itself as the girl s character shall be developed But Florence Mountjoy had now for many months been the cause of bitter dislike against poor Harry in the mind of Augustus Scarborough
5933-104482-0014	train-other-500	He understood much more clearly than his brother had done who it was that the girl really preferred He was ever conscious too of his own superiority
5933-104482-0015	train-other-500	falsely conscious and did feel that if Harry s character were really known no girl would in truth prefer him He could not quite see Harry with Florence s eyes nor could he see himself with any other eyes but his own
none	none	 Then had come the meeting between Mountjoy and Harry Annesley in the street of which he had only such garbled account as Mountjoy himself had given him within half an hour afterward 
5933-104482-0016	train-other-500	From that story told in the words of a drunken man a man drunk and bruised and bloody who clearly did not understand in one minute the words spoken in the last
none	none	 Augustus did learn that there had been some great row between his brother and Harry Annesley 
5933-104482-0017	train-other-500	Then Mountjoy had disappeared had disappeared as the reader will have understood with his brother s company operation and Harry had not come forward
none	none	 when inquiries were made to declare what he knew of the occurrences of that night Augustus had narrowly watched his conduct in order at first that he might learn in what condition his brother had been left in the street 
5933-104482-0018	train-other-500	but afterward with the purpose of ascertaining why it was that Harry had been so reticent Then he had allured Harry on to a direct lie and soon perceived that he could afterward use the secret for his own purpose
5933-104482-0019	train-other-500	I think we shall have to see what that young man s about you know he said afterward to Septimus Jones Yes yes certainly said Septimus But Septimus did not quite understand why it was that they should have to see what the young man was about
5933-104482-0020	train-other-500	Between you and me I think he means to interfere with me and I do not mean to stand his interference I should think not He must go back to Buston among the Bustonians or he and I will have a stand up fight of it
5933-104482-0021	train-other-500	I rather like a stand up fight Just so When a fellow s so bumptious as that he ought to be licked He has lied about Mountjoy said Augustus Then Jones waited to be told how it was that Harry had lied
5933-104482-0022	train-other-500	He was aware that there was some secret unknown to him and was anxious to be informed Was Harry aware of Mountjoy s hiding place and if so how had he learned it Why was it that Harry should be acquainted with that which was dark to all the world besides
none	none	 Jones was of opinion that the squire knew all about it and thought it not improbable that the squire and Augustus had the secret in their joint keeping But if so how should Harry Annesley know anything about it He has lied like the very devil continued Augustus after a pause 
5933-104482-0023	train-other-500	Has he now And I don t mean to spare him I should think not Then there was a pause at the end of which Jones found himself driven to ask a question How has he lied
5933-104482-0024	train-other-500	Augustus smiled and shook his head from which the other man gathered that he was not now to be told the nature of the lie in question A fellow that lies like that said Jones is not to be endured I do not mean to endure him
5933-104482-0025	train-other-500	You have heard of a young lady named Miss Mountjoy a cousin of ours Mountjoy s Miss Mountjoy suggested Jones Yes Mountjoy s Miss Mountjoy That of course is over
5933-104482-0026	train-other-500	Mountjoy has brought himself to such a pass that he is not entitled to have a Miss Mountjoy any longer It seems the proper thing that she shall pass with the rest of the family property to the true heir You marry her
5933-104482-0027	train-other-500	We need not talk about that just at present I don t know that I ve made up my mind At any rate I do not intend that Harry Annesley shall have her I should think not
5933-104482-0028	train-other-500	He s a pestilential cur that has got himself introduced into the family and the sooner we get quit of him the better I should think the young lady would hardly fancy him when she knows that he has lied like the very devil with the object of getting her former lover out of the way
none	none	 By Jove no I should think not 
5933-104482-0029	train-other-500	And when the world comes to understand that Harry Annesley in the midst of all these inquiries knows all about poor Mountjoy was the last to see him in London and has never come forward to say a word about him
5933-104482-0030	train-other-500	then I think the world will be a little hard upon the immaculate Harry Annesley His own uncle has quarrelled with him already What uncle The gentleman down in Hertfordshire on the strength of whose acres Master Harry is flaunting it about in idleness
5933-104482-0031	train-other-500	I have my eyes open and can see as well as another When Harry lectures me about my father and my father about me
none	none	 one would suppose that there s not a hole in his own coat 
5933-104482-0032	train-other-500	I think he ll find that the garment is not altogether water tight Then Augustus finding that he had told as much as was needful to Septimus Jones left his friend and went about his own family business
5933-104482-0033	train-other-500	On the next morning Septimus Jones took his departure and on the day following Augustus followed him
none	none	 So you re off his father said to him when he came to make his adieux 
5933-104482-0034	train-other-500	Well yes I suppose so A man has got so many things to look after which he can t attend to down here I don t know what they are but you understand it all I m not going to ask you to stay
5933-104482-0035	train-other-500	Does it ever occur to you that you may never see me again What a question It s one that requires an answer at any rate It does occur to me but not at all as probable Why not probable
5933-104482-0036	train-other-500	Because there s a telegraph wire from Tretton to London and because the journey down here is very short It also occurs to me to think so from what has been said by Sir William Brodrick Of course any man may die suddenly
5933-104482-0037	train-other-500	Especially when the surgeons have been at him You have your sister with you sir and she will be of more comfort to you than I can be Your condition is in some respects an advantage to you
none	none	 These creditors of Mountjoy can t force their way in upon you 
5933-104482-0038	train-other-500	You are wrong there They have not done so Nor should they though I were as strong as you What are Mountjoy s creditors to me They have not a scrap of my handwriting in their possession
5933-104482-0039	train-other-500	There is not one who can say that he has even a verbal promise from me They never came to me when they wanted to lend him money at fifty per cent Did they ever hear me say that he was my heir Perhaps not Not one has ever heard it
none	none	 It was not to them I lied 
5933-104482-0040	train-other-500	but to you and to Grey D the creditors What do I care for them though they be all ruined Not in the least Why do you talk to me about the creditors You at any rate know the truth
none	none	 Then Augustus quitted the room leaving his father in a passion But as a fact he was by no means assured as to the truth He supposed that he was the heir but might it not be possible that his father had contrived all this so as to save the property from Mountjoy and that greedy pack of money lenders Grey must surely know the truth But why should not Grey be deceived on the second event as well as the first There was no limit Augustus sometimes thought to his father s cleverness This idea had occurred to him within the last week and his mind was tormented with reflecting what might yet be his condition But of one thing he was sure that his father and Mountjoy were not in league together Mountjoy at any rate believed himself to have been disinherited Mountjoy conceived that his only chance of obtaining money arose from his brother The circumstances of Mountjoy s absence were at any rate unknown to his father CHAPTER X 
7460_104483_000001_000000	train-clean-360	SIR MAGNUS MOUNTJOY 
7460_104483_000002_000000	train-clean-360	It was the peculiarity of Florence Mountjoy that she did not expect other people to be as good as herself 
none	none	It was not that she erected for herself a high standard and had then told herself that she had no right to demand from others one so exalted 
7460_104483_000002_000002	train-clean-360	She had erected nothing 
7460_104483_000002_000003	train-clean-360	Nor did she know that she attempted to live by grand rules 
none	none	She had no idea that she was better than anybody else but it came to her naturally as the result of what had gone before to be unselfish generous trusting and pure 
7460_104483_000002_000005	train-clean-360	These may be regarded as feminine virtues and may be said to be sometimes tarnished by faults which are equally feminine 
7460_104483_000002_000006	train-clean-360	Unselfishness may become want of character generosity essentially unjust confidence may be weak and purity insipid 
7460_104483_000002_000007	train-clean-360	Here it was that the strength of Florence Mountjoy asserted itself 
7460_104483_000002_000008	train-clean-360	She knew well what was due to herself though she would not claim it 
7460_104483_000002_000009	train-clean-360	She could trust to another but in silence be quite sure of herself 
7460_104483_000002_000010	train-clean-360	Though pure herself she was rarely shocked by the ways of others 
none	none	And she was as true as a man pretends to be 
7460_104483_000003_000000	train-clean-360	In figure form and face she never demanded immediate homage by the sudden flash of her beauty 
7460_104483_000003_000001	train-clean-360	But when her spell had once fallen on a man s spirit it was not often that he could escape from it quickly 
7460_104483_000003_000002	train-clean-360	When she spoke a peculiar melody struck the hearer s ears 
none	none	Her voice was soft and low and sweet and full at all times of harmonious words but when she laughed it was like soft winds playing among countless silver bells There was something in her touch which to men was almost divine 
7460_104483_000003_000004	train-clean-360	Of this she was all unconscious but was as chary with her fingers as though it seemed that she could ill spare her divinity 
7460_104483_000004_000000	train-clean-360	In height she was a little above the common but it was by the grace of her movements that the world was compelled to observe her figure 
7460_104483_000004_000001	train-clean-360	There are women whose grace is so remarkable as to demand the attention of all 
none	none	But then it is known of them and momentarily seen that their grace is peculiar 
7460_104483_000004_000003	train-clean-360	They have studied their graces and the result is there only too evident 
7460_104483_000004_000004	train-clean-360	But Florence seemed to have studied nothing 
7460_104483_000004_000005	train-clean-360	The beholder felt that she must have been as graceful when playing with her doll in the nursery 
7460_104483_000004_000006	train-clean-360	And it was the same with her beauty 
none	none	There was no peculiarity of chiselled features 
7460_104483_000004_000008	train-clean-360	Had you taken her face and measured it by certain rules you would have found that her mouth was too large and her nose irregular 
none	none	Of her teeth she showed but little and in her complexion there was none of that pellucid clearness in which men ordinarily delight 
7460_104483_000004_000010	train-clean-360	But her eyes were more than ordinarily bright and when she laughed there seemed to stream from them some heavenly delight When she did laugh it was as though some spring had been opened from which ran for the time a stream of sweetest intimacy 
7460_104483_000004_000011	train-clean-360	For the time you would then fancy that you had been let into the inner life of this girl and would be proud of yourself that so much should have been granted you 
none	none	You would feel that there was something also in yourself in that this should have been permitted Her hair and eyebrows were dark brown of the hue most common to men and women and had in them nothing that was peculiar but her hair was soft and smooth and ever well dressed and never redolent of peculiar odors 
7460_104483_000004_000014	train-clean-360	It was simply Florence Mountjoy s hair and that made it perfect in the eyes of her male friends generally 
7460_104483_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 She s not such a wonderful beauty after all once said of her a gentleman to whom it may be presumed that she had not taken the trouble to be peculiarly attractive 
7460_104483_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 No said another no 
none	none	But by George 
7460_104483_000005_000003	train-clean-360	I shouldn t like to have the altering of her It was thus that men generally felt in regard to Florence Mountjoy 
7460_104483_000005_000004	train-clean-360	When they came to reckon her up they did not see how any change was to be made for the better 
7460_104483_000006_000000	train-clean-360	To Florence as to most other girls the question of her future life had been a great trouble 
none	none	Whom should she marry 
7460_104483_000006_000002	train-clean-360	and whom should she decline to marry 
7460_104483_000006_000003	train-clean-360	To a girl when it is proposed to her suddenly to change everything in life to go altogether away and place herself under the custody of a new master to find for herself a new home new pursuits new aspirations and a strange companion the change must be so complete as almost to frighten her by its awfulness 
7460_104483_000006_000004	train-clean-360	And yet it has to be always thought of and generally done 
7460_104483_000007_000000	train-clean-360	But this change had been presented to Florence in a manner more than ordinarily burdensome 
7460_104483_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Early in life when naturally she would not have begun to think seriously of marriage she had been told rather than asked to give herself to her cousin Mountjoy 
none	none	She was too firm of character to accede at once to deliver herself over body and soul to the tender mercies of one in truth unknown But she had been unable to interpose any reason that was valid and had contented herself by demanding time Since that there had been moments in which she had almost yielded 
7460_104483_000007_000005	train-clean-360	Mountjoy Scarborough had been so represented to her that she had considered it to be almost a duty to yield 
none	none	More than once the word had been all but spoken but the word had never been spoken 
7460_104483_000007_000007	train-clean-360	She had been subjected to what might be called cruel pressure 
7460_104483_000007_000008	train-clean-360	In season and out of season her mother had represented as a duty this marriage with her cousin 
7460_104483_000007_000009	train-clean-360	Why should she not marry her cousin 
7460_104483_000007_000010	train-clean-360	It must be understood that these questions had been asked before any of the terrible facts of Captain Scarborough s life had been made known to her 
7460_104483_000007_000011	train-clean-360	Because it may be said she did not love him 
7460_104483_000007_000012	train-clean-360	But in these days she had loved no man and was inclined to think so little of herself as to make her want of love no necessary bar to the accomplishment of the wish of others 
none	none	By degrees she was spoken of among their acquaintance as the promised bride of Mountjoy Scarborough and though she ever denied the imputation there came over her girl s heart a feeling very sad and very solemn but still all but accepted that so it must be Then Harry Annesley had crossed her path and the question had been at last nearly answered and the doubts nearly decided 
7460_104483_000007_000015	train-clean-360	She did not quite know at first that she loved Harry Annesley but was almost sure that it was impossible for her to become the wife of Mountjoy Scarborough 
none	none	Then there came nearly twelve months of most painful uncertainty in her life It is very hard for a young girl to have to be firm with her mother in declining a proposed marriage when all circumstances of the connection are recommended to her as being peculiarly alluring And there was nothing in the personal manners of her cousin which seemed to justify her in declaring her abhorrence 
7460_104483_000008_000003	train-clean-360	He was a dark handsome military looking man whose chief sin it was in the eyes of his cousin that he seemed to demand from her affection worship and obedience 
7460_104483_000008_000004	train-clean-360	She did not analyse his character but she felt it 
7460_104483_000008_000005	train-clean-360	And when it came to pass that tidings of his debts at last reached her she felt that she was glad of an excuse though she knew that the excuse would not have prevailed with her had she liked him 
7460_104483_000008_000006	train-clean-360	Then came his debts and with the knowledge of them a keener perception of his imperiousness 
7460_104483_000008_000007	train-clean-360	She could consent to become the wife of the man who had squandered his property and wasted his estate but not of one who before his marriage demanded of her that submission which as she thought should be given by her freely after her marriage 
7460_104483_000008_000008	train-clean-360	Harry Annesley glided into her heart after a manner very different from this 
none	none	She knew that he adored her but yet he did not hasten to tell her so She knew that she loved him but she doubted whether a time would ever come in which she could confess it 
7460_104483_000008_000011	train-clean-360	It was not till he had come to acknowledge the trouble to which Mountjoy had subjected him that he had ever ventured to speak plainly of his own passion and even then he had not asked for a reply 
none	none	She was still free as she thought of all this but she did at last tell herself that let her mother say what she would she certainly never would stand at the altar with her cousin Mountjoy 
7460_104483_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Even now when the captain had been declared not to be his father s heir and when all the world knew that he had disappeared from the face of the earth missus Mountjoy did not altogether give him up 
7460_104483_000009_000001	train-clean-360	She partly disbelieved her brother and partly thought that circumstances could not be so bad as they were described 
7460_104483_000010_000000	train-clean-360	To her feminine mind to her living not in the world of London but in the very moderate fashion of Cheltenham it seemed to be impossible that an entail should be thus blighted in the bud 
none	none	Why was an entail called an entail unless it were ineradicable a decision of fate rather than of man and of law And to her eyes Mountjoy Scarborough was so commanding that all things must at last be compelled to go as he would have them And to tell the truth there had lately come to missus Mountjoy a word of comfort which might be necessary if the world should be absolutely upset in accordance with the wicked skill of her brother which even in that case might make crooked things smooth 
7460_104483_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Augustus whom she had regarded always as quite a Mountjoy because of his talent and appearance and habit of command had whispered to her a word 
none	none	Why should not Florence be transferred with the remainder of the property There was something to missus Mountjoy s feelings base in the idea at the first blush of it 
7460_104483_000010_000005	train-clean-360	She did not like to be untrue to her gallant nephew But as she came to turn it in her mind there were certain circumstances which recommended the change to her should the change be necessary Florence certainly had expressed an unintelligible objection to the elder brother 
7460_104483_000010_000006	train-clean-360	Why should the younger not be more successful 
none	none	missus Mountjoy s heart had begun to droop within her as she had thought that her girl would prove deaf to the voice of the charmer 
7460_104483_000010_000008	train-clean-360	Another charmer had come most objectionable in her sight but to him no word of absolute encouragement had as she thought been yet spoken 
7460_104483_000010_000009	train-clean-360	Augustus had already obtained for himself among his friends the character of an eloquent young lawyer 
none	none	Let him come and try his eloquence on his cousin only let it first be ascertained as an assured fact and beyond the possibility of all retrogression that the squire s villainy was certain
7460_104483_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I think my love she said to her daughter one day that under the immediate circumstances of the family we should retire for a while into private life 
7460_104483_000011_000001	train-clean-360	This occurred on the very day on which Septimus Jones had been vaguely informed of the iniquitous falsehood of Harry Annesley 
7460_104483_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Good gracious 
none	none	mamma is not our life always private She had understood it all that the private life was intended altogether to exclude Harry but was to be made open to the manoeuvres of her cousin such as they might be Not in the sense in which I mean 
7460_104483_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Your poor uncle is dying 
none	none	We hear that Sir William says he is better
7460_104483_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I fear nevertheless that he is dying though it may perhaps take a long time 
7460_104483_000015_000001	train-clean-360	And then poor Mountjoy has disappeared 
7460_104483_000015_000002	train-clean-360	I think that we should see no one till the mystery about Mountjoy has been cleared up And then the story is so very discreditable 
none	none	I do not see that that is an affair of ours said Florence who had no desire to be shut up just at the present moment
7460_104483_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 We cannot help ourselves 
7460_104483_000017_000001	train-clean-360	This making his eldest son out to be oh something so very different is too horrible to be thought of 
7460_104483_000017_000002	train-clean-360	I am told that nobody knows the truth 
7460_104483_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 We at any rate are not implicated in that 
none	none	But we are He at any rate is my brother and Mountjoy is my nephew or at any rate was 
7460_104483_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Poor Augustus is thrown into terrible difficulties 
7460_104483_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I am told that he is greatly pleased at finding that Tretton is to belong to him 
7460_104483_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Who tells you that 
7460_104483_000021_000001	train-clean-360	You have no right to believe anything about such near relatives from any one 
7460_104483_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Whoever told you so has been very wicked missus Mountjoy no doubt thought that this wicked communication had been made by Harry Annesley 
none	none	Augustus has always proved himself to be affectionate and respectful to his elder brother that is to his brother who is is older than himself added missus Mountjoy feeling that there was a difficulty in expressing herself as to the presumed condition of the two Scarboroughs Of course he would rather be owner of Tretton than let any one else have it if you mean that The honor of the family is very much to him
7460_104483_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I do not know that the family can have any honor left said Florence severely 
7460_104483_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear you have no right to say that 
7460_104483_000023_000001	train-clean-360	The Scarboroughs have always held their heads very high in Staffordshire and more so of late than ever 
none	none	I don t mean quite of late but since Tretton became of so much importance Now I ll tell you what I think we had better do 
7460_104483_000023_000004	train-clean-360	We ll go and spend six weeks with your uncle at Brussels 
7460_104483_000023_000005	train-clean-360	He has always been pressing us to come 
7460_104483_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh mamma he does not want us 
7460_104483_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 How can you say that 
7460_104483_000025_000001	train-clean-360	How do you know 
7460_104483_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I am sure Sir Magnus will not care for our coming now 
7460_104483_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Besides how could that be retiring into private life 
7460_104483_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Sir Magnus as ambassador has his house always full of company 
7460_104483_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear he is not ambassador 
7460_104483_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He is minister plenipotentiary 
7460_104483_000027_000002	train-clean-360	It is not quite the same thing 
7460_104483_000027_000003	train-clean-360	And then he is our nearest relative our nearest at least since my own brother has made this great separation of course 
7460_104483_000027_000004	train-clean-360	We cannot go to him to be out of the way of himself 
7460_104483_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Why do you want to go anywhere mamma 
none	none	Why not stay at home But Florence pleaded in vain as her mother had already made up her mind Before that day was over she succeeded in making her daughter understand that she was to be taken to Brussels as soon as an answer could be received from Sir Magnus and the necessary additions were made to their joint wardrobe 
7460_104483_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Sir Magnus Mountjoy the late general s elder brother had been for the last four or five years the English minister at Brussels 
7460_104483_000029_000001	train-clean-360	He had been minister somewhere for a very long time so that the memory of man hardly ran back beyond it and was said to have gained for himself very extensive popularity 
7460_104483_000029_000002	train-clean-360	It had always been a point with successive governments to see that poor Sir Magnus got something and Sir Magnus had never been left altogether in the cold 
7460_104483_000029_000003	train-clean-360	He was not a man who would have been left out in the cold in silence and perhaps the feeling that such was the case had been as efficacious on his behalf as his well attested popularity 
7460_104483_000029_000004	train-clean-360	At any rate poor Sir Magnus had always been well placed and was now working out his last year or two before the blessed achievement of his pursuit should have been reached 
7460_104483_000029_000005	train-clean-360	Sir Magnus had a wife of whom it was said at home that she was almost as popular as her husband but the opinion of the world at Brussels on this subject was a good deal divided 
7460_104483_000029_000006	train-clean-360	There were those who declared that Lady Mountjoy was of all women the most overbearing and impertinent 
7460_104483_000029_000007	train-clean-360	But they were generally English residents at Brussels who had come to live there as a place at which education for their children would be cheaper than at home 
7460_104483_000029_000008	train-clean-360	Of these Lady Mountjoy had been heard to declare that she saw no reason why because she was the minister s wife she should be expected to entertain all the second class world of London 
none	none	This of course must be understood with a good deal of allowance as the English world at Brussels was much too large to expect to be so received but there were certain ladies living on the confines of high society who thought that they had a right to be admitted and who grievously resented their exclusion It cannot therefore be said that Lady Mountjoy was popular but she was large in figure and painted well and wore her diamonds with an air which her peculiar favorites declared to be majestic 
7460_104483_000029_000011	train-clean-360	You could not see her going along the boulevards in her carriage without being aware that a special personage was passing 
none	none	Upon the whole it may be said that she performed well her special role in life 
7460_104483_000029_000013	train-clean-360	Of Sir Magnus it was hinted that he was afraid of his wife but in truth he desired it to be understood that all the disagreeable things done at the Embassy were done by Lady Mountjoy and not by him 
7460_104483_000029_000014	train-clean-360	He did not refuse leave to the ladies to drop their cards at his hall door 
7460_104483_000029_000015	train-clean-360	He could ask a few men to his table without referring the matter to his wife but every one would understand that the asking of ladies was based on a different footing 
7460_104483_000030_000000	train-clean-360	He knew well that as a rule it was not fitting that he should ask a married man without his wife but there are occasions on which an excuse can be given and upon the whole the men liked it 
7460_104483_000030_000001	train-clean-360	He was a stout tall portly old gentleman sixty years of age but looking somewhat older whom it was a difficulty to place on horseback but who when there looked remarkably well 
7460_104483_000030_000002	train-clean-360	He rarely rose to a trot during his two hours of exercise which to the two attache s who were told off for the duty of accompanying him was the hardest part of their allotted work 
7460_104483_000030_000003	train-clean-360	But other gentlemen would lay themselves out to meet Sir Magnus and to ride with him and in this way he achieved that character for popularity which had been a better aid to him in life than all the diplomatic skill which he possessed 
7460_104483_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you think said he walking off with missus Mountjoy s letter into his wife s room 
7460_104483_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think anything my dear 
7460_104483_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 You never do Lady Mountjoy who had not yet undergone her painting looked cross and ill natured 
7460_104483_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 At any rate Sarah and her daughter are proposing to come here 
none	none	Good gracious At once
7460_104483_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes at once 
7460_104483_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Of course I ve asked them over and over again and something was said about this autumn when we had come back from Pimperingen 
7460_104483_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Why did you not tell me 
none	none	Bother 
7460_104483_000037_000001	train-clean-360	I did tell you 
none	none	This kind of thing always turns up at last She s a very good kind of a woman
7460_104483_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 and the daughter 
none	none	is all that she ought to be Of course she ll be flirting with Anderson Anderson was one of the two mounted attaches
7460_104483_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Anderson will know how to look after himself said Sir Magnus 
7460_104483_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 At any rate they must come 
7460_104483_000039_000002	train-clean-360	They have never troubled us before and we ought to put up with them once 
7460_104483_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 But my dear what is all this about her brother 
7460_104483_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 She won t bring her brother with her 
7460_104483_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 How can you be sure of that said the anxious lady 
7460_104483_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 He is dying and can t be moved 
7460_104483_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 But that son of his Mountjoy 
7460_104483_000044_000001	train-clean-360	It s altogether a most distressing story 
none	none	He turns out to be nobody after all and now he has disappeared and the papers for an entire month were full of him 
7460_104483_000044_000003	train-clean-360	What would you do if he were to turn up here 
7460_104483_000044_000004	train-clean-360	The girl was engaged to him you know and has only thrown him off since his own father declared that he was not legitimate 
7460_104483_000044_000005	train-clean-360	There never was such a mess about anything since London first began 
7460_104483_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Then Sir Magnus declared that let Mountjoy Scarborough and his father have misbehaved as they might mister Scarborough s sister must be received at Brussels 
none	none	There was a little family difficulty 
7460_104483_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Sir Magnus had borrowed three thousand pounds from the general which had been settled on the general s widow and the interest was not always paid with extreme punctuality 
7460_104483_000045_000003	train-clean-360	To give missus Mountjoy her due it must be said that this had not entered into her consideration when she had written to her brother in law but it was a burden to Sir Magnus and had always tended to produce from him a reiteration of those invitations which missus Mountjoy had taken as an expression of brotherly love 
none	none	Her own income was always sufficient for her wants and the hundred and fifty pounds coming from Sir Magnus had not troubled her much Well my dear if it must be it must only what I m to do with her I do not know
7460_104483_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Take her about in the carriage said Sir Magnus who was beginning to be a little angry with this interference 
none	none	And the daughter 
7460_104483_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Daughters are twice more troublesome than their mothers 
none	none	Pass her over to Miss Abbott 
7460_104483_000048_000001	train-clean-360	And for goodness sake don t make so much trouble about things which need not be troublesome Then Sir Magnus left his wife to ring for her chambermaid and go on with her painting while he himself undertook the unwonted task of writing an affectionate letter to his sister in law 
none	none	It should be here explained that Sir Magnus had no children of his own and that Miss Abbott was the lady who was bound to smile and say pretty things on all occasions to Lady Mountjoy for the moderate remuneration of two hundred a year and her maintenance

none	none	CHAPTER XI MONTE CARLO Toward the end of September while the weather was so hot as to keep away from the south of France all but very determined travellers an English gentleman not very beautiful in his outward appearance was sauntering about the great hall of the gambling house at Monte Carlo in the kingdom or principality of Monaco the only gambling house now left in Europe in which idle men of a speculative nature may yet solace their hours with some excitement Nor is the amusement denied to idle ladies as might be seen by two or three highly dressed habituees who at this moment were depositing their shawls and parasols with the porters The clock was on the stroke of eleven when the gambling room would be open and the amusement was too rich in its nature to allow of the loss of even a few minutes But this gentleman was not an habitue nor was he known even by name to any of the small crowd that was then assembled But it was known to many of them that he had had a great turn of luck on the preceding day and had walked off from the rouge et noir table with four or five hundred pounds The weather was still so hot that but few Englishmen were there and the play had not as yet begun to run high There were only two or three men who cannot keep their hands from ruin when ruin is open to them To them heat and cold the dog star or twenty degrees below zero make no difference while the croupier is there with his rouleaux before him capable of turning up the card They know that the chance is against them one in twenty let us say and that in the long run one in twenty is as good as two to one to effect their ruin For a day they may stand against one in twenty as this man had done For two or three days for a week they may possibly do so but they know that the doom must come at last as it does come invariably and they go on But our friend the Englishman who had won the money was not such a one as these at any rate in regard to Monaco Yesterday had been his first appearance and he had broken ground there with great success He was an ill looking person poorly clad what in common parlance we should call seedy He had not a scrap of beard on his face and though swarthy and dark as to his countenance was light as to his hair which hung in quantities down his back He was dressed from head to foot in a suit of cross barred light colored tweed of which he wore the coat buttoned tight over his chest as though to hide some deficiency of linen The gentleman was altogether a disreputable looking personage and they who had seen him win his money Frenchmen and Italians for the most part had declared among themselves that his luck had been most miraculous It was observed that he had a companion with him who stuck close to his elbow and it was asserted that this companion continually urged him to leave the room But as long as the croupier remained at the table he remained and continued to play through the day with almost invariable luck It was surmised among the gamblers there that he had not entered the room with above twenty or thirty pieces in his pocket and that he had taken away with him when the place was closed six hundred napoleons Look there he has come again to give it all back to Madame Blanc with interest said a Frenchman to an Italian Yes and he will end by blowing his brains out within a week He is just the man to do it These Englishmen always rush at their fate like mad bulls said the Frenchman They get less distraction for their money than any one Che va piano va sano said the Italian jingling the four napoleons in his pocket which had been six on yesterday morning Then they sauntered up to the Englishman and both of them touched their hats to him The Englishman just acknowledged the compliment and walked off with his companion who was still whispering something into his ear It is a gendarme who is with him I think said the Frenchman only the man does not walk erect Who does not know the outside hall of the magnificent gambling house at Monte Carlo with all the golden splendor of its music room within Who does not know the lofty roof and lounging seats with its luxuries of liveried servants its wealth of newspapers and every appanage of costly comfort which can be added to it And its music within who does not know that there are to be heard sounds in a greater perfection of orchestral melody than are to be procured by money and trouble combined in the great capitals of Europe Think of the trouble endured by those unhappy fathers of families who indulge their wives and daughters at the Philharmonic and saint James s Hall Think of the horrors of our theatres with their hot gas and narrow passages and difficulties of entrance and almost impossibility of escape And for all this money has to be paid high prices and the day has to be fixed long beforehand so that the tickets may be secured and the daily feast papa s too often solitary enjoyment has to be turned into a painful early fast And when at last the thing has been done and the torment endured the sounds heard have not always been good of their kind for the money has not sufficed to purchase the aid of a crowd of the best musicians But at Monte Carlo you walk in with your wife in her morning costume and seating yourself luxuriously in one of those soft stalls which are there prepared for you you give yourself up with perfect ease to absolute enjoyment For two hours the concert lasts and all around is perfection and gilding There is nothing to annoy the most fastidious taste You have not heated yourself with fighting your way up crowded stairs no box keeper has asked you for a shilling No link boy has dunned you because he stood useless for a moment at the door of your carriage No panic has seized you and still oppresses you because of the narrow dimensions in which you have to seat yourself for the next three hours There are no twenty minutes during which you are doomed to sit in miserable expectation Exactly at the hour named the music begins and for two hours it is your own fault if you be not happy A railway carriage has brought you to steps leading up to the garden in which these princely halls are built and when the music is over will again take you home Nothing can be more perfect than the concert room at Monte Carlo and nothing more charming and for all this there is nothing whatever to pay But by whom out of whose pocket are all these good things provided They tell you at Monte Carlo that from time to time are to be seen men walking off in the dark of the night or the gloom of the evening or for the matter of that in the broad light of day if the stern necessity of the hour require it with a burden among them to be deposited where it may not be seen or heard of any more They are carrying away all that mortal remains of one of the gentlemen who have paid for your musical entertainment He has given his all for the purpose and has then blown his brains out It is one of the disagreeable incidents to which the otherwise extremely pleasant money making operations of the establishment are liable Such accidents will happen A gambling house the keeper of which is able to maintain the royal expense of the neighboring court out of his winnings and also to keep open for those who are not ashamed to accept it gratis all for love a concert room brilliant with gold filled with the best performers whom the world can furnish and comfortable beyond all opera houses known to men must be liable to a few such misfortunes Who is not ashamed to accept I have said having lately been there and thoroughly enjoyed myself But I did not put myself in the way of having to cut my throat on which account I felt as I came out that I had been somewhat shabby I was ashamed in that I had not put a few napoleons down on the table Conscience had prevented me and a wish to keep my money But should not conscience have kept me away from all that happiness for which I had not paid I had not thought of it before I went to Monte Carlo but I am inclined now to advise others to stay away or else to put down half a napoleon at any rate as the price of a ticket The place is not overcrowded because the conscience of many is keener than was mine We ought to be grateful to the august sovereign of Monaco in that he enabled an enterprising individual to keep open for us in so brilliant a fashion the last public gambling house in Europe The principality is but large enough to contain the court of the sovereign which is held in the little town of Monaco and the establishment of the last of legitimate gamblers which is maintained at Monte Carlo If the report of the world does not malign the prince he lives as does the gambler out of the spoil taken from the gamblers He is to be seen in his royal carriage going forth with his royal consort and very royal he looks His little teacup of a kingdom or rather a roll of French bread for it is crusty and picturesque is now surrounded by France There is Nice away to the west and Mentone to the east and the whole kingdom lies within the compass of a walk Mentone in France at any rate is within five miles of the monarch s residence How happy it is that there should be so blessed a spot left in tranquillity on the earth s surface But on the present occasion Monte Carlo was not in all its grandeur because of the heat of the weather Another month and English lords and English members of Parliament and English barristers would be there all men for instance who could afford to be indifferent as to their character for a month and the place would be quite alive with music cards and dice At present men of business only flocked to its halls eagerly intent on making money though alas almost all doomed to lose it But our one friend with the long light locks was impatient for the fray The gambling room had now been opened and the servants of the table less impatient than he were slowly arranging their money and their cards Our friend had taken his seat and was already resolving with his eyes fixed on the table where he would make his first plunge In his right hand was a bag of gold and under his left hand were hidden the twelve napoleons with which he intended to commence On yesterday he had gone through his day s work by twelve though on one or two occasions he had plunged deeply It had seemed to this man as though a new heaven had been opened to him as of late he had seen little of luck in this world The surmises made as to the low state of his funds when he entered the room had been partly true but time had been when he was able to gamble in a more costly fashion even than here and to play among those who had taken his winnings and losings simply as a matter of course And now the game had begun and the twelve napoleons were duly deposited Again he won his stake an omen for the day and was exultant A second twelve and a third were put down and on each occasion he won In the silly imagination of his heart he declared to himself that the calculation of all chances was as nothing against his run of luck Here was the spot on which it was destined that he should redeem all the injury which fortune had done him And in truth this man had been misused by fortune His companion whispered in his ear but he heard not a word of it He increased the twelve to fifteen and again won As he looked round there was a halo of triumph which seemed to illuminate his face He had chained Chance to his chariot wheel and would persevere now that the good time had come What did he care for the creature at his elbow He thought of all the good things which money could again purchase for him as he carefully fingered the gold for the next stake He had been rich though he was now poor though how could a man be accounted poor who had an endless sum of six hundred napoleons in his pocket a sum which was in truth endless while it could be so rapidly recruited in this fashion The next stake he also won but as he raked all the pieces which the croupier pushed toward him his mind had become intent on another sphere and on other persons Let him win what he might his old haunts were now closed against him What good would money do him living such a life as he must now be compelled to pass As he thought of this the five and twenty napoleons on the table were taken away from him almost without consciousness on his part At that moment there came a voice in his ear not the voice of his attending friend but one of which he accurately knew the lisping fiendish sound Ah Captain Scarborough I thought it vas posshible you might be here Dis ish a very nice place Our friend looked round and glared at the man and felt that it was impossible that this occupation should be continued under his eyes Yesh it was likely How do you like Monte Carlo You have plenty of money plenty The man was small and oily and black haired and beaky nosed with a perpetual smile on his face unless when on special occasions he would be moved to the expression of deep anger Of the modern Hebrews a most complete Hebrew but a man of purpose who never did things by halves who could count upon good courage within and who never allowed himself to be foiled by misadventure He was one who beginning with nothing was determined to die a rich man and was likely to achieve his purpose Now there was no gleam of anger on his face but a look of invincible good humor which was not however quite good humor when you came to examine it closely Oh that is you is it mister Hart Yesh it is me I have followed you Oh I have had quite a pleasant tour following you But ven I got my noshe once on to the schent then I was sure it was Monte Carlo And it ish Monte Carlo eh Captain Scarborough Yes of course it is Monte Carlo That is to say Monte Carlo is the place where we are now I don t know what you mean by running on in that way Then he drew back from the table mister Hart following close behind him and his attendant at a farther distance behind him As he went he remembered that he had slightly increased the six hundred napoleons of yesterday and that the money was still in his own possession Not all the Jews in London could touch the money while he kept it in his pocket Who ish dat man there asked mister Hart What can that be to you He seems to follow you pretty close Not so close as you do by George and perhaps he has something to get by it which you haven t Come come come If he have more to get than I he mush be pretty deep There is Mishter Tyrrwhit No one have more to get than I only Mishter Tyrrwhit Vy Captain Scarborough the little game you wash playing there which wash a very pretty little game is as nothing to my game wish you When you see the money down on the table there it seems to be mush because the gold glitters but it is as noting to my little game where the gold does not glitter because it is pen and ink A pen and ink soon writes ten thousand pounds But you think mush of it when you win two hundred pounds at roulette I think nothing of it said our friend Captain Scarborough And it goes into your pocket to give champagne to the ladies instead of paying your debts to the poor fellows who have supplied you for so long with all de money All this occurred in the gambling house at a distance from the table but within hearing of that attendant who still followed the player These moments were moments of misery to the captain in spite of the bank notes for six hundred napoleons which were still in his breast coat pocket And they were not made lighter by the fact that all the words spoken by the Jew were overheard by the man who was supposed to be there in the capacity of his servant But the man as it seemed had a mission to fulfil and was the captain s master as well as servant mister Hart said Captain Scarborough repressing the loudness of his words as far as his rage would admit him but still speaking so as to attract the attention of some of those round him I do not know what good you propose to yourself by following me in this manner You have my bonds which are not even payable till my father s death Ah there you are very much mistaken And are then only payable out of the property to which I believed myself to be heir when the money was borrowed You are still de heir de heir to Tretton There is not a shadow of a doubt as to that I hope when the time comes said the captain you ll be able to prove your words Of course we shall prove dem Why not Your father and your brother are very clever shentlemen I think but they will not be more clever than Mishter Samuel Hart mister Tyrrwhit also is a clever man Perhaps he understands your father s way of doing business Perhaps it is all right with mister Tyrrwhit It shall be all right with me too I swear it When will you come back to London Captain Scarborough Then there came an angry dispute in the gambling room during which mister Hart by no means strove to repress his voice Captain Scarborough asserted his rights as a free agent declaring himself capable as far as the law was concerned of going wherever he pleased without reference to mister Hart and told that gentleman that any interference on his part would be regarded as an impertinence But my money my money which you must pay this minute if I please to demand it You did not lend me five and twenty thousand pounds without security It is forty five now at this moment Take it get it go and put it in your pocket You have a lot of writings turn then into cash at once Take them to any other Jew in London and sell them See if you can get your five and twenty thousand pounds for them or twenty five thousand shillings You certainly cannot get five and twenty pence for them here though you had all the police of this royal kingdom to support you My father says that the bonds I gave you are not worth the paper on which they were written If you are cheated so have I been If he has robbed you so has he me But I have not robbed you and you can do nothing to me I vill stick to you like beesvax said mister Hart while the look of good humor left his countenance for a moment Like beesvax You shall not escape me again You will have to follow me to Constantinople then I vill follow you to the devil You are likely to go before me there But for the present I am off to Constantinople from whence I intend to make an extended tour to Mount Caucasus and then into Thibet I shall be very glad of your company but cannot offer to pay the bill When you and your companions have settled yourselves comfortably at Tretton I shall be happy to come and see you there You will have to settle the matter first with my younger brother if I may make bold to call that well born gentleman my brother at all I wish you a good morning mister Hart Upon that he walked out into the hall and thence down the steps into the garden in front of the establishment his own attendant following him mister Hart also followed him but did not immediately seek to renew the conversation If he meant to show any sign of keeping his threat and of sticking to the captain like beeswax he must show his purpose at once The captain for a time walked round the little enclosure in earnest conversation with the attendant and mister Hart stood on the steps watching them Play was over at any rate for that day as far as the captain was concerned Now Captain Scarborough don t you think you ve been very rash said the attendant I think I ve got six hundred and fifty napoleons in my pocket instead of waiting to get them in driblets from my brother But if he knew that you had come here he would withdraw them altogether Of course he will know now That man will be sure to tell him He will let all London know Of course it would be so when you came to a place of such common resort as Monte Carlo Common resort Do you believe he came here as to a place of common resort Do you think that he had not tracked me out and would not have done so whether I had gone to Melbourne or New York or saint Petersburg But the wonder is that he should spend his money in such a vain pursuit Ah captain you do not know what is vain and what is not It is your brother s pleasure that you should be kept in the dark for a time Hang my brother s pleasure Why am I to follow my brother s pleasure Because he will allow you an income He will keep a coat on your back and a hat on your head and supply meat and wine for your needs Here Captain Scarborough jingled the loose napoleons in his trousers pocket Oh yes that is all very well but it will not last forever Indeed it will not last for a week unless you leave Monte Carlo I shall leave it this afternoon by the train for Genoa And where shall you go then You heard me suggest to mister Hart to the devil or else Constantinople and after that to Thibet I suppose I shall still enjoy the pleasure of your company mister Augustus wishes that I should remain with you and as you yourself say perhaps it will be best CHAPTER XII HARRY ANNESLEY S SUCCESS Harry Annesley a day or two after he had left Tretton went down to Cheltenham for he had received an invitation to a dance there 
8156-104485-0001	train-other-500	and with the invitation an intimation that Florence Mountjoy was to be at the dance If I were to declare that the dance had been given and Florence asked to it merely as an act of friendship to Harry it would perhaps be thought that modern friendship is seldom carried to so great a length
8156-104485-0002	train-other-500	But it was undoubtedly the fact that missus Armitage who gave the dance was a great friend and admirer of Harry s and that mister Armitage was an especial chum Let not however any reader suppose that Florence was in the secret
none	none	 missus Armitage had thought it best to keep her in the dark as to the person asked to meet her 
8156-104485-0003	train-other-500	As to my going to Montpelier Place Harry had once said to missus Armitage I might as well knock at a prison door missus Mountjoy lived in Montpelier Place
none	none	 I think we could perhaps manage that for you missus Armitage had replied 
8156-104485-0004	train-other-500	and she had managed it Is she coming Harry said to missus Armitage in an anxious whisper as he entered the room She has been here this half hour
none	none	 if you had taken the trouble to leave your cigars and come and meet her 
8156-104485-0005	train-other-500	She has not gone said Harry almost awe struck at the idea No she is sitting like Patience on a monument smiling at grief in the room inside She has got horrible news to tell you Oh heavens What news
none	none	 I suppose she will tell you though she has not been communicative to me in regard to your royal highness The news is simply that her mother is going to take her to Brussels 
8156-104485-0006	train-other-500	and that she is to live for a while amid the ambassadorial splendors with Sir Magnus and his wife By retiring from the world missus Mountjoy had not intended to include such slight social relaxations as missus Armitage s party for Harry on turning round
none	none	 encountered her talking to another Cheltenham lady 
8156-104485-0007	train-other-500	He greeted her with his pleasantest smile to which missus Mountjoy did not respond quite so sweetly
none	none	 She had ever greatly feared Harry Annesley 
8156-104485-0008	train-other-500	and had to day heard a story very much as she thought to his discredit Is your daughter here asked Harry with well trained hypocrisy missus Mountjoy could not but acknowledge that Florence was in the room and then Harry passed on in pursuit of his quarry
8156-104485-0009	train-other-500	Oh mister Annesley when did you come to Cheltenham
none	none	 As soon as I heard that missus Armitage was going to have a party 
8156-104485-0010	train-other-500	I began to think of coming immediately Then an idea for the first time shot through Florence s mind
none	none	 that her friend missus Armitage was a woman devoted to intrigue 
8156-104485-0011	train-other-500	What dance have you disengaged I have something that I must tell you to night
none	none	 You don t mean to say that you will not give me one dance 
8156-104485-0012	train-other-500	This was merely a lover s anxious doubt on his part because Florence had not at once replied to him I am told that you are going away to Brussels Mamma is going on a visit to her brother in law And you with her Of course I shall go with mamma
8156-104485-0013	train-other-500	All this had been said apart while a fair haired lackadaisical young gentleman was standing twiddling his thumbs waiting to dance with Florence
none	none	 At last the little book from her waist was brought forth 
8156-104485-0014	train-other-500	and Harry s name was duly inscribed The next dance was a quadrille
none	none	 and he saw that the space after that was also vacant 
8156-104485-0015	train-other-500	so he boldly wrote down his name for both I almost think that Florence must have suspected that Harry Annesley was to be there that night or why should the two places have been kept vacant And now what is this he began about your going to Brussels
8156-104485-0016	train-other-500	Mamma s brother is minister there and we are just going on a visit But why now I am sure there is some especial cause Florence would not say that there was no especial cause so she could only repeat her assertion that they certainly were going to Brussels
8156-104485-0017	train-other-500	She herself was well aware that she was to be taken out of Harry s way and that something was expected to occur during this short month of her absence which might be detrimental to him
none	none	 and to her also But this she could not tell 
8156-104485-0018	train-other-500	nor did she like to say that the plea given by her mother was the general state of the Scarborough affairs She did not wish to declare to this lover that that other lover was as nothing to her And how long are you to be away asked Harry
8156-104485-0019	train-other-500	We shall be a month with Sir Magnus but mamma is talking of going on afterward to the Italian lakes Good heavens you will not be back I suppose till ever so much after Christmas I cannot tell Nothing as yet has been settled
8156-104485-0020	train-other-500	I do not know that I ought to tell you anything about it Harry at this moment looked up and caught the eye of missus Mountjoy as she was standing in the door way opposite
none	none	 missus Mountjoy certainly looked as though no special communication as to Florence s future movements ought to be made to Harry Annesley 
8156-104485-0021	train-other-500	Then however it came to his turn to dance and he had a moment allowed to him to collect his thoughts By nothing that he could do or say could he prevent her going and he could only use the present moment to the best purpose in his power He bethought himself then
none	none	 that he had never received from her a word of encouragement 
8156-104485-0022	train-other-500	and that such word if ever to be spoken should be forthcoming that night What might not happen to a girl who was passing the balmy Christmas months amid the sweet shadows of an Italian lake
none	none	 Harry s ideas of an Italian lake were in truth 
8156-104485-0023	train-other-500	at present somewhat vague But future months were to his thinking interminable the present moment only was his own The dance was now finished Come and take a walk said Harry I think I will go to mamma
8156-104485-0024	train-other-500	Florence had seen her mother s eye fixed upon her Oh come that won t do at all said Harry who had already got her hand within his arm A fellow is always entitled to five minutes and then I am down for the next waltz Oh no But I am and you can t get out of it now
8156-104485-0025	train-other-500	Oh Florence will you answer me a question one question I asked it you before and you did not vouchsafe me any answer You asked me no question said Florence who remembered to the last syllable every word that had been said to her on that occasion
none	none	 Did I not I am sure you knew what it was that I intended to ask Florence could not but think that this was quite another thing 
8156-104485-0026	train-other-500	Oh Florence can you love me Had she given her ears for it she could not have told him the truth then on the spur of the moment Her mother s eye was she knew watching her through the door way all the way across from the other room
none	none	 And yet had her mother asked her she would have answered boldly that she did love Harry Annesley and intended to love him for ever and ever with all her heart And she would have gone farther if cross questioned 
8156-104485-0027	train-other-500	and have declared that she regarded him already as her lord and master But now she had not a word to say to him All she knew was that he had now pledged himself to her and that she intended to keep him to his pledge May I not have one word
8156-104485-0028	train-other-500	he said one word What could he want with a word more thought Florence Her silence now was as good as any speech
none	none	 But as he did want more she would after her own way reply to him 
8156-104485-0029	train-other-500	So there came upon his arm the slightest possible sense of pressure from those sweet fingers
none	none	 and Harry Annesley was on a sudden carried up among azure tinted clouds into the farthest heaven of happiness 
8156-104485-0030	train-other-500	After a moment he stood still and passed his fingers through his hair and waved his head as a god might do it
none	none	 She had now made to him a solemn promise than which no words could be more binding 
8156-104485-0031	train-other-500	Oh Florence he exclaimed I must have you alone with me for one moment
none	none	 For what could he want her alone for any moment 
8156-104485-0032	train-other-500	thought Florence There was her mother still looking at them but for her Harry did not now care one straw Nor did he hate those bright Italian lakes with nearly so strong a feeling of abhorrence Florence you are now all my own
8156-104485-0033	train-other-500	There came another slightest pressure slight but so eloquent from those fingers I hate dancing How is a fellow to dance now I shall run against everybody I can see no one I should be sure to make a fool of myself
none	none	 No I don t want to dance even with you No certainly not let you dance with somebody else and you engaged to me 
8156-104485-0034	train-other-500	Well if I must of course I must
none	none	 I declare Florence you have not spoken a single word to me 
8156-104485-0035	train-other-500	though there is so much that you must have to say What have you got to say What a question to ask You must tell me Oh you know what you have got to tell me
none	none	 The sound of it will be the sweetest music that a man can possibly hear You knew it all Harry 
8156-104485-0036	train-other-500	she whispered But I want to hear it Oh Florence Florence I do not think you can understand how completely I am beyond myself with joy I cannot dance again and will not Oh my wife my wife Hush said Florence
8156-104485-0037	train-other-500	afraid that the very walls might hear the sound of Harry s words What does it signify though all the world knew it Oh yes
none	none	 That I should have been so fortunate 
8156-104485-0038	train-other-500	That is what I cannot understand Poor Mountjoy I do feel for him That he should have had the start of me so long and have done nothing Nothing whispered Florence
none	none	 And I have done everything I am so proud of myself that I think I must look almost like a hero They had now got to the extremity of the room near an open window 
8156-104485-0039	train-other-500	and Florence found that she was able to say one word You are my hero The sound of this nearly drove him mad with joy He forgot all his troubles Prodgers the policeman Augustus Scarborough and that fellow whom he hated so much Septimus Jones
8156-104485-0040	train-other-500	what were they all to him now He had set his mind upon one thing of value and he had got it
none	none	 Florence had promised to be his and he was sure that she would never break her word to him 
8156-104485-0041	train-other-500	But he felt that for the full enjoyment of his triumph he must be alone somewhere with Florence for five minutes He had not actually explained to himself why but he knew that he wished to be alone with her At present there was no prospect of any such five minutes
8156-104485-0042	train-other-500	but he must say something in preparation for some future five minutes at a time to come Perhaps it might be to morrow though he did not at present see how that might be possible for missus Mountjoy he knew would shut her door against him
none	none	 And missus Mountjoy was already prowling round the room after her daughter 
8156-104485-0043	train-other-500	Harry saw her as he got Florence to an opposite door and there for the moment escaped with her And now he said how am I to manage to see you before you go to Brussels
none	none	 I do not know that you can see me Do you mean that you are to be shut up and that I am not to be allowed to approach you 
8156-104485-0044	train-other-500	I do mean it Mamma is of course attached to her nephew What after all that has passed Why not Is he to blame for what his father has done Harry felt that he could not press the case against Captain Scarborough
8156-104485-0045	train-other-500	without some want of generosity And though he had told Florence once about that dreadful midnight meeting he could say nothing farther on that subject Of course mamma thinks that I am foolish But why he asked Because she doesn t see with my eyes Harry
none	none	 We need not say anything more about it at present It is so and therefore I am to go to Brussels 
8156-104485-0046	train-other-500	You have made this opportunity for yourself before I start
none	none	 Perhaps I have been foolish to be taken off my guard 
8156-104485-0047	train-other-500	Don t say that Florence I shall think so unless you can be discreet Harry you will have to wait
none	none	 You will remember that we must wait 
8156-104485-0048	train-other-500	but I shall not change Nor I nor I I think not because I trust you Here is mamma and now I must leave you But I shall tell mamma everything before I go to bed
8156-104485-0049	train-other-500	Then missus Mountjoy came up and took Florence away with a few words of most disdainful greeting to Harry Annesley When Florence was gone Harry felt that as the sun and the moon and the stars had all set
none	none	 and as absolute darkness reigned through the rooms 
8156-104485-0050	train-other-500	he might as well escape into the street where there was no one but the police to watch him as he threw his hat up into the air in his exultation But before he did so he had to pass by missus Armitage and thank her for all her kindness
none	none	 for he was aware how much she had done for him in his present circumstances 
8156-104485-0051	train-other-500	Oh missus Armitage I am so obliged to you no fellow was ever so obliged to a friend before How has it gone off For missus Mountjoy has taken Florence home Oh yes she has taken her away
none	none	 But she hasn t shut the stable door till the steed has been stolen 
8156-104485-0052	train-other-500	Oh the steed has been stolen Yes I think so I do think so And that poor man who has disappeared is nowhere Men who disappear never are anywhere But I do flatter myself that if he had held his ground and kept his property
none	none	 the result would have been the same 
8156-104485-0053	train-other-500	I dare say Don t suppose missus Armitage that I am taking any pride to myself
none	none	 Why on earth Florence should have taken a fancy to such a fellow as I am I cannot imagine 
8156-104485-0054	train-other-500	Oh no not in the least It s all very well for you to laugh missus Armitage but as I have thought of it all I have sometimes been in despair But now you are not in despair No indeed just now I am triumphant
8156-104485-0055	train-other-500	I have thought so often that I was a fool to love her because everything was so much against me I have wondered that you continued It always seemed to me that there wasn t a ghost of a chance for you mister Armitage bade me give it all up because he was sure you would never do any good
8156-104485-0056	train-other-500	I don t care how much you laugh at me missus Armitage
none	none	 Let those laugh who win Then he rushed out into the Paragon and absolutely did throw his hat up in the air in his triumph CHAPTER XIII missus MOUNTJOY S ANGER Florence as she went home in the fly with her mother after the party at which Harry had spoken to her so openly did not find the little journey very happy missus Mountjoy was a woman endowed with a strong power of wishing rather than of willing of desiring rather than of contriving but she was one who could make herself very unpleasant when she was thwarted Her daughter was now at last fully determined that if she ever married anybody that person should be Harry Annesley Having once pressed his arm in token of assent she had as it were given herself away to him so that no reasoning no expostulations could she thought change her purpose and she had much more power of bringing about her purposed design than had her mother But her mother could be obstinate and self willed and would for the time make herself disagreeable Florence had assured her lover that everything should be told her mother that night before she went to bed But missus Mountjoy did not wait to be simply told No sooner were they seated in the fly together than she began to make her inquiries What has that man been saying to you she demanded Florence was at once offended by hearing her lover so spoken of and could not simply tell the story of Harry s successful courtship as she had intended Mamma she said why do you speak of him like that Because he is a scamp No he is no scamp It is very unkind of you to speak in such terms of one whom you know is very dear to me I do not know it He ought not to be dear to you at all You have been for years intended for another purpose This was intolerable to Florence this idea that she should have been considered as capable of being intended for the purposes of other people And a resolution at once was formed in her mind that she would let her mother know that such intentions were futile But for the moment she sat silent A journey home at twelve o clock at night in a fly was not the time for the expression of her resolution I say he is a scamp said missus Mountjoy During all these inquiries that have been made after your cousin he has known all about it He has not known all about it said Florence You contradict me in a very impertinent manner and cannot be acquainted with the circumstances The last person who saw your cousin in London was mister Henry Annesley and yet he has not said a word about it while search was being made on all sides And he saw him under circumstances most suspicious in their nature so suspicious as to have made the police arrest him if they were aware of them He had at that moment grossly insulted Captain Scarborough No mamma no it was not so How do you know how can you tell I do know and I can tell The ill usage had come from the other side Then you too have known the secret and have said nothing about it You too have been aware of the violence which took place at that midnight meeting You have been aware of what befell your cousin the man to whom you were all but engaged And you have held your tongue at the instigation no doubt of mister Henry Annesley Oh Florence you also will find yourself in the hands of the policeman At this moment the fly drew up at the door of the house in Montpelier Place and the two ladies had to get out and walk up the steps into the hall where they were congratulated on their early return from the party by the lady s maid Mamma I will go to bed said Florence as soon as she reached her mother s room I think you had better my dear though Heaven knows what disturbances there may be during the night By this missus Mountjoy had intended to imply that Prodgers the policeman might probably lose not a moment more before he would at once proceed to arrest Miss Mountjoy for the steps she had taken in regard to the disappearance of Captain Scarborough She had heard from Harry Annesley the fact that he had been brutally attacked by the captain in the middle of the night in the streets of London and for this in accordance with her mother s theory she was to be dragged out of bed by a constable and that probably before the next morning should have come There was something in this so ludicrous as regarded the truth of the story and yet so cruel as coming from her mother that Florence hardly knew whether to cry or laugh as she laid her head upon the pillow But in the morning as she was thinking that the facts of her own position had still to be explained to her mother that it would be necessary that she should declare her purpose and the impossibility of change now that she had once pledged herself to her lover missus Mountjoy came into the room and stood at her bedside with that appearance of ghostly displeasure which always belongs to an angry old lady in a night cap Well mamma Florence there must be an understanding between us I hope so I thought there always had been I am sure mamma you have known that I have never liked Captain Scarborough so as to become his wife and I think you have known that I have liked Harry Annesley Likings are all fiddlesticks No mamma or if you object to the word I will say love You have known that I have not loved my cousin and that I have loved this other man That is not nonsense that at any rate is a stern reality if there be anything real in the world Stern you may well call it stern I mean unbending strong not to be overcome by outside circumstances If mister Annesley had not spoken to me as he did last night could never have so spoken to me I should have been a miserable girl but my love for him would have been just as stern I should have remained and thought of it and have been unhappy through my whole life But he has spoken and I am exultant That is what I mean by stern All that is most important at any rate to me I am here now to tell you that it is impossible Very well mamma Then things must go on and we must bide our time It is proper that I should tell you that he has disgraced himself Never I will not admit it You do not know the circumstances exclaimed Florence It is most impertinent in you to pretend that you know them better than I do said her mother indignantly The story was told to me by himself Yes and therefore told untruly I grieve that you should think so of him mamma but I cannot help it Where you have got your information I cannot tell But that mine has been accurately told to me I feel certain At any rate my duty is to look after you and to keep you from harm I can only do my duty to the best of my ability mister Annesley is to my thinking a most objectionable young man and he will I believe be in the hands of the police before long Evidence will have to be given in which your name will unfortunately be mentioned Why my name It is not probable that he will keep it a secret when cross questioned as to his having divulged the story to some one He will declare that he has told it to you When that time shall come it will be well that we should be out of the country I propose to start from here on this day week Uncle Magnus will not be able to have us then We must loiter away our time on the road I look upon it as quite imperative that we shall both be out of England within eight days time of this But where will you go Never mind I do not know that I have as yet quite made up my mind But you may understand that we shall start from Cheltenham this day week Baker will go with us and I shall leave the other two servants in charge of the house I cannot tell you anything farther as yet except that I will never consent to your marriage with mister Henry Annesley You had better know that for certain and then there will be less cause for unhappiness between us So saying the angry ghost with the night cap on stalked out of the room It need hardly be explained that missus Mountjoy s information respecting the scene in London had come to her from Augustus Scarborough When he told her that Annesley had been the last in London to see his brother Mountjoy and had described the nature of the scene that had occurred between them he had no doubt forgotten that he himself had subsequently seen his brother In the story as he had told it there was no need to mention himself no necessity for such a character in making up the tragedy of that night No doubt according to his idea the two had been alone together Harry had struck the blow by which his brother had been injured and had then left him in the street Mountjoy had subsequently disappeared and Harry had told to no one that such an encounter had taken place This had been the meaning of Augustus Scarborough when he informed his aunt that Harry had been the last who had seen Mountjoy before his disappearance To missus Mountjoy the fact had been most injurious to Harry s character Harry had wilfully kept the secret while all the world was at work looking for Mountjoy Scarborough and as far as missus Mountjoy could understand it might well be that Harry had struck the fatal blow that had sent her nephew to his long account All the impossibilities in the case had not dawned upon her It had not occurred to her that Mountjoy could not have been killed and his body made away with without some great effort in the performance of which the scamp would hardly have risked his life or his character But the scamp was certainly a scamp even though he might not be a murderer or he would have revealed the secret In fact missus Mountjoy believed in the matter exactly what Augustus had intended and so believing had resolved that her daughter should suffer any purgatory rather than become Harry s wife But her daughter made her resolutions exactly in the contrary direction She in truth did know what had been done on that night while her mother was in ignorance The extent of her mother s ignorance she understood but she did not at all know where her mother had got her information She felt that Harry s secret was in hands other than he had intended and that some one must have spoken of the scene It occurred to Florence at the moment that this must have come from Mountjoy himself whom she believed and rightly believed to have been the only second person present on the occasion And if he had told it to any one then must that any one know where and how he had disappeared And the information must have been given to her mother solely with the view of damaging Harry s character and of preventing Harry s marriage Thinking of all this Florence felt that a premeditated and foul attempt for as she turned it in her mind the attempt seemed to be very foul was being made to injure Harry A false accusation was brought against him and was grounded on a misrepresentation of the truth in such a manner as to subvert it altogether to Harry s injury It should have no effect upon her To this determination she came at once and declared to herself solemnly that she would be true to it An attempt was made to undermine him in her estimation but they who made it had not known her character She was sure of herself now within her own bosom that she was bound in a peculiar way to be more than ordinarily true to Harry Annesley In such an emergency she ought to do for Harry Annesley more than a girl in common circumstances would be justified in doing for her lover Harry was maligned ill used and slandered Her mother had been induced to call him a scamp and to give as her reason for doing so an account of a transaction which was altogether false though she no doubt had believed it to be true As she thought of all this she resolved that it was her duty to write to her lover and tell him the story as she had heard it It might be most necessary that he should know the truth She would write her letter and post it so that it should be altogether beyond her mother s control and then would tell her mother that she had written it She at first thought that she would keep a copy of the letter and show it to her mother But when it was written those first words intended for a lover s eyes which had ever been produced by her pen she found that she could not subject those very words to her mother s hard judgment Her letter was as follows DEAR HARRY You will be much surprised at receiving a letter from me so soon after our meeting last night But I warn you that you must not take it amiss I should not write now were it not that I think it may be for your interest that I should do so I do not write to say a word about my love of which I think you may be assured without any letter I told mamma last night what had occurred between us and she of course was very angry You will understand that knowing how anxious she has been on behalf of my cousin Mountjoy She has always taken his part and I think it does mamma great honor not to throw him over now that he is in trouble I should never have thrown him over in his trouble had I ever cared for him in that way I tell you that fairly Master Harry But mamma in speaking against you which she was bound to do in supporting poor Mountjoy declared that you were the last person who had seen my cousin before his disappearance and she knew that there had been some violent struggle between you Indeed she knew all the truth as to that night except that the attack had been made by Mountjoy on you She turned the story all round declaring that you had attacked him which as you perceive gives a totally different appearance to the whole matter Somebody has told her though who it may have been I cannot guess but somebody has been endeavoring to do you all the mischief he can in the matter and has made mamma think evil of you She says that after attacking him and brutally ill using him you had left him in the street and had subsequently denied all knowledge of having seen him You will perceive that somebody has been at work inventing a story to do you a mischief and I think it right that I should tell you But you must never believe that I shall believe anything to your discredit It would be to my discredit now I know that you are good and true and noble and that you would not do anything so foul as this It is because I know this that I have loved you and shall always love you Let mamma and others say what they will you are now to me all the world Oh Harry Harry when I think of it how serious it seems to me and yet how joyful I exult in you and will do so let them say what they may against you You will be sure of that always Will you not be sure of it But you must not write a line in answer not even to give me your assurance That must come when we shall meet at length say after a dozen years or so I shall tell mamma of this letter which circumstances seem to demand and shall assure her that you will write no answer to it Oh Harry you will understand all that I might say of my feelings in regard to you Your own FLORENCE This letter when she had written it and copied it fair and posted the copy in the pillar box close by she found that she could not in any way show absolutely to her mother In spite of all her efforts it had become a love letter And what genuine love letter can a girl show even to her mother But she at once told her of what she had done Mamma I have written a letter to Harry Annesley You have Yes mamma I have thought it right to tell him what you had heard about that night And you have done this without my permission without even telling me what you were going to do If I had asked you you would have told me not Of course I should have told you not Good gracious has it come to this that you correspond with a young gentleman without my leave and when you know that I would not have given it Mamma in this instance it was necessary Who was to judge of that If he is to be my husband But he is not to be your husband You are never to speak to him again You shall never be allowed to meet him you shall be taken abroad and there you shall remain and he shall hear nothing about you If he attempts to correspond with you He will not How do you know I have told him not to write Told him indeed Much he will mind such telling I shall give your Uncle Magnus a full account of it all and ask for his advice He is a man in a high position and perhaps you may think fit to obey him although you utterly refuse to be guided in any way by your mother Then the conversation for the moment came to an end But Florence as she left her mother assured herself that she could not promise any close obedience in any such matters to Sir Magnus CHAPTER XIV THEY ARRIVE IN BRUSSELS For some weeks after the party at missus Armitage s house and the subsequent explanations with her mother Florence was made to suffer many things First came the one week before they started which was perhaps the worst of all This was specially embittered by the fact that missus Mountjoy absolutely refused to divulge her plans as they were made There was still a fortnight before she could be received at Brussels and as to that fortnight she would tell nothing Her knowledge of human nature probably went so far as to teach her that she could thus most torment her daughter It was not that she wished to torment her in a revengeful spirit She was quite sure within her own bosom that she did all in love She was devoted to her daughter But she was thwarted and therefore told herself that she could best farther the girl s interests by tormenting her It was not meditated revenge but that revenge which springs up without any meditation and is often therefore the most bitter I must bring her nose to the grindstone was the manner in which she would have probably expressed her thoughts to herself Consequently Florence s nose was brought to the grindstone and the operation made her miserable She would not however complain when she had discovered what her mother was doing She asked such questions as appeared to be natural and put up with replies which purposely withheld all information Mamma have you not settled on what day we shall start No my dear Mamma where are we going I cannot tell you as yet I am by no means sure myself I shall be glad to know mamma what I am to pack up for use on the journey Just the same as you would do on any journey Then Florence held her tongue and consoled herself with thinking of Harry Annesley At last the day came and she knew that she was to be taken to Boulogne Before this time she had received one letter from Harry full of love full of thanks just what a lover s letter ought to have been but yet she was disturbed by it It had been delivered to herself in the usual way and she might have concealed the receipt of it from her mother because the servants in the house were all on her side But this would not be in accordance with the conduct which she had arranged for herself and she told her mother It is just an acknowledgment of mine to him It was to have been expected but I regret it I do not ask to see it said missus Mountjoy angrily I could not show it you mamma though I think it right to tell you of it I do not ask to see it I tell you I never wish to hear his name again from your tongue But I knew how it would be of course I cannot allow this kind of thing to go on It must be prevented It will not go on mamma But it has gone on You tell me that he has already written Do you think it proper that you should correspond with a young man of whom I do not approve Florence endeavored to reflect whether she did think it proper or not She thought it quite proper that she should love Harry Annesley with all her heart but was not quite sure as to the correspondence At any rate you must understand continued missus Mountjoy that I will not permit it All letters while we are abroad must be brought to me and if any come from him they shall be sent back to him I do not wish to open his letters but you cannot be allowed to receive them When we are at Brussels I shall consult your uncle upon the subject I am very sorry Florence that there should be this cause of quarrel between us but it is your doing Oh mamma why should you be so hard I am hard because I will not allow you to accept a young man who has I believe behaved
7717_104491_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 very badly 
none	none	and who has got nothing of his own He is his uncle s heir We know what that may come to Mountjoy was his father s heir and nothing could be entailed more strictly than Tretton We know what entails have come to there mister Prosper will find some way of escaping from it Entails go for nothing now and I hear that he thinks so badly of his nephew that he has already quarrelled with him And he is quite a young man himself I cannot think how you can be so foolish you who declared that you are throwing your cousin over because he is no longer to have all his father s property Oh mamma that is not true Very well my dear I never allowed it to be said in my name that I was engaged to my cousin Mountjoy Very well I will never allow it to be said in my name that with my consent you are engaged to mister Henry Annesley Six or seven days after this they were settled together most uncomfortably in a hotel at Boulogne missus Mountjoy had gone there because there was no other retreat to which she could take her daughter and because she had resolved to remove her from beyond the sphere of Harry Annesley s presence She had at first thought of Ostend but it had seemed to her that Ostend was within the kingdom reigned over by Sir Magnus and that there would be some impropriety in removing from thence to the capital in which Sir Magnus was reigning It was as though you were to sojourn for three days at the park gates before you were entertained at the mansion Therefore they stayed at Boulogne and missus Mountjoy tried the bathing cold as the water was with equinoctial gales in order that there might be the appearance of a reason for her being at Boulogne And for company s sake in the hope of maintaining some fellowship with her mother Florence bathed also Mamma he has not written again said Florence coming up one day from the stand I suppose that you are impatient Why should there be a quarrel between us I am not impatient If you would only believe me it would be so much more happy for both of us You always used to believe me That was before you knew mister Harry Annesley There was something in this very aggravating something specially intended to excite angry feelings But Florence determined to forbear I think you may believe me mamma I am your own daughter and I shall not deceive you I do consider myself engaged to mister Annesley You need not tell me that But while I am living with you I will promise not to receive letters from him without your leave If one should come I will bring it to you unopened so that you may deal with it as though it had been delivered to yourself I care nothing about my uncle as to this affair What he may say cannot affect me but what you say does affect me very much I will promise neither to write nor to hear from mister Annesley for three months Will not that satisfy you missus Mountjoy would not say that it did satisfy her but she somewhat mitigated her treatment of her daughter till they arrived together at Sir Magnus s mansion They were shown through the great hall by three lackeys into an inner vestibule where they encountered the great man himself He was just then preparing to be put on to his horse and Lady Mountjoy had already gone forth in her carriage for her daily airing with the object in truth of avoiding the new comers My dear Sarah said Sir Magnus I hope I have the pleasure of seeing you and my niece very well Let me see your name is My name is Florence said the young lady so interrogated Ah yes to be sure I shall forget my own name soon If any one was to call me Magnus without the Sir I shouldn t know whom they meant Then he looked his niece in the face and it occurred to him that Anderson might not improbably desire to flirt with her Anderson was the riding attache who always accompanied him on horseback and of whom Lady Mountjoy had predicted that he would be sure to flirt with the minister s niece At that moment Anderson himself came in and some ceremony of introduction took place Anderson was a fair haired good looking young man with that thorough look of self satisfaction and conceit which attaches are much more wont to exhibit than to deserve For the work of an attache at Brussels is not of a nature to bring forth the highest order of intellect but the occupations are of a nature to make a young man feel that he is not like other young men I am so sorry that Lady Mountjoy has just gone out She did not expect you till the later train You have been staying at Boulogne What on earth made you stay at Boulogne Bathing said missus Mountjoy in a low voice Ah yes I suppose so Why did you not come to Ostend There is better bathing there and I could have done something for you What The horses ready are they I must go out and show myself or otherwise they ll all think that I am dead If I were absent from the boulevard at this time of day I should be put into the newspapers Where is missus Richards Then the two guests with their own special Baker were made over to the ministerial house keeper and Sir Magnus went forth upon his ride She s a pretty girl that niece of mine said Sir Magnus Uncommonly pretty said the attache But I believe she is engaged to some one I quite forget who but I know there is some aspirant Therefore you had better keep your toe in your pump young man I don t know that I shall keep my toe in my pump because there is another aspirant said Anderson You rather whet my ardor sir to new exploits In such circumstances one is inclined to think that the aspirant must look after himself Not that I conceive for a moment that Miss Mountjoy should ever look after me When missus Mountjoy came down to the drawing room there seemed to be quite a party collected to enjoy the hospitality of Sir Magnus but there were not in truth many more than the usual number at the board There were Lady Mountjoy and Miss Abbot and mister Anderson with mister Montgomery Arbuthnot the two attaches mister Montgomery Arbuthnot was especially proud of his name but was otherwise rather a humble young man as an attache having as yet been only three months with Sir Magnus and desirous of perfecting himself in Foreign Office manners under the tuition of mister Anderson mister Blow Secretary of Legation was not there He was a married man of austere manners who to tell the truth looked down from a considerable height as regarded Foreign Office knowledge upon his chief It was mister Blow who did the grinding on behalf of the Belgian Legation and who sometimes did not hesitate to let it be known that such was the fact Neither he nor missus Blow was popular at the Embassy or it may perhaps be said with more truth that the Embassy was not popular with mister and missus Blow It may be stated also that there was a clerk attached to the establishment mister Bunderdown who had been there for some years and who was good naturedly regarded by the English inhabitants as a third attache mister Montgomery Arbuthnot did his best to let it be understood that this was a mistake In the small affairs of the legation which no doubt did not go beyond the legation mister Bunderdown generally sided with mister Blow mister Montgomery Arbuthnot was recognized as a second mounted attache though his attendance on the boulevard was not as constant as that of mister Anderson in consequence probably of the fact that he had not a horse of his own But there were others also present There were Sir Thomas Tresham with his wife who had been sent over to inquire into the iron trade of Belgium He was a learned free trader who could not be got to agree with the old familiar views of Sir Magnus who thought that the more iron that was produced in Belgium the less would be forthcoming from England But Sir Thomas knew better and as Sir Magnus was quite unable to hold his own with the political economist he gave him many dinners and was civil to his wife Sir Thomas no doubt felt that in doing so Sir Magnus did all that could be expected from him Lady Tresham was a quiet little woman who could endure to be patronized by Lady Mountjoy without annoyance And there was M Grascour from the Belgian Foreign Office who spoke English so much better than the other gentlemen present that a stranger might have supposed him to be a school master whose mission it was to instruct the English Embassy in their own language Oh missus Mountjoy I am so ashamed of myself said Lady Mountjoy as she waddled into the room two minutes after the guests had been assembled She had a way of waddling that was quite her own and which they who knew her best declared that she had adopted in lieu of other graces of manner She puffed a little also and did contrive to attract peculiar attention But I have to be in my carriage every day at the same hour I don t know what would be thought of us if we were absent Then she turned with a puff and a waddle to Miss Abbot Dear Lady Tresham was with us missus Mountjoy murmured something as to her satisfaction at not having delayed the carriage party and bethought herself how exactly similar had been the excuse made by Sir Magnus himself Then Lady Mountjoy gave another little puff and assured Florence that she hoped she would find Brussels sufficiently gay not that we pretend at all to equal Paris We live at Cheltenham said Florence and that is not at all like Paris Indeed I never slept but two nights at Paris in my life Then we shall do very well at Brussels After this she waddled off again and was stopped in her waddling by Sir Magnus who sternly desired her to prepare for the august ceremony of going in to dinner The one period of real importance at the English Embassy was no doubt the daily dinner hour Florence found herself seated between mister Anderson who had taken her in and M Grascour who had performed the same ceremony for her ladyship I am sure you will like this little capital very much said M Grascour It is as much nicer than Paris as it is smaller and less pretentious Florence could only assent You will soon be able to learn something of us but in Paris you must be to the manner born or half a lifetime will not suffice We ll put you up to the time of day said mister Anderson who did not choose as he said afterward that this tidbit should be taken out of his mouth I dare say that all that I shall want will come naturally without any putting up You won t find it amiss to know a little of what s what You have not got a riding horse here Oh no said Florence I was going on to say that I can manage to secure one for you Billibong has got an excellent horse that carried the Princess of Styria last year mister Anderson was supposed to be peculiarly up to everything concerning horses But I have not got a habit That is a much more serious affair Well yes Billibong does not keep habits I wish he did But we can manage that too There does live a habit maker in Brussels Ladies habits certainly are made in Brussels said M Grascour But if Miss Mountjoy does not choose to trust a Belgian tailor there is the railway open to her An English habit can be sent Dear Lady Centaur had one sent to her only last year when she was staying here said Lady Mountjoy across her neighbor with two little puffs I shall not at all want the habit said Florence not having the horse and indeed never being accustomed to ride at all Do tell me what it is that you do do said mister Anderson with a convenient whisper when he found that M Grascour had fallen into conversation with her ladyship Lawn tennis I do play at lawn tennis though I am not wedded to it Billiards I know you play billiards I never struck a ball in my life Goodness gracious how odd Don t you ever amuse yourself at all Are they so very devotional down at Cheltenham I suppose we are stupid I don t know that I ever do especially amuse myself We must teach you we really must teach you I think I may boast of myself that I am a good instructor in that line Will you promise to put yourself into my hands You will find me a most unpromising pupil Not in the least I will undertake that when you leave this you shall be au fait at everything Leap frog is not too heavy for me and spillikins not too light I am up to them all from backgammon to a cotillon not but what I prefer the cotillon for my own taste Or leap frog perhaps suggested Florence Well yes leap frog used to be a good game at Gother School and I don t see why we shouldn t have it back again Ladies of course must have a costume on purpose But I am fond of anything that requires a costume Don t you like everything out of the common way I do Florence assured him that their tastes were wholly dissimilar as she liked everything in the common way That s what I call an uncommonly pretty girl he said afterward to M Grascour while Sir Magnus was talking to Sir Thomas What an eye Yes indeed she is very lovely My word you may say that And such a turn of the shoulders I don t say which are the best looking as a rule English or Belgians but there are very few of either to come up to her Anderson can you tell us how many tons of steel rails they turn out at Liege every week Sir Thomas asks me just as though it were the simplest question in the world Forty million said Anderson more or less Twenty thousand would perhaps be nearer the mark said M Grascour but I will send him the exact amount to morrow CHAPTER XV mister ANDERSON S LOVE Lady Mountjoy had certainly prophesied the truth when she said that mister Anderson would devote himself to Florence The first week in Brussels passed by quietly enough A young man can hardly declare his passion within a week and mister Anderson s ways in that particular were well known A certain amount of license was usually given to him both by Sir Magnus and Lady Mountjoy and when he would become remarkable by the rapidity of his changes the only adverse criticism would come generally from mister Blow Another peerless Bird of Paradise mister Blow would say If the birds were less numerous Anderson might perhaps do something But at the end of the week on this occasion even Sir Magnus perceived that Anderson was about to make himself peculiar By George he said one morning when Sir Magnus had just left the outer office which he had entered with the object of giving some instruction as to the day s ride take her altogether I never saw a girl so fit as Miss Mountjoy There was something very remarkable in this speech as according to his usual habit of life Anderson would certainly have called her Florence whereas his present appellation showed an unwonted respect What do you mean when you say that a young lady is fit said mister Blow I mean that she is right all round which is a great deal more than can be said of most of them The divine Florence began mister Montgomery Arbuthnot struggling to say something funny Young man you had better hold your tongue and not talk of young ladies in that language I do believe that he is going to fall in love said mister Blow I say that Miss Mountjoy is the fittest girl I have seen for many a day and when a young puppy calls her the divine Florence he does not know what he is about Why didn t you blow mister Blow up when he called her a Bird of Paradise said Montgomery Arbuthnot Divine Florence is not half so disrespectful of a young lady as Bird of Paradise Divine Florence means divine Florence but Bird of Paradise is chaff mister Blow as a married man said Anderson has a certain freedom allowed him If he uses it in bad taste the evil falls back upon his own head Now if you please we ll change the conversation From this it will be seen that mister Anderson had really fallen in love with Miss Mountjoy But though the week had passed in a harmless way to Sir Magnus and Lady Mountjoy in a harmless way to them as regarded their niece and their attache a certain amount of annoyance had no doubt been felt by Florence herself Though mister Anderson s expressions of admiration had been more subdued than usual though he had endeavored to whisper his love rather than to talk it out loud still the admiration had been both visible and audible and especially so to Florence herself It was nothing to Sir Magnus with whom his attache flirted Anderson was the younger son of a baronet who had a sickly elder brother and some fortune of his own If he chose to marry the girl that would be well for her and if not it would be quite well that the young people should amuse themselves He expected Anderson to help to put him on his horse and to ride with him at the appointed hour He in return gave Anderson his dinner and as much wine as he chose to drink They were both satisfied with each other and Sir Magnus did not choose to interfere with the young man s amusements But Florence did not like being the subject of a young man s love making and complained to her mother Now it had come to pass that not a word had been said as to Harry Annesley since the mother and daughter had reached Brussels missus Mountjoy had declared that she would consult her brother in law in that difficulty but no such consultation had as yet taken place Indeed Florence would not have found her sojourn at Brussels to be unpleasant were it not for mister Anderson s unpalatable little whispers She had taken them as jokes as long as she had been able to do so but was now at last driven to perceive that other people would not do so Mamma she said don t you think that that mister Anderson is an odious young man No my dear by no means What is there odious about him He is very lively he is the second son of Sir Gregory Anderson and has very comfortable means of his own Oh mamma what does that signify Well my dear it does signify In the first place he is a gentleman and in the next has a right to make himself attentive to any young lady in your position I don t say anything more I am not particularly wedded to mister Anderson If he were to come to me and ask for my permission to address you I should simply refer him to yourself by which I should mean to imply that if he could contrive to recommend himself to you I should not refuse my sanction Then the subject for that moment dropped but Florence was astonished to find that her mother could talk about it not only without reference to Harry Annesley but also without an apparent thought of Mountjoy Scarborough and it was distressing to her to think that her mother should pretend to feel that she her own daughter should be free to receive the advances of another suitor As she reflected it came across her mind that Harry was so odious that her mother would have been willing to accept on her behalf any suitor who presented himself even though her daughter in accepting him should have proved herself to be heartless Any alternative would have been better to her mother than that choice to which Florence had determined to devote her whole life Mamma she said going back to the subject on the next day if I am to stay here for three weeks longer Yes my dear you are to stay here for three weeks longer Then somebody must say something to mister Anderson I do not see who can say it but you yourself As far as I can see he has not misbehaved I wish you would speak to my uncle What am I to tell him That I am engaged He would ask me to whom and I cannot tell him I should then be driven to put the whole case in his hands and to ask his advice You do not suppose that I am going to say that you are engaged to marry that odious young man All the world knows how atrociously badly he has behaved to your own cousin He left him lying for dead in the street by a blow from his own hand and though from that day to this nothing has been heard of Mountjoy nothing is known to the police of what may have been his fate even stranger he may have perished under the usage which he received yet mister Annesley has not thought it right to say a word of what had occurred He has not dared even to tell an inspector of police the events of that night And the young man was your own cousin to whom you were known to have been promised for the last two years No no said Florence I say that it was so You were promised to your cousin Mountjoy Scarborough Not with my own consent All your friends your natural friends knew that it was to be so And now you expect me to take by the hand this young man who has almost been his murderer No mamma it is not true You do not know the circumstances and you assert things which are directly at variance with the truth From whom do you get your information From the young man himself Is that likely to be true What would Sir Magnus say as to that were I to tell him I do not know what he would say but I do know what is the truth And can you think it possible that I should now be willing to accept this foolish young man in order thus to put an end to my embarrassments Then she left her mother s room and retreating to her own sat for a couple of hours thinking partly in anger and partly in grief of the troubles of her situation Her mother had now in truth frightened her as to Harry s position She did begin to see what men might say of him and the way in which they might speak of his silence though she was resolved to be as true to him in her faith as ever Some exertion of spirit would indeed be necessary She was beginning to understand in what way the outside world might talk of Harry Annesley of the man to whom she had given herself and her whole heart Then her mother was right And as she thought of it she began to justify her mother It was natural that her mother should believe the story which had been told to her let it have come from where it might There was in her mind some suspicion of the truth She acknowledged a great animosity to her cousin Augustus and regarded him as one of the causes of her unhappiness But she knew nothing of the real facts she did not even suspect that Augustus had seen his brother after Harry had dealt with him or that he was responsible for his brother s absence But she knew that she disliked him and in some way she connected his name with Harry s misfortune Of one thing she was certain let them the Mountjoys and Prospers and the rest of the world think and say what they would of Harry she would be true to him She could understand that his character might be made to suffer but it should not suffer in her estimation Or rather let it suffer ever so that should not affect her love and her truth She did not say this to herself By saying it even to herself she would have committed some default of truth She did not whisper it even to her own heart But within her heart there was a feeling that let Harry be right or wrong in what he had done even let it be proved to the satisfaction of all the world that he had sinned grievously when he had left the man stunned and bleeding on the pavement for to such details her mother s story had gone still to her he should be braver more noble more manly more worthy of being loved than was any other man She perceiving the difficulties that were in store for her and looking forward to the misfortune under which Harry might be placed declared to herself that he should at least have one friend who would be true to him Miss Mountjoy I have come to you with a message from your aunt This was said three or four days after the conversation between Florence and her mother by mister Anderson who had contrived to follow the young lady into a small drawing room after luncheon What was the nature of the message it is not necessary for us to know We may be sure that it had been manufactured by mister Anderson for the occasion He had looked about and spied and had discovered that Miss Mountjoy was alone in the little room And in thus spying we consider him to have been perfectly justified His business at the moment was that of making love a business which is allowed to override all other considerations Even the making an office copy of a report made by mister Blow for the signature of Sir Magnus might according to our view of life have been properly laid aside for such a purpose When a young man has it in him to make love to a young lady and is earnest in his intention no duty however paramount should be held as a restraint Such was mister Anderson s intention at the present moment and therefore we think that he was justified in concocting a message from Lady Mountjoy The business of love making warrants any concoction to which the lover may resort But oh Miss Mountjoy I am so glad to have a moment in which I can find you alone It must be understood that the amorous young gentleman had not yet been acquainted with the young lady for quite a fortnight I was just about to go up stairs to my mother said Florence rising to leave the room Oh bother your mother I beg her pardon and yours I really didn t mean it There is such a lot of chaff going on in that outer room that a fellow falls into the way of it whether he likes it or no My mother won t mind it at all but I really must go Oh no I am sure you can wait for five minutes I don t want to keep you for more than five minutes But it is so hard for a fellow to get an opportunity to say a few words What words can you want to say to me mister Anderson This she said with a look of great surprise as though utterly unable to imagine what was to follow Well I did hope that you might have some idea of what my feelings are Not in the least Haven t you now I suppose I am bound to believe you though I doubt whether I quite do Pray excuse me for saying this but it is best to be open Florence felt that he ought to be excused for doubting her as she did know very well what was coming I I Come then I love you If I were to go on beating about the bush for twelve months I could only come to the same conclusion Perhaps you might then have considered it better Not in the least Fancy considering such a thing as that for twelve months before you speak of it I couldn t do it not for twelve days So I perceive mister Anderson Well isn t it best to speak the truth when you re quite sure of it If I were to remain dumb for three months how should I know but what some one else might come in the way But you can t expect that I should be so sudden That s just where it is Of course I don t And yet girls have to be sudden too Have they They re expected to be ready with their answer as soon as they re asked I don t say this by way of impertinence but merely to show that I have some justification Of course if you like to say that you must take a week to think of it I am prepared for that Only let me tell my own story first You shall tell your own story mister Anderson but I am afraid that it can be to no purpose Don t say that pray don t say that but do let me tell it Then he paused but as she remained silent after a moment he resumed the eloquence of his appeal By George Miss Mountjoy I have been so struck of a heap that I do not know whether I am standing on my head or my heels You have knocked me so completely off my pins that I am not at all like the same person Sir Magnus himself says that he never saw such a difference I only say that to show that I am quite in earnest Now I am not quite like a fellow that has no business to fall in love with a girl I have four hundred a year besides my place in the Foreign Office And then of course there are chances In this he alluded to his brother s failing health of which he could not explain the details to Miss Mountjoy on the present occasion I don t mean to say that this is very splendid or that it is half what I should like to lay at your feet But a competence is comfortable Money has nothing to do with it mister Anderson What then Perhaps it is that you don t like a fellow What girls generally do like is devotion and by George you d have that The very ground that you tread upon is sweet to me For beauty I don t know how it is but to my taste there is no one I ever saw at all like you You fit me well as though you were made for me I know that another fellow might say it a deal better but no one more truly Miss Mountjoy I love you with all my heart and I want you to be my wife Now you ve got it He had not pleaded his cause badly and so Florence felt That he had pleaded it hopelessly was a matter of course But he had given rise to feelings of gentle regard rather than of anger He had been honest and had contrived to make her believe him He did not come up to her ideal of what a lover should be but he was nearer to it than Mountjoy Scarborough He had touched her so closely that she determined at once to tell him the truth thinking that she might best in this way put an end to his passion forever mister Anderson she said though I have known it to be vain I have thought it best to listen to you because you asked it I am sure I am awfully obliged to you And I ought to thank you for the kind feeling you have expressed to me Indeed I do thank you I believe every word you have said It is better to show my confidence in your truth than to pretend to the humility of thinking you untrue It is true it is true every word of it But I am engaged Then it was sad to see the thorough change which came over the young man s face Of course a girl does not talk of her own little affairs to strangers or I would let you have known this before so as to have prevented it But in truth I am engaged Does Sir Magnus know it or Lady Mountjoy I should think not Does your mother Now you are taking advantage of my confidence and pressing your questions too closely But my mother does know of it I will tell you more she does not approve of it But it is fixed in Heaven itself It may well be that I shall never be able to marry the gentleman to whom I allude but most certainly I shall marry no one else I have told you this because it seems to be necessary to your welfare so that you may get over this passing feeling It is no passing feeling said Anderson with some tragic grandeur At any rate you have now my story and remember that it is trusted to you as a gentleman I have told it you for a purpose Then she walked out of the room leaving the poor young man in temporary despair CHAPTER XVI mister AND MISS GREY It was now the middle of October and it may be said that from the time in which old mister Scarborough had declared his intention of showing that the elder of his sons had no right to the property mister Grey the lawyer had been so occupied with the Scarborough affairs as to have had left him hardly a moment for other considerations He had a partner who during these four months had in fact carried on the business One difficulty had grown out of another till mister Grey s whole time had been occupied and all his thoughts had been filled with mister Scarborough which is a matter of much greater moment to a man than the loss of his time The question of Mountjoy Scarborough s position had been first submitted to him in June October had now been reached and mister Grey had been out of town only for a fortnight during which fortnight he had been occupied entirely in unravelling the mystery He had at first refused altogether to have anything to do with the unravelling and had desired that some other lawyer might be employed But it had gradually come to pass that he had entered heart and soul into the case and with many execrations on his own part against mister Scarborough could find a real interest in nothing else He had begun his investigations with a thorough wish to discover that Mountjoy Scarborough was in truth the heir Though he had never loved the young man and as he went on with his investigations became aware that the whole property would go to the creditors should he succeed in proving that Mountjoy was the heir yet for the sake of abstract honesty he was most anxious that it should be so And he could not bear to think that he and other lawyers had been taken in by the wily craft of such a man as the Squire of Tretton It went thoroughly against the grain with him to have to acknowledge that the estate would become the property of Augustus But it was so and he did acknowledge it It was proved to him that in spite of all the evidence which he had hitherto seen in the matter the squire had not married his wife until after the birth of his eldest son He did acknowledge it and he said bravely that it must be so Then there came down upon him a crowd of enemies in the guise of baffled creditors all of whom believed or professed to believe that he mister Grey was in league with the squire to rob them of their rights If it could be proved that Mountjoy had no claim to the property then would it go nominally to Augustus who according to their showing was also one of the confederates and the property could thus they said be divided Very shortly the squire would be dead and then the confederates would get everything to the utter exclusion of poor mister Tyrrwhit and poor mister Samuel Hart and all the other poor creditors who would thus be denuded defrauded and robbed by a lawyer s trick It was in this spirit that mister Grey was attacked by mister Tyrrwhit and the others and mister Grey found it very hard to bear And then there was another matter which was also very grievous to him If it were as he now stated if the squire had been guilty of this fraud to what punishment would he be subjected Mountjoy was declared to have been innocent mister Tyrrwhit as he put the case to his own lawyers laughed bitterly as he made this suggestion And Augustus was of course innocent Then there was renewed laughter And mister Grey mister Grey had of course been innocent Then the laughter was very loud Was it to be believed that anybody could be taken in by such a story as this There was he mister Tyrrwhit he had ever been known as a sharp fellow and mister Samuel Hart who was now away on his travels and the others they were all of them sharp fellows Was it to be believed that such a set of gentlemen so keenly alive to their own interest should be made the victims of such a trick as this Not if they knew it Not if mister Tyrrwhit knew it It was in this shape that the matter reached mister Grey s ears and then it was asked if it were so what would be the punishment to which they would be subjected who had defrauded mister Tyrrwhit of his just claim mister Tyrrwhit who on one occasion made his way into mister Grey s presence wished to get an answer to that question from mister Grey The man is dying said mister Grey solemnly Dying He is not more likely to die than you are from all I hear At this time rumors of mister Scarborough s improved health had reached the creditors in London mister Tyrrwhit had begun to believe that mister Scarborough s dangerous condition had been part of the hoax that there had been no surgeon s knives no terrible operations no moment of almost certain death I don t believe he s been ill at all said mister Tyrrwhit I cannot help your belief said mister Grey But because a man doesn t die and recovers is he on that account to be allowed to cheat people as he has cheated me with impunity I am not going to defend mister Scarborough but he has not in fact cheated you Who has Come do you mean to tell me that if this goes on I shall not have been defrauded of a hundred thousand pounds Did you ever see mister Scarborough on the matter No it was not necessary Or have you got his writing to any document Have you anything to show that he knew what his son was doing when he borrowed money of you Is it not perfectly clear that he knew nothing about it Of course he knew nothing about it then at that time It was afterward that his fraud began When he found that the estate was in jeopardy then the falsehood was concocted Ah there mister Tyrrwhit I can only say that I disagree with you I must express my opinion that if you endeavor to recover your money on that plea you will be beaten If you can prove fraud of that kind no doubt you can punish those who have been guilty of it me among the number I say nothing of that said mister Tyrrwhit But if you have been led into your present difficulty by an illegal attempt on the part of my client to prove an illegitimate son to have been legitimate and then to have changed his mind for certain purposes I do not see how you are to punish him The act will have been attempted and not completed And it will have been an act concerning his son and not concerning you Not concerning me shrieked mister Tyrrwhit Certainly not legally You are not in a position to prove that he knew that his son was borrowing money from you on the credit of the estate As a fact he certainly did not know it We shall see about that said mister Tyrrwhit Then you must see about it but not with my aid As a fact I am telling you all that I know about it If I could I would prove Mountjoy Scarborough to be his father s heir to morrow Indeed I am altogether on your side in the matter if you would believe it Here mister Tyrrwhit again laughed But you will not believe it and I do not ask you to do so As it is we must be opposed to each other Where is the young man asked mister Tyrrwhit Ah that is a question I am not bound to answer even if I knew It is a matter on which I say nothing You have lent him money at an exorbitant rate of interest It is not true At any rate it seems so to me and it is out of the question that I should assist you in recovering it You did it at your own peril and not on my advice Good morning mister Tyrrwhit Then mister Tyrrwhit went his way not without sundry threats as to the whole Scarborough family It was very hard upon mister Grey because he certainly was an honest man and had taken up the matter simply with a view of learning the truth It had been whispered to him within the last day or two that Mountjoy Scarborough had lately been seen alive and gambling with reckless prodigality at Monte Carlo It had only been told to him as probably true but he certainly believed it But he knew nothing of the details of his disappearance and had not been much surprised as he had never believed that the young man had been murdered or had made away with himself But he had heard before that of the quarrel in the street between him and Harry Annesley and the story had been told to him so as to fall with great discredit on Harry Annesley s head According to that story Harry Annesley had struck his foe during the night and had left him for dead upon the pavement Then Mountjoy Scarborough had been missing and Harry Annesley had told no one of the quarrel There had been some girl in question So much and no more mister Grey had heard and was of course inclined to think that Harry Annesley must have behaved very badly But of the mode of Mountjoy s subsequent escape he had heard nothing mister Grey at this time was living down at Fulham in a small old fashioned house which over looked the river and was called the Manor house He would have said that it was his custom to go home every day by an omnibus but he did in truth almost always remain at his office so late as to make it necessary that he should return by a cab He was a man fairly well to do in the world as he had no one depending on him but one daughter no one that is to say whom he was obliged to support But he had a married sister with a scapegrace husband and six daughters whom in fact he did support missus Carroll with the kindest intentions in the world had come and lived near him She had taken a genteel house in Bolsover Terrace a genteel new house on the Fulham Road about a quarter of a mile from her brother mister Grey lived in the old Manor house a small uncomfortable place which had a nook of its own close upon the water and with a lovely little lawn It was certainly most uncomfortable as a gentleman s residence but no consideration would induce mister Grey to sell it There were but two sitting rooms in it and one was for the most part uninhabited The up stairs drawing room was furnished but any one with half an eye could see that it was never used A stray caller might be shown up there but callers of that class were very uncommon in mister Grey s establishment With his own domestic arrangements mister Grey would have been quite contented had it not been for missus Carroll It was now some years since he had declared that though mister Carroll or Captain Carroll as he had then been called was an improvident worthless drunken Irishman he would never see his sister want The consequence was that Carroll had come with his wife and six daughters and taken a house close to him There are such whips and scorns in the world to which a man shall be so subject as to have the whole tenor of his life changed by them The hero bears them heroically making no complaints to those around him The common man shrinks and squeals and cringes so that he is known to those around him as one especially persecuted In this respect mister Grey was a grand hero When he spoke to his friends of missus Carroll his friends were taught to believe that his outside arrangements with his sister were perfectly comfortable No doubt there did creep out among those who were most intimate with him a knowledge that mister Carroll for the captain had in truth never been more than a lieutenant and had now long since sold out was impecunious and a trouble rather than otherwise But I doubt whether there was a single inhabitant of the neighborhood of Fulham who was aware that missus Carroll and the Miss Carrolls cost mister Grey on an average above six hundred a year There was one in mister Grey s family to whom he was so attached that he would to oblige her have thrown over the whole Carroll family but of this that one person would not hear She hated the whole Carroll family with an almost unholy hatred of which she herself was endeavoring to repent daily but in vain She could not do other than hate them but she could do other than allow her father to withdraw his fostering protection for this one person was mister Grey s only daughter and his one close domestic associate Miss Dorothy Grey was known well to all the neighborhood and was both feared and revered As we shall have much to do with her in the telling of our story it may be well to make her stand plainly before the reader s eyes In the first place it must be understood that she was motherless brotherless and sisterless She had been mister Grey s only child and her mother had been dead for fifteen or sixteen years She was now about thirty years of age but was generally regarded as ranging somewhere between forty and fifty If she isn t nearer fifty than forty I ll eat my old shoes said a lady in the neighborhood to a gentleman I ve known her these twenty years and she s not altered in the least As Dolly Grey had been only ten twenty years ago the lady must have been wrong But it is singular how a person s memory of things may be created out of their present appearances Dorothy herself had apparently no desire to set right this erroneous opinion which the neighborhood entertained respecting her She did not seem to care whether she was supposed to be thirty or forty or fifty Of youth as a means of getting lovers she entertained a profound contempt That no lover would ever come she was assured and would not at all have known what to do with one had he come The only man for whom she had ever felt the slightest regard was her father For some women about she did entertain a passionless well regulated affection but they were generally the poor the afflicted or the aged It was however always necessary that the person so signalized should be submissive Now missus Carroll mister Grey s sister had long since shown that she was not submissive enough nor were the girls the eldest of whom was a pert ugly well grown minx now about eighteen years old The second sister who was seventeen was supposed to be a beauty but which of the two was the more odious in the eyes of their cousin it would be impossible to say Miss Dorothy Grey was Dolly only to her father Had any one else so ventured to call her she would have started up at once the outraged aged female of fifty Even her aunt who was trouble enough to her felt that it could not be so Her uncle tried it once and she declined to come into his presence for a month letting it be fully understood that she had been insulted And yet she was not according to my idea by any means an ill favored young woman It is true that she wore spectacles and as she always desired to have her eyes about with her she never put them off when out of bed But how many German girls do the like and are not accounted for that reason to be plain She was tall and well made we may almost say robust She had the full use of all her limbs and was never ashamed of using them I think she was wrong when she would be seen to wheel the barrow about the garden and that her hands must have suffered in her attempts to live down the conventional absurdities of the world It is true that she did wear gloves during her gardening but she wore them only in obedience to her father s request She had bright eyes somewhat far apart and well made wholesome regular features Her nose was large and her mouth was large but they were singularly intelligent and full of humor when she was pleased in conversation As to her hair she was too indifferent to enable one to say that it was attractive but it was smoothed twice a day was very copious and always very clean Indeed for cleanliness from head to foot she was a model She is very clean but then it s second to nothing to her had said a sarcastic old lady who had meant to imply that Miss Dorothy Grey was not constant at church But the sarcastic old lady had known nothing about it Dorothy Grey never stayed away from morning church unless her presence was desired by her father and for once or twice that she might do so she would take her father with her three or four times against the grain with him it must be acknowledged But the most singular attribute of the lady s appearance has still to be mentioned She always wore a slouch hat which from motives of propriety she called her bonnet which gave her a singular appearance as though it had been put on to thatch her entirely from the weather It was made generally of black straw and was round equal at all points of the circle and was fastened with broad brown ribbons It was supposed in the neighborhood to be completely weather tight The unimaginative nature of Fulham did not allow the Fulham mind to gather in the fact that at the same time she might possess two or three such hats But they were undoubtedly precisely similar and she would wear them in London with exactly the same indifference as in the comparatively rural neighborhood of her own residence She would in truth go up and down in the omnibus and would do so alone without the slightest regard to the opinion of any of her neighbors The Carroll girls would laugh at her behind her back but no Carroll girl had been seen ever to smile before her face instigated to do so by their cousin s vagaries But I have not yet mentioned that attribute of Miss Grey s which is perhaps the most essential in her character It is necessary at any rate that they should know it who wish to understand her nature When it had once been brought home to her that duty required her to do this thing or the other or to say this word or another the thing would be done or the word said let the result be what it might Even to the displeasure of her father the word was said or the thing was done Such a one was Dolly Grey CHAPTER XVII mister GREY DINES AT HOME mister Grey returned home in a cab on the day of mister Tyrrwhit s visit not in the happiest humor Though he had got the best of mister Tyrrwhit in the conversation still the meeting which had been protracted had annoyed him mister Tyrrwhit had made accusations against himself personally which he knew to be false but which having been covered up and not expressed exactly he had been unable to refute A man shall tell you you are a thief and a scoundrel in such a manner as to make it impossible for you to take him by the throat You of course are not a thief and a scoundrel he shall say to you but shall say it in such a tone of voice as to make you understand that he conceives you to be both We all know the parliamentary mode of giving an opponent the lie so as to make it impossible that the Speaker shall interfere mister Tyrrwhit had treated mister Grey in the same fashion and as mister Grey was irritable thin skinned and irascible and as he would brood over things of which it was quite unnecessary that a lawyer should take any cognizance he went back home an unhappy man Indeed the whole Scarborough affair had been from first to last a great trouble to him The work which he was now performing could not he imagined be put into his bill To that he was supremely indifferent but his younger partner thought it a little hard that all the other work of the firm should be thrown on his shoulders during the period which naturally would have been his holidays and he did make his feelings intelligible to mister Grey mister Grey who was essentially a just man saw that his partner was right and made offers but he would not accede to the only proposition which his partner made Let him go and look for a lawyer elsewhere said his partner They both of them knew that mister Scarborough had been thoroughly dishonest but he had been an old client His father before him had been a client of mister Grey s father It was not in accordance with mister Grey s theory to treat the old man after this fashion And he had taken intense interest in the matter He had first of all been quite sure that Mountjoy Scarborough was the heir and though Mountjoy Scarborough was not at all to his taste he had been prepared to fight for him He had now assured himself after most laborious inquiry that Augustus Scarborough was the heir and although in the course of the business he had come to hate the cautious money loving Augustus twice worse than the gambling spendthrift Mountjoy still in the cause of honesty and truth and justice he fought for Augustus against the world at large and against the band of creditors till the world at large and the band of creditors began to think that he was leagued with Augustus so as to be one of those who would make large sums of money out of the irregularity of the affair This made him cross and put him into a very bad humor as he went back to Fulham One thing must be told of mister Grey which was very much to his discredit and which if generally known would have caused his clients to think him to be unfit to be the recipient of their family secrets he told all the secrets to Dolly He was a man who could not possibly be induced to leave his business behind him at his office It made the chief subject of conversation when he was at home He would even call Dolly into his bedroom late at night bringing her out of bed for the occasion to discuss with her some point of legal strategy of legal but still honest strategy which had just occurred to him Maybe he had not quite seen his way as to the honesty and wanted Dolly s opinion on the subject Dolly would come in in her dressing gown and sitting on his bed would discuss the matter with him as advocate against the devil Sometimes she would be convinced more frequently she would hold her own But the points which were discussed in that way and the strength of argumentation which was used on either side would have surprised the clients and the partner and the clerks and the eloquent barrister who was occasionally employed to support this side or the other The eloquent barrister or it might be the client himself startled sometimes at the amount of enthusiasm which mister Grey would throw into his argument would little dream that the very words had come from the young lady in her dressing gown To tell the truth Miss Grey thoroughly liked these discussions whether held on the lawn or in the dining room arm chairs or during the silent hours of the night They formed indeed the very salt of her life She felt herself to be the Conscience of the firm Her father was the Reason And the partner in her own phraseology was the Devil For it must be understood that Dolly Grey had a spice of fun about her of which her father had the full advantage She would not have called her father s partner the Devil to any other ear but her father s And that her father knew understanding also the spirit in which the sobriquet had been applied He did not think that his partner was worse than another man nor did he think that his daughter so thought The partner whose name was Barry was a man of average honesty who would occasionally be surprised at the searching justness with which mister Grey would look into a matter after it had been already debated for a day or two in the office But mister Barry though he had the pleasure of Miss Grey s acquaintance had no idea of the nature of the duties which she performed in the firm I m nearly broken hearted about this abominable business said mister Grey as he went upstairs to his dressing room The normal hour for dinner was half past six He had arrived on this occasion at half past seven and had paid a shilling extra to the cabman to drive him quick The man having a lame horse had come very slowly fidgeting mister Grey into additional temporary discomfort He had got his additional shilling and mister Grey had only additional discomfort I declare I think he is the wickedest old man the world ever produced This he said as Dolly followed him upstairs but Dolly wiser than her father would say nothing about the wicked old man in the servants hearing In five minutes mister Grey came down dressed by the use of which word was implied the fact that he had shaken his neckcloth washed his hands and face and put on his slippers It was understood in the household that though half past six was the hour named for dinner half past seven was a much more probable time mister Grey pertinaciously refused to have it changed Stare super vias antiquas he had stoutly said when the proposition had been made to him by which he had intended to imply that as during the last twenty years he had been compelled to dine at half past six instead of six he did not mean to be driven any farther in the same direction Consequently his cook was compelled to prepare his dinner in such a manner that it might be eaten at one hour or the other as chance would have it The dinner passed without much conversation other than incidental to mister Grey s wants and comforts His daughter knew that he had been at the office for eight hours and knew also that he was not a young man Every kind of little cosseting was therefore applied to him There was a pheasant for dinner and it was essentially necessary in Dolly s opinion that he should have first the wing quite hot and then the leg also hot and that the bread sauce should be quite hot on the two occasions For herself if she had had an old crow for dinner it would have been the same thing Tea and bread and butter were her luxuries and her tea and bread and butter had been enjoyed three hours ago I declare I think that after all the leg is the better joint of the two Then why don t you have the two legs There would be a savor of greediness in that though I know that the leg will go down and I shouldn t then be able to draw the comparison I like to have them both and I like always to be able to assert my opinion that the leg is the better joint Now how about the apple pudding You said I should have an apple pudding From which it appeared that mister Grey was not superior to having the dinner discussed in his presence at the breakfast table The apple pudding came and was apparently enjoyed A large portion of it was put between two plates That s for missus Grimes suggested mister Grey I am not quite sure that missus Grimes is worthy of it If you knew what it was to be left without a shilling of your husband s wages you d think yourself worthy When the conversation about the pudding was over mister Grey ate his cheese and then sat quite still in his arm chair over the fire while the things were being taken away I declare I think he is the wickedest man the world has ever produced said mister Grey as soon as the door was shut thus showing by the repetition of the words he had before used that his mind had been intent on mister Scarborough rather than on the pheasant Why don t you have done with them That s all very well but you wouldn t have done with them if you had known them all your life I wouldn t spend my time and energies in white washing any rascal said Dolly with vigor You don t know what you d do And a man isn t to be left in the lurch altogether because he s a rascal Would you have a murderer hanged without some one to stand up for him Yes I would said Dolly thoughtlessly And he mightn t have been a murderer after all or not legally so which as far as the law goes is the same thing But this special question had been often discussed between them and mister Grey and Dolly did not intend to be carried away by it on the present occasion I know all about that she said but this isn t a case of life and death The old man is only anxious to save his property and throws upon you all the burden of doing it He never agrees with you as to anything you say As to legal points he does But he keeps you always in hot water and puts forward so much villany that I would have nothing farther to do with him He has been so crafty that you hardly know now which is in truth the heir Oh yes I do said the lawyer I know very well and am very sorry that it should be so And I cannot but feel for the rascal because the dishonest effort was made on behalf of his own son Why was it necessary said Dolly with sparks flying from her eye Throughout from the beginning he has been bad Why was the woman not his wife Ah why indeed But had his sin consisted only in that I should not have dreamed of refusing my assistance as a family lawyer All that would have gone for nothing then When evil creeps in said Dolly sententiously you cannot put it right afterward Never mind about that We shall never get to the end if you go back to Adam and Eve People don t go back often enough Bother said mister Grey finishing his second and last glass of port wine Do keep yourself in some degree to the question in dispute In advising an attorney of to day as to how he is to treat a client you can t do any good by going back to Adam and Eve Augustus is the heir and I am bound to protect the property for him from these money lending harpies The moment the breath is out of the old man s body they will settle down upon it if we leave them an inch of ground on which to stand Every detail of his marriage must be made as clear as daylight and that must be done in the teeth of former false statements As far as I can see the money lending harpies are the honestest lot of people concerned The law is not on their side They have got no right The estate as a fact will belong to Augustus the moment his father dies mister Scarborough endeavored to do what he could for him whom he regarded as his eldest son It was very wicked He was adding a second and a worse crime to the first He was flying in the face of the laws of his country But he was successful and he threw dust into my eyes because he wanted to save the property for the boy And he endeavored to make it up to his second son by saving for him a second property He was not selfish and I cannot but feel for him But you say he is the wickedest man the world ever produced Because he boasts of it all and cannot be got in any way to repent He gives me my instructions as though from first to last he had been a highly honorable man and only laughs at me when I object And yet he must know that he may die any day He only wishes to have this matter set straight so that he may die I could forgive him altogether if he would but once say that he was sorry for what he d done But he has completely the air of the fine old head of a family who thinks he is to be put into marble the moment the breath is out of his body and that he richly deserves the marble he is to be put into That is a question between him and his God said Dolly He hasn t got a God He believes only in his own reason and is content to do so lying there on the very brink of eternity He is quite content with himself because he thinks that he has not been selfish He cares nothing that he has robbed every one all round He has no reverence for property and the laws which govern it He was born only with the life interest and he has determined to treat it as though the fee simple had belonged to him It is his utter disregard for law for what the law has decided which makes me declare him to have been the wickedest man the world ever produced It is his disregard for truth which makes you think so He cares nothing for truth He scorns it and laughs at it And yet about the little things of the world he expects his word to be taken as certainly as that of any other gentleman I would not take it Yes you would and would be right too If he would say he d pay me a hundred pounds to morrow or a thousand I would have his word as soon as any other man s bond And yet he has utterly got the better of me and made me believe that a marriage took place when there was no marriage I think I ll have a cup of tea You won t go to sleep papa Oh yes I shall When I ve been so troubled as that I must have a cup of tea mister Grey was often troubled and as a consequence Dolly was called up for consultations in the middle of the night At about one o clock there came the well known knock at Dolly s door and the usual invitation Would she come into her father s room for a few minutes Then her father trotted back to his bed and Dolly of course followed him as soon as she had clothed herself decently Why didn t you tell me I thought I had made up my mind not to go or I thought rather that I should be able to make up my mind not to go But it is possible that down there I may have some effect for good What does he want of you There is a long question about raising money with which Augustus desires to buy the silence of the creditors Could he get the money asked Dolly Yes I think he could The property at present is altogether unembarrassed To give mister Scarborough his due he has never put his name to a scrap of paper nor has he had occasion to do so The Tretton pottery people want more land or rather more water and a large sum of money will be forthcoming But he doesn t see the necessity of giving mister Tyrrwhit a penny piece or certainly mister Hart He would send them away howling without a scruple Now Augustus is anxious to settle with them for some reason which I do not clearly understand But he wishes to do so without any interference on his father s part In fact he and his father have very different ideas as to the property The squire regards it as his but Augustus thinks that any day may make it his own In fact they are on the very verge of quarrelling Then after a long debate Dolly consented that her father should go down to Tretton and act if possible the part of peace maker CHAPTER XVIII THE CARROLL FAMILY Aunt Carroll is coming to dinner to day said Dolly the next day with a serious face
7717_104491_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 I know she is 
7717_104491_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Have a nice dinner for her 
7717_104491_000003_000002	train-clean-360	I don t think she ever has a nice dinner at home 
7717_104491_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 And the three eldest girls are coming 
none	none	Three
7717_104491_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 You asked them yourself on Sunday 
none	none	Very well 
7717_104491_000007_000001	train-clean-360	They said their papa would be away on business 
7717_104491_000007_000002	train-clean-360	It was understood that mister Carroll was never asked to the Manor house 
none	none	Business There is a club he belongs to where he dines and gets drunk once a month It s the only thing he does regularly
7717_104491_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 They must have their dinner at any rate said mister Grey 
7717_104491_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t think they should suffer because he drinks 
7717_104491_000009_000002	train-clean-360	This had been a subject much discussed between them but on the present occasion Miss Grey would not renew it 
7717_104491_000009_000003	train-clean-360	She despatched her father in a cab the cab having been procured because he was supposed to be a quarter of an hour late and then went to work to order her dinner 
7717_104491_000010_000000	train-clean-360	It has been said that Miss Grey hated the Carrolls but she hated the daughters worse than the mother and of all the people she hated in the world she hated Amelia Carroll the worst 
7717_104491_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Amelia the eldest entertained an idea that she was more of a personage in the world s eyes than her cousin that she went to more parties which certainly was true if she went to any that she wore finer clothes which was also true and that she had a lover whereas Dolly Grey as she called her cousin behind her back had none 
7717_104491_000010_000002	train-clean-360	This lover had something to do with horses and had only been heard of had never been seen at the Manor house Sophy was a good deal hated also being a forward flirting tricky girl of seventeen who had just left the school at which Uncle John had paid for her education 
7717_104491_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Georgina the third was still at school under similar circumstances and was pardoned her egregious noisiness and romping propensities under the score of youth 
7717_104491_000010_000004	train-clean-360	She was sixteen and was possessed of terrible vitality 
7717_104491_000010_000005	train-clean-360	 I am sure they take after their father altogether mister Grey had once said when the three left the Manor house together 
7717_104491_000010_000006	train-clean-360	At half past six punctually they came 
7717_104491_000010_000007	train-clean-360	Dolly heard a great clatter of four people leaving their clogs and cloaks in the hall and would not move out of the unused drawing room in which for the moment she was seated 
none	none	Betsey had to prepare the dinner table down stairs and would have been sadly discomfited had she been driven to do it in the presence of three Carroll girls For it must be understood that Betsey had no greater respect for the Carroll girls than her mistress
7717_104491_000010_000010	train-clean-360	 Well Aunt Carroll how does the world use you 
none	none	Very badly You haven t been up to see me for ten days
7717_104491_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 I haven t counted but when I do come I don t often do any good 
7717_104491_000012_000001	train-clean-360	How are Minna and Brenda and Potsey 
7717_104491_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Poor Potsey has got a nasty boil under her arm 
7717_104491_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 It comes from eating too much toffy said Georgina 
7717_104491_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 I told her it would 
7717_104491_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 How very nasty you are said Miss Carroll 
7717_104491_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 Do leave the child and her ailments alone 
7717_104491_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Poor papa isn t very well either said Sophy who was supposed to be her father s pet 
7717_104491_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope his state of health will not debar him from dining with his friends to night said Miss Grey 
none	none	You have always something ill natured to say about papa said Sophy Nothing will ever keep him back when conviviality demands his presence 
7717_104491_000019_000001	train-clean-360	This came from his afflicted wife who in spite of all his misfortunes would ever speak with some respect of her husband s employments 
7717_104491_000019_000002	train-clean-360	 He wasn t at all in a fit state to go to night but he had promised and that was enough 
7717_104491_000020_000000	train-clean-360	When they had waited three quarters of an hour Amelia began to complain certainly not without reason 
7717_104491_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 I wonder why Uncle John always keeps us waiting in this way 
7717_104491_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Papa has unfortunately something to do with his time which is not altogether his own There was not much in these words but the tone in which they were uttered would have crushed any one more susceptible than Amelia Carroll 
7717_104491_000021_000001	train-clean-360	But at that moment the cab arrived and Dolly went down to meet her father 
none	none	Have they come he asked Come she answered taking his gloves and comforter from him and giving him a kiss as she did so
7717_104491_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 That girl up stairs is nearly famished 
7717_104491_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 I won t be half a moment said the repentant father hastening up stairs to go through his ordinary dressing arrangement 
7717_104491_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I wouldn t hurry for her said Dolly but of course you ll hurry You always do don t you papa Then they sat down to dinner 
7717_104491_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Well girls what is your news 
7717_104491_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 We were out to day on the Brompton Road said the eldest and there came up Prince Chitakov s drag with four roans 
none	none	Prince Chitakov 
7717_104491_000028_000001	train-clean-360	I didn t know there was such a prince 
7717_104491_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh dear yes with very stiff mustaches turned up high at the corners and pink cheeks and a very sharp nobby looking hat with a light colored grey coat and light gloves 
7717_104491_000029_000001	train-clean-360	You must know the prince 
none	none	Upon my word I never heard of him my dear 
7717_104491_000030_000001	train-clean-360	What did the prince do 
7717_104491_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 He was tooling his own drag and he had a lady with him on the box 
7717_104491_000031_000001	train-clean-360	I never saw anything more tasty than her dress dark red silk with little fluffy fur ornaments all over it 
7717_104491_000031_000002	train-clean-360	I wonder who she was 
7717_104491_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 missus Chitakov probably said the attorney 
7717_104491_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think the prince is a married man said Sophy 
none	none	They never are for the most part said Amelia and she wouldn t be missus Chitakov Uncle John Wouldn t she now What would she be Can either of you tell me what the wife of a Prince of Chitakov would call herself Princess of Chitakov of course said Sophy
7717_104491_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 It s the Princess of Wales 
7717_104491_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 But it isn t the Princess of Christian nor yet the Princess of Teck nor the Princess of England 
none	none	I don t see why the lady shouldn t be missus Chitakov if there is such a lady
7717_104491_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Papa don t bamboozle her said his daughter 
7717_104491_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 But continued the attorney why shouldn t the lady have been his wife 
7717_104491_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Don t married ladies wear little fluffy fur ornaments 
none	none	I wish John you wouldn t talk to the girls in that strain said their mother
7717_104491_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 It really isn t becoming 
none	none	To suggest that the lady was the gentleman s wife But I was going to say continued Amelia that as the prince drove by he kissed his hand he did indeed And Sophy and I were walking along as demurely as possible I never was so knocked of a heap in all my life
7717_104491_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 He did said Sophy 
7717_104491_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 It s the most impertinent thing I ever heard 
7717_104491_000043_000002	train-clean-360	If my father had seen it he d have had the prince off the box of the coach in no time 
none	none	Then my dear said the attorney I am very glad that your father did not see it Poor Dolly during this conversation about the prince sat angry and silent thinking to herself in despair of what extremes of vulgarity even a first cousin of her own could be guilty 
7717_104491_000044_000001	train-clean-360	That she should be sitting at table with a girl who could boast that a reprobate foreigner had kissed his hand to her from the box of a fashionable four horsed coach 
7717_104491_000044_000002	train-clean-360	For it was in that light that Miss Grey regarded it And did you have any farther adventures besides this memorable encounter with the prince 
7717_104491_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing nearly so interesting said Sophy 
7717_104491_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 That was hardly to be expected said the attorney 
7717_104491_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 Jane you will have a glass of port wine 
7717_104491_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Girls you must have a glass of port wine to support you after your disappointment with the prince 
7717_104491_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 We were not disappointed in the least said Amelia 
none	none	Pray pray let the subject drop said Dolly
7717_104491_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 That is because the prince did not kiss his hand to you said Sophy Then Miss Grey sunk again into silence crushed beneath this last blow 
7717_104491_000050_000000	train-clean-360	In the evening when the dinner things had been taken away a matter of business came up and took the place of the prince and his mustaches missus Carroll was most anxious to know whether her brother could lend her a small sum of twenty pounds 
none	none	It came out in conversation that the small sum was needed to satisfy some imperious demand made upon mister Carroll by a tailor
7717_104491_000050_000002	train-clean-360	 He must have clothes you know said the poor woman wailing 
none	none	He doesn t have many but he must have some There had been other appeals on the same subject made not very long since and to tell the truth mister Grey did require to have the subject argued in fear of the subsequent remarks which would be made to him afterward by his daughter if he gave the money too easily 
7717_104491_000050_000004	train-clean-360	The loan had to be arranged in full conclave as otherwise missus Carroll would have found it difficult to obtain access to her brother s ear 
7717_104491_000050_000005	train-clean-360	But the one auditor whom she feared was her niece 
7717_104491_000050_000006	train-clean-360	On the present occasion Miss Grey simply took up her book to show that the subject was one which had no interest for her but she did undoubtedly listen to all that was said on the subject There was never anything settled about poor Patrick s clothes said missus Carroll in a half whisper 
none	none	She did not care how much her own children heard and she knew how vain it was to attempt so to speak that Dolly should not hear
7717_104491_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 I dare say something ought to be done at some time said mister Grey who knew that he would be told when the evening was over that he would give away all his substance to that man if he were asked 
7717_104491_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Papa has not had a new pair of trousers this year said Sophy 
7717_104491_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Except those green ones he wore at the races said Georgina 
7717_104491_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Hold your tongue miss said her mother 
7717_104491_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 That was a pair I made up for him and sent them to the man to get pressed 
none	none	When the hundred a year was arranged for all our dresses said Amelia not a word was said about papa 
7717_104491_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Of course papa is a trouble 
none	none	I don t see that he is more of a trouble than any one else said Sophy
7717_104491_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 Uncle John would not like not to have any clothes 
none	none	No I should not my dear And his own income is all given up to the house uses Here Sophy touched imprudently on a sore subject 
7717_104491_000058_000001	train-clean-360	His own income consisted of what had been saved out of his wife s fortune and was thus named as in opposition to the larger sum paid to missus Carroll by mister Grey 
7717_104491_000058_000002	train-clean-360	There was one hundred and fifty pounds a year coming from settled property which had been preserved by the lawyer s care and which was regarded in the family as papa s own 
none	none	It certainly is essential for respectability that something should be set apart from a man s income for his wearing apparel and though the money was perhaps improperly so designated Dolly would not have objected had she not thought that it had already gone to the race course in company with the green trousers She had her own means of obtaining information as to the Carroll family 
7717_104491_000059_000002	train-clean-360	It was very necessary that she should do so if the family was to be kept on its legs at all I don t think any good can come from discussing what my uncle does with the money 
7717_104491_000059_000003	train-clean-360	This was Dolly s first speech 
7717_104491_000059_000004	train-clean-360	 If he is to have it let him have it but let him have as little as possible 
none	none	I never heard anybody so cross as you always are to papa said Sophy
7717_104491_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Your cousin Dorothy is very fortunate said missus Carroll 
7717_104491_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 She does not know what it is to want for anything 
none	none	She never spends anything on herself said her father
7717_104491_000062_000001	train-clean-360	 It is Dolly s only fault that she won t 
7717_104491_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Because she has it all done for her said Amelia 
7717_104491_000064_000000	train-clean-360	Dolly had gone back to her book and disdained to make any farther reply 
none	none	Her father felt that quite enough had been said about it and was prepared to give the twenty pounds under the idea that he might be thought to have made a stout fight upon the subject
7717_104491_000064_000002	train-clean-360	 He does want them very badly for decency s sake said the poor wife thus winding up her plea 
7717_104491_000064_000003	train-clean-360	Then mister Grey got out his check book and wrote the check for twenty pounds 
7717_104491_000064_000004	train-clean-360	But he made it payable not to mister but to missus Carroll 
7717_104491_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose papa nothing can be done about mister Carroll 
7717_104491_000065_000001	train-clean-360	This was said by Dolly as soon as the family had withdrawn 
7717_104491_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 In what way done my dear 
7717_104491_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 As to settling some farther sum for himself 
7717_104491_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 He d only spend it my dear 
7717_104491_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 That would be intended said Dolly 
7717_104491_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 And then he would come back just the same 
7717_104491_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 But in that case he should have nothing more 
none	none	Though they were to declare that he hadn t a pair of trousers in which to appear at a race course he shouldn t have it
7717_104491_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear said mister Grey you cannot get rid of the gnats of the world They will buzz and sting and be a nuisance 
7717_104491_000072_000001	train-clean-360	Poor Jane suffers worse from this gnat than you or I Put up with it and understand in your own mind that when he comes for another twenty pounds he must have it 
7717_104491_000072_000002	train-clean-360	You needn t tell him but so it must be 
7717_104491_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 If I had my way said Dolly after ten minutes silence I would punish him 
7717_104491_000073_000001	train-clean-360	He is an evil thing and should be made to reap the proper reward 
7717_104491_000073_000002	train-clean-360	It is not that I wish to avoid my share of the world s burdens but that justice should be done 
7717_104491_000073_000003	train-clean-360	I don t know which I hate the worst Uncle Carroll or mister Scarborough 
7717_104491_000074_000000	train-clean-360	The next day was Sunday and Dolly was very anxious before breakfast to induce her father to say that he would go to church with her but he was inclined to be obstinate and fell back upon his usual excuse saying that there were Scarborough papers which it would be necessary that he should read before he started for Tretton on the following day 
none	none	Papa I think it would do you good if you came Well yes I suppose it would 
7717_104491_000076_000001	train-clean-360	That is the intention but somehow it fails with me sometimes 
7717_104491_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you think that you hate people when you go to church as much as when you don t 
7717_104491_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 I am not sure that I hate anybody very much 
none	none	I do That seems an argument for your going
7717_104491_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 But if you don t hate them it is because you won t take the trouble and that again is not right 
none	none	If you would come to church you would be better for it all round 
7717_104491_000081_000002	train-clean-360	You d hate Uncle Carroll s idleness and abominable self indulgence worse than you do 
none	none	I don t love him as it is my dear And I should hate him less I felt last night as though I could rise from my bed and go and murder him
7717_104491_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 Then you certainly ought to go to church 
none	none	And you had passed him off just as though he were a gnat from which you were to receive as little annoyance as possible forgetting the influence he must have on those six unfortunate children Don t you know that you gave her that twenty pounds simply to be rid of a disagreeable subject I should have given it ever so much sooner only that you were looking at me
7717_104491_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 I know you would you dear sweet kind hearted but most un Christian father 
7717_104491_000087_000001	train-clean-360	You must come to church in order that some idea of what Christianity demands of you may make its way into your heart 
7717_104491_000087_000002	train-clean-360	It is not what the clergyman may say of you but that your mind will get away for two hours from that other reptile and his concerns Then mister Grey with a loud long sigh allowed his boots and his gloves and his church going hat and his church going umbrella to be brought to him 
7717_104491_000087_000003	train-clean-360	It was in fact his aversion to these articles that Dolly had to encounter 
none	none	It may be doubted whether the church services of that day did mister Grey much good but they seemed to have had some effect upon his daughter from the fact that in the afternoon she wrote a letter in kindly words to her aunt Papa is going to Tretton and I will come up to you on Tuesday 
7717_104491_000088_000001	train-clean-360	I have got a frock which I will bring with me as a present for Potsey and I will make her sew on the buttons for herself 
7717_104491_000088_000002	train-clean-360	Tell Minna I will lend her that book I spoke of 
none	none	About those boots I will go with Georgina to the boot maker But as to Amelia and Sophy she could not bring herself to say a good natured word so deep in her heart had sunk that sin of which they had been guilty with reference to Prince Chitakov On that night she had a long discussion with her father respecting the affairs of the Scarborough family 
7717_104491_000089_000001	train-clean-360	The discussion was held in the dining room and may therefore be supposed to have been premeditated Those at night in mister Grey s own bedroom were generally the result of sudden thought 
7717_104491_000089_000002	train-clean-360	 I should lay down the law to him began Dolly 
none	none	The law is the law said her father
7717_104491_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t mean the law in that sense 
none	none	I should tell him firmly what I advised and should then make him understand that if he did not follow my advice I must withdraw 
7717_104491_000091_000002	train-clean-360	If his son is willing to pay these money lenders what sums they have actually advanced and if by any effort on his part the money can be raised let it be done 
7717_104491_000091_000003	train-clean-360	There seems to be some justice in repaying out of the property that which was lent to the property when by mister Scarborough s own doing the property was supposed to go into the eldest son s hands 
none	none	Though the eldest son and the money lenders be spendthrifts and profligates alike there will in that be something of fairness 
7717_104491_000091_000005	train-clean-360	Go there prepared with your opinion 
7717_104491_000091_000006	train-clean-360	But if either father or son will not accept it then depart and shake the dust from your feet 
7717_104491_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 You propose it all as though it were the easiest thing in the world 
7717_104491_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 Easy or difficult 
7717_104491_000093_000001	train-clean-360	I would not discuss anything of which the justice may hereafter be disputed 
7717_104491_000094_000000	train-clean-360	What was the result of the consultation on mister Grey s mind he did not declare but he resolved to take his daughter s advice in all that she said to him 
none	none	CHAPTER XIX mister GREY GOES TO TRETTON mister Grey went down to Tretton with a great bag of papers In fact though he told his daughter that he had to examine them all before he started and had taken them to Fulham for that purpose he had not looked at them And as another fact the bag was not opened till he got home again They had been read at any rate what was necessary He knew his subject The old squire knew it well mister Grey was going down to Tretton not to convey facts or to explain the law but in order that he might take the side either of the father or of the son mister Scarborough had sent for the lawyer to support his view of the case and the son had consented to meet him in order that he might the more easily get the better of his father mister Grey had of late learned one thing which had before been dark to him had seen one phase of this complicated farrago of dishonesty which had not before been visible to him Augustus suspected his father of some farther treachery That he should be angry at having been debarred from his birthright so long debarred from the knowledge of his birthright was mister Grey thought natural A great wrong had been at least intended and that such a man should resent it was to have been expected But of late mister Grey had discovered that it was not in that way that the son s mind worked It was not anger but suspicion that he showed and he used his father s former treatment of him as a justification for the condemnation implied in his thoughts There is no knowing what an old man may do who has already acted as he had done It was thus that he expressed himself both by his words and deeds and did so openly in his father s presence mister Grey had not seen them together but knew from the letters of both of them that such was the case Old mister Scarborough scorned his son s suspicions and disregarded altogether any words that might be said as to his own past conduct He was willing or half willing that Mountjoy s debts should be not paid but settled But he was willing to do nothing toward such a step except in his own way While the breath was in his body the property was his and he chose to be treated as its only master If Augustus desired to do anything by post obits let him ruin himself after his own fashion It is not very likely that Augustus can raise money by post obits circumstanced as the property is he had written to mister Grey with a conveyed sneer and chuckle as to the success of his own villany It was as though he had declared that the money lenders had been too well instructed as to what tricks mister Scarborough could play with his property to risk a second venture Augustus had in truth been awaiting his father s death with great impatience It was unreasonable that a man should live who had acted in such a way and who had been so cut about by the doctors His father s demise had in truth been promised to him and to all the world It was an understood thing in all circles which knew anything that old mister Scarborough could not live another month It had been understood some time and was understood at the present moment and yet mister Scarborough went on living no doubt as an invalid in the last stage of probable dissolution but still with the full command of his intellect and mental powers for mischief Augustus suspecting him as he did had begun to fear that he might live too long His brother had disappeared and he was the heir If his father would die such had been his first thought he could settle with the creditors immediately before any tidings should be heard of his brother But tidings had come His brother had been seen by mister Hart at Monte Carlo and though mister Hart had not yet sent home the news to the other creditors the news had been sent at once to Augustus Scarborough by his own paid attendant upon his brother Of mister Hart s little game he did not yet know the particulars but he was confident that there was some game Augustus by no means gave his mother credit for the disgraceful conduct imputed to her in the story as now told by her surviving husband It was not that he believed in the honesty of his mother whom he had never known and for whose memory he cared little but that he believed so fully in the dishonesty of his father His father when he had thoroughly understood that Mountjoy had enveloped the property in debt so that nothing but a skeleton would remain when the bonds were paid had set to work and by the ingenuity of his brain had resolved to redeem as far as the Scarboroughs were concerned their estate from its unfortunate position It was so that Augustus believed this was the theory existing in his mind That his father should have been so clever and mister Grey so blind and even mister Hart and mister Tyrrwhit so easily hoodwinked was remarkable But so it was or might probably be so He felt no assurance but there was ever present to him the feeling of great danger But the state of things as arranged by his father might be established by himself If he could get these creditors to give up their bonds while his father s falsehood was still believed it would be a great thing He had learned by degrees how small a proportion of the money claimed had in fact been advanced to Mountjoy and had resolved to confine himself to paying that That might now probably be accepted with gratitude The increasing value of the estate might bear that without being crushed But it should be done at once while Mountjoy was still absent and before mister Tyrrwhit at any rate knew that Mountjoy had not been killed Then had happened that accidental meeting with mister Hart at Monte Carlo That idiot of a keeper of his had been unable to keep Mountjoy from the gambling house But mister Hart had as yet told nothing mister Hart was playing some game of his own in which he would assuredly be foiled The strong hold which Augustus had was in the great infirmity of his father and in the blindness of mister Grey but it would be settled It ought to have been well that the thing should be settled already by his father s death Augustus did feel strongly that the squire ought to complete his work by dying Were the story as now told by him true he ought certainly to die so as to make speedy atonement for his wickedness Were it false then he ought to go quickly so that the lie might be effectual Every day that he continued to live would go far to endanger the discovery Augustus felt that he must at once have the property in his own hands so as to buy the creditors and obtain security mister Grey who was not so blind as Augustus thought him saw a great deal of this Augustus suspected him as well as the squire His mind went backward and forward on these suspicions It was more probable that the squire should have contrived all this with the attorney s assistance than without it The two willing it together might be very powerful But then mister Grey would hardly dare to do it His father knew that he was dying but mister Grey had no such easy mode of immediate escape if detected And his father was endowed with a courage as peculiar as it was great He did not think that mister Grey was so brave a man as his father And then he could trace the payment of no large sum to mister Grey such as would have been necessary as a bribe in such a case Augustus suspected mister Grey on and off But mister Grey was sure that Augustus suspected his own father Now of one thing mister Grey was certain Augustus was in truth the rightful heir The squire had at first contrived to blind him him mister Grey partly by his own acuteness partly through the carelessness of himself and those in his office partly by the subornation of witnesses who seemed to have been actually prepared for such an event But there could be no subsequent blinding mister Grey had a well earned reputation for professional acuteness and honesty He knew there was no need for such suspicions as those now entertained by the young man but he knew also that they existed and he hated the young man for entertaining them When he arrived at Tretton Park he first of all saw mister Septimus Jones with whom he was not acquainted mister Scarborough will be here directly He is out somewhere about the stables said mister Jones in that tone of voice with which a guest at the house a guest for pleasure may address sometimes a guest who is a guest on business In such a case the guest on pleasure cannot be a gentleman and must suppose that the guest on business is not one either mister Grey thinking that the mister Scarborough spoken of could not be the squire put mister Jones right It is the elder mister Scarborough whom I wish to see There is quite time enough No doubt Miss Scarborough will be down presently You are mister Grey I believe That is my name My friend Augustus Scarborough is particularly anxious to see you before you go to his father The old man is in very failing health you know I am well acquainted with the state of mister Scarborough s health said mister Grey and will leave it to himself to say when I shall see him Perhaps to morrow will be best Then he rung the bell but the servant entered the room at the same moment and summoned him up to the squire s chamber mister Scarborough also wished to see mister Grey before his son and had been on the alert to watch for his coming On the landing he met Miss Scarborough He does seem to keep up his strength said the lady mister Merton is living in the house now and watches him very closely mister Merton was a resident young doctor whom Sir William Brodrick had sent down to see that all medical appliances were at hand as the sick man might require them Then mister Grey was shown in and found the squire recumbent on a sofa with a store of books within his reach and reading apparatuses of all descriptions and every appliance which the ingenuity of the skilful can prepare for the relief of the sick and wealthy This is very kind of you mister Grey said the squire speaking in a cheery voice I wanted you to come very much but I hardly thought that you would take the trouble Augustus is here you know So I have heard from that gentleman down stairs mister Jones I have never had the pleasure of seeing mister Jones What sort of a gentleman is mister Jones to look at Very much like other gentlemen I dare say He has done me the honor to stay a good deal at my house lately Augustus never comes without him He is Fidus Achates I take it to Augustus Augustus has never asked whether he can be received Of course it does not matter When a man is the eldest son and so to say the only one he is apt to take liberties with his father s house I am so sorry that in my position I cannot do the honors and receive him properly He is a very estimable and modest young man I believe As mister Grey had not come down to Tretton either to be a spy on mister Jones or to answer questions concerning him he held his tongue Well mister Grey what do you think about it eh This was a comprehensive question but mister Grey well understood its purport What did he mister Grey think of the condition to which the affairs of Tretton had been brought and those of mister Scarborough himself and of his two sons What did he think of Mountjoy who had disappeared and was still absent What did he think of Augustus who was not showing his gratitude in the best way for all that had been done for him And what did he think of the squire himself who from his death bed had so well contrived to have his own way in everything to do all manner of illegal things without paying any of the penalties to which illegality is generally subject And having asked the question he paused for an answer mister Grey had had no personal interview with the squire since the time at which it had been declared that Mountjoy was not the heir Then some very severe words had been spoken mister Grey had first sworn that he did not believe a word of what was said to him and had refused to deal with the matter at all If carried out mister Scarborough must take it to some other lawyer s office There had since that been a correspondence as to much of which mister Scarborough had been forced to employ an amanuensis Gradually mister Grey had assented in the first instance on behalf of Mountjoy and then on behalf of Augustus But he had done so in the expectation that he should never again see the squire in this world He too had been assured that the man would die and had felt that it would be better that the management of things should then be in honest hands such as his own and in the hands of those who understood them than be confided to those who did not not understand them and who might probably not be honest But the squire had not died and here he was again at Tretton as the squire s guest I think said mister Grey that the less said about a good deal of it the better That of course is sweeping condemnation which however I expect Let that be all as though it had been expressed You don t understand the inner man which rules me how it has struggled to free itself from conventionalities Nor do I quite understand how your inner man has succumbed to them and encouraged them I have encouraged an obedience to the laws of my country Men generally find it safer to do so Exactly and men like to be safe Perhaps a condition of danger has had its attractions for me It is very stupid but perhaps it is so But let that go The rope has been round my own neck and not round that of others Perhaps I have thought of late that if danger should come I could run away from it all by the help of the surgeon They have become so skilful now that a man has no chance in that way But what do you think of Mountjoy and Augustus I think that Mountjoy has been very ill used But I endeavored to do the best I could for him And that Augustus has been worse used But he at any rate has been put right quite in time Had he been brought up as the eldest son he might have done as Mountjoy did Then there came a little gleam of satisfaction across the squire s face as he felt the sufficiency of his answer But they are neither of them pleased You cannot please men by going wrong even in their own behalf I m not so sure of that Were you to say that we cannot please men ever by doing right on their behalf you would perhaps be nearer the mark Where do you think that Mountjoy is A rumor had reached mister Grey that Mountjoy had been seen at Monte Carlo but it had been only a rumor The same had in truth reached mister Scarborough but he chose to keep his rumor to himself Indeed more than a rumor had reached him I think that he will turn up safely said the lawyer I think that if it were made worth his while he would turn up at once Is it not better that he should be away mister Grey shrugged his shoulders What s the good of his coming back into a nest of hornets I have always thought that he did very well to disappear Where is he to live if he came back Should he come here Not with his gambling debts unpaid at the club That might have been settled Though indeed his gambling was as a tub that has no bottom to it There has been nothing for it but to throw him over altogether And yet how very much the better he has been of the two Poor Mountjoy Poor Mountjoy You see if I hadn t disinherited him I should have had to go on paying for him till the whole estate would have been squandered even during my lifetime You speak as though the law had given you the power of disinheriting him So it did But not the power of giving him the inheritance I took that upon myself There I was stronger than the law Now I simply and humbly ask the law to come and help me And the upshot is that Augustus takes upon himself to lecture me and to feel aggrieved He is not angry with me for what I did about Mountjoy but is quarrelling with me because I do not die I have no idea of dying just to please him I think it important that I should live just at present But will you let him have the money to pay these creditors That is what I want to speak about If I can see the list of the sums to be paid and if you can assure yourself that by paying them I shall get back all the post obit bonds which Mountjoy has given and that the money can be at once raised upon a joint mortgage to be executed by me and Augustus I will do it But the first thing must be to know the amount I will join Augustus in nothing without your consent He wants to assume the power himself In fact the one thing he desires is that I shall go As long as I remain he shall do nothing except by my company operation I will see you and him to morrow and now you may go and eat your dinner I cannot tell you how much obliged I am to you for coming And then mister Grey left the room went to his chamber and in process of time made his way into the drawing room CHAPTER XX mister GREY S OPINION OF THE SCARBOROUGH FAMILY Had Augustus been really anxious to see mister Grey before mister Grey went to his father he would probably have managed to do so He did not always tell mister Jones everything So the fellow has hurried up to the governor the moment he came into the house he said He s with him now Of course he is Never mind I ll be even with him in the long run Then he greeted the lawyer with a mock courtesy as soon as he saw him I hope your journey has done you no harm mister Grey Not in the least It s very kind of you I am sure to look after our poor concerns with so much interest Jones don t you think it is time they gave us some dinner mister Grey I m sure must want his dinner All in good time said the lawyer You shall have your dinner mister Grey It is the least we can do for you mister Grey felt that in every sound of his voice there was an insult and took special notice of every tone and booked them all down in his memory After dinner he asked some unimportant question with reference to the meeting that was to take place in the morning and was at once rebuked I do not know that we need trouble our friend here with our private concerns he said Not in the least said mister Grey You have already been talking about them in my presence and in his It is necessary that I should have a list of the creditors before I can advise your father I don t see it but however that is for you to judge Indeed I do not know on what points my father wants your advice A lawyer generally furnishes such a list Then mister Grey took up a book and was soon left alone by the younger men In the morning he walked out in the park so as to have free time for thought Not a word farther had been said between him and Augustus touching their affairs At breakfast Augustus discussed with his friend the state of the odds respecting some race and then the characters of certain ladies No subjects could have been less interesting to mister Grey as Augustus was aware They breakfasted at ten and twelve had been named for the meeting mister Grey had an hour or an hour and a half for his walk in which he could again turn over in his mind all these matters of which his thoughts had been full for now many a day Of two or three facts he was certain Augustus was the legitimate heir of his father Of that he had seen ample documentary evidence The word of no Scarborough should go for anything with him but of that fact he was assured Whether the squire knew aught of Mountjoy he did not feel sure but that Augustus did he was quite certain Who was paying the bills for the scapegrace during his travels he could not say but he thought it probable that Augustus was finding the money He Mountjoy was kept away so as to be out of the creditors way He thought therefore that Augustus was doing this so that he might the more easily buy up the debts But why should Augustus go to the expense of buying up the debts seeing that the money must ultimately come out of his own pocket Because so mister Grey thought Augustus would not trust his own father The creditors if they could get hold of Mountjoy when his father was dead and when the bonds would all become payable might possibly so unravel the facts as to make it apparent that after all the property was Mountjoy s This was not mister Grey s idea but was mister Grey s idea of the calculation which Augustus was making for his own government According to mister Grey s reading of all the facts of the case such were the suspicions which Augustus entertained in the matter Otherwise why should he be anxious to take a step which would redound only to the advantage of the creditors He was quite certain that no money would be paid at any rate by Augustus solely with the view of honestly settling their claims But there was another subject which troubled his mind excessively as he walked across the park Why should he soil his hands or at any rate trouble his conscience with an affair so unclean so perplexed and so troublesome Why was he there at Tretton at all to be insulted by a young blackguard such as he believed Augustus Scarborough to be Augustus Scarborough he knew suspected him But he in return suspected Augustus Scarborough The creditors suspected him Mountjoy suspected him The squire did not suspect him but he suspected the squire He never could again feel himself to be on comfortable terms of trusting legal friendship with a man who had played such a prank in reference to his marriage as this man had performed Why then should he still be concerned in a matter so distasteful to him Why should he not wipe his hands of it all and retreat There was no act of parliament compelling him to meddle with the dirt Such were his thoughts But yet he knew that he was compelled He did feel himself bound to look after interests which he had taken in hand now for many years It had been his duty or the duty of some one belonging to him to see into the deceit by which an attempt had been made to rob Augustus Scarborough of his patrimony It had been his duty for a while to protect Mountjoy and the creditors who had lent their money to Mountjoy from what he had believed to be a flagitious attempt Then as soon as he felt that the flagitious attempt had been made previously in Mountjoy s favor it became his duty to protect Augustus in spite of the strong personal dislike which from the first he had conceived for that young man And then he doubtless had been attracted by the singularity of all that had been done in the affair and of all that was likely to be done He had said to himself that the matter should be made straight and that he would make it straight Therefore during his walk in the park he resolved that he must persevere At twelve o clock he was ready to be taken up to the sick man s room When he entered it under the custody of Miss Scarborough he found that Augustus was there The squire was sitting up with his feet supported and was apparently in a good humor Well mister Grey he said have you settled this matter with Augustus I have settled nothing He has not spoken to me about it at all said Augustus I told him I wanted a list of the creditors He said that it was my duty to supply it That was the extent of our conversation Which he thought it expedient to have in the presence of my friend mister Jones mister Jones is very well in his way but he is not acquainted with all my affairs Your son mister Scarborough has made no tender to me of any information Nor sir has mister Grey sought for any information from me During this little dialogue mister Scarborough turned his face with a smile from one to the other without a word If mister Grey has anything to suggest in the way of advice let him suggest it said Augustus Now mister Grey said the squire with the same smile Till I get farther information said mister Grey I can only limit myself to giving the advice which I offered to you yesterday Perhaps you will repeat it so that he may hear it said the squire If you get a list of those to whom your son Mountjoy owes money and an assurance that the moneys named in that list have been from time to time lent by them to him the actual amount I mean then I think that if you and your son Augustus shall together choose to pay those amounts you will make the best reparation in your power for the injury you have no doubt done in having contrived that it should be understood that Mountjoy was legitimate You need not discuss said the squire any injuries that I have done I have done a great many no doubt But continued the lawyer before any such payment is made close inquiries should be instituted as to the amounts of money which have absolutely passed We should certainly be taken in said the squire I have great admiration for mister Samuel Hart I do believe that it would be found impossible to extract the truth from mister Samuel Hart If mister Samuel Hart does not make money yet out of poor Mountjoy I shall be surprised The truth may be ascertained said mister Grey You should get some accountant to examine the checks When I remember how easy it was to deceive some really clever men as to the evidence of my marriage began mister Scarborough So the squire began but then stopped himself with a shrug of his shoulders Among the really clever men who had been easily deceived mister Grey was if not actually first in importance foremost at any rate in name The truth may be ascertained mister Grey repeated almost with a scowl of anger upon his brow Well yes I suppose it may It will be difficult in opposition to mister Samuel Hart You must satisfy yourselves at any rate These men will know that they have no other hope of getting a shilling It is a little hard to make them believe anything said the squire They fancy you know that if they could get a hold of Mountjoy so as to have him in their hands when the breath is out of my body and the bonds are really due that then it may be made to turn out that he is really the heir We know that it is not so said mister Grey At this Augustus smiled blandly We know But it is what we can make mister Samuel Hart know In truth mister Samuel Hart never allows himself to know anything except the amount of money which he may have at his banker s And it will be difficult to convince mister Tyrrwhit mister Tyrrwhit is assured that all of us you and I and Mountjoy and Augustus are in a conspiracy to cheat him and the others I don t wonder at it said mister Grey Perhaps not continued the squire the circumstances no doubt are suspicious But he will have to find out his mistake Augustus is very anxious to pay these poor men their money It is a noble feeling on the part of Augustus you must admit that mister Grey The irony with which this was said was evident in the squire s face and voice Augustus only quietly laughed The attorney sat as firm as death He was not going to argue with such a statement or to laugh at such a joke I suppose it will come to over a hundred thousand pounds Eighty thousand I should think said Augustus The bonds amount to a great deal more than that twice that It is for him to judge said the squire whether he is bound by his honor to pay so large a sum to men whom I do not suppose he loves very well The estate can bear it said Augustus Yes the estate can bear it said the attorney They should be paid what they have expended That is my idea Your son thinks that their silence will be worth the money What makes you say that demanded Augustus Just my own opinion I look upon it as an insult Would you be kind enough to explain to us what is your reason for wishing to do this thing asked mister Grey No sir I decline to give any reason But those which you ascribe to me are insulting Will you deny them I will not assent to anything coming from you nor will I deny anything It is altogether out of your place as an attorney to ascribe motives to your clients Can you raise the money so that it shall be forthcoming at once That is the question On your father s authority backed by your signature I imagine that I can do so But I will not answer as a certainty The best thing would be to sell a portion of the property If you and your father will join and Mountjoy also with you it may be done What has Mountjoy got to do with it asked the father You had better have Mountjoy also There may be some doubt as to the title People will think so after the tricks that have been played This was said by the lawyer but the squire only laughed He always showed some enjoyment of the fun which arose from the effects of his own scheming The legal world with its entails had endeavored to dispose of his property but he had shown the legal world that it was not an easy task to dispose of anything in which he was concerned How will you get hold of Mountjoy asked Augustus Then the two older men only looked at each other Both of them believed that Augustus knew more about his brother than any one else I think you had better send to mister Annesley and ask him What does Annesley know about him asked the squire He was the last person who saw him at any rate in London Are you sure of that said mister Grey I think I may say that I am I think at any rate that I know that there was a violent quarrel between them in the streets a quarrel in which the two men proceeded to blows and that Annesley struck him in such a way as to leave him for dead upon the pavement Then the young man walked away and Mountjoy has not been heard of or at least has not been seen since That a man should have struck such a blow and then on the spur of the moment thinking of his own safety should have left his opponent I can understand I should not like to be accused of such treatment myself but I can understand it I cannot understand that the man should have been missing altogether and that then he should have held his tongue How do you know all this asked the attorney It is sufficient that I do know it I don t believe a word of it said the squire Coming from you of course I must put up with any contradiction said Augustus I should not bear it from any one else and he looked at the attorney One has a right to ask for your authority said his father I cannot give it A lady is concerned whose name I shall not mention But it is of less importance as his own friends are acquainted with the nature of his conduct Indeed it seems odd to see you two gentlemen so ignorant as to the matter which has been a subject of common conversation in most circles His uncle means to cut him out from the property Can he too deal with entails said the squire He is still in middle life and he can marry That is what he intended to do so much is he disgusted with his nephew He has already stopped the young man s allowance and swears that he shall not have a shilling of his money if he can help it The police for some time were in great doubt whether they would not arrest him I think I am justified in saying that he is a thorough reprobate You are not at all justified said the father I can only express my opinion and am glad to say that the world agrees with me It is sickening absolutely sickening said the squire turning to the attorney You would not believe now But he stopped himself What would not mister Grey believe asked the son There is no one one knows better than you that after the row in the street when Mountjoy was I believe the aggressor he was again seen by another person I hate such deceit and scheming Here Augustus smiled What are you sniggering there at you blockhead Your hatred sir at deceit and scheming The truth is that when a man plays a game well he does not like to find that he has any equal Heaven forbid that I should say that there is rivalry here You sir are so pre eminently the first that no one can touch you Then he laughed long a low bitter inaudible laugh during which mister Grey sat silent This comes well from you said the father Well sir you would try your hand upon me I have passed over all that you have done on my behalf But when you come to abuse me I cannot quite take your words as calmly as though there had been no shall I say antecedents Now about this money Are we to pay it I don t care one straw about the money What is it to me I don t owe these creditors anything Nor do I Let them rest then and do the worst they can But upon the whole mister Grey he added after a pause I think we had better pay them They have endeavored to be insolent to me and I have therefore ignored their claim I have told them to do their worst If my son here will agree with you in raising the money and if Mountjoy as he too is necessary will do so I too will do what is required of me If eighty thousand pounds will settle it all there ought not to be any difficulty You can inquire what the real amount would be If they choose to hold to their bonds nothing will come of it that s all Very well mister Scarborough Then I shall know how to proceed I understand that mister Scarborough junior is an assenting party mister Scarborough junior signified his assent by nodding his head That will do then for I think that I have a little exhausted myself Then he turned round upon his couch as though he intended to slumber mister Grey left the room and Augustus followed him but not a word was spoken between them mister Grey had an early dinner and went up to London by an evening train What became of Augustus he did not inquire but simply asked for his dinner and for a conveyance to the train These were forthcoming and he returned that night to Fulham Well said Dolly as soon as she had got him his slippers and made him his tea I wish with all my heart I had never seen any one of the name of Scarborough That is of course but what have you done The father has been a great knave He has set the laws of his country at defiance and should be punished most severely And Mountjoy Scarborough has proved himself to be unfit to have any money in his hands A man so reckless is little better than a lunatic But compared with Augustus they are both estimable amiable men The father has ideas of philanthropy and Mountjoy is simply mad But Augustus is as dishonest as either of them and is odious also all round Then at length he explained all that he had learned and all that he had advised and at last went to bed combating Dolly s idea that the Scarboroughs ought now to be thrown over altogether CHAPTER XXI mister SCARBOROUGH S THOUGHTS OF HIMSELF When mister Scarborough was left alone he did not go to sleep as he had pretended but lay there for an hour thinking of his position and indulging to the full the feelings of anger which he now entertained toward his second son He had never in truth loved Augustus Augustus was very like his father in his capacity for organizing deceit for plotting and so contriving that his own will should be in opposition to the wills of all those around him But they were thoroughly unlike in the object to be attained mister Scarborough was not a selfish man Augustus was selfish and nothing else mister Scarborough hated the law because it was the law and endeavored to put a restraint upon him and others Augustus liked the law unless when in particular points it interfered with his own actions mister Scarborough thought that he could do better than the law Augustus wished to do worse mister Scarborough never blushed at what he himself attempted unless he failed which was not often the case But he was constantly driven to blush for his son Augustus blushed for nothing and for nobody When mister Scarborough had declared to the attorney that just praise was due to Augustus for the nobility of the sacrifice he was making Augustus had understood his father accurately and determined to be revenged not because of the expression of his father s thoughts but because he had so expressed himself before the attorney mister Scarborough also thought that he was entitled to his revenge When he had been left alone for an hour he rung the bell which was close at his side and called for mister Merton Where is mister Grey I think he has ordered the wagonette to take him to the station And where is Augustus I do not know And mister Jones I suppose they have not gone to the station Just feel my pulse Merton I am afraid I am very weak mister Merton felt his pulse and shook his head There isn t a pulse so to speak Oh yes but it is irregular If you will exert yourself so violently That is all very well but a man has to exert himself sometimes let the penalty be what it may When do you think that Sir William will have to come again Sir William when he came would come with his knife and his advent was always to be feared It depends very much on yourself mister Scarborough I don t think he can come very often but you can make the distances long or short You should attend to no business That is absolute rubbish Nevertheless it is my duty to say so Whatever arrangements may be required they should be made by others Of course if you do as you have done this morning I can suggest some little relief I can give you tonics and increase the amount but I cannot resist the evil which you yourself do yourself I understand all about it You will kill yourself if you go on I don t mean to go on any farther not as I have done to day but as to giving up business that is rubbish I have got my property to manage and I mean to manage it myself as long as I live Unfortunately there have been accidents which make the management a little rough at times I have had one of the rough moments to day but they shall not be repeated I give you my word for that But do not talk to me about giving up my business Now I ll take your tonics and then would you have the kindness to ask my sister to come to me Miss Scarborough who was always in waiting on her brother was at once in the room Martha he said where is Augustus I think he has gone out And where is mister Septimus Jones He is with him John The two are always together You would not mind giving my compliments to mister Jones and telling him that his bedroom is wanted His bedroom wanted There are lots of bedrooms and nobody to occupy them It s a hint that I want him to go he d understand that Would it not be better to tell Augustus asked the lady doubting much her power to carry out the instructions given to her He would tell Augustus It is not you see any objection I have to mister Jones I have not the pleasure of his acquaintance He is a most agreeable young man I m sure but I do not care to entertain an agreeable young man without having a word to say on the subject Augustus does not think it worth his while even to speak to me about him Of course when I am gone in a month or so perhaps a week or two he can do as he pleases Don t John But it is so While I live I am master at least of this house I cannot see mister Jones and I do not wish to have another quarrel with Augustus mister Merton says that every time I get angry it gives Sir William another chance with the knife I thought that perhaps you could do it Then Miss Scarborough promised that she would do it and having her brother s health very much at heart she did do it Augustus stood smiling while the message was in fact conveyed to him but he made no answer When the lady had done he bobbed his head to signify that he acknowledged the receipt of it and the lady retired I have got my walking papers he said to Septimus Jones ten minutes afterward I don t know what you mean Don t you Then you must be very thick headed My father has sent me word that you are to be turned out Of course he means it for me He does not wish to give me the power of saying that he sent me away from the house me whom he has so long endeavored to rob me to whom he owes so much for taking no steps to punish his fraud And he knows that I can take none because he is on his death bed But you couldn t could you if he were were anywhere else Couldn t I That s all you know about it Understand however that I shall start to morrow morning and unless you like to remain here on a visit to him you had better go with me mister Jones signified his compliance with the hint and so Miss Scarborough had done her work mister Scarborough when thus left alone spent his time chiefly in thinking of the condition of his sons His eldest son Mountjoy who had ever been his favorite whom as a little boy he had spoiled by every means in his power was a ruined man His debts had all been paid except the money due to the money lenders But he was not the less a ruined man Where he was at this moment his father did not know All the world knew the injustice of which he had been guilty on his boy s behalf and all the world knew the failure of the endeavor And now he had made a great and a successful effort to give back to his legitimate heir all the property But in return the second son only desired his death and almost told him so to his face He had been proud of Augustus as a lad but he had never loved him as he had loved Mountjoy Now he knew that he and Augustus must henceforward be enemies Never for a moment did he think of giving up his power over the estate as long as the estate should still be his Though it should be but for a month though it should be but for a week he would hold his own Such was the nature of the man and when he swallowed mister Merton s tonics he did so more with the idea of keeping the property out of his son s hands than of preserving his own life According to his view he had done very much for Augustus and this was the return which he received And in truth he had done much for Augustus For years past it had been his object to leave to his second son as much as would come to his first He had continued to put money by for him instead of spending his income on himself Of this mister Grey had known much but had said nothing when he was speaking those severe words which mister Scarborough had always contrived to receive with laughter But he had felt their injustice though he had himself ridiculed the idea of law There had been the two sons both born from the same mother and he had willed that they should be both rich men living among the foremost of their fellowmen and the circumstances of the property would have helped him The income from year to year went on increasing The water mills of Tretton and the town of Tretton had grown and been expanded within his domain and the management of the sales in mister Grey s hands had been judicious The revenues were double now what they had been when mister Scarborough first inherited it It was all no doubt entailed but for twenty years he had enjoyed the power of accumulating a sum of money for his second son s sake or would have enjoyed it had not the accumulation been taken from him to pay Mountjoy s debts It was in vain that he attempted to make Mountjoy responsible for the money Mountjoy s debts and irregularities and gambling went on till mister Scarborough found himself bound to dethrone the illegitimate son and to place the legitimate in his proper position In doing the deed he had not suffered much though the circumstances which had led to the doing of it had been full of pain There had been an actual pleasure to him in thus showing himself to be superior to the conventionalities of the world There was Augustus still ready to occupy the position to which he had in truth been born And at the moment Mountjoy had gone he knew not where There had been gambling debts which coming as they did after many others he had refused to pay He himself was dying at the moment as he thought It would be better for him to take up with Augustus Mountjoy he must leave to his fate For such a son so reckless so incurable so hopeless it was impossible that anything farther should be done He would at least enjoy the power of leaving those wretched creditors without their money There would be some triumph some consolation in that So he had done and now his heir turned against him It was very bitter to him as he lay thinking of it all He was a man who was from his constitution and heart capable of making great sacrifices for those he loved He had a most thorough contempt for the character of an honest man He did not believe in honesty but only in mock honesty And yet he would speak of an honest man with admiration meaning something altogether different from the honesty of which men ordinarily spoke The usual honesty of the world was with him all pretence or if not assumed for the sake of the character it would achieve mister Grey he knew to be honest mister Grey s word he knew to be true but he fancied that mister Grey had adopted this absurd mode of living with the view of cheating his neighbors by appearing to be better than others All virtue and all vice were comprised by him in the words good nature and ill nature All church going propensities and these propensities in his estimate extended very widely he scorned from the very bottom of his heart That one set of words should be deemed more wicked than another as in regard to swearing was to him a sign either of hypocrisy of idolatry or of feminine weakness of intellect To women he allowed the privilege of being in regard to thought only something better than dogs When his sister Martha shuddered at some exclamation from his mouth he would say to himself simply that she was a woman not an idiot or a hypocrite Of women old and young he had been very fond and in his manner to them very tender but when a woman rose to a way of thinking akin to his own she was no longer a woman to his senses Against such a one his taste revolted She sunk to the level of a man contaminated by petticoats And law was hardly less absurd to him than religion It consisted of a perplexed entanglement of rules got together so that the few might live in comfort at the expense of the many Robbery if you could get to the bottom of it was bad as was all violence but taxation was robbery rent was robbery prices fixed according to the desire of the seller and not in obedience to justice were robbery Then you are the greatest of robbers his friends would say to him He would admit it allowing that in such a state of society he was not prepared to go out and live naked in the streets if he could help it But he delighted to get the better of the law and triumphed in his own iniquity as has been seen by his conduct in reference to his sons In this way he lived and was kind to many people having a generous and an open hand But he was a man who could hate with a bitter hatred and he hated most those suspected by him of mean or dirty conduct mister Grey who constantly told him to his face that he was a rascal he did not hate at all Thinking mister Grey to be in some respects idiotic he respected him and almost loved him He thoroughly believed mister Grey thinking him to be an ass for telling so much truth unnecessarily And he had loved his son Mountjoy in spite of all his iniquities and had fostered him till it was impossible to foster him any longer Then he had endeavored to love Augustus and did not in the least love him the less because his son told him frequently of the wicked things he had done He did not object to be told of his wickedness even by his son But Augustus suspected him of other things than those of which he accused him and attempted to be sharp with him and to get the better of him at his own game And his son laughed at him and scorned him and regarded him as one who was troublesome only for a time and who need not be treated with much attention because he was there only for a time Therefore he hated Augustus But Augustus was his heir and he knew that he must die soon But for how long could he live And what could he yet do before he died A braver man than mister Scarborough never lived that is one who less feared to die Whether that is true courage may be a question but it was his in conjunction with courage of another description He did not fear to die nor did he fear to live But what he did fear was to fail before he died Not to go out with the conviction that he was vanishing amid the glory of success was to him to be wretched at his last moment and to be wretched at his last moment or to anticipate that he should be so was to him even so near his last hours the acme of misery How much of life was left to him so that he might recover something of success Or was any moment left to him He could not sleep so he rung his bell and again sent for mister Merton I have taken what you told me So best said mister Merton For he did not always feel assured that this strange patient would take what had been ordered And I have tried to sleep That will come after a while You would not naturally sleep just after the tonic And I have been thinking of what you said about business There is one thing I must do and then I can remain quiet for a fortnight unless I should be called upon to disturb my rest by dying We will hope not That may go as it pleases said the sick man I want you now to write a letter for me to mister Grey mister Merton had undertaken to perform the duties of secretary as well as doctor and had thought in this way to obtain some authority over his patient for the patient s own good but he had found already that no authority had come to him He now sat down at the table close to the bedside and prepared to write in accordance with mister Scarborough s dictation I think that Grey the lawyer you know is a good man The world as far as I hear it says that he is honest I don t care a straw what the world says The world says that I am dishonest but I am not Merton could only shrug his shoulders I don t say that because I want you to change your opinion I don t care what you think But I tell you a fact I doubt whether Grey is so absolutely honest as I am but as things go he is a good man Certainly But the world I suppose says that my son Augustus is honest Well yes I should suppose so If you have looked into him and have seen the contrary I respect your intelligence I did not mean anything particular I dare say not and if so I mean nothing particular as to your intelligence He at any rate is a scoundrel Mountjoy you know Mountjoy Never saw him in my life I don t think he is a scoundrel not all round He has gambled when he has not had money to pay That is bad And he has promised when he wanted money and broken his word as soon as he had got it which is bad also And he has thought himself to be a fine fellow because he has been intimate with lords and dukes which is very bad He has never cared whether he paid his tailor I do not mean that he has merely got into debt which a young man such as he cannot help but he has not cared whether his breeches were his or another man s That too is bad Though he has been passionately fond of women it has only been for himself not for the women which is very bad There is an immense deal to be altered before he can go to heaven I hope the change may come before it is too late said Merton These changes don t come very suddenly you know But there is some chance for Mountjoy I don t think that there is any for Augustus Here he paused but Merton did not feel disposed to make any remark You don t happen to know a young man of the name of Annesley Harry Annesley I have heard his name from your son From Augustus Then you didn t hear any good of him I m sure You have heard all the row about poor Mountjoy s disappearance I heard that he did disappear After a quarrel with that Annesley After some quarrel I did not notice the name at the time Harry Annesley was the name Now Augustus says that Harry Annesley was the last person who saw Mountjoy before his disappearance the last who knew him He implies thereby that Annesley was the conscious or unconscious cause of his disappearance Well yes Certainly it is so And as it has been thought by the police and by other fools that Mountjoy was murdered that his disappearance was occasioned by his death either by murder or suicide it follows that Annesley must have had something to do with it That is the inference is it not I should suppose so said Merton That is manifestly the inference which Augustus draws To hear him speak to me about it you would suppose that he suspected Annesley of having killed Mountjoy Not that I hope Something of the sort He has intended it to be believed that Annesley for his own purposes has caused Mountjoy to be made away with He has endeavored to fill the police with that idea A policeman generally is the biggest fool that London or England or the world produces and has been selected on that account Therefore the police have a beautifully mysterious but altogether ignorant suspicion as to Annesley That is the doing of Augustus for some purpose of his own Now let me tell you that Augustus saw Mountjoy after Annesley had seen him that he knows this to be the case and that it was Augustus who contrived Mountjoy s disappearance Now what do you think of Augustus This was a question which Merton did not find it very easy to answer But mister Scarborough waited for a reply Eh he exclaimed I had rather not give an opinion on a point so raised You may Of course you understand that I intend to assert that Augustus is the greatest blackguard you ever knew If you have anything to say in his favor you can say it Only that you may be mistaken Living down here you may not know the truth Just that But I do know the truth Augustus is very clever but there are others as clever as he is He can pay but then so can I That he should want to get Mountjoy out of the way is intelligible Mountjoy has become disreputable and had better be out of the way But why persistently endeavor to throw the blame upon young Annesley That surprises me only I do not care much about it I hear now for the first time that he has ruined young Annesley and that does appear to be very horrible But why does he want to pay eighty thousand pounds to these creditors That I should wish to do so out of a property which must in a very short time become his would be intelligible I may be supposed to have some affection for Mountjoy and after all am not called upon to pay the money out of my own pocket Do you understand it Not in the least said Merton who did not indeed very much care about it Nor do I only this that if he could pay these men and deprive them of all power of obtaining farther payment let who would have the property they at any rate would be quiet Augustus is now my eldest son Perhaps he thinks he might not remain so If I were out of the way and these creditors were paid he thinks that poor Mountjoy wouldn t have a chance He shall pay this eighty thousand pounds Mountjoy hasn t a chance as it is but Augustus shall pay the penalty Then he threw himself back on the bed and mister Merton begged him to spare himself the trouble of the letter for the present But in a few minutes he was again on his elbow and took some farther medicine I m a great ass he said to help Augustus in playing his game If I were to go off at once he would be the happiest fellow left alive But come let us begin Then he dictated the letter as follows DEAR mister GREY I have been thinking much of what passed between us the other day Augustus seems to be in a great hurry as to paying the creditors and I do not see why he should not be gratified as the money may now be forthcoming I presume that the sales which will be completed before Christmas will nearly enable us to stop their mouths I can understand that Mountjoy should be induced to join with me and Augustus so that in disposing of so large a sum of money the authority of all may be given both of myself and of the heir and also of him who a short time since was supposed to be the heir I think that you may possibly find Mountjoy s address by applying to Augustus who is always clever in such matters But you will have to be certain that you obtain all the bonds If you can get Tyrrwhit to help you you will be able to be sure of doing so The matter to him is one of vital importance as his sum is so much the largest Of course he will open his mouth very wide but when he finds that he can get his principal and nothing more I think that he will help you I am afraid that I must ask you to put yourself in correspondence with Augustus That he is an insolent scoundrel I will admit but we cannot very well complete this affair without him I fancy that he now feels it to be his interest to get it all done before I die as the men will be clamorous with their bonds as soon as the breath is out of my body Yours sincerely JOHN SCARBOROUGH That will do he said when the letter was finished But when mister Merton turned to leave the room mister Scarborough detained him Upon the whole I am not dissatisfied with my life he said I don t know that you have occasion rejoined mister Merton In this he absolutely lied for according to his thinking there was very much in the affairs of mister Scarborough s life which ought to have induced regret He knew the whole story of the birth of the elder son of the subsequent marriage of mister Scarborough s fraudulent deceit which had lasted so many years and of his later return to the truth so as to save the property and to give back to the younger son all of which for so many years he his father had attempted to rob him All London had talked of the affair and all London had declared that so wicked and dishonest an old gentleman had never lived And now he had returned to the truth simply with the view of cheating the creditors and keeping the estate in the family He was manifestly an old gentleman who ought to be above all others dissatisfied with his own life but mister Merton when the assertion was made to him knew not what other answer to make I really do not think I have nor do I know one to whom heaven with all its bliss will be more readily accorded What have I done for myself I don t quite know what you have done all your life I was born a rich man and then I married not rich as I am now but with ample means for marrying After mister Mountjoy s birth said Merton who could not pretend to be ignorant of the circumstance Well yes I have my own ideas about marriage and that kind of thing which are perhaps at variance with yours Whereupon Merton bowed I had the best wife in the world who entirely coincided with me in all that I did I lived entirely abroad and made most liberal allowances to all the agricultural tenants I rebuilt all the cottages go and look at them I let any man shoot his own game till Mountjoy came up in the world and took the shooting into his own hands When the people at the pottery began to build I assisted them in every way in the world I offered to keep a school at my own expense solely on the understanding that what they call Dissenters should be allowed to come there The parson spread abroad a rumor that I was an atheist and consequently the School was kept for the Dissenters only The School board has come and made that all right though the parson goes on with his rumor If he understood me as well as I understand him he would know that he is more of an atheist than I am I gave my boys the best education spending on them more than double what is done by men with twice my means My tastes were all simple and were not specially vicious I do not know that I have ever made any one unhappy Then the estate became richer but Mountjoy grew more and more expensive I began to find that with all my economies the estate could not keep pace with him so as to allow me to put by anything for Augustus Then I had to bethink myself what I had to do to save the estate from those rascals You took peculiar steps I am a man who does take peculiar steps Another would have turned his face to the wall in my state of health and have allowed two dirty Jews such as Tyrrwhit and Samuel Hart to have revelled in the wealth of Tretton I am not going to allow them to revel Tyrrwhit knows me and Hart will have to know me They could not keep their hands to themselves till the breath was out of my body Now I am about to see that each shall have his own shortly and the estate will still be kept in the family For mister Augustus Scarborough Yes alas yes But that is not my doing I do not know that I have cause to be dissatisfied with myself but I cannot but own that I am unhappy But I wished you to understand that though a man may break the law he need not therefore be accounted bad and though he may have views of his own as to religious matters he need not be an atheist I have made efforts on behalf of others in which I have allowed no outward circumstances to control me Now I think I do feel sleepy CHAPTER XXII HARRY ANNESLEY IS SUMMONED HOME Just now I am triumphant Harry Annesley had said to his hostess as he left missus Armitage s house in the Paragon at Cheltenham He was absolutely triumphant throwing his hat up into the air in the abandonment of his joy For he was not a man to have conceived so well of his own parts as to have flattered himself that the girl must certainly be his There are at present a number of young men about who think that few girls are worth the winning but that any girl is to be had not by asking which would be troublesome but simply by looking at her You can see the feeling in their faces They are for the most part small in stature well made little men who are aware that they have something to be proud of wearing close packed shining little hats by which they seem to add more than a cubit to their stature men endowed with certain gifts of personal dignity I may perhaps call it though the word rises somewhat too high They look as though they would be able to say a clever thing but their spoken thoughts seldom rise above a small acrid sharpness They respect no one above all not their elders To such a one his horse comes first if he have a horse then a dog and then a stick and after that the mistress of his affections But their fault is not altogether of their own making It is the girls themselves who spoil them and endure their inanity because of that assumed look of superiority which to the eyes of the outside world would be a little offensive were it not a little foolish But they do not marry often Whether it be that the girls know better at last or that they themselves do not see sufficiently clearly their future dinners who can say They are for the most part younger brothers and perhaps have discovered the best way of getting out of the world whatever scraps the world can afford them Harry Annesley s faults were altogether of another kind In regard to this young woman the Florence whom he had loved he had been over modest Now his feeling of glory was altogether redundant Having been told by Florence that she was devoted to him he walked with his head among the heavens The first instinct with such a young man as those of whom I have spoken teaches him the moment he has committed himself to begin to consider how he can get out of the scrape It is not much of a scrape for when an older man comes this way a man verging toward baldness with a good professional income our little friend is forgotten and he is passed by without a word But Harry had now a conviction on that one special night that he never would be forgotten and never would forget He was filled at once with an unwonted pride All the world was now at his feet and all the stars were open to him He had begun to have a glimmering of what it was that Augustus Scarborough intended to do but the intentions of Augustus Scarborough were now of no moment to him He was clothed in a panoply of armor which would be true against all weapons At any rate on that night and during the next day this feeling remained the same with him Then he received a summons from his mother at Buston His mother pressed him to come at once down to the parsonage Your uncle has been with your father and has said terrible things about you As you know my brother is not very strong minded and I should not care so much for what he says were it not that so much is in his hands I cannot understand what it is all about but your father says that he does nothing but threaten He talks of putting the entail on one side Entails used to be fixed things I thought but since what old mister Scarborough did nobody seems to regard them now But even suppose the entail does remain what are you to do about the income Your father thinks you had better come down and have a little talk about the matter This was the first blow received since the moment of his exaltation Harry knew very well that the entail was fixed and could not be put aside by mister Prosper though mister Scarborough might have succeeded with his entail but yet he was aware that his present income was chiefly dependent on his uncle s good will To be reduced to live on his fellowship would be very dreadful And that income such as it was depended entirely on his celibacy And he had too as he was well aware engendered habits of idleness during the last two years The mind of a young man so circumstanced turns always first to the Bar and then to literature At the Bar he did not think that there could be any opening for him In the first place it was late to begin and then he was humble enough to believe of himself that he had none of the peculiar gifts necessary for a judge or for an advocate Perhaps the knowledge that six or seven years of preliminary labor would be necessary was somewhat of a deterrent The rewards of literature might be achieved immediately Such was his idea But he had another idea perhaps as erroneous that this career would not become a gentleman who intended to be Squire of Buston He had seen two or three men decidedly Bohemian in their modes of life to whom he did not wish to assimilate himself There was Quaverdale whom he had known intimately at saint John s and who was on the Press Quaverdale had quarrelled absolutely with his father who was also a clergyman and having been thrown altogether on his own resources had come out as a writer for The Coming Hour He made his five or six hundred a year in a rattling loose uncertain sort of fashion and was so thought Harry Annesley the dirtiest man of his acquaintance He did not believe in the six hundred a year or Quaverdale would certainly have changed his shirt more frequently and would sometimes have had a new pair of trousers He was very amusing very happy very thoughtless and as a rule altogether impecunious Annesley had never known him without the means of getting a good dinner but those means did not rise to the purchase of a new hat Putting Quaverdale before him as an example Annesley could not bring himself to choose literature as a profession Thinking of all this when he received his mother s letter he assured himself that Florence would not like professional literature He wrote to say that he would be down at Buston in five days time It does not become a son who is a fellow of a college and the heir to a property to obey his parents too quickly But he gave up the intermediate days to thinking over the condition which bound him to his uncle and to discussing his prospects with Quaverdale who as usual was remaining in town doing the editor s work for The Coming Hour If he interfered with me I should tell him to go to bed said Quaverdale The allusion was of course made to mister Prosper I am not on those sort of terms with him I should make my own terms and then let him do his worst What can he do If he means to withdraw his beggarly two hundred and fifty pounds of course he ll do it I suppose I do owe him something in the way of respect Not if he threatens you in regard to money What does it come to That you are to cringe at his heels for a beggarly allowance which he has been pleased to bestow upon you without your asking Very well my dear fellow I should say to him you can stop it the moment you please For certain objects of your own that your heir might live in the world after a certain fashion you have bestowed it It has been mine since I was a child If you can reconcile it to your conscience to discontinue it do so You would find that he would have to think twice about it He will stop it and what am I to do then Can I get an opening on any of these papers Quaverdale whistled a mode of receiving the overture which was not pleasing to Annesley I don t suppose that anything so very super human in the way of intellect is required Annesley had got a fellowship whereas Quaverdale had done nothing at the university Couldn t you make a pair of shoes Shoemakers do get good wages What do you mean A fellow never can get you to be serious for two minutes together I never was more serious in my life That I am to make shoes No I don t quite think that I don t suppose you can make them You d have first to learn the trade and show that you were an adept And I must show that I am an adept before I can write for The Coming Hour There was a tone of sarcasm in this which was not lost on Quaverdale Certainly you must and that you are a better adept than I who have got the place or some other unfortunate who will have to be put out of his berth The Coming Hour only requires a certain number Of course there are many newspapers in London and many magazines and much literary work going You may get your share of it but you have got to begin by shoving some incompetent fellow out And in order to be able to begin you must learn the trade How did you begin Just in that way While you were roaming about London like a fine gentleman I began by earning twenty four shillings a week Can I earn twenty four shillings a week You won t because you have already got your fellowship You had a knack at writing Greek iambics and therefore got a fellowship I picked up at the same time the way of stringing English together I also soon learned the way to be hungry I m not hungry now very often but I ve been through it My belief is that you wouldn t get along with my editor That s your idea of being independent Certainly it is I do his work and take his pay and obey his orders If you think you can do the same come and try There s not room here but there is no doubt room elsewhere There s the trade to be learned like any other trade but my belief is that even then you could not do it We don t want Greek iambics Harry turned away disgusted Quaverdale was like the rest of the world and thought that a peculiar talent and a peculiar tact were needed for his own business Harry believed that he was as able to write a leading article at any rate as Quaverdale and that the Greek iambics would not stand in his way But he conceived it to be probable that his habits of cleanliness might do so and gave up the idea for the present He thought that his friend should have welcomed him with an open hand into the realms of literature and perhaps it was the case that Quaverdale attributed too much weight to the knack of turning readable paragraphs on any subject at any moment s notice But what should he do down at Buston There were three persons there with whom he would have to contend his father his mother and his uncle With his father he had always been on good terms but had still been subject to a certain amount of gentle sarcasm He had got his fellowship and his allowance and so had been lifted above his father s authority His father thoroughly despised his brother in law and looked down upon him as an absolute ass But he was reticent only dropping a word here and there out of deference perhaps to his wife and from a feeling lest his son might be deficient in wise courtesy if he were encouraged to laugh at his benefactor He had said a word or two as to a profession when Harry left Cambridge but the word or two had come to nothing In those days the uncle had altogether ridiculed the idea and the mother fond of her son the fellow and the heir had altogether opposed the notion The rector himself was an idle good looking self indulgent man a man who read a little and understood what he read and thought a little and understood what he thought but who took no trouble about anything To go through the world comfortably with a rather large family and a rather small income was the extent of his ambition In regard to his eldest son he had begun well Harry had been educated free and had got a fellowship He had never cost his father a shilling And now the eldest of two grown up daughters was engaged to be married to the son of a brewer living in the little town of Buntingford This also was a piece of good luck which the rector accepted with a thankful heart There was another grown up girl also pretty and then a third girl not grown up and the two boys who were at present at school at Royston Thus burdened the reverend mister Annesley went through the world with as jaunty a step as was possible making but little of his troubles but anxious to make as much as he could of his advantages Of these the position of Harry was the brightest if only Harry would be careful to guard it It was quite out of the question that he should find an income for Harry if the squire stopped the two hundred and fifty pounds per annum which he at present allowed him Then there was Harry s mother who had already very frequently discounted the good things which were to fall to Harry s lot She was a dear good motherly woman all whose geese were certainly counted to be swans And of all swans Harry was the whitest whereas in purity of plumage Mary the eldest daughter who had won the affections of the young Buntingford brewer was the next That Harry s allowance should be stopped would be almost as great a misfortune as though mister Thoroughbung were to break his neck out hunting with the Puckeridge hounds an amusement which after the manner of brewers he was much in the habit of following missus Annesley had lived at Buston all her life having been born at the Hall She was an excellent mother of a family and a good clergyman s wife being in both respects more painstaking and assiduous than her husband But she did maintain something of respect for her brother though in her inmost heart she knew that he was a fool But to have been born Squire of Buston was something and to have reached the age of fifty unmarried so as to leave the position of heir open to her own son was more To such a one a great deal was due but of that deal Harry was but little disposed to pay any part He must be talked to and very seriously talked to and if possible saved from the sin of offending his easily offended uncle A terrible idea had been suggested to her lately by her husband The entail might be made altogether inoperative by the marriage of her brother It was a fearful notion but one which if it entered into her brother s head might possibly be carried out No one before had ever dreamed of anything so dangerous to the Annesley interests and missus Annesley now felt that by due submission on the part of the heir it might be avoided But the squire himself was the foe whom Harry most feared He quite understood that he would be required to be submissive and even if he were willing he did not know how to act the part There was much now that he would endure for the sake of Florence If mister Prosper demanded that after dinner he should hear a sermon he would sit and hear it out It would be a bore but might be endured on behalf of the girl whom he loved But he much feared that the cause of his uncle s displeasure was deeper than that A rumor had reached him that his uncle had declared his conduct to Mountjoy Scarborough to have been abominable He had heard no words spoken by his uncle but threats had reached him through his mother and also through his uncle s man of business He certainly would go down to Buston and carry himself toward his uncle with what outward signs of respect would be possible But if his uncle accused him he could not but tell his uncle that he knew nothing of the matter of which he was talking Not for all Buston could he admit that he had done anything mean or ignoble Florence he was quite sure would not desire it Florence would not be Florence were she to desire it He thought that he could trace the hands or rather the tongues through which the calumny had made its way down to the Hall He would at once go to the Hall and tell his uncle all the facts He would describe the gross ill usage to which he had been subjected No doubt he had left the man sprawling upon the pavement but there had been no sign that the man had been dangerously hurt and when two days afterward the man had vanished it was clear that he could not have vanished without legs Had he taken himself off as was probable then why need Harry trouble himself as to his vanishing If some one else had helped him in escaping as was also probable why had not that some one come and told the circumstances when all the inquiries were being made Why should he have been expected to speak of the circumstances of such an encounter which could not have been told but to Captain Scarborough s infinite disgrace And he could not have told of it without naming Florence Mountjoy His uncle when he heard the truth must acknowledge that he had not behaved badly And yet Harry as he turned it all in his mind was uneasy as to his own conduct He could not quite acquit himself in that he had kept secret all the facts of that midnight encounter in the face of the inquiries which had been made in that he had falsely assured Augustus Scarborough of his ignorance And yet he knew that on no consideration would he acknowledge himself to have been wrong CHAPTER XXIII THE RUMORS AS TO mister PROSPER It was still October when Harry Annesley went down to Buston and the Mountjoys had just reached Brussels mister Grey had made his visit to Tretton and had returned to London Harry went home on an understanding on the part of his mother at any rate that he should remain there till Christmas But he felt himself very averse to so long a sojourn If the Hall and park were open to him he might endure it He would take down two or three stiff books which he certainly would never read and would shoot a few pheasants and possibly ride one of his future brother in law s horses with the hounds But he feared that there was to be a quarrel by which he would be debarred from the Hall and the park and he knew too that it would not be well for him to shoot and hunt when his income should have been cut off It would be necessary that some great step should be taken at once but then it would be necessary also that Florence should agree to that step He had a modest lodging in London but before he started he prepared himself for what must occur by giving notice I don t say as yet that I shall give them up but I might as well let you know that it s possible This he said to missus Brown who kept the lodgings and who received this intimation as a missus Brown is sure to do But where should he betake himself when his home at missus Brown s had been lost He would he thought find it quite impossible to live in absolute idleness at the rectory Then in an unhappy frame of mind he went down by the train to Stevenage and was there met by the rectory pony carriage He saw it all in his mother s eye the moment she embraced him There was some terrible trouble in the wind and what could it be but his uncle Well mother what is it Oh Harry there is such a sad affair up at the Hall Is my uncle dead Dead No Then why do you look so sad Even such a man so faint so spiritless So dull so dead in look so woe begone Drew Priam s curtain in the dead of night Oh Harry do not laugh Your uncle says such dreadful things I don t care much what he says The question is what does he mean to do He declares that he will cut you off altogether That is sooner said than done That is all very well Harry but he can do it Oh Harry But come and sit down and talk to me I told your father to be out so that I might have you alone and the dear girls are gone into Buntingford Ah like them Thoroughbung will have enough of them He is our only happiness now Poor Thoroughbung I pity him if he has to do happiness for the whole household Joshua is a most excellent young man Where we should be without him I do not know The flourishing young brewer was named Joshua and had been known to Harry for some years though never as yet known as a brother in law I am sure he is particularly as he has chosen Molly to be his wife He is just the young man who ought to have a wife Of course he ought Because he can keep a family But now about my uncle He is to perform this ceremony of cutting me off Will he turn out to have had a wife and family in former ages I have no doubt old Scarborough could manage it but I don t give my uncle credit for so much cleverness But in future ages said the unhappy mother shaking her head and rubbing her eyes You mean that he is going to have a family It is all in the hands of Providence said the parson s wife Yes that is true He is not too old yet to be a second Priam and have his curtains drawn the other way That s his little game is it There s a sort of rumor about that it is possible And who is the lady You may be sure there will be no lack of a lady if he sets his mind upon it I was turning it over in my mind and I thought of Matilda Thoroughbung Joshua s aunt Well she is Joshua s aunt no doubt I did just whisper the idea to Joshua and he says that she is fool enough for anything She has twenty five thousand pounds of her own but she lives all by herself I know where she lives just out of Buntingford as you go to Royston But she s not alone Is Uncle Prosper to marry Miss Tickle also Miss Tickle was an estimable lady living as companion to Miss Thoroughbung I don t know how they may manage but it has to be thought of Harry We only know that your uncle has been twice to Buntingford The lady is fifty at any rate The lady is barely forty She gives out that she is thirty six And he could settle a jointure on her which would leave the property not worth having What can I do Yes indeed my dear what can you do Why is he going to upset all the arrangements of my life and his life after such a fashion as this That s just what your father says I suppose he can do it The law will allow him But the injustice would be monstrous I did not ask him to take me by the hand when I was a boy and lead me into this special walk of life It has been his own doing How will he look me in the face and tell me that he is going to marry a wife I shall look him in the face and tell him of my wife But is that settled Yes mother it is settled Wish me joy for having won the finest lady that ever walked the earth His mother blessed him but said nothing about the finest lady who at that moment she believed to be the future bride of mister Joshua Thoroughbung And when I shall tell my uncle that it is so what will he say to me Will he have the face then to tell me that I am to be cut out of Buston I doubt whether he will have the courage He has thought of that Harry How thought of it mother He has given orders that he is not to see you Not to see me So he declares He has written a long letter to your father in which he says that he would be spared the agony of an interview What is it all done then Your father got the letter yesterday It must have taken my poor brother a week to write it And he tells the whole plan Matilda Thoroughbung and the future family No he does not say anything about Miss Thoroughbung He says that he must make other arrangements about the property He can t make other arrangements that is not until the boy is born It may be a long time first you know But the jointure What does Molly say about it Molly is mad about it and so is Joshua Joshua talks about it just as though he were one of us and he says that the old people at Buntingford would not hear of it The old people spoken of were the father and mother of Joshua and the half brother of Miss Matilda Thoroughbung But what can they do They can do nothing If Miss Matilda likes Uncle Prosper Likes my dear How young you are Of course she would like a country house to live in and the park and the county society And she would like somebody to live with besides Miss Tickle My uncle for instance Yes your uncle If I had my choice mother I should prefer Miss Tickle Because you are a silly boy But what are you to do now In this long letter which he has written to my father does he give no reason Your father will show you the letter Of course he gives reasons He says that you have done something which you ought not to have done about that wretched Mountjoy Scarborough What does he know about it the idiot Oh Harry Well mother what better can I say of him He has taken me as a child and fashioned my life for me has said that this property should be mine and has put an income into my hand as though I were an eldest son has repeatedly declared when his voice was more potent than mine that I should follow no profession He has bound himself to me telling all the world that I was his heir And now he casts me out because he has heard some cock and bull story of the truth of which he knows nothing What better can I say of him than call him an idiot He must be that or else a heartless knave And he says that he does not mean to see me me with whose life he has thus been empowered to interfere so as to blast it if not to bless it and intends to turn me adrift as he might do a dog that did not suit him And because he knows that he cannot answer me he declares that he will not see me It is very hard Harry Therefore I call him an idiot in preference to calling him a knave But I am not going to be dropped out of the running in that way just in deference to his will I shall see him Unless they lock him up in his bedroom I shall compel him to see me What good would that do Harry That would only set him more against you You don t know his weakness Oh yes I do he is very weak He will not see me because he will have to yield when he hears what I have to say for myself He knows that and would therefore fain keep away from me Why should he be stirred to this animosity against me Why indeed Because there is some one who wishes to injure me more strong than he is and who has got hold of him Some one has lied behind my back Who has done this Ah that is the question But I know who has done it though I will not name him just now This enemy of mine knowing him to be weak knowing him to be an idiot has got hold of him and persuaded him He believes the story which is told to him and then feels happy in shaking off an incubus No doubt I have not been very soft with him nor indeed hard I have kept out of his way and he is willing to resent it but he is afraid to face me and tell me that it is so Here are the girls come back from Buntingford Molly you blooming young bride I wish you joy of your brewer He s none the worse on that account Master Harry said the eldest sister All the better very much the better Where would you be if he was not a brewer But I congratulate you with all my heart old girl I have known him ever so long and he is one of the best fellows I do know Thank you Harry and she kissed him I wish Fanny and Kate may even do so well All in good time said Fanny I mean to have a banker all to myself said Kate I wish you may have half as good a man for your husband said Harry And I am to tell you continued Molly who was now in high good humor that there will be always one of his horses for you to ride as long as you remain at home It is not every brother in law that would do as much as that for you Nor yet every uncle said Kate shaking her head from which Harry could see that this quarrel with his uncle had been freely discussed in the family circle Uncles are very different said the mother uncles can t be expected to do everything as though they were in love Fancy Uncle Peter in love said Kate mister Prosper was called Uncle Peter by the girls though always in a sort of joke Then the other two girls shook their heads very gravely from which Harry learned that the question respecting the choice of Miss Matilda Thoroughbung as a mistress for the Hall had been discussed also before them I am not going to marry all the family said Molly Not Miss Matilda for instance said her brother laughing No especially not Matilda Joshua is quite as angry about his aunt as anybody here can be You ll find that he is more of an Annesley than a Thoroughbung My dear said the mother your husband will as a matter of course think most of his own family And so ought you to do of his family which will be yours A married woman should always think most of her husband s family In this way the mother told her daughter of her future duties but behind the mother s back Kate made a grimace for the benefit of her sister Fanny showing thereby her conviction that in a matter of blood what she called being a gentleman a Thoroughbung could not approach an Annesley Mamma does not know it as yet Molly said afterward in privacy to her brother but you may take it for granted that Uncle Peter has been into Buntingford and has made an offer to Aunt Matilda I could tell it at once because she looked so sharp at me to day And Joshua says that he is sure it is so by the airs she gives herself You think she ll have him Have him Of course she ll have him Why shouldn t she A wretched old maid living with a companion like that would have any one She has got a lot of money She ll take care of her money let her alone for that And she ll have his house to live in And there ll be a jointure Of course if there were to be children Oh bother Well perhaps there will not But it will be just as bad We don t mean even to visit them we think it so very wicked And we shall tell them a bit of our mind as soon as the thing has been publicly declared CHAPTER XXIV HARRY ANNESLEY S MISERY The conversation which took place that evening between Harry and his father was more serious in its language though not more important in its purpose This is bad news Harry said the rector Yes indeed sir Your uncle no doubt can do as he pleases You mean as to the income he has allowed me As to the income As to the property itself It is bad waiting for dead men s shoes And yet it is what everybody does in this world No one can say that I have been at all in a hurry to step into my uncle s shoes It was he that first told you that he should never marry and as the property had been entailed on me he undertook to bring me up as his son So he did Not a doubt about it sir But I had nothing to say to it As far as I understand he has been allowing me two hundred and fifty pounds a year for the last dozen years Ever since you went to the Charter house At that time I could not be expected to have a word to say to it And it has gone on ever since Yes it has gone on ever since And when I was leaving Cambridge he required that I should not go into a profession Not exactly that Harry It was so that I understood it He did not wish his heir to be burdened with a profession He said so to me himself Yes just when he was in his pride because you had got your fellowship But there was a contract understood if not made What contract asked Harry with an air of surprise That you should be to him as a son I never undertook it I wouldn t have done it at the price or for any price I never felt for him the respect or the love that were due to a father I did feel both of them to the full for my own father They are a sort of a thing which we cannot transfer They may be shared Harry said the rector who was flattered No sir in this instance that was not possible You might have sat by while he read a sermon to his sister and nieces You understood his vanity and you wounded it knowing what you were doing I don t mean to blame you but it was a misfortune Now we must look it in the face and see what must be done Your mother has told you that he has written to me There is his letter You will see that he writes with a fixed purpose Then he handed to Harry a letter written on a large sheet of paper the reading of which would be so long that Harry seated himself for the operation The letter need not here be repeated at length It was written with involved sentences but in very decided language It said nothing of Harry s want of duty or not attending to the sermons or of other deficiencies of a like nature but based his resolution in regard to stopping the income on his nephew s misconduct as it appeared to him in a certain particular case And unfortunately though Harry was prepared to deny that his conduct on that occasion had been subject to censure he could not contradict any of the facts on which mister Prosper had founded his opinion The story was told in reference to Mountjoy Scarborough but not the whole story I understand that there was a row in the streets late at night at the end of which young mister Scarborough was left as dead under the railings Left for dead exclaimed Harry Who says that he was left for dead I did not think him to be dead You had better read it to the end said his father and Harry read it The letter went on to describe how Mountjoy Scarborough was missed from his usual haunts how search was made by the police how the newspapers were filled with the strange incident and how Harry had told nothing of what had occurred But beyond this the letter went on to say he positively denied in conversation with the gentleman s brother that he had anything to do with the gentleman on the night in question If this be so he absolutely lied A man who would lie on such an occasion knowing himself to have been guilty of having beaten the man in such a way as to have probably caused his death for he had left him for dead under the railings in a London street and in the midnight hour and would positively assert to the gentleman s brother that he had not seen the gentleman on the night in question when he had every reason to believe that he had killed him a deed which might or might not be murder is not fit to be recognized as my heir There were other sentences equally long and equally complicated in all of which mister Prosper strove to tell the story with tragic effect but all of which had reference to the same transaction He said nothing as to the ultimate destination of the property nor of his own proposed marriage Should he have a son that son would of course have the property Should there be no son Harry must have it even though his conduct might have been ever so abominable To prevent this outrage on society his marriage with its ordinary results would be the only step Of that he need say nothing But the two hundred and fifty pounds would not be paid after the Christmas quarter and he must decline for the future the honor of receiving mister Henry Annesley at the Hall Harry when he had read it all began to storm with anger The man as he truly observed had grossly insulted him mister Prosper had called him a liar and had hinted that he was a murderer You can do nothing to him his father said He is your uncle and you have eaten his bread I can t call him out and fight him You must let it alone I can make my way into the house and see him I don t think you can do that You will find it difficult to get beyond the front door and I would advise you to abandon all such ideas What can you say to him It is false What is false Though in essence it is false in words it is true You did deny that you had seen him I forget what passed Augustus Scarborough endeavored to pump me about his brother and I did not choose to be pumped As far as I can ascertain now it is he that is the liar He saw his brother after the affair with me Has he denied it Practically he denies it by asking me the question He asked me with the ostensible object of finding out what had become of his brother when he himself knew what had become of him But you can t prove it He positively says that you did deny having seen him on the night in question I am not speaking of Augustus Scarborough but of your uncle What he says is true and you had better leave him alone Take other steps for driving the real truth into his brain What steps can be taken with such a fool Write your own account of the transaction so that he shall read it Let your mother have it I suppose he will see your mother And so beg his favor You need beg for nothing Or if the marriage comes off You have heard of the marriage sir Yes I have heard of the marriage I believe that he contemplates it Put your statement of what did occur and of your motives into the hands of the lady s friends He will be sure to read it What good will that do No good but that of making him ashamed of himself You have got to read the world a little more deeply than you have hitherto done He thinks that he is quarrelling with you about the affair in London but it is in truth because you have declined to hear him read the sermons after having taken his money Then it is he that is the liar rather than I I who am a moderate man would say that neither is a liar You did not choose to be pumped as you call it and therefore spoke as you did According to the world s ways that was fair enough He who is sore at the little respect you have paid him takes any ground of offence rather than that Being sore at heart he believes anything This young Scarborough in some way gets hold of him and makes him accept this cock and bull story If you had sat there punctual all those Sunday evenings do you think he would have believed it then And I have got to pay such a penalty as this The rector could only shrug his shoulders He was not disposed to scold his son It was not the custom of the house that Harry should be scolded He was a fellow of his college and the heir to Buston and was therefore considered to be out of the way of scolding But the rector felt that his son had made his bed and must now lie on it and Harry was aware that this was his father s feeling For two or three days he wandered about the country very down in the mouth The natural state of ovation in which the girls existed was in itself an injury to him How could he join them in their ovation he who had suffered so much It seemed to be heartless that they should smile and rejoice when he the head of the family as he had been taught to consider himself was being so cruelly ill used For a day or two he hated Thoroughbung though Thoroughbung was all that was kind to him He congratulated him with cold congratulations and afterward kept out of his way Remember Harry that up to Christmas you can always have one of the nags There s Belladonna and Orange Peel I think you d find the mare a little the faster though perhaps the horse is the bigger jumper Oh thank you said Harry and passed on Now Thoroughbung was fond of his horses and liked to have them talked about and he knew that Harry Annesley was treating him badly But he was a good humored fellow and he bore it without complaint He did not even say a cross word to Molly Molly however was not so patient You might be a little more gracious when he s doing the best he can for you It is not every one who will lend you a horse to hunt for two months Harry shook his head and wandered away miserable through the fields and would not in these days even set his foot upon the soil of the park He was not going to intrude any farther he said to the rector You can come to church at any rate his father said for he certainly will not be there while you are at the parsonage Oh yes Harry would go to the church I have yet to understand that mister Prosper is owner of the church and the path there from the rectory is at any rate open to the public for at Buston the church stands on one corner of the park This went on for two or three days during which nothing farther was said by the family as to Harry s woes A letter was sent off to missus Brown telling her that the lodgings would not be required any longer and anxious ideas began to crowd themselves on Harry s mind as to his future residence He thought that he must go back to Cambridge and take his rooms at saint John s and look for college work Two fatal years years of idleness and gayety had been passed but still he thought that it might be possible What else was there open for him And then as he roamed about the fields his mind naturally ran away to the girl he loved How would he dare again to look Florence in the face It was not only the two hundred and fifty pounds per annum that was gone that would have been a small income on which to marry And he had never taken the girl s own money into account He had rather chosen to look forward to the position as squire of Buston and to take it for granted that it would not be very long before he was called upon to fill the position He had said not a word to Florence about money but it was thus that he had regarded the matter Now the existing squire was going to marry and the matter could not so be regarded any longer He saw half a dozen little Prospers occupying half a dozen little cradles and a whole suite of nurseries established at the Hall The name of Prosper would be fixed at Buston putting it altogether beyond his reach In such circumstances would it not be reasonable that Florence should expect him to authorize her to break their engagement What was he now but the penniless son of a poor clergyman with nothing on which to depend but a miserable stipend which must cease were he to marry He knew that he ought to give her back her troth and yet as he thought of doing so he was indignant with her Was love to come to this Was her regard for him to be counted as nothing What right had he to expect that she should be different from any other girl Then he was more miserable than ever as he told himself that such would undoubtedly be her conduct As he walked across the fields heavy with the mud of a wet October day there came down a storm of rain which wet him through Who does not know the sort of sensation which falls upon a man when he feels that even the elements have turned against him how he buttons up his coat and bids the clouds open themselves upon his devoted bosom Blow winds and crack your cheeks rage blow You cataracts and hurricanes It is thus that a man is apt to address the soft rains of heaven when he is becoming wet through in such a frame of mind and on the present occasion Harry likened himself to Leer It was to him as though the steeples were to be drenched and the cocks drowned when he found himself wet through In this condition he went back to the house and so bitter to him were the misfortunes of the world that he would hardly condescend to speak while enduring them But when he had entered the drawing room his mother greeted him with a letter It had come by the day mail and his mother looked into his face piteously as she gave it to him The letter was from Brussels and she could guess from whom it had come It might be a sweetly soft love letter but then it might be neither sweet nor soft in the condition of things in which Harry was now placed He took it and looked at it but did not dare to open it on the spur of the moment Without a word he went up to his room and then tore it asunder No doubt he said to himself it would allude to his miserable stipend and penniless condition The letter ran as follows DEAREST HARRY I think it right to write to you though mamma does not approve of it I have told her however that in the present circumstances I am bound to do so and that I should implore you not to answer Though I must write there must be no correspondence between us Rumors have been received here very detrimental to your character Harry gnashed his teeth as he read this Stories are told about your meeting with Captain Scarborough in London which I know to be only in part true Mamma says that because of them I ought to give up my engagement and my uncle Sir Magnus has taken upon himself to advise me to do so I have told them both that that which is said of you is in part untrue but whether it be true or whether it be false I will never give up my engagement unless you ask me to do so They tell me that as regards your pecuniary prospects you are ruined I say that you cannot be ruined as long as you have my income It will not be much but it will I should think be enough And now you can do as you please You may be quite sure that I shall be true to you through ill report and good report Nothing that mamma can say to me will change me and certainly nothing from Sir Magnus And now there need not be a word from you if you mean to be true to me Indeed I have promised that there shall be no word and I expect you to keep my promise for me If you wish to be free of me then you must write and say so But you won t wish it and therefore I am yours always always always your own FLORENCE Harry read the letter standing up in the middle of the room and in half a minute he had torn off his wet coat and kicked one of his wet boots to the farther corner of the room Then there was a knock at the door and his mother entered Tell me Harry what she says He rushed up to his mother all damp and half shod as he was and seized her in his arms Oh mother mother What is it dear Read that and tell me whether there ever was a finer human being missus Annesley did read it and thought that her own daughter Molly was just as fine a creature Florence was simply doing what any girl of spirit would do But she saw that her son was as jubilant now as he had been downcast and she was quite willing to partake of his comfort Not write a word to her Ha ha I think I see myself at it But she seems to be in earnest there In earnest And so am I in earnest Would it be possible that a fellow should hold his hand and not write Yes my girl I think that I must write a line I wonder what she would say if I were not to write I think she means that you should be silent She has taken a very odd way of assuming it I am to keep her promise for her my darling my angel my life But I cannot do that one thing Oh mother mother if you knew how happy I am What the mischief does it all signify Uncle Prosper Miss Thoroughbung and the rest of it with a girl like that CHAPTER XXV HARRY AND HIS UNCLE Harry was kissed all round by the girls and was congratulated warmly on the heavenly excellence of his mistress They could afford to be generous if he would be good natured Of course you must write to her said Molly when he came down stairs with dry clothes I should think so mother Only she does seem to be so much in earnest about it said missus Annesley I think she would rather get just a line to say that he is in earnest too said Fanny Why should not she like a love letter as much as any one else said Kate who had her own ideas Of course she has to tell him about her mamma but what need he care for that Of course mamma thinks that Joshua need not write to Molly but Molly won t mind I don t think anything of the kind miss And besides Joshua lives in the next parish said Fanny and has a horse to ride over on if he has anything to say At any rate I shall write said Harry even at the risk of making her angry And he did write as follows BUSTON October one hundred eighty eight MY OWN DEAR GIRL It is impossible that I should not send one line in answer Put yourself in my place and consult your own feelings Think that you have a letter so full of love so noble so true so certain to fill you with joy and then say whether you would let it pass without a word of acknowledgment It would be absolutely impossible It is not very probable that I should ask you to break your engagement which in the midst of my troubles is the only consolation I have But when a man has a rock to stand upon like that he does not want anything else As long as a man has the one person necessary to his happiness to believe in him he can put up with the ill opinion of all the others You are to me so much that you outweigh all the world I did not choose to have my secret pumped out of me by Augustus Scarborough I can tell you the whole truth now Mountjoy Scarborough had told me that he regarded you as affianced to him and required me to say that I would drop you You know now how probable that was He was drunk on the occasion had made himself purposely drunk so as to get over all scruples and attacked me with his stick Then came a scrimmage in which he was upset A sober man has always the best of it I am afraid that Harry put in that little word sober for a purpose The opportunity of declaring that he was sober was too good too be lost I went away and left him certainly not dead nor apparently much hurt But if I told all this to Augustus Scarborough your name must have come out Now I should not mind Now I might tell the truth about you with great pride if occasion required it But I couldn t do it then What would the world have said to two men fighting in the streets about a girl neither of whom had a right to fight about her That was the reason why I told an untruth because I did not choose to fall into the trap which Augustus Scarborough had laid for me If your mother will understand it all I do not think she will object to me on that score If she does quarrel with me she will only be fighting the Scarborough game in which I am bound to oppose her I am afraid the fact is that she prefers the Scarborough game not because of my sins but from auld lang syne But Augustus has got hold of my Uncle Prosper and has done me a terrible injury My uncle is a weak man and has been predisposed against me from other circumstances He thinks that I have neglected him and is willing to believe anything against me He has stopped my income two hundred and fifty pounds a year and is going to revenge himself on me by marrying a wife It is too absurd and the proposed wife is aunt of the man whom my sister is going to marry It makes such a heap of confusion Of course if he becomes the father of a family I shall be nowhere Had I not better take to some profession Only what shall I take to It is almost too late for the Bar I must see you and talk over it all You have commanded me not to write and now there is a long letter It is as well to be hung for a sheep as a lamb But when a man s character is at stake he feels that he must plead for it You won t be angry with me because I have not done all that you told me It was absolutely necessary that I should tell you that I did not mean to ask you to break your engagement and one word has led to all the others There shall be only one other which means more than all the rest that I am yours dearest with all my heart HARRY ANNESLEY There he said to himself as he put the letter into the envelope she may think it too long but I am sure she would not have been pleased had I not written at all That afternoon Joshua was at the rectory having just trotted over after business hours at the brewery because of some special word which had to be whispered to Molly and Harry put himself in his way as he went out to get on his horse in the stable yard Joshua he said I know that I owe you an apology What for You have been awfully good to me about the horses and I have been very ungracious Not at all But I have The truth is I have been made thoroughly miserable by circumstances and when that occurs a man cannot pick himself up all at once It isn t my uncle that has made me wretched That is a kind of thing that a man has to put up with and I think that I can bear it as well as another But an attack has been made upon me which has wounded me I know all about it I don t mind telling you as you and Molly are going to hit it off together There is a girl I love and they have tried to interfere with her They haven t succeeded No by George And now I m as right as a trivet When it came across me that she might have might have yielded you know it was as though all had been over I ought not to have suspected her But she s all right Indeed she is I think you ll like her when you see her some day If you don t you have the most extraordinary taste I ever knew a man to possess How about the horse I have four you know What a grand thing it is to be a brewer And there are two of them will carry you The other two are not quite up to your weight You haven t been out yet Well no not exactly out The governor is the best fellow in the world but he draws the line at cub hunting He says the business should be the business till November Upon my word I think he s right And how many days a week after that Well three regular I do get an odd day with the Essex sometimes and the governor winks The governor hunts himself as often as you Oh dear no three a week does for the governor and he is beginning to like frosty weather and to hear with pleasure that one of the old horses isn t as fit as he should be He s what they call training off Good bye old fellow Mind you come out on the seventh of November But Harry though he had been made happy by the letter from Florence had still a great many troubles on his mind His first trouble was the having to do something in reference to his uncle It did not appear to him to be proper to accept his uncle s decision in regard to his income without at any rate attempting to see mister Prosper It would be as though he had taken what was done as a matter of course as though his uncle could stop the income without leaving him any ground of complaint Of the intended marriage if it were intended he would say nothing His uncle had never promised him in so many words not to marry and there would be he thought something ignoble in his asking his uncle not to do that which he intended to do himself without even consulting his uncle about it As he turned it all over in his mind he began to ask himself why his uncle should be asked to do anything for him whereas he had never done anything for his uncle He had been told that he was the heir not to the uncle but to Buston and had gradually been taught to look upon Buston as his right as though he had a certain defeasible property in the acres He now began to perceive that there was no such thing A tacit contract had been made on his behalf and he had declined to accept his share of the contract But he had been debarred from following any profession by his uncle s promised allowance He did not think that he could complain to his uncle about the proposed marriage but he did think that he could ask a question or two as to the income Without saying a word to any of his own family he walked across the park and presented himself at the front door of Buston Hall In doing so he would not go upon the grass He had told his father that he would not enter the park and therefore kept himself to the road And he had dressed himself with some little care as a man does when he feels that he is going forth on some mission of importance Had he intended to call on old mister Thoroughbung there would have been no such care And he rung at the front door instead of entering the house by any of the numerous side inlets with which he was well acquainted The butler understood the ring and put on his company coat when he answered the bell Is my uncle at home Matthew he said mister Prosper mister Harry Well no I can t say that he just is and the old man groaned and wheezed and looked unhappy He is not often out at this time Matthew groaned again and wheezed more deeply and looked unhappier I suppose you mean to say that he has given orders that I am not to be admitted To this the butler made no answer but only looked woefully into the young man s face What is the meaning of it all Matthew Oh mister Harry you shouldn t ask me as is merely a servant Harry felt the truth of this rebuke but was not going to put up with it That s all my eye Matthew you know all about it as well as any one It is so He does not want to see me I don t think he does mister Harry And why not You know the whole of my family story as well as my father does or my uncle Why does he shut his doors against me and send me word that he does not want to see me Well mister Harry I m not just able to say why he does it and you the heir But if I was asked I should make answer that it has come along of them sermons Then Matthew looked very serious and bathed his head I suppose so That was it mister Harry We none of us were very fond of the sermons I dare say not We in the kitchen But we was bound to have them or we should have lost our places And now I must lose my place The butler said nothing but his face assented A little hard isn t it Matthew But I wish to say a few words to my uncle not to express any regret about the sermons but to ask what it is that he intends to do Here Matthew shook his head very slowly He has given positive orders that I shall not be admitted It must be over my dead body mister Harry and he stood in the way with the door in his hand as though intending to sacrifice himself should he be called upon to do so by the nature of the circumstances Harry however did not put him to the test but bidding him good bye with some little joke as to his fidelity made his way back to the parsonage That night before he went to bed he wrote a letter to his uncle as to which he said not a word to either his father or mother or sisters He thought that the letter was a good letter and would have been proud to show it but he feared that either his father or mother would advise him not to send it and he was ashamed to read it to Molly He therefore sent the letter across the park the next morning by the gardener The letter was as follows MY DEAR UNCLE My father has shown me your letter to him and of course I feel it incumbent on me to take some notice of it Not wishing to trouble you with a letter I called this morning but I was told by Matthew that you would not see me As you have expressed yourself to my father very severely as to my conduct I am sure you will agree with me that I ought not to let the matter pass by without making my own defence You say that there was a row in the streets between Mountjoy Scarborough and myself in which he was left for dead When I left him I did not think he had been much hurt nor have I had reason to think so since He had attacked me and I had simply defended myself He had come upon me by surprise and when I had shaken him off I went away Then in a day or two he had disappeared Had he been killed or much hurt the world would have heard of it but the world simply heard that he had disappeared which could hardly have been the case had he been much hurt Then you say that I denied in conversation with Augustus Scarborough that I had seen his brother on the night in question I did deny it Augustus Scarborough who was evidently well acquainted with the whole transaction and who had I believe assisted his brother in disappearing wished to learn from me what I had done and to hide what he had done He wished to saddle me with the disgrace of his brother s departure and I did not choose to fall into his trap At the moment of his asking me he knew that his brother was safe I think that the word lie as used by you is very severe for such an occurrence A man is not generally held to be bound to tell everything respecting himself to the first person that shall ask him If you will ask any man who knows the world my father for instance I think you will be told that such conduct was not faulty But it is at any rate necessary that I should ask you what you intend to do in reference to my future life I am told that you intend to stop the income which I have hitherto received Will this be considerate on your part In his first copy of the letter Harry had asked whether it would be fair and had then changed the word for one that was milder When I took my degree you yourself said that it would not be necessary that I should go into any profession because you would allow me an income and would then provide for me I took your advice in opposition to my father s because it seemed then that I was to depend on you rather than on him You cannot deny that I shall have been treated hardly if I now be turned loose upon the world I shall be happy to come and see you if you shall wish it so as to save you the trouble of writing to me Your affectionate nephew HENRY ANNESLEY Harry might have been sure that his uncle would not see him probably was sure when he added the last paragraph mister Prosper enjoyed greatly two things the mysticism of being invisible and the opportunity of writing a letter mister Prosper had not a large correspondence but it was laborious and as he thought effective He believed that he did know how to write a letter and he went about it with a will It was not probable that he would make himself common by seeing his nephew on such an occasion or that he would omit the opportunity of spending an entire morning with pen and ink The result was very short but to his idea it was satisfactory SIR he began He considered this matter very deeply but as the entire future of his own life was concerned in it he felt that it became him to be both grave and severe I have received your letter and have read it with attention I observe that you admit that you told mister Augustus Scarborough a deliberate untruth This is what the plain speaking world when it wishes to be understood as using the unadorned English language which is always the language which I prefer myself calls a lie A LIE I do not choose that this humble property shall fall at my death into the hands of A LIAR Therefore I shall take steps to prevent it which may or may not be successful As such steps whatever may be their result are to be taken the income intended to prepare you for another alternative which may possibly not now be forth coming will naturally now be no longer allowed I am sir your obedient servant PETER PROSPER The first effect of the letter was to produce laughter at the rectory Harry could not but show it to his father and in an hour or two it became known to his mother and sister and under an oath of secrecy to Joshua Thoroughbung It could not be matter of laughter when the future hopes of Miss Matilda Thoroughbung were taken into consideration I declare I don t know what you are all laughing about said Kate except that Uncle Peter does use such comical phrases But missus Annesley though the most good hearted woman in the world was almost angry I don t know what you all see to laugh at in it Peter has in his hands the power of making or marring Harry s future But he hasn t said Harry Or he mayn t have said the rector It s all in the hands of the Almighty said missus Annesley who felt herself bound to retire from the room and to take her daughter with her But when they were alone both the father and his son were very angry I have done with him forever said Harry Let come what may I will never see him or speak to him again A lie and liar He has written those words in that way so as to salve his own conscience for the injustice he is doing He knows that I am not a liar He cannot understand what a liar means or he would know that he is one himself A man seldom has such knowledge as that Is it not so when he stigmatizes me in this way merely as an excuse to himself He wants to be rid of me probably because I did not sit and hear him read the sermons Let that pass I may have been wrong in that and he may be justified but because of that he cannot believe really that I have been a liar a liar in such a determined way as to make me unfit to be his heir He is a fool Harry That is the worst of him I don t think it is the worst You cannot have worse It is dreadful to have to depend on a fool to have to trust to a man who cannot tell wrong from right Your uncle intends to be a good man If it were brought home to him that he were doing a wrong he would not do it He would not rob he would not steal he must not commit murder and the rest of it But he is a fool and he does not know when he is doing these things I will wash my hands of him Yes and he will wash his hands of you You do not know him as I do He has taken it into his silly head that you are the chief of sinners because you said what was not true to that man who seems really to be the sinner and nothing will eradicate the idea He will go and marry that woman because he thinks that in that way he can best carry his purpose and then he will repent at leisure I used to tell you that you had better listen to the sermons And now I must pay for it Well my boy it is no good crying for spilt milk As I was saying just now there is nothing worse than a fool CHAPTER XXVI MARMADUKE LODGE On the seventh of next month two things occurred each of great importance Hunting commenced in the Puckeridge country and Harry with that famous mare Belladonna was there And Squire Prosper was driven in his carriage into Buntingford and made his offer with all due formality to Miss Thoroughbung The whole household including Matthew and the cook and the coachman and the boy and the two house maids knew what he was going to do It would be difficult to say how they knew because he was a man who never told anything He was the last man in England who on such a matter would have made a confidant of his butler He never spoke to a servant about matters unconnected with their service He considered that to do so would be altogether against his dignity Nevertheless when he ordered his carriage which he did not do very frequently at this time of the year when the horses were wanted on the farm and of which he gave twenty four hours notice to all the persons concerned and when early in the morning he ordered that his Sunday suit should be prepared for wearing and when his aspect grew more and more serious as the hour drew nigh it was well understood by them all that he was going to make the offer that day He was both proud and fearful as to the thing to be done proud that he the Squire of Buston should be called on to take so important a step proud by anticipation of his feelings as he would return home a jolly thriving wooer and yet a little fearful lest he might not succeed Were he to fail the failure would be horrible to him He knew that every man and woman about the place would know all about it Among the secrets of the family there was a story never now mentioned of his having done the same thing once before He was then a young man about twenty five and he had come forth to lay himself and Buston at the feet of a baronet s daughter who lived some twenty five miles off She was very beautiful and was said to have a fitting dower but he had come back and had shut himself up in the house for a week afterward To no human ears had he ever since spoken of his interview with Miss Courteney The doings of that day had been wrapped in impenetrable darkness But all Buston and the neighboring parishes had known that Miss Courteney had refused him Since that day he had never gone forth again on such a mission There were those who said of him that his love had been so deep and enduring that he had never got the better of it Miss Courteney had been married to a much grander lover and had been taken off to splendid circles But he had never mentioned her name That story of his abiding love was throughly believed by his sister who used to tell it of him to his credit when at the rectory the rector would declare him to be a fool But the rector used to say that he was dumb from pride or that he could not bear to have it known that he had failed at anything At any rate he had never again attempted love and had formally declared to his sister that as he did not intend to marry Harry should be regarded as his son Then at last had come the fellowship and he had been proud of his heir thinking that in some way he had won the fellowship himself as he had paid the bills But now all was altered and he was to go forth to his wooing again There had been a rumor about the country that he was already accepted but such was not the case He had fluttered about Buntingford thinking of it but he had never put the question To his thinking it would not have been becoming to do so without some ceremony Buston was not to be made away during the turnings of a quadrille or as a part of an ordinary conversation It was not probable nay it was impossible that he should mention the subject to any one but still he must visibly prepare for it and I think that he was aware that the world around him knew what he was about And the Thoroughbung s knew and Miss Matilda Thoroughbung knew well All Buntingford knew In those old days in which he had sought the hand of the baronet s daughter the baronet s daughter and the baronet s wife and the baronet himself had known what was coming though mister Prosper thought that the secret dwelt alone in his own bosom Nor did he dream now that Harry and Harry s father and Harry s mother and sisters had all laughed at the conspicuous gravity of his threat It was the general feeling on the subject which made the rumor current that the deed had been done But when he came down stairs with one new gray kid glove on and the other dangling in his hand nothing had been done Drive to Buntingford said the squire Yes sir said Matthew the door of the carriage in his hand To Marmaduke Lodge Yes sir Then Matthew told the coachman who had heard the instructions very plainly and knew them before he had heard them The squire threw himself back in the carriage and applied himself to wondering how he should do the deed He had in truth barely studied the words but not finally the manner of delivering them With his bare hand up to his eyes so that he might hold the glove unsoiled in the other he devoted his intellect to the task nor did he withdraw his hand till the carriage turned in at the gate The drive up to the door of Marmaduke Lodge was very short and he had barely time to arrange his waistcoat and his whiskers before the carriage stood still He was soon told that Miss Thoroughbung was at home and within a moment he found himself absolutely standing on the carpet in her presence Report had dealt unkindly with Miss Thoroughbung in the matter of her age Report always does deal unkindly with unmarried young women who have ceased to be girls There is an idea that they will wish to make themselves out to be younger than they are and therefore report always makes them older She had been called forty five and even fifty Her exact age at this moment was forty two and as mister Prosper was only fifty there was no discrepancy in the marriage He would have been young looking for his age but for an air of ancient dandyism which had grown upon him He was somewhat dry too and skinny with high cheekbones and large dull eyes But he was clean and grave and orderly a man promising well to a lady on the lookout for a husband Miss Thoroughbung was fat fair and forty to the letter and she had a just measure of her own good looks of which she was not unconscious But she was specially conscious of twenty five thousand pounds the possession of which had hitherto stood in the way of her search after a husband It was said commonly about Buntingford that she looked too high seeing that she was only a Thoroughbung and had no more than twenty five thousand pounds But Miss Tickle was in the room and might have been said to be in the way were it not that a little temporary relief was felt by mister Prosper to be a comfort Miss Tickle was at any rate twenty years older than Miss Thoroughbung and was of all slaves at the same time the humblest and the most irritating She never asked for anything but was always painting the picture of her own deserts I hope I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Tickle quite well said the squire as soon as he had paid his first compliments to the lady of his love Thank you mister Prosper pretty well My anxiety is all for Matilda Matilda had been Matilda to her since she had been a little girl and Miss Tickle was not going now to drop the advantage which the old intimacy gave her I trust there is no cause for it Well I m not so sure She coughed a little last night and would not eat her supper We always do have a little supper A despatched crab it was and when she would not eat it I knew there was something wrong Nonsense what a fuss you make Well mister Prosper have you seen your nephew yet No Miss Thoroughbung nor do I intend to see him The young man has disgraced himself Dear dear how sad Young men do disgrace themselves I fear very often said Miss Tickle We won t talk about it if you please because it is a family affair Oh no said Miss Thoroughbung At least not as yet It may be but never mind I would not wish to be premature in anything I am always telling Matilda so She is so impulsive But as you may have matters of business mister Prosper on which to speak to Miss Thoroughbung I will retire It is very thoughtful on your part Miss Tickle Then Miss Tickle retired from which it may be surmised that the probable circumstances of the interview had been already discussed between the ladies mister Prosper drew a long breath and sighed audibly as soon as he was alone with the object of his affections He wondered whether men were ever bright and jolly in such circumstances He sighed again and then he began Miss Thoroughbung mister Prosper All the prepared words had flown from his memory He could not even bethink himself how he ought to begin And unfortunately so much must depend upon manner But the property was unembarrassed and Miss Thoroughbung thought it probable that she might be allowed to do what she would with her own money She had turned it all over to the right and to the left and she was quite minded to accept him With this view she had told Miss Tickle to leave the room and she now felt that she was bound to give the gentleman what help might be in her power Oh Miss Thoroughbung he said mister Prosper you and I are such good friends that that that Yes indeed You can have no more true friend than I am not even Miss Tickle Oh bother Miss Tickle Miss Tickle is very well Exactly so Miss Tickle is very well a most estimable person We ll leave her alone just at present Yes certainly We had better leave her alone in our present conversation Not but what I have a strong regard for her mister Prosper had surely not thought of the opening he might be giving as to a future career for Miss Tickle by such an assertion So have I for the matter of that but we ll drop her just now Then she paused but he paused also You have come over to Buntingford to day probably in order that you might congratulate them at the brewery on the marriage with one of your family Then mister Prosper frowned but she did not care for his frowning It will not be a bad match for the young lady as Joshua is fairly steady and the brewery is worth money I could have wished him a better brother in law said the lover who was taken away from the consideration of his love by the allusion to the Annesleys He had thought of all that and in the dearth of fitting objects of affection had resolved to endure the drawback of the connection But it had for a while weighed very seriously with him so that had the twenty five thousand pounds been twenty thousand pounds he might have taken himself to Miss Puffle who lived near Saffron Walden and who would own Snickham Manor when her father died The property was said to be involved and Miss Puffle was certainly forty eight As an heir was the great desideratum he had resolved that Matilda Thoroughbung should be the lady in spite of the evils attending the new connection He did feel that in throwing over Harry he would have to abandon all the Annesleys and to draw a line between himself with Miss Thoroughbung and the whole family of the Thoroughbungs generally You mustn t be too bitter against poor Molly said Miss Thoroughbung mister Prosper did not like to be called bitter and in spite of the importance of the occasion could not but show that he did not like it I don t think that we need talk about it Oh dear no Kate and Miss Tickle need neither of them be talked about mister Prosper disliked all familiarity and especially that of being laughed at but Miss Thoroughbung did laugh So he drew himself up and dangled his glove more slowly than before Then you were not going on to congratulate them at the brewery Certainly not I did not know My purpose carries me no farther than Marmaduke Lodge I have no desire to see any one to day besides Miss Thoroughbung That is a compliment Then his memory suddenly brought back to him one of his composed sentences In beholding Miss Thoroughbung I behold her on whom I hope I may depend for all the future happiness of my life He did feel that it had come in the right place It had been intended to be said immediately after her acceptance of him But it did very well where it was It expressed as he assured himself the feelings of his heart and must draw from her some declaration of hers Goodness gracious me mister Prosper This sort of coyness was to have been expected and he therefore continued with another portion of his prepared words which now came glibly enough to him But it was a previous portion It was all the same to Miss Thoroughbung as it declared plainly the gentleman s intention If I can induce you to listen to me favorably I shall say of myself that I am the happiest gentleman in Hertfordshire Oh mister Prosper My purpose is to lay at your feet my hand my heart and the lands of Buston Here he was again going backward but it did not much matter now in what sequence the words were said The offer had been thoroughly completed and was thoroughly understood A lady mister Prosper has to think of these things said Miss Thoroughbung Of course I would not wish to hurry you prematurely to any declaration of your affections But there are other considerations mister Prosper You know about my property Nothing particularly It has not been a matter of consideration with me This he said with some slight air of offence He was a gentleman whereas Miss Thoroughbung was hardly a lady Matter of consideration her money of course had been How should he not consider it But he was aware that he ought not to rush on that subject but should leave it to the arrangement of lawyers expressing his own views through her own lawyer To her it was the thing of most importance and she had no feelings which induced her to be silent on a matter so near to her She rushed But it has to be considered mister Prosper It is all my own and comes to very nearly one thousand a year I think it is nine hundred and seventy two pounds six shillings and eightpence Of course when there is so much money it would have to be tied up somehow mister Prosper was undoubtedly disgusted and if he could have receded at this moment would have transferred his affections to Miss Puffle Of course you understand that She had not accepted him as yet nor said a word of her regard for him All that went it seemed as a matter of no importance whatever He had been standing for the last few minutes and now he remained standing and looking at her They were both silent so that he was obliged to speak I understand that between a lady and gentleman so circumstanced there should be a settlement Just so I also have some property said mister Prosper with a touch of pride in his tone Of course you have Goodness gracious me Why else would you come You have got Buston which I suppose is two thousand a year At any rate it has that name But it isn t your own Not my own Well no You couldn t leave it to your widow so that she might give it to any one she pleased when you were gone Here the gentleman frowned very darkly and thought that after all Miss Puffle would be the woman for him All that has to be considered and it makes Buston not exactly your own If I were to have a daughter she wouldn t have it No not a daughter said mister Prosper still wondering at the thorough knowledge of the business in hand displayed by the lady Oh if it were to be a son that would be all right and then my money would go to the younger children divided equally between the boys and girls mister Prosper shook his head as he found himself suddenly provided with so plentiful and thriving a family That I suppose would be the way of the settlement together with a certain income out of Buston set apart for my use It ought to be considered that I should have to provide a house to live in This belongs to my brother and I pay him forty pounds a year for it It should be something better than this My dear Miss Thoroughbung the lawyer would do all that There did come upon him an idea that she with her aptitude for business would not be altogether a bad helpmate The lawyers are very well but in a transaction of this kind there is nothing like the principals understanding each other Young women are always robbed when their money is left altogether to the gentlemen Robbed Don t suppose I mean you mister Prosper and the robbery I mean is not considered disgraceful at all The gentlemen I mean are the fathers and the brothers and the uncles and the lawyers And they intend to do right after the custom of their fathers and uncles But woman s rights are coming up I hate woman s rights Nevertheless they are coming up A young woman doesn t get taken in as she used to do I don t mean any offence you know This was said in reply to mister Prosper s repeated frown Since woman s rights have come up a young woman is better able to fight her own battle mister Prosper was willing to admit that Miss Thoroughbung was fair but she was fat also and at least forty There was hardly need that she should refer so often to her own unprotected youth I should like to have the spending of my own income mister Prosper that s a fact Oh indeed Yes I should I shouldn t care to have to go to my husband if I wanted to buy a pair of stockings An allowance I should say And that should be my own income Nothing to go to the house Oh yes There might be certain things which I might agree to pay for A pair of ponies I should like I always keep a carriage and a pair of horses But the ponies would be my lookout I shouldn t mind paying for my own maid and the champagne and my clothes of course and the fish monger s bill There would be Miss Tickle too You said you would like Miss Tickle I should have to pay for her That would be about enough I think mister Prosper was thoroughly disgusted but when he left Marmaduke Lodge he had not said a word as to withdrawing from his offer She declared that she would put her terms into writing and give them to her lawyer who would communicate with mister Grey mister Prosper was surprised to find that she knew the name of his lawyer who was in truth our old friend And then while he was still hesitating she astounded nay shocked him by her mode of ending the conference She got up and throwing her arms round his neck kissed him most affectionately After that there was no retreating for mister Prosper no immediate mode of retreat at all events He could only back out of the room and get into his carriage and be carried home as quickly as possible CHAPTER XXVII THE PROPOSAL It had never happened to him before The first thought that came upon mister Prosper when he got into his carriage was that it had never occurred to him before He did not reflect that he had not put himself in the way of it but now the strangeness of the sensation overwhelmed him He inquired of himself whether it was pleasant but he found himself compelled to answer the question with a negative It should have come from him but not yet not yet probably for some weeks But it had been done and by the doing of it she had sealed him utterly as her own There was no getting out of it now He did feel that he ought not to attempt to get out of it after what had taken place He was not sure but that the lady had planned it all with that purpose but he was sure that a strong foundation had been laid for a breach of promise case if he were to attempt to escape What might not a jury do against him giving damages out of the acres of Buston Hall And then Miss Thoroughbung would go over to the other Thoroughbungs and to the Annesleys and his condition would become intolerable In some moments as he was driven home he was not sure but that it had all been got up as a plot against him by the Annesleys When he got out of his carriage Matthew knew that things had gone badly with his master but he could not conjecture in what way The matter had been fully debated in the kitchen and it had been there decided that Miss Thoroughbung was certainly to be brought home as the future mistress of Buston The step to be taken by their master was not popular in the Buston kitchen It had been there considered that Master Harry was to be the future master and by some perversity of intellect they had all thought that this would occur soon Matthew was much older than the squire who was hardly to be called a sickly man and yet Matthew had made up his mind that mister Harry was to reign over him as Squire of Buston When therefore the tidings came that Miss Thoroughbung was to brought to Buston as the mistress there had been some slight symptoms of rebellion They didn t want any Tilda Thoroughbung there They had their own idea of a lady and a gentleman which as in all such cases was perfectly correct They knew the squire to be a fool but they believed him to be a gentleman They heard that Miss Thoroughbung was a clever woman but they did not believe her to be a lady Matthew had said a few words to the cook as to a public house at Stevenage She had told him not to be an old fool and that he would lose his money but she had thought of the public house There had been a mutinous feeling Matthew helped his master out of the carriage and then came a revulsion That froth of a beer barrel as Matthew had dared to call her had absolutely refused his master mister Prosper went into the house very meditative and sad at heart It was a matter almost of regret to him that it had not been as Matthew supposed But he was caught and bound and must make the best of it He thought of all the particulars of her proposed mode of living and recapitulated them to himself A pair of ponies her own maid champagne the fish monger s bill and Miss Tickle Miss Puffle would certainly not have required such expensive luxuries Champagne and the fish would require company for their final consumption The ponies assumed a tone of being quite opposed to that which he had contemplated He questioned with himself whether he would like Miss Tickle as a perpetual inmate He had in sheer civility expressed a liking for Miss Tickle but what need could there be to a married woman of a Miss Tickle And then he thought of the education of the five or six children which she had almost promised him He had suggested to himself simply an heir just one heir so that the nefarious Harry might be cut out He already saw that he would not be enriched to the extent of a shilling by the lady s income Then there would be all the trouble and the disgrace of a separate purse He felt that there would be disgrace in having the fish and champagne which were consumed in his own house paid for by his wife without reference to him What if the lady had a partiality for champagne He knew nothing about it and would know nothing about it except when he saw it in her heightened color Despatched crabs for supper He always went to bed at ten and had a tumbler of barley water brought to him a glass of barley water with just a squeeze of lemon juice He saw ruin before him No doubt she was a good manager but she would be a good manager for herself Would it not be better for him to stand the action for breach of promise and betake himself to Miss Puffle But Miss Puffle was fifty and there could be no doubt that the lady ought to be younger than the gentleman He was much distressed in mind If he broke off with Miss Thoroughbung ought he to do so at once before she had had time to put the matter into the hands of the lawyer And on what plea should he do it Before he went to bed that night he did draw out a portion of a letter which however was never sent MY DEAR MISS THOROUGHBUNG In the views which we both promulgated this morning I fear that there was some essential misunderstanding as to the mode of life which had occurred to both of us You as was so natural at your age and with your charms have not been slow to anticipate a coming period of uncheckered delights Your allusion to a pony carriage and other incidental allusions he did not think it well to mention more particularly the fish and the champagne have made clear the sort of future life which you have pictured to yourself Heaven forbid that I should take upon myself to find fault with anything so pleasant and so innocent But my prospects of life are different and in seeking the honor of an alliance with you I was looking for a quiet companion in my declining years and it might be also to a mother to a possible future son When you honored me with an unmistakable sign of your affection on my going I was just about to explain all this You must excuse me if my mouth was then stopped by the mutual ardor of our feeling I was about to say But he had found it difficult to explain what he had been about to say and on the next morning when the time for writing had come he heard news which detained him for the day and then the opportunity was gone On the following morning when Matthew appeared at his bedside with his cup of tea at nine o clock tidings were brought him He took in the Buntingford Gazette which came twice a week and as Matthew laid it opened and unread in its accustomed place he gave the information which he had no doubt gotten from the paper You haven t heard it sir I suppose as yet Heard what About Miss Puffle What about Miss Puffle I haven t heard a word What about Miss Puffle He had been thinking that moment of Miss Puffle of how she would be superior to Miss Thoroughbung in many ways so that he sat up in his bed holding the untasted tea in his hand She s gone off with young Farmer Tazlehurst Miss Puffle gone off and with her father s tenant s son Yes indeed sir She and her father have been quarrelling for the last ten years and now she s off She was always riding and roistering about the country with them dogs and them men and now she s gone Oh heavens exclaimed the squire thinking of his own escape Yes indeed sir There s no knowing what any one of them is up to Unless they gets married afore they re thirty or thirty five at most they re most sure to get such ideas into their head as no one can mostly approve This had been intended by Matthew as a word of caution to his master but had really the opposite effect He resolved at the moment that the latter should not be said of Miss Thoroughbung And he turned Matthew out of the room with a flea in his ear How dare you speak in that way of your betters mister Puffle the lady s father has for many years been my friend I am not saying anything of the lady nor saying that she has done right Of course down stairs in the servants hall you can say what you please but up here in my presence you should not speak in such language of a lady behind whose chair you may be called upon to wait Very well sir I won t no more said Matthew retiring with mock humility But he had shot his bolt and he supposed successfully He did not know what had taken place between his master and Miss Thoroughbung but he did think that his speech might assist in preventing a repetition of the offer Miss Puffle gone off with the tenant s son The news made matrimony doubly dangerous to him and yet robbed him of the chief reason by which he was to have been driven to send her a letter He could not at any rate now fall back upon Miss Puffle And he thought that nothing would have induced Miss Thoroughbung to go off with one of the carters from the brewery Whatever faults she might have they did not lie in that direction Champagne and ponies were as faults less deleterious Miss Puffle gone off with young Tazlehurst a lady of fifty with a young man of twenty five and she the reputed heiress of Snickham Manor It was a comfort to him as he remembered that Snickham Manor had been bought no longer ago than by the father of the present owner The Prospers been at Buston ever since the time of George the First You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow s ear He had been ever assuring himself of that fact which was now more of a fact than ever And fifty years old It was quite shocking With a steady middle aged man like himself and with the approval of her family marriage might have been thought of But this harum scarum young tenant s son who was in no respect a gentleman whose only thought was of galloping over hedges and ditches such an idea showed a state of mind which well absolutely disgusted him mister Prosper because he had grown old himself could not endure to think that others at his age should retain a smack of their youth There are ladies besides Miss Puffle who like to ride across the country with a young man before them or perhaps following and never think much of their fifty years But the news certainly brought to him a great change of feelings so that the letter to which he had devoted the preceding afternoon was put back into the letter case and was never finished And his mind immediately recurred to Miss Thoroughbung and he bethought himself that the objection which he felt was perhaps in part frivolous At any rate she was a better woman than Miss Puffle She certainly would run after no farmer s son Though she might be fond of champagne it was he thought chiefly for other people Though she was ambitious of ponies the ambition might be checked At any rate she could pay for her own ponies whereas mister Puffle was a very hale old man of seventy Puffle he told himself had married young and might live for the next ten years or twenty To mister Prosper whose imagination did not fly far afield the world afforded at present but two ladies These were Miss Puffle and Miss Thoroughbung and as Miss Puffle had fallen out of the running there seemed to be a walk over for Miss Thoroughbung He did think during the two or three days which passed without any farther step on his part he did think how it might be were he to remain unmarried As regarded his own comfort he was greatly tempted Life would remain so easy to him But then duty demanded of him that he should marry and he was a man who in honest sober talk thought much of his duty He was absurdly credulous and as obstinate as a mule But he did wish to do what was right He had been convinced that Harry Annesley was a false knave and had been made to swear an oath that Harry should not be his heir Harry had been draped in the blackest colors and to each daub of black something darker had been added by his uncle s memory of those neglected sermons It was now his first duty in life to beget an heir and for that purpose a wife must be had Putting aside the ponies and the champagne and the despatched crab the sound of which as coming to him from Miss Tickle s mouth was uglier than the other sounds he still thought that Miss Thoroughbung would answer his purpose From her side there would not be making of a silk purse but then the boy would be his boy as well as hers and would probably take more after the father He passed much of these days with the Peerage in his hand and satisfied himself that the best blood had been maintained frequently by second rate marriages Health was a great thing Health in the mother was everything Who could be more healthy than Miss Thoroughbung Then he thought of that warm embrace Perhaps after all it was right that she should embrace him after what he had said to her Three days only had passed by and he was still thinking what ought to be his next step when there came to him a letter from Messrs Soames Simpson attorneys in Buntingford He had heard of Messrs Soames Simpson had been familiar with their names for the last twenty years but had never dreamed that his own private affairs should become a matter of consultation in their office Messrs Grey Barry of Lincoln s Inn were his lawyers who were quite gentlemen He knew nothing against Messrs Soames Simpson but he thought that their work consisted generally in the recovery of local debts Messrs Soames Simpson now wrote to him with full details as to his future life Their client Miss Thoroughbung had communicated to them his offer of marriage They were acquainted with all the lady s circumstances and she had asked them for their advice They had proposed to her that the use of her own income should be by deed left to herself Some proportion of it should go into the house and might be made matter of agreement They suggested that an annuity of a thousand pounds a year in shape of dower should be secured to their client in the event of her outliving mister Prosper The estate should of course be settled on the eldest child The mother s property should be equally divided among the other children Buston Hall should be the residence of the widow till the eldest son should be twenty four after which mister Prosper would no doubt feel that their client would have to provide a home for herself Messrs Soames Simpson did not think that there was anything in this to which mister Prosper would object and if this were so they would immediately prepare the settlement That woman didn t say against it after all said Matthew to himself as he gave the letter from the lawyers to his master The letter made mister Prosper very angry It did in truth contain nothing more than a repetition of the very terms which the lady had herself suggested but coming to him through these local lawyers it was doubly distasteful What was he to do He felt it to be out of the question to accede at once Indeed he had a strong repugnance to putting himself into communication with the Buntingford lawyers Had the matter been other than it was he would have gone to the rector for advice The rector generally advised him But that was out of the question now He had seen his sister once since his visit to Buntingford but had said nothing to her about it Indeed he had been anything but communicative so that missus Annesley had been forced to leave him with a feeling almost of offense There was no help to be had in that quarter and he could only write to mister Grey and ask that gentleman to assist him in his difficulties He did write to mister Grey begging for his immediate attention There is that fool Prosper going to marry a brewer s daughter down at Buntingford said mister Grey to his daughter He s sixty years old No my love He looks it but he s only fifty A man at fifty is supposed to be young enough to marry There s a nephew who has been brought up as his heir that s the hard part of it And the nephew is mixed up in some way with the Scarboroughs Is it he who is to marry that young lady I think it is And now there s some devil s play going on I ve got nothing to do with it But you will have Not a turn mister Prosper can marry if he likes it They have sent him most abominable proposals as to the lady s money and as to her jointure I must stop that if I can though I suppose he is not such a fool as to give way Is he soft Well not exactly He likes his own money But he s a gentleman and wants nothing but what is or ought to be his own There are but few like that now It s true of him But then he does not know what is his own or what ought to be He s almost the biggest fool I have ever known and will do an injustice to that boy simply from ignorance Then he drafted his letter to mister Prosper and gave it to Dolly to read That s what I shall propose The clerk can put it into proper language He must offer less than he means to give Is that honest father It s honest on my part knowing the people with whom I have to deal If I were to lay down the strict minimum which he should grant he would add other things which would cause him to act not in accordance with my advice I have to make allowance for his folly a sort of windage which is not dishonest Had he referred her lawyers to me I could have been as hard and honest as you please All which did not quite satisfy Dolly s strict ideas of integrity But the terms proposed were that the lady s means should be divided so that one half should go to herself for her own personal expenses and the other half to her husband for the use of the house that the lady should put up with a jointure of two hundred and fifty pounds which ought to suffice when joined to her own property and that the settlement among the children should be as recommended by Messrs Soames Simpson And if there are not any children papa Then each will receive his or her own property Because it may be so Certainly my dear very probably CHAPTER XXVIII mister HARKAWAY When the first Monday in November came Harry was still living at the rectory Indeed what other home had he in which to live Other friends had become shy of him besides his uncle He had been accustomed to receive many invitations Young men who are the heirs to properties and are supposed to be rich because they are idle do get themselves asked about here and there and think a great deal of themselves in consequence There s young Jones He is fairly good looking but hasn t a word to say for himself He will do to pair off with Miss Smith who ll talk for a dozen He can t hit a hay stack but he s none the worse for that We haven t got too many pheasants He ll be sure to come when you ask him and he ll be sure to go So Jones is asked and considers himself to be the most popular man in London I will not say that Harry s invitations had been of exactly that description but he too had considered himself to be popular and now greatly felt the withdrawal of such marks of friendship He had received one put off from the Ingoldsbys of Kent Early in June he had promised to be there in November The youngest Miss Ingoldsby was very pretty and he no doubt had been gracious She knew that he had meant nothing could have meant nothing But he might come to mean something and had been most pressingly asked In September there came a letter to him to say that the room intended for him at Ingoldsby had been burnt down missus Ingoldsby was so extremely sorry and so were the girls Harry could trace it all up The Ingoldsbys knew the Greens and missus Green was Sister to Septimus Jones who was absolutely the slave the slave as Harry said repeating the word to himself with emphasis of Augustus Scarborough He was very unhappy not that he cared in the least for any Miss Ingoldsby but that he began to be conscious that he was to be dropped He was to be taken up on the other hand by Joshua Thoroughbung Alas alas though he smiled and resolved to accept his brother in law with a good heart this did not in the least salve the wound His own county was to him less than other counties and his own neighborhood less than other neighborhoods Buntingford was full of Thoroughbungs the best people in the world but not quite up to what he believed to be his mark mister Prosper himself was the stupidest ass At Welwyn people smelled of the City At Stevenage the parsons set began Baldock was a caput mortuum of dulness Royston was alive only on market days Of his own father s house and even of his mother and sisters he entertained ideas that savored a little of depreciation But to redeem him from this fault a fault which would have led to the absolute ruin of his character had it not been redeemed and at last cured there was a consciousness of his own vanity and weakness My father is worth a dozen of them and my mother and sisters two dozen he would say of the Ingoldsbys when he went to bed in the room that was to be burnt down in preparation for his exile And he believed it They were honest they were unselfish they were unpretending His sister Molly was not above owning that her young brewer was all the world to her a fine honest bouncing girl who said her prayers with a meaning thanked the Lord for giving her Joshua and laughed so loud that you could hear her out of the rectory garden half across the park Harry knew that they were good did in his heart know that where the parsons begin the good things were likely to begin also He was in this state of mind the hand of good pulling one way and the devil s pride the other when young Thoroughbung called for him one morning to carry him on to Cumberlow Green Cumberlow Green was a popular meet in that county where meets have not much to make them popular except the good humor of those who form the hunt It is not a county either pleasant or easy to ride over and a Puckeridge fox is surely the most ill mannered of foxes But the Puckeridge men are gracious to strangers and fairly so among themselves It is more than can be said of Leicestershire where sportsmen ride in brilliant boots and breeches but with their noses turned supernaturally into the air Come along we ve four miles to do and twenty minutes to do it in Halloo Molly how d ye do Come up on to the step and give us a kiss Go away said Molly rushing back into the house Did you ever hear anything like his impudence Why shouldn t you said Kate All the world knows it Then the gig with the two sportsmen was driven on Don t you think he looks handsome in his pink coat whispered Molly afterward to her elder sister Only think I have never seen him in a red coat since he was my own Last April when the hunting was over he hadn t spoken out and this is the first day he has worn pink this year Harry when he reached the meet looked about him to watch how he was received There are not many more painful things in life than when an honest gallant young fellow has to look about him in such a frame of mind It might have been worse had he deserved to be dropped some one will say Not at all A different condition of mind exists then and a struggle is made to overcome the judgment of men which is not in itself painful It is part of the natural battle of life which does not hurt one at all unless indeed the man hate himself for that which has brought upon him the hatred of others Repentance is always an agony and should be so Without the agony there can be no repentance But even then it is hardly so sharp as that feeling of injustice which accompanies the unmeaning look and dumb faces and pretended indifference of those who have condemned When Harry descended from the gig he found himself close to old mister Harkaway the master of the hounds mister Harkaway was a gentleman who had been master of these hounds for more than forty years and had given as much satisfaction as the county could produce His hounds which were his hobby were perfect His horses were good enough for the Hertfordshire lanes and Hertfordshire hedges His object was not so much to run a fox as to kill him in obedience to certain rules of the game Ever so many hinderances have been created to bar the killing a fox as for instance that you shouldn t knock him on the head with a brick bat all of which had to mister Harkaway the force of a religion The laws of hunting are so many that most men who hunt cannot know them all But no law had ever been written or had become a law by the strength of tradition which he did not know To break them was to him treason When a young man broke them he pitied the young man s ignorance and endeavored to instruct him after some rough fashion When an old man broke them he regarded him as a fool who should stay at home or as a traitor who should be dealt with as such And with such men he could deal very hardly Forty years of reigning had taught him to believe himself to be omnipotent and he was so in his own hunt He was a man who had never much affected social habits The company of one or two brother sportsmen to drink a glass of port wine with him and then to go early to bed was the most of it He had a small library but not a book ever came off the shelf unless it referred to farriers or the res venatica He was unmarried The time which other men gave to their wives and families he bestowed upon his hounds To his stables he never went looking on a horse as a necessary adjunct to hunting expensive disagreeable and prone to get you into danger When anyone flattered him about his horse he would only grunt and turn his head on one side No one in these latter years had seen him jump any fence But yet he was always with his hounds and when any one said a kind word as to their doings that he would take as a compliment It was they who were there to do the work of the day which horses and men could only look at He was a sincere honest taciturn and withal affectionate man who could on an occasion be very angry with those who offended him He knew well what he could do and never attempted that which was beyond his power How are you mister Harkaway said Harry How are you mister Annesley how are you said the master with all the grace of which he was capable But Harry caught a tone in his voice which he thought implied displeasure And mister Harkaway had in truth heard the story how Harry had been discarded at Buston because he had knocked the man down in the streets at night time and had then gone away After that mister Harkaway toddled off and Harry sat and frowned with embittered heart Well Malt and hops and how are you This came from a fast young banker who lived in the neighborhood and who thus intended to show his familiarity with the brewer but when he saw Annesley he turned round and rode away Scaly trick that fellow played the other day He knocked a fellow down and when he thought that he was dead he lied about it like old boots All of which made itself intelligible to Harry He told himself that he had always hated that banker Why do you let such a fellow as that call you Malt and hops he said to Joshua What young Florin He s a very good fellow and doesn t mean anything A vulgar cad I should say Then he rode on in silence till he was addressed by an old gentleman of the county who had known his father for the last thirty years The old gentleman had had nothing about him to recommend him either to Harry s hatred or love till he spoke and after that Harry hated him How d you do mister Annesley said the old gentleman and then rode on Harry knew that the old man had condemned him as the others had done or he would never have called him mister Annesley He felt that he was blown upon in his own county as well as by the Ingoldsbys down in Kent They had but a moderate day s sport going a considerable distance in search of it till an incident arose which gave quite an interest to the field generally and nearly brought Joshua Thoroughbung into a scrape They were drawing a covert which was undoubtedly the property of their own hunt or rather just going to draw it when all of a sudden they became aware that every hound in the pack was hunting mister Harkaway at once sprung from his usual cold apathetic manner into full action But they who knew him well could see that it was not the excitement of joy He was in an instant full of life but it was not the life of successful enterprise He was perturbed and unhappy and his huntsman Dillon a silent cunning not very popular man who would obey his master in everything began to move about rapidly and to be at his wit s end The younger men prepared themselves for a run one of those sudden short decisive spurts which come at the spur of the moment and on which a man if he is not quite awake to the demands of the moment is very apt to be left behind But the old stagers had their eyes on mister Harkaway and knew that there was something amiss Then there appeared another field of hunters first one man leading them then others following and after them the first ruck and then the crowd It was apparent to all who knew anything that two packs had joined These were the Hitchiners as the rival sportsmen would call them and this was the Hitchin Hunt with mister Fairlawn their master mister Fairlawn was also an old man popular no doubt in his own country but by no means beloved by mister Harkaway mister Harkaway used to declare how Fairlawn had behaved very badly about certain common coverts about thirty years ago when the matter had to be referred to a committee of masters No one in these modern days knew aught of the quarrel or cared The men of the two hunts were very good friends unless they met under the joint eyes of the two masters and then they were supposed to be bound to hate each other Now the two packs were mixed together and there was only one fox between them The fox did not trouble them long He could hardly have saved himself from one pack but very soon escaped from the fangs of the two Each hound knew that his neighbor hound was a stranger and in scrutinizing the singularity of the occurrence lost all the power of hunting In ten minutes there were nearly forty couples of hounds running hither and thither with two huntsmen and four whips swearing at them with strange voices and two old gentlemen giving orders each in opposition to the other Then each pack was got together almost on the same ground and it was necessary that something should be done mister Harkaway waited to see whether mister Fairlawn would ride away quickly to his own country He would not have spoken to mister Fairlawn if he could have helped it mister Fairlawn was some miles away from his country He must have given up the day for lost had he simply gone away But there was another covert a mile off and he thought that one of his hounds had shown a line or said that he thought so Now it is well known that you may follow a hunted fox through whatever country he may take you to if only your hounds are hunting him continuously And one hound for that purpose is as good as thirty and if a hound can only show a line he is held to be hunting mister Fairlawn was quite sure that one of his hounds had been showing a line and had been whipped off it by one of mister Harkaway s men The man swore that he had only been collecting his own hounds On this plea mister Fairlawn demanded to take his whole pack into Greasegate Wood the very covert that mister Harkaway had been about to draw I m d d if you do said mister Harkaway standing whip in hand in the middle of the road so as to prevent the enemy s huntsman passing by with his hounds It was afterward declared that mister Harkaway had not been heard to curse and swear for the last fifteen years I m d d if I don t said mister Fairlawn riding up to him mister Harkaway was ten years the older man and looked as though he had much less of fighting power But no one saw him quail or give an inch Those who watched his face declared that his lips were white with rage and quivered with passion To tell the words which passed between them after that would require Homer s pathos and Homer s imagination The two old men scowled and scolded at each other and had mister Fairlawn attempted to pass mister Harkaway would certainly have struck him with his whip And behind their master a crowd of the Puckeridge men collected themselves foremost among whom was Joshua Thoroughbung Take em round to the covert by Winnipeg Lane said mister Fairlawn to his huntsman The man prepared to take his pack round by Winnipeg Lane which would have added a mile to the distance But the huntsman when he had got a little to the left was soon seen scurrying across the country in the direction of the covert with a dozen others at his heels and the hounds following him But old mister Harkaway had seen it too and having possession of the road galloped along it at such a pace that no one could pass him All the field declared that they had regarded it as impossible that their master should move so fast And Dillon and the whips and Thoroughbung and Harry Annesley with half a dozen others kept pace with him They would not sit there and see their master outmanoeuvred by any lack of readiness on their part They got to the covert first and there with their whips drawn were ready to receive the second pack Then one hound went in without an order but for their own hounds they did not care They might find a fox and go after him and nobody would follow them The business here at the covert side was more important and more attractive Then it was that mister Thoroughbung nearly fell into danger As to the other hounds mister Fairlawn s hounds doing any harm in the covert or doing any good for themselves or their owners that was out of the question The rival pack was already there with their noses up in the air and thinking of anything but a fox and this other pack the Hitchiners were just as wild But it was the object of mister Fairlawn s body guard to say that they had drawn the covert in the teeth of mister Harkaway and to achieve this one of the whips thought that he could ride through the Puckeridge men taking a couple of hounds with him That would suffice for triumph But to prevent such triumph on the part of the enemy Joshua Thoroughbung was prepared to sacrifice himself He rode right at the whip with his own whip raised and would undoubtedly have ridden over him had not the whip tried to turn his horse sharp round stumbled and fallen in the struggle and had not Thoroughbung with his horse fallen over him It will be the case that a slight danger or injury in one direction will often stop a course of action calculated to create greater dangers and worse injuries So it was in this case When Dick the Hitchin whip went down and Thoroughbung with his horse was over him two men and two horses struggling together on the ground all desire to carry on the fight was over The huntsman came up and at last mister Fairlawn also and considered it to be their duty to pick up Dick whose breath was knocked out of him by the weight of Joshua Thoroughbung and the Puckeridge side felt it to be necessary to give their aid to the valiant brewer There was then no more attempt to draw the covert Each general in gloomy silence took off his forces and each afterward deemed that the victory was his Dick swore when brought to himself that one of his hounds had gone in whereas Squire Arkaway had swore most orrid oaths that no Itchiner ound should ever live to put his nose in One of is ounds ad and Squire Arkaway would have to be Well Dick declared that he would not say what would happen to mister Harkaway CHAPTER XXIX RIDING HOME The two old gentlemen rode away each in his own direction in gloomy silence Not a word was said by either of them even to one of his own followers It was nearly twenty miles to mister Harkaway s house and along the entire twenty miles he rode silent He s in an awful passion said Thoroughbung he can t speak from anger But to tell the truth mister Harkaway was ashamed of himself He was an old gentleman between seventy and eighty who was supposed to go out for his amusement and had allowed himself to be betrayed into most unseemly language What though the hound had not shown a line Was it necessary that he at his time of life should fight on the road for the maintenance of a trifling right of sport But yet there came upon him from time to time a sense of the deep injury done to him That man Fairlawn that blackguard that creature of all others the farthest removed from a gentleman had declared that in his mister Harkaway s teeth he would draw his mister Harkaway s covert Then he would urge on his old horse and gnash his teeth and then again he would be ashamed Tantaene animis coelestibus irae But Thoroughbung rode home high in spirits very proud and conscious of having done good work He was always anxious to stand well with the hunt generally and was aware that he had now distinguished himself Harry Annesley was on one side of him and on the other rode mister Florin the banker He s an abominable liar said Thoroughbung a wicked wretched liar He was alluding to the Hitchiner s whip whom in his wrath he had nearly sent to another world He says that one of his hounds got into the covert but I was there and saw it all Not a nose was over the little bank which runs between the field and the covert You must have seen a hound if he had been there said the banker I was as cool as a cucumber and could count the hounds he had with him There were three of them A big black spotted bitch was leading the one that I nearly fell upon When the man went down the hound stopped not knowing what was expected of him How should he The man would have been in the covert but by George I managed to stop him What did you mean to do to him when you rode at him so furiously asked Harry Not let him get in there That was my resolute purpose I suppose I should have knocked him off his horse with my whip But suppose he had knocked you off your horse suggested the banker There is no knowing how that might have been I never calculated those chances When a man wants to do a thing like that he generally does it And you did it said Harry Yes I think I did I dare say his bones are sore I know mine are But I don t care for that in the least When this day comes to be talked about as I dare say it will be for many a long year no one will be able to say that the Hitchiners got into that covert Thoroughbung with the genuine modesty of an Englishman would not say that he had achieved by his own prowess all this glory for the Puckeridge Hunt but he felt it down to the very end of his nails Had he not been there that whip would have got into the wood and a very different tale would then have been told in those coming years to which his mind was running away with happy thoughts He had ridden the aggressors down he had stopped the first intrusive hound But though he continued to talk of the subject he did not boast in so many words that he had done it His veni vidi vici was confined to his own bosom As they rode home together there came to be a little crowd of men round Thoroughbung giving him the praises that were his due But one by one they fell off from Annesley s side of the road He soon felt that no one addressed a word to him He was probably too prone to encourage them in this It was he that fell away and courted loneliness and then in his heart accused them There was no doubt something of truth in his accusations but another man less sensitive might have lived it down He did more than meet their coldness half way and then complained to himself of the bitterness of the world They are like the beasts of the field he said who when another beast has been wounded turn upon him and rend him to death His future brother in law the best natured fellow that ever was born rode on thoughtless and left Harry alone for three or four miles while he received the pleasant plaudits of his companions In Joshua s heart was that tale of the whip s discomfiture He did not see that Molly s brother was alone as soon as he would have done but for his own glory He is the same as the others said Harry to himself Because that man has told a falsehood of me and has had the wit to surround it with circumstances he thinks it becomes him to ride away and cut me Then he asked himself some foolish questions as to himself and as to Joshua Thoroughbung which he did not answer as he should have done had he remembered that he was then riding Thoroughbung s horse and that his sister was to become Thoroughbung s wife After half an hour of triumphant ovation Joshua remembered his brother in law and did fall back so as to pick him up What s the matter Harry Why don t you come on and join us I m sick of hearing of that infernal squabble Well as to a squabble mister Harkaway behaved quite right If a hunt is to be kept up the right of entering coverts must be preserved for the hunt they belong to There was no line shown You must remember that there isn t a doubt about that The hounds were all astray when we joined them It s a great question whether they brought their fox into that first covert There are they who think that Bodkin was just riding across the Puckeridge country in search of a fox Bodkin was mister Fairlawn s huntsman If you admit that kind of thing where will you be As a hunting country just nowhere Then as a sportsman where are you It is necessary to put down such gross fraud My own impression is that mister Fairlawn should be turned out from being master I own I feel very strongly about it But then I always have been fond of hunting Just so said Harry sulkily who was not in the least interested as to the matter on which Joshua was so eloquent Then mister Proctor rode by the gentleman who in the early part of the day disgusted Harry by calling him mister Now mister Proctor continued Joshua I appeal to you whether mister Harkaway was not quite right If you won t stick up for your rights in a hunting county But mister Proctor rode on wishing them good night very discourteously declining to hear the remainder of the brewer s arguments He s in a hurry I suppose said Joshua You d better follow him You ll find that he ll listen to you then I don t want him to listen to me particularly I thought you did Then for half an hour the two men rode on in silence What s the matter with you Harry said Joshua I can see there s something up that riles you I know you re a fellow of your college and have other things to think of besides the vagaries of a fox The fellow of a college said Harry who had he been in a good humor would have thought much more of being along with a lot of fox hunters than of any college honors Well yes I suppose it is a great thing to be a fellow of a college I never could have been one if I had mugged forever My being a fellow of a college won t do me much good Did you see that old man Proctor go by just now Oh yes he never likes to be out after a certain hour And did you see Florin and mister Harkaway and a lot of others You yourself have been going on ahead for the last hour without speaking to me How do you mean without speaking to you said Joshua turning sharp round Then Harry Annesley reflected that he was doing an injustice to his future brother in law Perhaps I have done you wrong he said You have I beg your pardon I believe you are as honest and true a fellow as there is in Hertfordshire but for those others You think it s about Mountjoy Scarborough then asked Joshua I do That infernal fool Peter Prosper has chosen to publish to the world that he has dropped me because of something that he has heard of that occurrence A wretched lie has been told with a purpose by Mountjoy Scarborough s brother and my uncle has taken it into his wise head to believe it The truth is I have not been as respectful to him as he thinks I ought and now he resents my neglect in this fashion He is going to marry your aunt in order that he may have a lot of children and cut me out In order to justify himself he has told these lies about me and you see the consequence not a man in the county is willing to speak to me I really think a great deal of it s fancy You go and ask mister Harkaway He s honest and he ll tell you Ask this new cousin of yours mister Prosper I don t know that they are going to make a match of it after all Ask my own father Only think of it that a puling puking idiot like that from a mere freak should be able to do a man such a mischief He can rob me of my income which he himself has brought me up to expect That he can do by a stroke of his pen He can threaten to have sons like Priam All that is within his own bosom But to justify himself to the world at large he picks up a scandalous story from a man like Augustus Scarborough and immediately not a man in the county will speak to me I say that that is enough to break a man s heart not the injury done which a man should bear but the injustice of the doing Who wants his beggarly allowance He can do as he likes about his own money I shall never ask him for his money But that he should tell such a lie as this about the county is more than a man can endure What was it that did happen asked Joshua The man met me in the street when he was drunk and he struck at me and was insolent Of course I knocked him down Who wouldn t have done the same Then his brother found him somewhere or got hold of him and sent him out of the country and says that I had held my tongue when I left him in the street Of course I held my tongue What was Mountjoy to me Then Augustus has asked me sly questions and accuses me of lying because I did not choose to tell him everything It all comes out of that Here they had reached the rectory and Harry after seeing that the horses were properly supplied with gruel took himself and his ill humor up stairs to his own chamber But Joshua had a word or two to say to one of the inmates of the rectory He felt that it would be improper to ride his horse home without giving time to the animal to drink his gruel and therefore made his way into the little breakfast parlor where Molly had a cup of tea and buttered toast ready for him He of course told her first of the grand occurrence of the day how the two packs of hounds had mixed themselves together how violently the two masters had fallen out and had nearly flogged each other how mister Harkaway had sworn horribly who had never been heard to swear before how a final attempt had been made to seize a second covert and how at last it had come to pass that he had distinguished himself Do you mean to say that you absolutely rode over the unfortunate man asked Molly I did Not that the man had the worst of it or very much the worse There we were both down and the two horses all in a heap together Oh Joshua suppose you had been kicked In that case I should have been kicked But a kick from an infuriated horse There wasn t much infuriation about him The man had ridden all that out of the beast You are sure to laugh at me Joshua because I think what terrible things might have happened to you Why do you go putting yourself so forward in every danger now that you have got somebody else to depend upon you and to care for you It s very very wrong Somebody had to do it Molly It was most important in the interests of hunting generally that those hounds should not have been allowed to get into that covert I don t think that outsiders ever understand how essential it is to maintain your rights It isn t as though it were an individual The whole county may depend upon it Why shouldn t it be some man who hasn t got a young woman to look after said Molly half laughing and half crying It s the man who first gets there who ought to do it said Joshua A man can t stop to remember whether he has got a young woman or not I don t think you ever want to remember Then that little quarrel was brought to the usual end with the usual blandishments and Joshua went on to discuss with her that other source of trouble her brother s fall Harry is awfully cut up said the brewer You mean these affairs about his uncle Yes It isn t only the money he feels or the property but people look askew at him You ought all of you to be very kind to him I am sure we are There is something in it to vex him That stupid old fool your uncle I beg your pardon you know for speaking of him in that way He is a stupid old fool Is behaving very badly I don t know whether he shouldn t be treated as I did that fellow up at the covert Ride over him Something of that kind Of course Harry is sore about it and when a man is sore he frets at a thing like that more than he ought to do As for that aunt of mine at Buntingford there seems to be some hitch in it I should have said she d have married the Old Gentleman had he asked her Don t talk like that Joshua But there is some screw loose Simpson came up to my father about it yesterday and the governor let enough of the cat out of the bag to make me know that the thing is not going as straight as she wishes He has offered then I am sure he has asked her And your aunt will accept him asked Molly There s probably some difference about money It s all done with the intention of injuring poor Harry If he were my own brother I could not be more unhappy about him And as to Aunt Matilda she s a fool There are two fools together If they choose to marry we can t hinder them But there is some screw loose and if the two young lovers don t know their own minds things may come right at last Then with some farther blandishments the prosperous brewer walked away CHAPTER XXX PERSECUTION In the mean time Florence Mountjoy was not passing her time pleasantly at Brussels Various troubles there attended her All her friends around her were opposed to her marriage with Harry Annesley Harry Annesley had become a very unsavory word in the mouths of Sir Magnus and the British Embassy generally missus Mountjoy told her grief to her brother in law who thoroughly took her part as did also very strongly Lady Mountjoy It got to be generally understood that Harry was a mauvais sujet Such was the name that was attached to him and the belief so conveyed was thoroughly entertained by them all Sir Magnus had written to friends in London and the friends in London bore out the reports that were so conveyed The story of the midnight quarrel was told in a manner very prejudicial to poor Harry and both Sir Magnus and his wife saw the necessity of preserving their niece from anything so evil as such a marriage But Florence was very firm and was considered to be very obstinate To her mother she was obstinate but affectionate To Sir Magnus she was obstinate and in some degree respectful But to Lady Mountjoy she was neither affectionate nor respectful She took a great dislike to Lady Mountjoy who endeavored to domineer and who by the assistance of the two others was in fact tyrannical It was her opinion that the girl should be compelled to abandon the man and missus Mountjoy found herself constrained to follow this advice She did love her daughter who was her only child The main interest of her life was centred in her daughter Her only remaining ambition rested on her daughter s marriage She had long revelled in the anticipation of being the mother in law of the owner of Tretton Park She had been very proud of her daughter s beauty Then had come the first blow when Harry Annesley had come to Montpelier Place and had been welcomed by Florence missus Mountjoy had seen it all long before Florence had been aware of it And the first coming of Harry had been long before the absolute disgrace of Captain Scarborough at any rate before the tidings of that disgrace had reached Cheltenham missus Mountjoy had been still able to dream of Tretton Park after the Jews had got their fingers on it even after the Jews had been forced to relinquish their hold It can hardly be said that up to this very time missus Mountjoy had lost all hope in her nephew thinking that as the property had been entailed some portion of it must ultimately belong to him She had heard that Augustus was to have it and her desires had vacillated between the two Then Harry had positively declared himself and Augustus had given her to understand how wretched how mean how wicked had been Harry s conduct And he fully explained to her that Harry would be penniless She had indeed been aware that Buston quite a trifling thing compared to Tretton was to belong to him But entails were nothing nowadays It was part of the radical abomination to which England was being subjected Not even Buston was now to belong to Harry Annesley The small income which he had received from his uncle was stopped He was reduced to live upon his fellowship which would be stopped also if he married She even despised him because he was the fellow of a college she had looked for a husband for her daughter so much higher than any college could produce It was not from any lack of motherly love that she was opposed to Florence or from any innate cruelty that she handed her daughter over to the tender mercies of Lady Mountjoy And since she had been at Brussels there had come up farther hopes Another mode had shown itself of escaping Harry Annesley who was of all catastrophes the most dreaded and hated mister Anderson the second secretary of legation he whose business it was to ride about the boulevard with Sir Magnus had now declared himself in form Never saw a fellow so bowled over Sir Magnus had declared by which he had intended to signify that mister Anderson was now truly in love I ve seen him spooney a dozen times Sir Magnus had said confidentially to his sister in law but he has never gone to this length He has asked a lot of girls to have him but he has always been off it again before the week was over He has written to his mother now And mister Anderson showed his love by very unmistakable signs Sir Magnus too and Lady Mountjoy were evidently on the same side as mister Anderson Sir Magnus thought there was no longer any good in waiting for his nephew the captain and of that other nephew Augustus he did not entertain any very high idea Sir Magnus had corresponded lately with Augustus and was certainly not on his side But he so painted mister Anderson s prospects in life as did also Lady Mountjoy as to make it appear that if Florence could put up with young Anderson she would do very well with herself He s sure to be a baronet some of these days you know said Sir Magnus I don t think that would go very far with Florence said her mother But it ought Look about in the world and you ll see that it does go a long way He d be the fifth baronet But his elder brother is alive The queerest fellow you ever saw in your born days and his life is not worth a year s purchase He s got some infernal disease nostalgia or what d ye call it which never leaves him a moment s peace and then he drinks nothing but milk Sure to go off cock sure I shouldn t like Florence to count upon that And then Hugh Anderson the fellow here is very well off as it is He has four hundred pounds here and another five hundred pounds of his own Florence has or will have four hundred pounds of her own I should call them deuced rich I should indeed as beginners She could have her pair of ponies here and what more would she want These arguments did go very far with missus Mountjoy the farther because in her estimation Sir Magnus was a great man He was the greatest Englishman at any rate in Brussels and where should she go for advice but to an Englishman And she did not know that Sir Magnus had succeeded in borrowing a considerable sum of money from his second secretary of legation Leave her to me for a little just leave her to me said Lady Mountjoy I would not say anything hard to her said the mother pleading for her naughty child Not too hard but she must be made to understand You see there have been misfortunes As to Mountjoy Scarborough he s past hoping for You think so Altogether When a man has disappeared there s an end of him There was Lord Baltiboy s younger son disappeared and he turned out to be a Zouave corporal in a French regiment They did get him out of course but then he went preaching in America You may take it for granted that when a man has absolutely vanished from the clubs he ll never be any good again as a marrying man But there s his brother who they say is to have the property A very cold blooded sort of young man who doesn t care a straw for his own family He had received very sternly the overtures for a loan from Sir Magnus And he as I understand has never declared himself in Florence s favor You can t count upon Augustus Scarborough Not just count upon him Whereas there s young Anderson who is the most gentleman like young man I know all ready It will have been such a turn of luck your coming here and catching him up I don t know that it can be called a turn of luck Florence has a very nice fortune of her own And she wants to give it to this penniless reprobate It is just one of those cases in which you must deal roundly with a girl She has to be frightened and that s about the truth of it After this Lady Mountjoy did succeed in getting Florence alone with herself into her morning room When her mother told her that her aunt wished to see her she answered first that she had no special wish to see her aunt Her mother declared that in her aunt s house she was bound to go when her aunt sent for her To this Florence demurred She was she thought her aunt s guest but by no means at her aunt s disposal But at last she obeyed her mother She had resolved that she would obey her mother in all things but one and therefore she went one morning to her aunt s chamber But as she went she was on the first instance caught by her uncle and taken by him into a little private sanctum behind his official room My dear he said just come in here for two minutes I am on my way up to my aunt I know it my dear Lady Mountjoy has been talking it all over with me Upon my word you can t do anything better than take young Anderson I can t do that Uncle Magnus Why not There s poor Mountjoy Scarborough he has gone astray There is no question of my cousin And Augustus is no better There is no question of Augustus either As to that other chap he isn t any good he isn t indeed You mean mister Annesley Yes Harry Annesley as you call him He hasn t got a shilling to bless himself with or wouldn t have if he was to marry you But I have got something Not enough for both of you I m afraid That uncle of his has disinherited him His uncle can t disinherit him He s quite young enough to marry and have a family and then Annesley will be disinherited He has stopped his allowance anyway and you mustn t think of him He did something uncommonly unhandsome the other day though I don t quite know what He did nothing unhandsome Uncle Magnus Of course a young lady will stand up for her lover but you will really have to drop him I m not a hard sort of man but this was something that the world will not stand When he thought the man had been murdered he didn t say anything about it for fear they should tax him with it And then he swore he had never seen him It was something of that sort He never feared that any one would suspect him And now young Anderson has proposed I should not have spoken else but it s my duty to tell you about young Anderson He s a gentleman all round So is mister Annesley And Anderson has got into no trouble at all He does his duty here uncommonly well I never had less trouble with any young fellow than I have had with him No licking him into shape or next to none and he has a very nice private income You together would have plenty and could live here till you had settled on apartments A pair of ponies would be just the thing for you to drive about and support the British interests You think of it my dear and you ll find that I m right Then Florence escaped from that room and went up to receive the much more severe lecture which she was to have from her aunt Come in my dear said Lady Mountjoy in her most austere voice She had a voice which could assume austerity when she knew her power to be in the ascendant As Florence entered the room Miss Abbott left it by a door on the other side Take that chair Florence I want to have a few minutes conversation with you Then Florence sat down When a young lady is thinking of being married a great many things have to be taken into consideration This seemed to be so much a matter of fact that Florence did not feel it necessary to make any reply Of course I am aware you are thinking of being married Oh yes said Florence But to whom To Harry Annesley said Florence intending to imply that all the world knew that I hope not I hope not Indeed I may say that it is quite out of the question In the first place he is a beggar He has begged from none said Florence He is what the world calls a beggar when a young man without a penny thinks of being married I m not a beggar and what I ve got will be his My dear you re talking about what you don t understand A young lady cannot give her money away in that manner it will not be allowed Neither your mother nor Sir Magnus nor will I permit it Here Florence restrained herself but drew herself up in her chair as though prepared to speak out her mind if she should be driven Lady Mountjoy would not permit it She thought that she would feel herself quite able to tell Lady Mountjoy that she had neither power nor influence in the matter but she determined to be silent a little longer In the first place a gentleman who is a gentleman never attempts to marry a lady for her money But when a lady has the money she can express herself much more clearly than she could otherwise I don t quite understand what you mean by that my dear When mister Annesley proposed to me he was the acknowledged heir to his uncle s property A trumpery affair at the best of it It would have sufficed for me Then I accepted him That goes for nothing from a lady Of course your acceptance was contingent on circumstances It was so on my regard Having accepted him and as my regard remains just as warm as ever I certainly shall not go back because of anything his uncle may do I only say this to explain that he was quite justified in his offer It was not for my small fortune that he came to me I m not so sure of that But if my money can be of any use to him he s quite welcome to it Sir Magnus spoke to me about a pair of ponies I d rather have him than a pair of ponies I m coming to that just now Here is mister Anderson Oh yes he s here There was certainly a touch of impatience in the tone in which this was uttered It was as though she had said that mister Anderson had so contrived that she could have no doubt whatever about his continued presence mister Anderson had made himself so conspicuous as to be visible to her constantly Lady Mountjoy who intended at present to sing mister Anderson s praises felt this to be impertinent I don t know what you mean by that mister Anderson has behaved himself quite like a gentleman and you ought to be very proud of any token you may receive of his regard and affection But I m not bound to return to it You are bound to think of it when those who are responsible for your actions tell you to do so Mamma you mean I mean your uncle Sir Magnus Mountjoy She did not quite dare to say that she had meant herself I suppose you will admit that Sir Magnus is a competent judge of young men s characters He may be a judge of mister Anderson because mister Anderson is his clerk There was something of an intention to depreciate in the word clerk Florence had not thought much of mister Anderson s worth nor as far as she had seen them of the duties generally performed at the British Embassy She was ignorant of the peculiar little niceties and intricacies which required the residence at Brussels of a gentleman with all the tact possessed by Sir Magnus She did not know that while the mere international work of the office might be safely intrusted to mister Blow and mister Bunderdown all those little niceties that smiling and that frowning that taking off of hats and only half taking them off that genial easy manner and that stiff hauteur formed the peculiar branch of Sir Magnus himself and under Sir Magnus of mister Anderson She did not understand that even to that pair of ponies which was promised to her were to be attached certain important functions which she was to control as the deputy of the great man s deputy And now she had called the great man s deputy a clerk mister Anderson is no such thing said Lady Mountjoy His young man then or private secretary only somebody else is that You are very impertinent and very ungrateful mister Anderson is second secretary of legation There is no officer attached to our establishment of more importance I believe you say it on purpose to anger me And then you compare this gentleman to mister Annesley a man to whom no one will speak I will speak to him Had Harry heard her say that he ought to have been a happy man in spite of his trouble You What good can you do him Florence nodded her head almost imperceptibly but still there was a nod signifying more than she could possibly say She thought that she could do him a world of good if she were near him and some good too though she were far away If she were with him she could hang on to his arm or perhaps at some future time round his neck and tell him that she would be true to him though all others might turn away And she could be just as true where she was though she could not comfort him by telling him so with her own words Then it was that she resolved upon writing that letter He should already have what little comfort she might administer in his absence Now listen to me Florence He is a thorough reprobate I will not hear him so called He is no reprobate He has behaved in such a way that all England is crying out about him He has done that which will never allow any gentleman to speak to him again Then there will be more need that a lady should do so But it is not true You put your knowledge of character against that of Sir Magnus Sir Magnus does not know the gentleman I do What s the good of talking of it aunt Harry Annesley has my word and nothing on earth shall induce me to go back from it Even were he what you say I would be true to him You would Certainly I would I could not willingly begin to love a man whom I knew to be base but when I had loved him I would not turn because of his baseness I couldn t do it It would be a great a terrible misfortune but it would have to be borne But here I know all the story to which you allude I know it too I am quite sure that the baseness has not been on his part In defence of my name he has been silent He might have spoken out if he had known all the truth then I was as much his own then as I am now One of these days I suppose I shall be more so You mean to marry him then Most certainly I do or I will never be married and as he is poor now and I must have my own money when I am twenty four I suppose I shall have to wait till then Will your mother s word go for nothing with you Poor mamma I do believe that mamma is very unhappy because she makes me unhappy What may take place between me and mamma I am not bound I think to tell you We shall be away soon and I shall be left to mamma alone And mamma would be left alone to her daughter Lady Mountjoy thought The visit must be prolonged so that at last mister Anderson might be enabled to prevail The visit had been originally intended for a month but was now prolonged indefinitely After that conversation between Lady Mountjoy and her niece two or three things happened all bearing upon our story Florence at once wrote her letter If things were going badly in England with Harry Annesley Harry should at any rate have the comfort of knowing what were her feelings if there might be comfort to him in that Perhaps after all he won t mind what I may say she thought to herself but only pretended to think it and at once flatly contradicted her own perhaps Then she told him most emphatically not to reply It was very important that she should write He was to receive her letter and there must be an end of it She was quite sure that he would understand her He would not subject her to the trouble of having to tell her own people that she was maintaining a correspondence for it would amount to that But still when the time came for the answer she had counted it up to the hour And when Sir Magnus sent for her and handed to her the letter having discussed that question with her mother she fully expected it and felt properly grateful to her uncle She wanted a little comfort too and when she had read the letter she knew that she had received it There had been a few words spoken between the two elder ladies after the interview between Florence and Lady Mountjoy She is a most self willed young woman said Lady Mountjoy Of course she loves her lover said missus Mountjoy desirous of making some excuse for her own daughter The girl was very troublesome but not the less her daughter I don t know any of them that don t who are worth anything If you regard it in that light Sarah she ll get the better of you If she marries him she will be lost that is the way you have got to look at it It is her future happiness you must think of and respectability She is a headstrong young woman and has to be treated accordingly What would you do I would be very severe But what am I to do I can t beat her I can t lock her up in her room Then you mean to give it up No I don t You shouldn t be so cross to me said poor missus Mountjoy When it had reached this the two ladies had become intimate I don t mean to give it up at all but what am I to do Remain here for the next month and and worry her let mister Anderson have his chance with her When she finds that everything will smile with her if she accepts him and that her life will be made a burden to her if she still sticks to her Harry Annesley she ll come round if she be like other girls Of course a girl can t be made to marry a man but there are ways and means By this Lady Mountjoy meant that the utmost cruelty should be used which would be compatible with a good breakfast dinner and bedroom Now missus Mountjoy knew herself to be incapable of this and knew also or thought that she knew that it would not be efficacious You stay here up to Christmas if you like it said Sir Magnus to his sister in law She can t but see Anderson every day and that goes a long way She of course puts on a resolute air as well as she can They all know how to do that Do you be resolute in return The deuce is in it if we can t have our way with her among us When you talk of ill usage nobody wants you to put her in chains There are different ways of killing a cat You get friends to write to you from England about young Annesley and I ll do the same The truth of course I mean Nothing can be worse than the truth said missus Mountjoy shaking her head sorrowfully Just so said Sir Magnus who was not at all sorrowful to hear so bad an account of the favored suitor Then we ll read her the letters She can t help hearing them Just the true facts you know That s fair nobody can call that cruel And then when she breaks down and comes to our call we ll all be as soft as mother s milk to her I shall see her going about the boulevards with a pair of ponies yet missus Mountjoy felt that when Sir Magnus spoke of Florence coming to his call he did not know her daughter But she had nothing better to do than to obey Sir Magnus Therefore she resolved to stay at Brussels another period of six weeks and told Florence that she had so resolved Just at present Brussels and Cheltenham would be all the same to Florence It will be a dreadful bore having them so long said poor Lady Mountjoy piteously to her husband For in the presence of Sir Magnus she was by no means the valiant woman that she was with some of her friends You find everything a bore What s the trouble What am I to do with them Take em about in the carriage Lord bless my soul what have you got a carriage for Then with Miss Abbott there s never room for any one else Leave Miss Abbott at home then What s the good of talking to me about Miss Abbott I suppose it doesn t matter to you whom my brother s daughter marries Lady Mountjoy did not think that it did matter much but she declared that she had already evinced the most tender solicitude Then stick to it The girl doesn t want to go out every day Leave her alone where Anderson can get at her He s always out riding with you No he s not not always And leave Miss Abbott at home Then there ll be room for two others Don t make difficulties Anderson will expect that I shall do something for him of course Because of the money said Lady Mountjoy whispering And I ve got to do something for her too Now there was a spice of honesty about Sir Magnus He knew that as he could not at once pay back these sums he was bound to make it up in some other way The debts would be left the same But that would remain with Providence Then came Harry s letter and there was a deep consultation It was known to have come from Harry by the Buntingford post mark missus Mountjoy proposed to consult Lady Mountjoy but to that Sir Magnus would not agree She d take her skin off her if she could now that she s angered said the lady s husband who no doubt knew the lady well Of course she ll learn that the letter has been written and then she ll throw it in our teeth She wouldn t believe that it had gone astray in coming here We should give her a sort of a whip hand over us So it was decided that Florence should have her letter CHAPTER XXXI FLORENCE S REQUEST Thus it was arranged that Florence should be left in mister Anderson s way mister Anderson as Sir Magnus had said was not always out riding There were moments in which even he was off duty And Sir Magnus contrived to ride a little earlier than usual so that he should get back while the carriage was still out on its rounds Lady Mountjoy certainly did her duty taking missus Mountjoy with her daily and generally Miss Abbott so that Florence was as it were left to the mercies of mister Anderson She could of course shut herself up in her bedroom but things had not as yet become so bad as that mister Anderson had not made himself terrible to her She did not in truth fear mister Anderson at all who was courteous in his manner and complimentary in his language and she came at this time to the conclusion that if mister Anderson continued his pursuit of her she would tell him the exact truth of the case As a gentleman and as a young man she thought that he would sympathize with her The one enemy whom she did dread was Lady Mountjoy She too had felt that her aunt could take her skin off her as Sir Magnus had said She had not heard the words but she knew that it was so and her dislike to Lady Mountjoy was in proportion It cannot be said that she was afraid She did not intend to leave her skin in her aunt s hands For every inch of skin taken she resolved to have an inch in return She was not acquainted with the expressive mode of language which Sir Magnus had adopted but she was prepared for all such attacks For Sir Magnus himself since he had given up the letter to her she did feel some regard Behind the British minister s house which though entitled to no such name was generally called the Embassy there was a large garden which though not much used by Sir Magnus or Lady Mountjoy was regarded as a valuable adjunct to the establishment Here Florence betook herself for exercise and here mister Anderson having put off the muddy marks of his riding found her one afternoon It must be understood that no young man was ever more in earnest than mister Anderson He too looking through the glass which had been prepared for him by Sir Magnus thought that he saw in the not very far distant future a missus Hugh Anderson driving a pair of gray ponies along the boulevard and he was much pleased with the sight It reached to the top of his ambition Florence was to his eyes really the sort of a girl whom a man in his position ought to marry A secretary of legation in a small foreign capital cannot do with a dowdy wife as may a clerk for instance in the Foreign Office A secretary of legation the second secretary he told himself was bound if he married at all to have a pretty and distinguee wife He knew all about the intricacies which had fallen in a peculiar way into his own hand mister Blow might have married a South Sea Islander and would have been none the worse as regarded his official duties mister Blow did not want the services of a wife in discovering and reporting all the secrets of the Belgium iron trade There was no intricacy in that no nicety There was much of what in his lighter moments mister Anderson called sweat He did not pretend to much capacity for such duties but in his own peculiar walk he thought that he was great But it was very fatiguing and he was sure that a wife was necessary to him There were little niceties which none but a wife could perform He had a great esteem for Sir Magnus Sir Magnus was well thought of by all the court and by the foreign minister at Brussels But Lady Mountjoy was really of no use The beginning and the end of it all with her was to show herself in a carriage It was incumbent upon him Anderson to marry He was loving enough and very susceptible He was too susceptible and he knew his own fault and he was always on guard against it as behooved a young man with such duties as his He was always falling in love and then using his diplomatic skill in avoiding the consequences He had found out that though one girl had looked so well under waxlight she did not endure the wear and tear of the day Another could not be always graceful or though she could talk well enough during a waltz she had nothing to say for herself at three o clock in the morning And he was driven to calculate that he would be wrong to marry a girl without a shilling It is a kind of thing that a man cannot afford to do unless he s sure of his position he had said on such an occasion to Montgomery Arbuthnot alluding especially to his brother s state of health When mister Anderson spoke of not being sure of his position he was always considered to allude to his brother s health In this way he had nearly got his little boat on to the rocks more than once and had given some trouble to Sir Magnus But now he was quite sure It s all there all round he had said to Arbuthnot more than once Arbuthnot said that it was there all round all round Waxlight and daylight made no difference to her She was always graceful Nobody with an eye in his head can doubt that said Anderson I should think not by Jove replied Arbuthnot And for talking you never catch her out never I never did certainly said Arbuthnot who as third secretary was obedient and kind hearted And then look at her money Of course a fellow wants something to help him on My position is so uncertain that I cannot do without it Of course not Now with some girls it s so deuced hard to find out You hear that a girl has got money but when the time comes it depends on the life of a father who doesn t think of dying damme doesn t think of it Those fellows never do said Arbuthnot But here you see I know all about it When she s twenty four only twenty four she ll have ten thousand pounds of her own I hate a mercenary fellow Oh yes that s beastly Nobody can say that of me Circumstanced as I am I want something to help to keep the pot boiling She has got it quite as much as I want quite and I know all about it without the slightest doubt in the world For the small loan of fifteen hundred pounds Sir Magnus paid the full value of the interest and deficient security Sir Magnus tells me that if I ll only stick to her I shall be sure to win There s some fellow in England has just touched her heart just touched it you know I understand said Arbuthnot looking very wise He is not a fellow of very much account said Anderson one of those handsome fellows without conduct and without courage I ve known lots of em said Arbuthnot His name is Annesley said Anderson I never saw him in my life but that s what Sir Magnus says He has done something awfully disreputable I don t quite understand what it is but it s something which ought to make him unfit to be her husband Nobody knows the world better than Sir Magnus and he says that it is so Nobody does know the world better than Sir Magnus said Arbuthnot And so that conversation was brought to an end One day soon after this he caught her walking in the garden Her mother and Miss Abbot were still out with Lady Mountjoy in the carriage and Sir Magnus had retired after the fatigue of his ride to sleep for half an hour before dinner All alone Miss Mountjoy he said Yes alone mister Anderson I m never in better company So I think but then if I were here you wouldn t be all alone would you Not if you were with me That s what I mean But yet two people may be alone as regards the world at large Mayn t they I don t understand the nicety of language well enough to say We used to have a question among us when we were children whether a wild beast could howl in an empty cavern It s the same sort of thing Why shouldn t he Because the cavern would not be empty if the wild beast were in it Did you ever see a girl bang an egg against a wall in a stocking and then look awfully surprised because she had smashed it I don t understand the joke She had been told she couldn t break an egg in an empty stocking Then she was made to look in and there was the broken egg for her pains I don t know what made me tell you that story It s a very good story I ll get Miss Abbott to do it to night She believes everything And everybody Then she s a happy woman I wish you d believe everybody So I do nearly everybody There are some inveterate liars whom nobody can believe I hope I am not regarded as one You certainly not If anybody were to speak of you as such behind your back no one would take your part more loyally than I But nobody would That s something at any rate Then you do believe that I love you I believe that you think so And that I don t know my own heart That s very common mister Anderson I wasn t quite sure of my own heart twelve months ago but I know it now He felt that his hopes ran very low when this was said She had never before spoken to him of his rival nor had he to her He knew or fancied that he knew that her heart had been touched as he had said to Arbuthnot But the touch must have been very deep if she felt herself constrained to speak to him on the subject It had been his desire to pass over mister Annesley and never to hear the name mentioned between them You were speaking of your own heart Well I was no doubt It is a silly thing to talk of I dare say I m going to tell you of my heart and I hope you won t think it silly I do so because I believe you to be a gentleman and a man of honor He blushed at the words and the tone in which they were spoken but his heart fell still lower mister Anderson I am engaged Here she paused a moment but he had nothing to say I am engaged to marry a gentleman whom I love with all my heart and all my strength and all my body I love him so that nothing can ever separate me from him or at least from the thoughts of him As regards all the interests of life I feel as though I were already his wife If I ever marry any man I swear to you that it will be him Then mister Anderson felt that all hope had utterly departed from him She had said that she believed him to be a man of truth He certainly believed her to be a true speaking woman He asked himself and he found it to be quite impossible to doubt her word on this subject Now I will go on and tell you my troubles My mother disapproves of the man Sir Magnus has taken upon himself to disapprove and Lady Mountjoy disapproves especially I don t care two straws about Sir Magnus and Lady Mountjoy As to Lady Mountjoy it is simply an impertinence on her part interfering with me There was something in her face as she said this which made mister Anderson feel that if he could only succeed in having her and the pair of ponies he would be a prouder man than the ambassador at Paris But he knew that it was hopeless As to my mother that is indeed a sorrow She has been to me the dearest mother putting her only hopes of happiness in me No mother was ever more devoted to a child and of all children I should be the most ungrateful were I to turn against her But from my early years she has wished me to marry a man whom I could not bring myself to love You have heard of Captain Scarborough The man who disappeared He was and is my first cousin He is in some way connected with Sir Magnus Through mamma Mamma is aunt to Captain Scarborough and she married the brother of Sir Magnus Well he has disappeared and been disinherited I cannot explain all about it for I don t understand it but he has come to great trouble It was not on that account that I would not marry him It was partly because I did not like him and partly because of Harry Annesley I will tell you everything because I want you to know my story But my mother has disliked mister Annesley because she has thought that he has interfered with my cousin I understand all that And she has been taught to think that mister Annesley has behaved very badly I cannot quite explain it because there is a brother of Captain Scarborough who has interfered I never loved Captain Scarborough but that man I hate He has spread those stories Captain Scarborough has disappeared but before he went he thought it well to revenge himself on mister Annesley He attacked him in the street late at night and endeavored to beat him But why Why indeed That such a trumpery cause as a girl s love should operate with such a man I can understand it oh yes I can understand it I believe he was tipsy and he had been gambling and had lost all his money more than all his money He was a ruined man and reckless and wretched I can forgive him and so does Harry But in the struggle Harry got the best of it and left him there in the street No weapons had been used except that Captain Scarborough had a stick There was no reason to suppose him hurt nor was he much hurt He had behaved very badly and Harry left him Had he gone for a policeman he could only have given him in charge The man was not hurt and seems to have walked away The papers were full of it Yes the papers were full of it because he was missing I don t know yet what became of him but I have my suspicions They say that he has been seen at Monaco Very likely But I have nothing to do with that Though he was my cousin I am touched nearer in another place Young mister Scarborough who I suspect knows all about his brother took upon himself to cross question mister Annesley mister Annesley did not care to tell anything of that struggle in the streets and denied that he had seen him In truth he did not want to have my name mentioned My belief is that Augustus Scarborough knew exactly what had taken place when he asked the question It was he who really was false But he is now the heir to Tretton and a great man in his way and in order to injure Harry Annesley he has spread abroad the story which they all tell here But why He does that is all I know But I will not be a hypocrite He chose to wish that I should not marry Harry Annesley I cannot tell you farther than that But he has persuaded mamma and has told every one He shall never persuade me Everybody seems to believe him said mister Anderson not as intending to say that he believed him now but that he had done so Of course they do He has simply ruined Harry He too has been disinherited now I don t know how they do these things but it has been done His uncle has been turned against him and his whole income has been taken from him But they will never persuade me Nor if they did would I be untrue to him It is a grand thing for a girl to have a perfect faith in the man she has to marry as I have as I have I know my man and will as soon disbelieve in Heaven as in him But were he what they say he is he would still have to become my husband I should be broken hearted but I should still be true Thank God though thank God he has done nothing and will do nothing to make me ashamed of him Now you know my story Yes now I know it The tears came very near the poor man s eyes as he answered And what will you do for me What shall I do Yes what will you do I have told you all my story believing you to be a fine tempered gentleman You have entertained a fancy which has been encouraged by Sir Magnus Will you promise me not to speak to me of it again Will you relieve me of so much of my trouble Will you will you Then when he turned away she followed him and put both her hands upon his arm Will you do that little thing for me A little thing Is it not a little thing when I am so bound to that other man that nothing can move me Whether it be little or whether it be much will you not do it She still held him by the arm but his face was turned from her so that she could not see it The tears absolute tears were running down his cheeks What did it behoove him as a man to do Was he to believe her vows now and grant her request and was she then to give herself to some third person and forget Harry Annesley altogether How would it be with him then A faint heart never won a fair lady All is fair in love and war You cannot catch cherries by holding your mouth open A great amount of wisdom such as this came to him at the spur of the moment But there was her hand upon his arm and he could not elude her request Will you not do it for me she asked again I will he said still keeping his face turned away I knew it I knew you would You are high minded and honest and cannot be cruel to a poor girl And if in time to come when I am Harry Annesley s wife we shall chance to meet each other as we will he shall thank you I shall not want that What will his thanks do for me You do not think that I shall be silent to oblige him Then he walked forth from out of the garden and she had never seen his tears But she knew well that he was weeping and she sympathized with him CHAPTER XXXII mister ANDERSON IS ILL When they went down to dinner that day it became known that mister Anderson did not intend to dine with them He s got a headache said Sir Magnus He says he s got a headache I never knew such a thing in my life before It was quite clear that Sir Magnus did not think that his lieutenant ought to have such a headache as would prevent his coming to dinner and that he did not quite believe in the headache There was a dinner ready a very good dinner which it was his business to provide He always did provide it and took a great deal of trouble to see that it was good There isn t a table so well kept in all Brussels he used to boast But when he had done his share he expected that Anderson and Arbuthnot should do theirs especially Anderson There had been sometimes a few words not quite a quarrel but nearly so on the subject of dining out Sir Magnus only dined out with royalty cabinet ministers and other diplomats Even then he rarely got a good dinner what he called a good dinner He often took Anderson with him He was the doyen among the diplomats in Brussels and a little indulgence was shown to him Therefore he thought that Anderson should be as true to him as was he to Anderson It was not for Anderson s sake indeed who felt the bondage to be irksome and Sir Magnus knew that his subordinate sometimes groaned in spirit But a good dinner is a good dinner especially the best dinner in Brussels and Sir Magnus felt that something ought to be given in return He had not that perfect faith in mankind which is the surest evidence of a simple mind Ideas crowded upon him Had Anderson a snug little dinner party just two or three friends in his own room Sir Magnus would not have been very angry he was rarely very angry but he should like to show his cleverness by finding it out Anderson had been quite well when he was out riding and he did not remember him ever before to have had a headache Is he very bad Arbuthnot I haven t seen him sir since he was riding Who has seen him He was in the garden with me said Florence boldly I suppose that did not give him a headache Not that I perceived It is very singular that he should have a headache just when dinner is ready continued Sir Magnus You had better leave the young man alone said Lady Mountjoy And one who knew the ways of living at the British Embassy would be sure that after this Sir Magnus would not leave the young man alone His nature was not simple It seemed to him again that there might be a little dinner party and that Lady Mountjoy knew all about it Richard he said to the butler go into mister Anderson s room and see if he is very bad Richard came back and whispered to the great man that Anderson was not in his room This is very remarkable A bad headache and not in his room Where is he I insist on knowing where mister Anderson is You had better leave him alone said Lady Mountjoy Leave a man alone because he s ill He might die Shall I go and see said Arbuthnot I wish you would and bring him in here if he s well enough to show I don t approve of a young man going without his dinner There s nothing so bad He ll be sure to get something Sir Magnus said Lady Mountjoy But Sir Magnus insisted that mister Arbuthnot should go and look after his friend It was now November and at eight o clock was quite dark but the weather was fine and something of the mildness of autumn remained Arbuthnot was not long in discovering that mister Anderson was again walking in the garden He had left Florence there and had gone to the house but had found himself to be utterly desolate and miserable She had exacted from him a promise which was not compatible with any kind of happiness to which he could now look forward In the first place all Brussels knew that he had been in love with Florence Mountjoy He thought that all Brussels knew it And they knew that he had been in earnest in this love He did believe that all Brussels had given him credit for so much And now they would know that he had suddenly ceased to make love It might be that this should be attributed to gallantry on his part that it should be considered that the lady had been deserted But he was conscious that he was not so good a hypocrite as not to show that he was broken hearted He was quite sure that it would be seen that he had got the worst of it But when he asked himself questions as to his own condition he told himself that there was suffering in store for him more heavy to bear than these There could be no ponies with Florence driving them and a boy in his own livery behind seen upon the boulevards That vision was gone and forever And then came upon him an idea that the absence of the girl from other portions of his life might touch him more nearly He did feel something like actual love And the more she had told him of her devotion to Harry Annesley the more strongly he had felt the value of that devotion Why should this man have it and not he He had not been disinherited He had not been knocked about in a street quarrel He had not been driven to tell a lie as to his having not seen a man when he had in truth knocked him down He had quite agreed with Florence that Harry was justified in the lie but there was nothing in it to make the girl love him the better for it And then looking forward he could perceive the possibility of an event which if it should occur would cover him with confusion and disgrace If after all Florence were to take not Harry Annesley but somebody else How foolish how credulous how vain would he have been then to have made the promise Girls did such things every day He had promised and he thought that he must keep his promise but she would be bound by no promise As he thought of it he reflected that he might even yet exact such a promise from her But when the dinner time came he really was sick with love or sick with disappointment He felt that he could not eat his dinner under the battery of raillery which was always coming from Sir Magnus and therefore he had told the servants that as the evening progressed he would have something to eat in his own room And then he went out to wander in the dusk beneath the trees in the garden Here he was encountered by mister Arbuthnot with his dress boots and white cravat What the mischief are you doing here old fellow I m not very well I have an awfully bilious headache Sir Magnus is kicking up a deuce of a row because you re not there Sir Magnus be blowed How am I to be there if I ve got a bilious headache I m not dressed I could not have dressed myself for a five pound note Couldn t you now Shall I go back and tell him that But you must have something to eat I don t know what s up but Sir Magnus is in a taking He s always in a taking I sometimes think he s the biggest fool out And there s the place kept vacant next to Miss Mountjoy Grascour wanted to sit there but her ladyship wouldn t let him And I sat next Miss Abbott because I didn t want to be in your way Tell Grascour to go and sit there or you may do so It s all nothing to me This he said in the bitterness of his heart by no means intending to tell his secret but unable to keep it within his own bosom What s the matter Anderson asked the other piteously I am clean broken hearted I don t mind telling you I know you re a good fellow and I ll tell you everything It s all over All over with Miss Mountjoy Then Anderson began to tell the whole story but before he had got half through or a quarter through another message came from Sir Magnus Sir Magnus is becoming very angry indeed whispered the butler He says that mister Arbuthnot is to go back I d better go or I shall catch it What s up with him Richard asked Anderson Well if you ask me mister Anderson I think he s a suspecting of something What does he suspect I think he s a thinking that perhaps you are having a jolly time of it Richard had known his master many years and could almost read his inmost thoughts I don t say as it so but that s what I am thinking You tell him I ain t You tell him I ve a bad bilious headache and that the air in the garden does it good You tell him that I mean to have something to eat up stairs when my head is better and do you mind and let me have it and a bottle of claret With this the butler went back and so did Arbuthnot after asking one other question I m so sorry it isn t all serene with Miss Mountjoy It isn t then Don t mind now but it isn t serene Don t say a word about her but she has done me I think I shall get leave of absence and go away for two months You ll have to do all the riding old fellow I shall go but I don t know where I shall go You return to them now and tell them I ve such a bilious headache I don t know which way to turn myself Arbuthnot went back and found Sir Magnus quarrelling grievously with the butler I don t think he s doing anything as he shouldn t the butler whispered having seen into his master s mind What do you mean by that Do let the matter drop said Lady Mountjoy who had also seen into her husband s mind and saw moreover that the butler had done so A young man s dinner isn t worth all this bother I won t let the matter drop What does he mean when he says that he isn t doing anything that he shouldn t I ve never said anything about what he was doing He isn t dressed Sir Magnus He finds himself a little better now and means to have something up stairs Then there came an awful silence during which the dinner was eaten Sir Magnus knew nothing of the truth simply suspecting the headache to be a myth Lady Mountjoy with a woman s quickness thought that there had been some words between Florence and her late lover and as she disliked Florence was inclined to throw all the blame upon her A word had been said to missus Mountjoy I don t think he ll trouble me any more mamma which missus Mountjoy did not quite understand but which she connected with the young man s absence But Florence understood it all and liked mister Anderson the better Could it really be that for love of her he would lose his dinner Could it be that he was so grievously afflicted at the loss of a girl s heart There he was walking out in the dark and the cold half famished all because she loved Harry Annesley so well that there could be no chance for him Girls believe so little in the truth of the love of men that any sign of its reality touches them to the core Poor Hugh Anderson A tear came into her eye as she thought that he was wandering there in the dark and all for the love of her The rest of the dinner passed away in silence and Sir Magnus hardly became cordial and communicative with M Grascour even under the influence of his wine On the next morning just before lunch Florence was waylaid by mister Anderson as she was passing along one of the passages in the back part of the house Miss Mountjoy he said I want to ask from your great goodness the indulgence of a few words Certainly Could you come into the garden If you will give me time to go and change my boots and get a shawl We ladies are not ready to go out always as are you gentlemen Anywhere will do Come in here and he led the way into a small parlor which was not often used I was so sorry to hear last night that you were unwell mister Anderson I was not very well certainly after what I had heard before dinner He did not tell her that he so far recovered as to be able to drink a bottle of claret and to smoke a couple of cigars in his bedroom Of course you remember what took place yesterday Remember Oh yes I shall not readily forget it I made you a promise You did very kindly And I mean to keep it I m sure you do because you re a gentleman I don t think I ought to have made it Oh mister Anderson I don t think I ought See what I am giving up Nothing except the privilege of troubling me But if it should be something else Do not be angry with me but loving you as I do of course my mind is full of it I have promised and must be dumb And I shall be spared great vexation But suppose I were to hear that in six months time you had married some one else mister Annesley you mean Not in six months Somebody else Not mister Annesley There is nobody else But there might be It is impossible After all that I told you do not you understand But if there were The poor man as he made the suggestion looked very piteous If there were I think you should promise me I shall be that somebody else That would be no more than fair She paused a moment to think frowning the while Certainly not Certainly not I can make no such promise nor should you ask it I am to promise that under certain circumstances I would become your wife when I know that under no circumstances I would do so Under no circumstances Under none What would you have me say mister Anderson Supposing yourself engaged to marry a girl I wish I were to you To a girl who loved you and whom you loved There s no doubt about my loving her You can follow my meaning and I wish that you would do so What would you think if you were to hear that she had promised to marry some one else in the event of your deserting her It is out of the question I mean to be the wife of Harry Annesley Say that it is not to be so and you will simply destroy me Of one thing I may be sure that I will marry him or nobody You promised me not because your promise was necessary for that but to spare me from trouble till that time shall come And I am grateful very grateful Then she left him suffering from another headache Was there anything said between you and mister Anderson yesterday her aunt inquired that afternoon Why do you ask Because it is necessary that I should know I do not see the necessity mister Anderson has at any rate your permission to say what he likes to me but I am not on that account bound to tell you all that he does say But I will tell you He has promised to trouble me no farther I told him that I was engaged to mister Annesley and he like a gentleman has assured me that he will desist Just because you asked him Yes aunt just because I asked him He will not be bound by such a promise for a moment It is a thing not to be heard of If that kind of thing is to go on any young lady will be entitled to ask any young gentleman not to say a word of marriage just at her request Some of the young ladies would not care for that perhaps Don t be impertinent I should not for one aunt only that I am already engaged And of course the young ladies would be bound to make such requests which would go for nothing at all I never heard of anything so monstrous You are not only to have the liberty of refusing but are to be allowed to bind a gentleman not to ask He has promised Pshaw It means nothing It is between him and me I asked him because I wished to save myself from being troubled As for that other man my dear it is quite out of the question From all that I hear it is on the cards that he may be arrested and put into prison I am quite sure that at any rate he deserves it The letters which Sir Magnus gets about him are fearful The things that he has done well penal servitude for life would be the proper punishment And it will come upon him sooner or later I never knew a man of that kind escape And you now to come and tell us that you intend to be his wife I do said Florence bobbing her head And what your uncle says to you has no effect Not the least in the world nor what my aunt says I believe that neither the one nor the other know what they are talking about You have been defaming a gentleman of the highest character a Fellow of a college a fine hearted noble high spirited man simply because because because Then she burst into tears and rushed out of the room but she did not break down before she had looked at her aunt and spoken to her aunt with a fierce indignation which had altogether served to silence Lady Mountjoy for the moment PART II CHAPTER XXXIII mister BARRY Good bye sir You ought not to be angry with me I am sure it will be better for us both to remain as we are This was said by Miss Dorothy Grey as a gentleman departed from her and made his way out of the front door at the Fulham Manor house Miss Grey had received an offer of marriage and had declined it The offer had been made by a worthy man he being no other than her father s partner mister Barry It may be remembered that on discussing the affairs of the firm with her father Dolly Grey had been accustomed to call this partner the Devil It was not that she had thought this partner to be specially devilish nor was he so It had ever been Miss Grey s object to have the affairs of the firm managed with an integrity which among lawyers might be called Quixotic Her father she had dubbed Reason and herself Conscience but in calling mister Barry the Devil she had not intended to signify any defalcation from honesty more than ordinary in lawyers offices She did in fact like mister Barry He would occasionally come out and dine with her father He was courteous and respectful and performed his duties with diligence He spent nobody s money but his own and not all of that nor did he look upon the world as a place to which men were sent that they might play He was nearly forty years old was clean a little bald and healthy in all his ways There was nothing of a devil about him except that his conscience was not peculiarly attentive to abstract honesty and abstract virtue There must according to him be always a little give and take in the world but in the pursuit of his profession he gave a great deal more than he took He thought himself to be an honest practitioner and yet in all domestic professional conferences with her father mister Barry had always been Miss Grey s Devil The possibility of such a request as had been now made had been already discussed between Dolly and her father Dolly had said that the idea was absurd mister Grey had not seen the absurdity There had been nothing more common he had said than that a young partner should marry an old partner s daughter It s not put into the partnership deed Dolly had rejoined But Dolly had never believed that the time would come Now it had come mister Barry had as yet possessed no more than a fourth of the business He had come in without any capital and had been contented with a fourth He now suggested to Dolly that on their marriage the business should be equally divided And he had named the house in which they would live There was a pleasant genteel residence on the other side of the water at Putney Miss Grey had suggested that the business might be divided in a manner that would be less burdensome to mister Barry As for the house she could not leave her father Upon the whole she had thought that it would be better for both of them that they should remain as they were By that Miss Grey had not intended to signify that mister Barry was to remain single but that he would have to do so in reference to Miss Grey When he was gone Dolly Grey spent the remainder of the afternoon in contemplating what would have been her condition had she agreed to join her lot to that of mister Barry and she came to the conclusion that it would have been simply unendurable There was nothing of romance in her nature but as she looked at matrimony with all its blisses and mister Barry among them she told herself that death would be preferable I know myself she said I should come to hate him with a miserable hatred And then I should hate myself for having done him so great an evil And as she continued thinking she assured herself that there was but one man with whom she could live and that that was her father And then other questions presented themselves to her which were not so easily answered What would become of her when he should go He was now sixty six and she was only thirty two He was healthy for his age but would complain of his work She knew that he must in course of nature go much the first Ten years he might live while she might probably be called upon to endure for thirty more I shall have to do it all alone she said all alone without a companion without one soul to whom I can open my own But if I were to marry mister Barry she continued I should at once be encumbered with a soul to whom I could not open my own I suppose I shall be enabled to live through it as do others Then she began to prepare for her father s coming As long as he did remain with her she would make the most of him Papa she said as she took him by the hand as he entered the house and led him into the dining room who do you think has been here mister Barry Then he has told you Not a word not even that he was coming But I saw him as he left the chambers and he had on a bright hat and a new coat And he thought that those could move me I have not known that he has wanted to move you You asked me to guess and I have guessed right it seems Yes you have guessed right And why did he come Only to ask me to be his wife And what did you say to him Dolly What did I say to the Devil She still held him by the hand and now she laughed lightly as she looked into his face Cannot you guess what I said to him I am sorry for it that s all Sorry for it Oh papa do not say that you are sorry Do you want to lose me I do not want to think that for my own selfish purposes I have retained you So he has asked you Yes he has asked me And you have answered him positively Most positively And for my sake No papa I have not said that I was joking when I asked whether you wished to lose me Of course you do not want to lose me Then she wound her arm round him and put up her face to be kissed But now come and dress yourself as you call it The dinner is late We will talk about it again after dinner But immediately after dinner the conversation went away to mister Scarborough and the Scarborough matters I am to see Augustus and he is to tell me something about Mountjoy and his affairs They say that Mountjoy is now in Paris The money can be given to them now if he will consent and will sign the deed releasing the property But the men have not all as yet agreed to accept the simple sums which they advanced That fellow Hart stands out and says that he would sooner lose it all Then he will lose it all said Dolly But the squire will consent to pay nothing unless they all agree Augustus is talking about his excessive generosity It is generous on his part said Dolly He sees his own advantage though I cannot quite understand where He tells Tyrrwhit that as there is so great an increase to the property he is willing for the sake of the good name of the family to pay all that has been in truth advanced but he is most anxious to do it now while his father is alive I think he fears that there will be lawsuits and that they may succeed I doubt whether he thanks his father But why should his father lie for his sake since they are on such bad terms Because his father was on worse terms with Mountjoy when he told the lie That is what I think Augustus thinks But his father told no lie at that time and cannot now go back to falsehood My belief is that if he were confident that such is the fact he would not surrender a shilling to pay these men their moneys He may stop a lawsuit which is like enough though they could only lose it And if Mountjoy should turn out to be the heir which is impossible he will be able to turn round and say that by his efforts he had saved so much of the property My head becomes so bewildered said Dolly that I can hardly understand it yet I think I understand it but I can only guess at his mind But he has got Tyrrwhit to accept forty thousand pounds which is the sum he in truth advanced The stake is too great for the man to lose it without ruin He can get it back now and save himself But Hart is the more determined blackguard He with two others has a claim for thirty five thousand pounds for which he has given but ten thousand pounds in hard cash and he thinks that he may get some profit out of Tyrrwhit s money and holds out For how much For the entire debt he tells me but I know that he is trying to deal with Tyrrwhit Tyrrwhit would pay him five thousand I think so as to secure the immediate payment of his own money Then there are a host of others who are contented to take what they have advanced but not contented if Hart is to have more There are other men in the background who advanced the money All the rascaldom of London is let loose upon me But Hart is the one man who holds his head the highest But if they will accept no terms they will get nothing said Dolly If once they attempt to go to law all will be lost There are wheels within wheels When the old man dies Mountjoy himself will probably put in a claim to the entire estate and will get some lawyer to take up the case for him You would not Certainly not because I know that Augustus is the eldest legitimate son As far as I can make it out Augustus is at present allowing Mountjoy the money on which he lives His father does not But the old man must know that Augustus does though he pretends to be ignorant But why is Hart to get money out of Tyrrwhit To secure the payment of the remainder mister Tyrrwhit would be very glad to get his forty thousand pounds back would pay five thousand pounds to get the forty back But nothing will be paid unless they all agree to join in freeing the property Therefore Hart who is the sharpest rascal of the lot stands out for some share of his contemplated plunder And you must be joined in such an arrangement Not at all I cannot help surmising what is to be done In dealing with the funds of the property I go to the men and say to them so much and so much and so much you have actually lost Agree among yourselves to accept that and it shall be paid to you That is honest I do not know But I do Every shilling that the son of my client has had from them my client is ready to pay There is some hitch among them and I make my surmises But I have no dealings with them It is for them to come to me now Dolly only shook her head You cannot touch pitch and not be defiled That was what Dolly said but said it to herself And then she went on and declared to herself still farther that mister Barry was pitch She knew that mister Barry had seen Hart and had seen Tyrrwhit and had been bargaining with them She excused her father because he was her father but according to her thinking there should have been no dealings with such men as these except at the end of a pair of tongs And now Dolly said her father after a long pause tell me about mister Barry There is nothing more to be told Not of what you said to him but of the reasons which have made you so determined Would it not be better for you to be married If I could choose my husband Whom would you choose You That is nonsense I am your father You know what I mean There is no one else among my circle of acquaintances with whom I should care to live There is no one else with whom I should care to do more than die When I look at it all round it seems to be absolutely impossible That I should on a sudden entertain habits of the closest intimacy with such a one as mister Barry What should I say to him when he went forth in the morning How should I welcome him when he came back at night What would be our breakfast and what would be our dinner Think what are yours and mine all the little solicitudes all the free abuse all the certainty of an affection which has grown through so many years all the absolute assurance on the part of each that the one does really know the inner soul of the other It would come With mister Barry That is your idea of my soul with which you have been in communion for so many years In the first place you think that I am a person likely to be able to transfer myself suddenly to the first man that comes my way Gradually you might do so at any rate so as to make life possible You will be all alone Think what it will be to have to live all alone I have thought I do know that it would be well that you should be able to take me with you But I cannot No There is the hardship You must leave me and I must be alone That is what we have to expect But for her sake and for mine we may be left while we can be left What would you be without me Think of that I should bear it You couldn t You d break your heart and die And if you can imagine my living there and pouring out mister Barry s tea for him you must imagine also what I should have to say to myself about you He will die of course But then he has come to that sort of age at which it doesn t much signify Then I should go on with mister Barry s tea He d come to kiss me when he went away and I should plunge a knife into him Dolly Or into myself which would be more likely Fancy that man calling me Dolly Then she got up and stood behind his chair and put her arm round his neck Would you like to kiss him or any man for the matter of that There is no one else to whom my fancy strays but I think that I should murder them all or commit suicide In the first place I should want my husband to be a gentleman There are not a great many gentlemen about You are fastidious Come now be honest is our mister Barry a gentleman Then there was a pause during which she waited for a reply I will have an answer I have a right to demand an answer to that question since you have proposed the man to me as a husband Nay I have not proposed him You have expressed a regret that I have not accepted him Is he a gentleman Well yes I think he is Mind we are sworn and you are bound to speak the truth What right has he to be a gentleman Who was his father and who was his mother Of what kind were his nursery belongings He has become an attorney and so have you But has there been any one to whisper to him among his teachings that in that profession as in all others there should be a sense of high honor to guide him He must not cheat or do anything to cause him to be struck off the rolls but is it not with him what his client wants and not what honor demands And in the daily intercourse of life would he satisfy what you call my fastidiousness Nothing on earth will ever do that You do I agree with you that nothing else on earth ever will The man who might won t come Not that I can imagine such a man because I know that I am spoiled Of course there are gentlemen though not a great many But he mustn t be ugly and he mustn t be good looking He mustn t seem to be old and certainly he mustn t seem to be young I should not like a man to wear old clothes but he mustn t wear new He must be well read but never show it He must work hard but he must come home to dinner at the proper time Here she laughed and gently shook her head He must never talk about his business at night Though dear darling old father he shall do that if he will talk like you And then which is the hardest thing of all I must have known him intimately for at any rate ten years As for mister Barry I never should know him intimately though I were married to him for ten years And it has all been my doing Just so You have made the bed and you must lie on it It hasn t been a bad bed Not for me Heaven knows it has not been bad for me Nor for me as things go only that there will come an arousing before we shall be ready to get up together Your time will probably be the first I can better afford to lose you than you to lose me God send that it shall be so It is nature she said It is to be expected and will on that account be the less grievous because it has been expected I shall have to devote myself to those Carroll children I sometimes think that the work of the world should not be made pleasant to us What profit will it be to me to have done my duty by you I think there will be some profit if I am good to my cousins At any rate you won t have mister Barry said the father Not if I know it said the daughter and you I think are a wicked old man to suggest it Then she bade him good night and went to bed for they had been talking now till near twelve But mister Barry when he had gone home told himself that he had progressed in his love suit quite as far as he had expected on the first opportunity He went over the bridge and looked at the genteel house and resolved as to certain little changes which should be made Thus one room should look here and the nursery should look there The walk to the railway would only take five minutes and there would be five minutes again from the Temple Station in London He thought it would do very well for domestic felicity And as for a fortune half the business would not be bad And then the whole business would follow and he in his turn would be enabled to let some young fellow in who should do the greater part of the work and take the smaller part of the pay as had been the case with himself But it had not occurred to him that the young lady had meant what she said when she refused him It was the ordinary way with young ladies Of course he had expected no enthusiasm of love nor had he wanted it He would wait for three weeks and then he would go to Fulham again CHAPTER XXXIV mister JUNIPER Though there was an air of badinage almost of tomfoolery about Dolly when she spoke of her matrimonial prospects to her father as when she said that she would stick a knife into mister Barry still there was a seriousness in all she said which was more than grave She was pathetic and melancholy She knew that there was nothing before her but to stay with her father and then to devote herself to her cousins from whom she was aware that she recoiled almost with hatred And she knew that it would be a good thing to be married if only the right man would come The right man would have to bear with her father and live in the same house with him to the end The right man must be a preux chevalier sans peur et sans reproche The right man must be strong minded and masterful and must have a will of his own but he must be strong minded always for good And where was she to find such a man as this she who was only an attorney s daughter plain too and with many eccentricities She was not intended to marry and consequently the only man who came in her way was her father s partner for whom in regard to a share in the business she might be desirable Devotion to the Carroll cousins was manifestly her duty The two eldest girls she absolutely did hate and their father To hate the father because he was vicious beyond cure might be very well but she could not hate the girls without being aware that she was guilty of a grievous sin Every taste possessed by them was antagonistic to her Their amusements their literature their clothes their manners especially in regard to men their gestures and color were distasteful to her They hide their dirt with a thin veneer of cheap finery said Dolly to her father He had replied by telling her that she was nasty No but unfortunately I cannot but see nastiness Dolly herself was clean to fastidiousness Take off her coarse frock and there the well dressed lady began Look at the heels of Sophie s boots Give her a push and she d fall off her pins as though they were stilts They re always asking to have a shoemaker s bill paid and yet they won t wear stout boots I ll pay the man she said to Amelia one day if you ll promise to wear what I ll buy you for the next six months But Amelia had only turned up her nose These were the relatives to whom it would become her duty to devote her life The next morning she started off to call in Bolsover Terrace with an intention not to begin her duty but to make a struggle at the adequate performance of it She took with her some article of clothing intended for one of the younger children but which the child herself was to complete But when she entered the parlor she was astounded at finding that mister Carroll was there It was nearly twelve o clock and at that time mister Carroll never was there He was either in bed or at Tattersall s or Dolly did not care where She had long since made up her mind that there must be a permanent quarrel between herself and her uncle and her desire was generally respected Now unfortunately he was present and with him were his wife and two elder daughters To be devoted thought Dolly to herself to such a family as this and without anybody else in the world to care for She gave her aunt a kiss and touched the girls hands and made a very distant bow to mister Carroll Then she began about the parcel in her hands and having given her instructions was preparing to depart But her aunt stopped her I think you ought to know Dorothea Certainly said mister Carroll It is quite right that your cousin should know If you think it proper I m sure I can t object said Amelia She won t approve I m sure said Sophie Her young man has come forward and spoken said mister Carroll And quite in a proper spirit said Amelia Of course said missus Carroll we are not to expect too much Though we are respectable in birth and all that we are poor mister Carroll has got nothing to give her I ve been the most unfortunate man in the world said mister Carroll We won t talk about that now continued missus Carroll Here we are without anything You have decent blood said Dolly at any rate on one side for she did not believe in the Carrolls On both on both said mister Carroll rising up and putting his hand upon his heart I can boast of royal blood among my ancestors But here we are without anything said missus Carroll again mister Juniper is a most respectable man He has been attached to some of the leading racing establishments in the kingdom said mister Carroll Dolly had heard of mister Juniper as a trainer though she did not accurately know what a trainer meant He is almost as great a man as the owner for the matter of that said Amelia standing up for her lover He is not to say young perhaps forty said missus Carroll and he has a very decent house of his own at Newmarket Dolly immediately began to think whether this might be for the better or for the worse Newmarket was a long way off and the girl would be taken away and it might be a good thing to dispose of one of such a string of daughters even to mister Juniper Of course there would be the disagreeable nature of the connection But as Dolly had once said to her father their share of the world s burdens had to be borne and this was one of them Her first cousin must marry the trainer She who had spoken so enthusiastically about gentlemen must put up with it She knew that mister Juniper was but a small man in his own line but she would never disown him by word of mouth He should be her cousin Juniper But she did hope that she might not be called upon to see him frequently After all he might be much more respectable than mister Carroll I am glad he has a house of his own said Dolly It is a much better house than Fulham Manor said Amelia Dolly was angered not at the comparison between the houses but at the ingratitude and insolence of the girl Very well said she addressing herself to her aunt if her parents are contented of course it is not for me or for papa to be discontented The thing to think of is the honesty of the man and his industry not the excellence of the house But you seemed to think that we were to live in a pigsty said Amelia mister Juniper stands very high on the turf said mister Carroll mister Leadabit s horses have always run straight and Mousetrap won the Two year old Trial Stakes last spring giving two pounds to Box and Cox A good looking tall fellow You remember seeing him here once last summer This was addressed to Miss Grey but Miss Grey had made up her mind never to exchange a word with mister Carroll When is it to be my dear said Miss Grey turning to the ladies but intending to address herself to Amelia She had already made up her mind to forgive the girl for her insolence about the house If the girl was to be taken away there was so much the more reason for forgiving her that and other things Oh I thought that you did not mean to speak to me at all said Amelia I supposed the cut was to be extended from papa to me Amelia how can you be so silly said the mother If you think I m going to put up with that kind of thing you re mistaken said Amelia She had got not only a lover but a husband in prospect and was much superior to her cousin who had neither one or the other as far as she was aware mister Juniper with an excellent house and a plentiful income is quite good enough for me though he hasn t got any regal ancestors She did not intend to laugh at her father but was aware that something had been said about ancestors by her cousin A gentleman who has the management of horses is almost the same as owning them But when is it to be again asked Dolly That depends a little upon my brother said missus Carroll in a voice hardly above a whisper mister Juniper has spoken about a day Then it will depend chiefly on himself and the young lady I suppose Well Dorothea there are money difficulties There s no denying it I wish I could shower gold into her lap said mister Carroll only for the accursed conventionalities of the world Bother papa said Sophia It will be the last of it as far as I am concerned said Amelia mister Juniper has said something about a few hundred pounds said missus Carroll It isn t much that he wants Then Miss Grey spoke in a severe tone You must speak to my father about that I am not to have your good word I suppose said Amelia Human flesh and blood could not but remember all that had been done and always with her consent Five hundred pounds is not a great deal for portioning off a girl when that is to be the last that she is ever to have One of six nieces whose father and mother were maintained and that without the slightest claim It was so that Dorothy argued but her arguments were kept to her own bosom But I must trust to my dear uncle I see that I am not to have a word from you The matter was now becoming serious Here was the eldest girl one of six daughters putting in her claim for five hundred pounds portion This would amount to three thousand pounds for the lot and as the process of marrying them went on they would all have to be maintained as at present What with their school expenses and their clothes the necessary funds for the Carroll family amounted to six hundred pounds a year That was the regular allowance and there were others whenever mister Carroll wanted a pair of trousers And Dolly s acerbation was aroused by a belief on her part that the money asked for trousers took him generally to race courses And now five hundred pounds was boldly demanded so as to induce a groom to make one of the girls his wife She almost regretted that in former years she had promised to assist her father in befriending the Carroll relations Perhaps Dorothea you won t mind stepping into my bedroom with me just for a moment This was said by missus Carroll and Dolly most unwillingly followed her aunt up stairs Of course I know all that you ve got to say began missus Carroll Then aunt why bring me in here Because I wish to explain things a little Don t be ill natured Dorothea I won t if I can help it I know your nature how good it is Here Dorothy shook her head Only think of me and of my sufferings I haven t come to this without suffering Then the poor woman began to cry I feel for you through it all I do said Dolly That poor man To have to be always with him and always doing my best to keep him out of mischief A man who will do nothing else must do harm Of course he must But what can he do now And the children I can see of course I know that they are not all that they ought to be But with six of them and nobody but myself how can I do it all And they are his children as well as mine Dolly s heart was filled with pity as she heard this which she knew to be so true In answering you they have uppish bad ways They don t like to submit to one so near their own age Not a word that has come from the mouth of one of them addressed to myself has ever done them any harm with my father That is what you mean No but with yourself I do not take anger against them out of the room with me Now about mister Juniper The question is one much too big for me Am I to tell my father I was thinking that if you would do so I cannot tell him that he ought to find five hundred pounds for mister Juniper Perhaps four would do Nor can I ask him to drive a bargain How much would he give her to be married Why should he give her anything He feeds her and gives her clothes It is only fit that the truth should be explained to you Girls so circumstanced when they are clothed and fed by their own fathers must be married without fortunes or must remain unmarried As Sophie and Georgina and Minna and Brenda come up the same requests will be made Poor Potsey said the mother For Potsey was a plain girl If this be done for Amelia must it not be done for all of them Papa is not a rich man but he has been very generous Is it fair to ask him for five hundred pounds to give to mister Juniper A gentleman nowadays does not like not to get something Then a gentleman must go where something is to be got The truth has to be told Aunt Carroll My father is willing enough to do what he can for you and the girls but I do not think that he will give five hundred pounds to mister Juniper It is once for all Four hundred pounds perhaps would do I do not think that he can make a bargain nor that he will pay any sum to mister Juniper To get one of them off would be so much What is to become of them To have one married would be the way for others Oh Dorothy if you would only think of my condition I know your papa will do what you tell him Dolly felt that her father would be more likely to do it if she were not to interfere at all but she could not say that She did feel the request to be altogether unreasonable She struggled to avert from her own mind all feeling of dislike for the girl and to look at it as she might have done if Amelia had been her special friend Aunt Carroll she said you had better go up to London and see my father there in his chambers You will catch him if you go at once Alone Yes alone Tell him about the girl s marriage and let him judge what he ought to do Could not you come with me No You don t understand I have to think of his money He can say what he will do with his own He will never give it without coming to you He never will if he does come to me You may prevail with him A man may throw away his own money as he pleases I cannot tell him that he ought to do it You may say that you have told me and that I have sent you to him And tell him let him do what he will that I shall find no fault with him If you can understand me and him you will know that I can do nothing for you beyond that Then Dolly took her leave and went home The mother turning it all over in her mind did understand something of her niece and went off to London as quick as the omnibus could take her There she did see her brother and he came back in consequence to dinner a little earlier than usual Why did you send my sister to me were the first words which he said to Dolly Because it was your business and not mine How dare you separate my business and yours What do you think I have done Given the young lady five hundred pounds down on the nail Worse than that Worse Much worse But why did you send my sister to my chambers But what have you done papa You don t mean that you have given the shark more than he demands I don t know that he s a shark Why shouldn t the man want five hundred pounds with his wife mister Barry would want much more with you and would be entitled to ask for much more You are my father Yes but those poor girls have been taught to look upon me almost as their father But what have you done I have promised them each three hundred and fifty pounds on their wedding day three hundred pounds to go to their husbands and fifty pounds for wedding expenses on condition that they marry with my approval I shall not be so hard to please for them as for you And you have approved of mister Juniper I have already set on foot inquiries down at Newmarket and I have made an exception in favor of mister Juniper He is to have four hundred and fifty pounds Jane only asked four hundred pounds to begin with You are not to find fault with me No that is part of the bargain I wonder whether my aunt knew what a thoroughly good natured thing I did We must have no more puddings now and you must come down by the omnibus It is not quite so bad as that Dolly When one has given away one s money extravagantly one ought to be made to feel the pinch one s self But dear dear darling old man why shouldn t you give away your money as you please I don t want it I am not in the least afraid but what there will be plenty for me But when the girl talks about her five hundred pounds so glibly as though she had a right to expect it and spoke of this jockey with such inward pride of heart A girl ought to be proud of her husband Your niece ought not to be proud of marrying a groom But she angered me and so did my aunt though I pitied her Then I reflected that they could get nothing from me in my anger not even a promise of a good word So I sent her to you It was at any rate the best thing I could do for them mister Grey thought that it was CHAPTER XXXV mister BARRY AND mister JUNIPER The joy in Bolsover Terrace was intense when missus Carroll returned home We are all to have three hundred and fifty pound fortunes when we get husbands said Georgina anticipating at once the pleasures of matrimony I am to have four hundred and fifty said Amelia I do think he might have made it five hundred pounds If I had it to give away I never would show the cloven foot about the last fifty pounds But he s only to have four hundred pounds said Sophia Your things are to be bought with the other fifty pounds I never can do it for fifty pounds said Amelia I did not expect that I was to find my own trousseau out of my own fortune Girls how can you be so ungrateful said their mother I m not ungrateful mamma said Potsey I shall be very much obliged when I get my three hundred and fifty pounds How long will it be You ve got to find the young man first Potsey I don t think you ll ever do that said Georgina who was rather proud of her own good looks This took place on the evening of the day on which missus Carroll had gone to London where mister Carroll was about attending to some of those duties of conviviality in the performance of which he was so indefatigable On the following morning at twelve o clock he was still in bed It was a well known fact in the family that on such an occasion he would lie in bed and that before twelve o clock he would have managed to extract from his wife s little hoardings at any rate two bottles of soda water and two glasses of some alcoholic mixture which was generally called brandy I ll have a gin and potash Sophie he had said on this occasion with reference to the second dose and do make haste I wish you d go yourself because that girl always drinks some of the sperrits What go to the gin shop It s a most respectable publican s just round the corner Indeed I shall do nothing of the kind You ve no feeling about your daughters at all But Sophie went on her errand and in order to protect her father s small modicum of sperrits she slipped on her cloak and walked out so as to be able to watch the girl Still I think that the maiden managed to get a sip as she left the bar The father in the mean time with his head between his hands was ruminating on the cocked up way which girls have who can t do a turn for their father But with the gin and potash and with Sophie mister Juniper made his appearance He was a well featured tall man but he looked the stable and he smelled of it His clothes no doubt were decent but they were made by some tailor who must surely work for horsey men and no others There is a class of men who always choose to show by their outward appearance that they belong to horses and they succeed mister Juniper was one of them Though good looking he was anything but young verging by appearance on fifty years So he has been at it again Miss Sophie said Juniper Sophie who did not like being detected in the performance of her filial duties led the way in silence into the house and disappeared up stairs with the gin and potash mister Juniper turned into the parlor where was missus Carroll with the other girls She was still angry as angry as she could be with her husband who on being informed that morning of what his wife had done had called her brother a beastly stingy old beau because he had cut Amelia off with four hundred and fifty instead of five hundred pounds mister Carroll probably knew that mister Juniper would not take his daughter without the entirety of the sum stipulated and would allow no portion of it to be expended on wedding dresses Oh Dick is this you said Amelia I suppose you ve come for your news mister Juniper s Christian name was Richard On this occasion he showed no affectionate desire to embrace his betrothed Yes it s me he said and then gave his hand all round first to missus Carroll and then to the girls I ve seen mister Grey said missus Carroll But Dick Juniper held his tongue and sat down and twiddled his hat Where have you come from asked Georgina From the Brompton Road I come down on a bus You ve come from Tattersall s young man said Amelia Then I just didn t But to tell the truth he had come from Tattersall s and it might be difficult to follow up the workings of his mind and find out why he had told the lie Of course it was known that when in London much of his business was done at Tattersall s But the horsey man is generally on the alert to take care that no secret of his trade escapes from him unawares And it may be that he was thus prepared for a gratuitous lie Uncle s gone a deal farther than ever I expected said Amelia He s been most generous to all the girls said missus Carroll moved nearly to tears mister Juniper did not care very much about all the girls thinking that the uncle s affection at the present moment should be shown to the one girl who had found a husband and thinking also that if the husband was to be secured the proper way of doing so would be by liberality to him Amelia had said that her uncle had gone farther than she expected mister Juniper concluded from this that he had not gone as far as he had been asked and boldly resolved at the spur of the moment to stand by his demand Five hundred pounds ain t much he said Dick don t make a beast of yourself said Amelia Upon this Dick only smiled He continually twiddled his hat for three or four minutes and then rose up straight I suppose said he I had better go up stairs and talk to the old man I seed Miss Sophie taking a pick up to him so I suppose he ll be able to talk Why shouldn t he talk said missus Carroll But she quite understood what mister Juniper s words were intended to imply It don t always follow said Juniper as he walked out of the room Now there ll be a row in the house you see if there isn t said Amelia But missus Carroll expressed her opinion that the man must be the most ungrateful of creatures if he kicked up a row on the present occasion I don t know so much about that mamma said Amelia mister Juniper walked up stairs with heavy slow steps and knocked at the door of the marital chamber There are men who can t walk up stairs as though to do so were an affair of ordinary life They perform the task as though they walked up stairs once in three years It is to be presumed that such men always sleep on the ground floor though where they find their bed rooms it is hard to say mister Juniper was admitted by Sophie who stepped out as he went in Well old fellow B and S and plenty of it That s the ticket eh I did have a little headache this morning I think it was the cigars Very like and the stuff as washed em down You haven t got any more of the same have you I m uncommonly sorry said the sick man rising up on his elbow but I m afraid there is not To tell the truth I had the deuce of a job to get this from the old woman It don t matter said the impassive mister Juniper only I have been down among the orses at the yard till my throat is full of dust So your lady has been and seen her brother Yes she s done that Well He ain t altogether a bad un isn t old Grey Of course he s an attorney I never think much of them chaps There s good and bad Juniper No doubt my brother in law has made a little money A pot of it if all they say s true But all they say isn t true All they say never is true I suppose he s got something Yes he s got something And how is it to be He s given the girl four hundred pounds on the nail upon this mister Juniper turned up his nose and fifty pounds for her wedding clothes He d better let me have that Girls think so much of it mister Juniper only shook his head and upon my word it s more than she had a right to expect It ain t what she had a right to expect but I here mister Carroll shook his head I said five hundred pounds out and I means to hold by it That s about it If he wants to get the girl married why he must open his pocket It isn t very much that I m asking I m that sort of a fellow that if I didn t want it I d take her without a shilling But you are that sort of fellow that always does want it I wants it now It s better to speak out ain t it I must have the five hundred pounds before I put my neck into the noose and there must be no paring off for petticoats and pelisses And mister Grey says that he must make inquiries into character said Carroll Into what Into character He isn t going to give his money without knowing something about the man I m all straight at Newmarket I ain t going to stand any inquiries into me you know I can stand inquiries better than some people He s got a partner named Barry ain t he There is such a gentleman I don t know much about the business ways of my respected brother in law mister Barry is I believe a good sort of a man It s he as is acting for Captain Scarborough Is it now It may be for anything I know Then there came a long conversation during which mister Juniper told some details of his former life and expressed himself very freely upon certain points It appeared that in the event of mister Scarborough having died as was expected in the course of the early summer and of Captain Scarborough succeeding to the property in the accustomed manner mister Juniper would have been one of those who would have come forward with a small claim upon the estate He had lent he said a certain sum of money to help the captain in his embarrassment and expected to get it back again Now latterly inquiries had been made very disagreeable in their nature to mister Juniper but mister Juniper seeing how the the land lay to use his own phrase consented only to accept so much as he had advanced It don t make much difference to me he had said Let me have the three hundred and fifty pounds which the captain got in hard money Then the inquiries were made by mister Barry that very mister Barry to whom subsequent inquiries were committed and mister Barry could not satisfy himself as to the three hundred and fifty pounds which the captain was said to have got in hard money There had been words spoken which seemed to mister Juniper to make it very inexpedient and we may say very unfair that these farther inquiries into his character as a husband should be intrusted to the same person He regarded mister Barry as an enemy to the human race from whom in the general confusion of things no plunder was to be extracted mister Barry had asked for the check by which the three hundred and fifty pounds had been paid to Captain Scarborough in hard cash There had been no check mister Juniper had said Such a small sum as that had been paid in notes at Newmarket He said that he could not or rather that he would not produce any evidence as to the money mister Barry had suggested that even so small a sum as three hundred and fifty pounds could not have come and could not have gone without leaving some trace mister Juniper very indignantly had referred to an acknowledgment on a bill stamp for six hundred pounds which he had filled in and which the captain had undoubtedly signed It s not worth the paper it s written on mister Barry had said We ll see about that said mister Juniper As soon as the breath is out of the old squire s body we ll see whether his son is to repudiate his debts in that way Ain t that the captain s signature and he slapped the bill with his hand The old ceremony was gone through of explaining that the captain had no right to a shilling of the property It had become an old ceremony now mister Augustus Scarborough is going to pay out of his own good will only those sums of the advance of which he has indisputable testimony Ain t he my testimony of this said mister Juniper This bill is for six hundred pounds In course it is Why don t you say you advanced him five hundred and fifty pounds instead of three hundred and fifty pounds Because I didn t Why do you say three hundred and fifty pounds instead of one hundred and fifty pounds Because I did Then we have only your bare word We are not going to pay any one a shilling on such a testimony Then mister Juniper had sworn an awful oath that he would have every man bearing the name of Scarborough hanged But mister Barry s firm did not care much for any law proceedings which might be taken by mister Juniper alone No law proceedings would be taken The sum to be regained would not be worth the while of any lawyer to insure the hopeless expense of fighting such a battle It would be shown in court on mister Barry s side that the existing owner of the estate out of his own generosity had repaid all sums of money as to which evidence existed that they had been advanced to the unfortunate illegitimate captain They would appear with clean hands but poor mister Juniper would receive the sympathy of none Of this mister Juniper had by degrees become aware and was already looking on his claim on the Scarborough property as lost And now on this other little affair of his on this matrimonial venture it was very hard that inquiries as to his character should be referred to the same mister Barry I m d if I stand it he said thumping his fist down on mister Carroll s bed on which he was sitting It isn t any of my doing I m on the square with you I don t know so much about that What have I done Didn t I send her to the girl s uncle and didn t she get from him a very liberal promise Promises Why didn t he stump up the rhino What s the good of promises There s as much to do about a beggarly five hundred pounds as though it were fifty thousand pounds Inquiries Of course he knew very well what that meant It s a most ungentlemanlike thing for one gentleman to take upon himself to make inquiries about another He is not the girl s father What right has he to make inquiries I didn t put it into his head said Carroll almost sobbing He must be a low bred pettifogging lawyer He is a lawyer said Carroll on whose mind the memory of the great benefit he had received had made some impression I have admitted that Pshaw But I don t think he s pettifogging not mister Grey Four hundred pounds down with fifty pounds for dress and the same or most the same to all the girls isn t pettifogging If you ever comes to have a family Juniper I ain t in the way But when you are and there comes six of em you won t find an uncle pettifogging when he speaks out like mister Grey The conversation was carried on for some time farther and then mister Juniper left the house without again visiting the ladies His last word was that if inquiries were made into him they might all go to Bath If the money were forthcoming they would know where to find him but it must be five hundred pounds square with no parings made from it on behalf of petticoats and pelisses With this last word mister Juniper stamped down the stairs and out of the house He s a brute after all said Sophie No he isn t What do you know about brutes Of course a gentleman has to make the best fight he can for his money This was what Amelia said at the moment but in the seclusion of their own room she wept bitterly Why didn t he come in to see me and just give me one word I hadn t done anything amiss It wasn t my fault if Uncle John is stingy And he isn t so very stingy after all said Sophie Of course papa hasn t got anything and wouldn t have anything though you were to pour golden rivers into his lap There are worse than papa said Sophie But he knows all that and that our uncle isn t any more than an uncle And why should he be so particular just about a hundred pounds I do think gentlemen are the meanest creatures when they are looking after money Ladies ain t half so bad He d no business to expect five hundred pounds all out This was very melancholy and the house was kept in a state of silent sorrow for four or five days till the result of the inquiries had come Then there was weeping and gnashing of teeth mister Barry came to Bolsover Terrace to communicate the result of the inquiry and was shut up for half an hour with poor missus Carroll He was afraid that he could not recommend the match Oh I m sorry for that very sorry said missus Carroll The young lady will be disappointed And her handkerchief went up to her eyes Then there was silence for awhile till she asked why an opinion so strongly condemnatory had been expressed The gentleman ma am is not what a gentleman should be You may take my word for it I must ask you not to repeat what I say to him Oh dear no But perhaps the least said the soonest mended He is not what a gentleman should be You mean a fine gentleman He is not what a man should be I cannot say more than that It would not be for the young lady s happiness that she should select such a partner for her life She is very much attached to him I am sorry that it should be so But it will be better that she should live it down At any rate I am bound to communicate to you mister Grey s decision Though he does not at all mean to withhold his bounty in regard to any other proposed marriage he cannot bring himself to pay money to mister Juniper Nothing at all asked missus Carroll He will make no payment that will go into the pocket of mister Juniper Then mister Barry went and there was weeping and wailing in the house in Bolsover Terrace So cruel an uncle as mister Grey had never been heard of in history or even in romance I know it s that old cat Dolly said Amelia Because she hasn t managed to get a husband for herself she doesn t want any one else to get one My poor child said mister Carroll in a maudlin condition I pity thee from the bottom of my heart I wish that mister Barry may be made to marry a hideous old maid past forty said Georgina I shouldn t care what they said but would take him straight off said Sophie Upon this missus Carroll shook her head I don t suppose that he is quite all that he ought to be Who is I should like to know said Amelia But my brother has to give his money according to his judgment As she said this the poor woman thought of those other five who in process of time might become claimants But here the whole family attacked her and almost drove her to confess that her brother was a stingy old curmudgeon CHAPTER XXXVI GURNEY MALCOLMSON S In Red Lion Square on the first floor of a house which partakes of the general dinginess of the neighborhood there are two rooms which bear on the outside door the well sounding names of Gurney Malcolmson and on the front door to the street are the names of Gurney Malcolmson showing that the business transacted by Messrs Gurney Malcolmson outweighs in importance any others conducted in the same house In the first room which is the smaller of the two occupied sits usually a lad who passes most of his time in making up and directing circulars so that a stranger might be led to suppose that the business of Gurney Malcolmson was of an extended nature But on the occasion to which we are about to allude the door of the premises was closed and the boy was kept on the alert posting or perhaps delivering the circulars which were continually issued This was the place of business affected by mister Tyrrwhit or at any rate one of them Who were Gurney Malcolmson it is not necessary that our chronicle should tell No Gurney or no Malcolmson was then visible and though a part of the business of the firm in which it is to be supposed that Gurney Malcolmson were engaged was greatly discussed their name on the occasion was never mentioned A meeting had been called at which the presiding genius was mister Tyrrwhit You might almost be led to believe that from the manner in which he made himself at home mister Tyrrwhit was Gurney Malcolmson But there was another there who seemed to be almost as much at home as mister Tyrrwhit and this was mister Samuel Hart whom we last saw when he had unexpectedly made himself known to his friend the captain at Monaco He had a good deal to say for himself and as he sat during the meeting with his hat on it is to be presumed that he was not in awe of his companions mister Juniper also was there He took a seat at one corner of the table and did not say much There was also a man who in speaking of himself and his own affairs always called himself Evans Crooke And there was one Spicer who sat silent for the most part and looked very fierce In all matters however he appeared to agree with mister Tyrrwhit He is especially named as his interest in the matter discussed was large There were three or four others whose affairs were of less moment though to them they were of intense interest These gentlemen assembled were they who had advanced money to Captain Scarborough and this was the meeting of the captain s creditors at which they were to decide whether they were to give up their bonds on payment of the sums they had actually advanced or whether they would stand out till the old squire s death and then go to law with the owner of the estate At the moment at which we may be presumed to be introduced mister Tyrrwhit had explained the matter in a nervous hesitating manner but still in words sufficiently clear There s the money down now if you like to take it and I m for taking it These were the words with which mister Tyrrwhit completed his address Circumstances is different said the man with his hat on I don t know much about that mister Hart said Tyrrwhit Circumstances is different I can t elp whether you know it or not How different They is different and that s all about it It ll perhaps shuit you and them other shentlemen to take a pershentage It won t suit Evans Crooke said the man who represented that firm But perhaps Messrs Evans Crooke may be willing to save so much of their property said mister Tyrrwhit They d like to have what s due to em We should all like that said Spicer and he gnashed his teeth and shook his head But we can t get it all said Tyrrwhit Speak for yourself mister Tyrrwhit said Hart I think I can get mine This is the most almighty abandoned swindle I ever met in all my born days The whole meeting except mister Tyrrwhit received this assertion with loudly expressed applause Such a blackguard dirty thieving job never was up before in my time I don t know ow to talk of it in language as a man isn t ashamed to commit himself to It s downright robbery I say so too said Evans Crooke By George continued mister Hart we come forward to elp a shentleman in his trouble and to wait for our moneys till the father is dead and then when e s ad our moneys the father turns round and says that is own son is a Oh it s too shocking I aven t slept since I eard it not a regular night s rest Now it s my belief the captain as no and in it Here mister Juniper scratched his head and looked doubtful and one or two of the other silent gentlemen scratched their heads Messrs Evans Crooke scratched his head It s a matter on which I would not like to give an opinion one way or the other said Tyrrwhit No more wouldn t I said Spicer Let every man speak as he finds continued Hart That s my belief I don t mind giving up a little of my claim just a thousand or so for ready cash The old sinner ought to be dead and can t last long My belief is when e s gone I m so circumstanced I shall get the whole Whether or no I ve gone in for elping the captain with all my savings and I mean to stick to them And lose everything said Tyrrwhit Why don t we go and lug the old sinner into prison said Evans Crooke Certainly that s the game said Juniper and there was another loud acclamation of applause from the entire room Gentlemen you don t know what you re talking about you don t indeed said Tyrrwhit I don t believe as we do said Spicer You can t touch the old gentleman He owes you nothing nor have you a scratch of his pen How are you to lug an old gentleman to prison when he s lying there cut up by the doctors almost to nothing I don t know that anybody can touch him The captain perhaps might if the present story be false and the younger son if the other be true And then they d have to prove it mister Grey says that no one can touch him He s in the swim as bad as any of em said Evans Crooke Of course he is said Hart But let everybody speak for himself I ve gone in to earn a eavy stake honestly That s all right said Evans Crooke And I mean to ave it or nothing Now mister Tyrrwhit you know a piece of my mind It s a biggish lot of money We know what your claim is But no man knows what the captain got and I don t mean em to know About fifteen thousand came in a whisper from some one in the room That s a lie said mister Hart so there s no getting out of that If the shentleman will mind is own concerns I ll mind mine Nobody knows barring the captain and he like enough has forgot and nobody s going to know What s written on these eight bits of paper everybody may know and he pulled out of a large case or purse which he carried in his breast coat pocket a fat sheaf of bills There are five thou written on each of them and for five thou on each of them I means to stand out It or miss If any shentleman chooses to talk to me about ready money I ll take two thou off I like ready money as well as another We can all say the same as that mister Hart said Tyrrwhit No doubt And if you think you can get it I advise you to stick to it If you thought you could get it you would say the same But I should like to get that old man s ead between my fists Wouldn t I punch it Thief scoundrel orrid old man It ain t for myself that I m speaking now because I m a going to get it I think I m a going to get it it s for humanity at large This kind of thing wiolates one s best feelings Ear ear ear said one of the silent gentlemen Them s the sentiments of Evans Crooke said the representative of that firm They re all our sentiments in course said Spicer but what s the use Not a ha p orth said mister Tyrrwhit Asking your pardon mister Tyrrwhit said mister Hart but as this is a meeting of creditors who ave a largish lot of money to deal with I don t think they ought to part without expressing their opinions in the way of British commerce I say crucifying d be too good for im You can t get at him to crucify him There s no knowing about that said mister Hart And now said mister Tyrrwhit drawing out his watch I expect mister Augustus Scarborough to call upon us You can crucify him said Evans Crooke It is the old man and neither of the sons as have done it said Hart mister Scarborough continued Tyrrwhit will be here and will expect to learn whether we have accepted his offer He will be accompanied by mister Barry If one rejects all reject Not at all said Hart He will not consent to pay anything unless he can make a clean hit of it He is about to sacrifice a very large sum of money Sacrifice said Juniper Yes sacrifice a very large sum of money His father cannot pay it without his consent The father may die any day and then the money will belong altogether to the son You have none of you any claim upon him It is likely he may think you will have a claim on the estate not trusting his own father I wouldn t trust him not alf as far as I could see him though he was twice my father This again came from mister Hart I want to explain to these gentlemen how the matter stands They understand said Hart I m for securing my own money It s very hard after all the risk I quite agree with mister Hart in what he says about the squire Such a piece of premeditated dishonesty for robbing gentlemen of their property I never before heard It s awful Orrid old man said mister Hart Just so But half a loaf is better than no bread Now here is a list prepared in mister Grey s chambers E s another nigh as orrid On this list we re all down with the sums he says we advanced Are we to take them If so we must sign our names each to his own figure Then he passed the list down the table The men there assembled all crowded to look at the list and among others mister Juniper He showed his anxiety by the eager way in which he nearly annihilated Messrs Evans Crooke by leaning over him as he struggled to read the paper Your name ain t down at all said Evans Crooke Then a tremendous oath very bitter and very wicked came from the mouth of mister Juniper most unbefitting a young man engaged to marry a young lady I tell you it isn t here said Evans Crooke trying to extricate himself I shall know how to right myself said Juniper with another oath And he then walked out of the room The captain when he was drunk one night got a couple of ponies from him It wasn t a couple all out And Juniper made him write his name for five hundred pounds It was thought then that the squire d have been dead next day and Juniper d ve got a good thing I ate them ways said mister Hart I never deal with a shentleman if he s to say drunk Of course it comes in my way but I never does Now there was heard a sound of steps on the stairs and mister Tyrrwhit rose from his chair so as to perform the duty of master of the ceremonies to the gentlemen who were expected Augustus Scarborough entered the room followed by mister Barry They were received with considerable respect and seated on two chairs at mister Tyrrwhit s right hand Gentlemen you most of you know these two gentlemen They are mister Augustus Scarborough and mister Barry junior partner in the firm of Messrs Grey Barry We knows em said Hart My client has made a proposition to you said mister Barry If you will give up your bonds against his brother which are not worth the paper they are written on Gammon said mister Hart I will sign checks paying to you the sums of money written on that list But you must all agree to accept such sums in liquidation in full I see you have not signed the paper yet No time is to be lost In fact you must sign it now or my client will withdraw from his offer Withdraw will e said Hart Suppose we withdraw O does your client think is the honestest man in this ere swim mister Barry seemed somewhat abashed by this question It isn t necessary to go into that mister Hart said he mister Hart laughed long and loud and all the gentlemen laughed There was something to them extremely jocose in their occupying as it were the other side of the question and appearing as the honest injured party They enjoyed it thoroughly and mister Hart was disposed to make the most of it No it ain t necessary is it There ain t no question of honesty to be asked in this ere business We quite understand that Then up and spoke Augustus Scarborough He rose to his feet and the very fact of his doing so quieted for a time the exuberant mirth of the party Gentlemen mister Hart speaks to you of honesty I am not going to boast of my own I am here to consent to the expenditure of a very large sum of money for which I am to get nothing and which if not paid to you will all go into my own pocket unless you believed that you wouldn t be here to meet me We don t believe nothing said Hart mister Hart you should let mister Scarborough speak said Tyrrwhit Vell let im speak Vat s the odds I do not wish to delay you nor to delay myself continued Augustus I can go and will go at once But I shall not come back There is no good discussing this matter any longer Oh no not the least Ve don t like discussion do ve captain said mister Hart But you ain t the captain is you As there seems to be no intention of signing that document I shall go said Augustus Then mister Tyrrwhit took the paper and signed it on the first line with his own name at full length He wrote his name to a very serious sum of money but it was less than half what he and others had expected to receive when the sum was lent Had that been realized there would have been no farther need for the formalities of Gurney Malcolmson and that young lad must have found other work to do than the posting of circulars The whole matter however had been much considered and he signed the document mister Hart s name came next but he passed it on I ain t made up my mind yet Maybe I shall have to call on mister Barry I ain t just consulted my partner Then the document went down to mister Spicer who signed it grinning horribly as did also Evans Crooke and all the others They did believe that was the only way in which they could get back the money they had advanced It was a great misfortune a serious blow But in this way there was something short of ruin They knew that Scarborough was about to pay the money so that he might escape a lawsuit which might go against him but then they also wished to avoid the necessity of bringing the lawsuit Looking at the matter all round we may say that the lawyers were the persons most aggrieved by what was done on that morning They all signed it as they sat there except mister Hart who passed it on and still wore his hat You won t agree mister Hart said Tyrrwhit Not yet I von t said Hart I ain t thought it out I ain t in the same boat with the rest I m not afraid of my money I shall get that all right Then I may as well go said Augustus Don t be in a hurry mister Scarborough said Tyrrwhit Things of this kind can t be done just in a moment But Augustus explained that they must be done in a very few moments if they were to be done at all It was not his intention to sit there in Gurney Malcolmson s office discussing the matter with mister Hart Notice of his intention had been given and they might take his money or leave it Just so captain said mister Hart Only I believe you ain t the captain Where s the captain now I see him last at Monte Carlo and he had won a pot of money He was looking uncommon well after his little accident in the streets with young Annesley mister Tyrrwhit contrived to get all the others out of the room he remaining there with Hart and Augustus Scarborough and mister Barry And then Hart did sign the document with altered figures only that so much was added on to the sum which he agreed to accept and a similar deduction made from that to which mister Tyrrwhit s name was signed But this was not done without renewed expostulation from the latter gentleman It was very hard he said that all the sacrifice should be made by him He would be ruined utterly ruined by the transaction But he did sign for the altered sum and mister Hart also signed the paper Now mister Barry as the matter is completed I think I will withdraw said Augustus It s five thousand pounds clean gone out of my pocket said Hart and I vas as sure of it as ever I vas in my life There vas no better money than the captain s Vell vell This vorld s a queer place So saying he followed Augustus and mister Barry out of the room and left mister Tyrrwhit alone in his misery CHAPTER XXXVII VICTORIA STREET Lounging in an arm chair in a small but luxuriously furnished room in Victoria Street sat Captain Mountjoy Scarborough and opposite to him equally comfortably placed as far as externals were concerned but without any of that lounging look which the captain affected sat his brother It was nearly eight o clock and the sound of the dinner plates could be heard through the open doors from the next room It was evident or at any rate was the fact that Augustus found his brother s presence a bore and as evident that the captain intended to disregard the dissatisfaction evinced by the owner of the chambers Do shut the door Mountjoy said the younger I don t suppose we want the servant to hear everything that we say He s welcome for me said Mountjoy without moving Then Augustus got up and banged the door Don t be angry because I sometimes forget that I am no longer considered to be your elder brother said Mountjoy Bother about elder brothers I suppose you can shut a door A man is sometimes compelled by circumstances to think whether he can or not I d ve shut the door for you readily enough the other day I don t know that I can now Ain t we going to have some dinner It s eight o clock I suppose they ll get dinner for you I m not going to dine here The two men were both dressed and after this they remained silent for the next five minutes Then the servant came in and said that dinner was ready All this happened in December It must be explained that the captain had come to London at his brother s instance and was there in his rooms at his invitation Indeed we may say that he had come at his brother s command Augustus had during the last few months taken upon himself to direct the captain s movements and though he had not always been obeyed still upon the whole his purposes had been carried out as well as he could expect He had offered to supply the money necessary for the captain s tour and had absolutely sent a servant to accompany the traveller When the traveller had won money at Monaco he had been unruly but this had not happened very often When we last saw him he had expressed his intention to mister Hart of making a return journey to the Caucasian provinces But he got no farther than Genoa on his way to the Caucasus and then when he found that mister Hart was not at his back he turned round and went back to Monte Carlo Monte Carlo of all places on the world s surface had now charms for him There was no longer a club open to him either in London or Paris at which he could win or lose one hundred pounds At Monte Carlo he could still do so readily and to do so need not sink down into any peculiarly low depth of social gathering At Monte Carlo the ennui of the day was made to disappear At Monte Carlo he could lie in bed till eleven and then play till dinner time At Monte Carlo there was always some one who would drink a glass of wine with him without inquiring too closely as to his antecedents He had begun by winning a large sum of money He had got some sums from his brother and when at last he was summoned home he was penniless Had his pocket been still full of money it may be doubted whether he would have come although he understood perfectly the importance of the matter on which he had been recalled He had been sent for in order that he might receive from mister Grey a clear statement of what it was intended to do in reference to the payment of money to the creditors mister Grey had in the first place endeavored to assure him that his company operation was in no respect made necessary by the true circumstances of the case but in order to satisfy the doubts of certain persons The money to be paid was the joint property of his father and his brother of his father as far as the use of it for his life was concerned and of his brother as to its continued and perpetual enjoyment They were willing to pay so much for the redemption of the bonds given by him the captain As far as these bonds were concerned the captain would thus be a free man There could be no doubt that nothing but benefit was intended for him as though he were himself the heir Though as to that I have no hesitation in telling you that you will at your father s death have no right to a shilling of the property The captain had said that he was quite willing and had signed the deed He was glad that these bonds should be recovered so cheaply But as to the property and here he spoke with much spirit to mister Grey it was his purpose at his father s death to endeavor to regain his position He would never believe he said that his mother was Then he turned away and in spite of all that had come and gone mister Grey respected him But he had signed the deed and the necessity for his presence was over What should his brother do with him now He could not keep him concealed or not concealed in his rooms But something must be done Some mode of living must be invented for him Abroad Augustus said to himself and to Septimus Jones who was his confidential friend that Mountjoy must live abroad Oh yes he must go abroad There s no doubt about that It s the only place for him So spoke Septimus Jones who though confidential friend was not admitted to the post of confidential adviser Augustus liked to have a depositary for his resolutions but would admit no advice And Septimus Jones had become so much his creature that he had to obey him in all things We are apt to think that a man may be disposed of by being made to go abroad or if he is absolutely penniless and useless by being sent to the colonies that he may become a shepherd and drink himself out of the world To kill the man so that he may be no longer a nuisance is perhaps the chief object in both cases But it was not easy to get the captain to go abroad unless indeed he was sent back to Monte Carlo Some Monte Carlo such as a club might be with stakes practically unlimited was the first desire of his heart But behind that or together with it was an anxious longing to remain near Tretton and see it out as he called it when his father should die His father must die very shortly and he would like to see it out as he told mister Grey and with this wish there was a longing also for the company of Florence Mountjoy He used to tell himself in those moments of sad thoughts thoughts serious as well as sad which will come even to a gambler that if he could have Tretton and Florence Mountjoy he would never touch another card And there was present to him an assurance that his aunt missus Mountjoy would still be on his side If he could talk over his circumstances with missus Mountjoy he thought that he might be encouraged to recover his position as an English gentleman His debts at the club had already been paid and he had met on the sly a former friend who had given him some hope that he might be re admitted But at the present moment his mind turned to Brussels He had learned that Florence and her mother were at the embassy there and though he hesitated still he desired to go But this was not the abroad contemplated by Augustus Augustus did not think it well that his father s bastard son who had been turned out of a London club for not paying his card debts and had then disappeared in a mysterious way for six months should show himself at the British embassy and there claim admittance and relationship Nor was he anxious that his brother should see Florence Mountjoy He had suggested a prolonged tour in South America which he had declared to be the most interesting country in the world I think I had rather go to Brussels Mountjoy had answered gallantly keeping his seat in the arm chair and picking his teeth the while This occurred on the evening before that on which we found them just now On the morning of that day Mountjoy had had his interview with mister Grey Augustus had declared that he intended to dine out This he had said in disgust at his brother s behavior No doubt he could get his dinner at ten minutes notice He had not been expelled from his club But he had ordered the dinner on that day with a view to eat it himself and in effect he carried out his purpose The captain got up thinking to go alone when the dinner was announced but expressed himself gratified when his brother said that he had changed his mind You made yourself such an ass about shutting the door that I resolved to leave you to yourself But come along And he accompanied the captain into the other room A very pretty little dinner was prepared quite such as one loving friend might give to another when means are sufficient such a dinner as the heir of Tretton might have given to his younger brother The champagne was excellent and the bottle of Leoville Mountjoy partook of all the good things with much gusto thinking all the while that he ought to have been giving the dinner to his younger brother When that conversation had sprung up about going to Brussels or South America Mountjoy had suggested a loan I ll pay your fare to Rio and give you an order on a banker there Mountjoy had replied that that would not at all suit his purpose Then Augustus had felt that it would be almost better to send his brother even to Brussels than to keep him concealed in London He had been there now for three or four days and even in respect of his maintenance had become a burden The pretty little dinners had to be found every day and were eaten by the captain alone when left alone without an attempt at an apology on his part Augustus had begun with some intention of exhibiting his mode of life He would let his brother know what it was to be the heir of Tretton No doubt he did assume all the outward glitter of his position expecting to fill his brother s heart with envy But Mountjoy had seen and understood it all and remembering the days not long removed when he had been the heir he bethought himself that he had never shown off before his brother And he was determined to express no gratitude or thankfulness He would go on eating the little dinners exactly as though they had been furnished by himself It certainly was dull There was no occupation for him and in the matter of pocket money he was lamentably ill supplied But he was gradually becoming used to face the streets again and had already entered the shops of one or two of his old tradesmen He had quite a confidential conversation with his boot maker and had ordered three or four new pairs of boots Nobody could tell how the question of the property would be decided till his father should have died His father had treated him most cruelly and he would only wait for his death He could assure the boot maker that when that time came he should look for his rights He knew that there was a suspicion abroad that he was in a conspiracy with his father and brother to cheat his creditors No such thing He himself was cheated He pledged himself to the boot maker that to the best of his belief his father was robbing him and that he would undoubtedly assert his right to the Tretton property as soon as the breath should be out of his father s body The truth of what he told the boot maker he certainly did believe There was some little garnishing added to his tale which perhaps under the circumstances was to be forgiven The blow had come upon him so suddenly he said that he was not able even to pay his card account and had left town in dismay at the mine which had been exploded under his feet The boot maker believed him so far that he undertook to supply his orders When the dinner had been eaten the two brothers lit their cigars and drew to the fire There must unfortunately come an end to this you know said Augustus I certainly can t stand it much longer said Mountjoy You at any rate have had the best of it I have endeavored to make my little crib comfortable for you The grub is good and the wine There s no doubt about that Somebody says somewhere that nobody can live upon bread alone That includes the whole menu I suppose What do you suggest to do with yourself You said go abroad So I did to Rio Rio is a long way off somewhere across the equator isn t it I believe it is I think we d better have it out clearly between us Augustus It won t suit me to be at Rio Janeiro when our father dies What difference will his death make to you A father s death generally does make a difference to his eldest son particularly if there is any property concerned You mean to say that you intend to dispute the circumstances of your birth Dispute them Do you think that I will allow such a thing to be said of my mother without disputing it Do you suppose that I will give up my claim to one of the finest properties in England without disputing it Then I had better stop the payment of that money and let the gentlemen know that you mean to raise the question on their behalf That s your affair The arrangement is a very good one for me but you made it You know very well that your present threat means nothing Ask mister Grey You can trust him But I can t trust him After having been so wickedly deceived by my own father I can trust no one Why did not mister Grey find it out before if it be true I give you my word Augustus the lawyers will have to fight it out before you will be allowed to take possession And yet you do not scruple to come and live here at my cost Not in the least At whose cost can I live with less scruple than at yours You at any rate have not robbed our mother of her good name as my father has done The only one of the family with whom I could not stay is the governor I could not sit at the table with a man who has so disgraced himself Upon my word I am very much obliged to you for the honor you do me That s my feeling The chance of the game and his villany have given you for the moment the possession of all the good things They are all mine by rights Cards have had nothing to do with it Yes they have But they have had nothing to do with my being the eldest legitimate son of my father The cards have been against me but they have not affected my mother Then there came the blow from the governor and where was I to look for my bread but to you I suppose if the truth be known you get the money from the governor Of course I do But not for your maintenance On what does he suppose that I have been living since last June It mayn t be in the bond but I suppose he has made allowance for my maintenance Do you mean to say that I am not to have bread and cheese out of Tretton If I were to turn you out of these rooms you d find it very difficult to get it I don t think you ll do that I m not so sure You re meditating it are you I shouldn t go just at present because I have not got a sovereign in the world I was going to speak to you about money You must let me have some Upon my word I like your impudence What the devil am I to do The governor has asked me to go down to Tretton and I can t go without a five pound note in my pocket The governor has asked you to Tretton Why not I got a letter from him this morning Then Augustus asked to see the letter but Mountjoy refused to show it From this there arose angry words and Augustus told his brother that he did not believe him Not believe me You do believe me You know that what I say is the truth He has asked me with all his usual soft soap But I have refused to go I told him that I could not go to the house of one who had injured my mother so seriously All that Mountjoy said as to the proposed visit to Tretton was true The squire had written to him without mentioning the name of Augustus and had told him that for the present Tretton would be the best home for him I will do what I can to make you happy but you will not see a card the squire had said It was not the want of cards which prevented Mountjoy but a feeling on his part that for the future there could be nothing but war between him and his father It was out of the question that he should accept his father s hospitality without telling him of his intention and he did not know his father well enough to feel that such a declaration would not affect him at all He had therefore declined Then Harry Annesley s name was mentioned I think I ve done for that fellow said Augustus What have you done I ve cooked his goose In the first place his uncle has stopped his allowance and in the second place the old fellow is going to marry a wife At any rate he has quarrelled with Master Harry a outrance Master Harry has gone back to the parental parsonage and is there eating the bread of affliction and drinking the waters of poverty Flossy Mountjoy may marry him if she pleases A girl may marry a man now without leave from anybody But if she does my dear cousin will have nothing to eat And you have done this Alone I did it boy Then it s an infernal shame What harm had he ever done you For me I had some ground of quarrel with him but for you there was none I have my own quarrel with him also I quarrelled with him with a cause I do not care if I quarrel with him again He shall never marry Florence Mountjoy if I can help it But to rob a fellow of his property I think a very shabby thing Then Augustus got up and walked out of the chambers into the street and Mountjoy soon followed him I must make him understand that he must leave this at once said Augustus to himself and if necessary I must order the supplies to be cut off CHAPTER XXXVIII THE SCARBOROUGH CORRESPONDENCE It was as Mountjoy had said The squire had written to him a letter inviting him to Tretton and telling him that it would be the best home for him till death should have put Tretton into other hands Mountjoy had thought the matter over sitting in the easy chair in his brother s room and had at last declined the invitation As his letter was emblematic of the man it may be as well to give it to the reader My dear father I don t think it will suit me to go down to Tretton at present I don t mind the cards and I don t doubt that you would make it better than this place But to tell the truth I don t believe a word of what you have told to the world about my mother and some of these days I mean to have it out with Augustus I shall not sit quietly by and see Tretton taken out of my mouth Therefore I think I had better not go to Tretton Yours truly MOUNTJOY SCARBOROUGH This had not at all surprised the father and had not in the least angered him He rather liked his son for standing up for his mother and was by no means offended at the expression of his son s incredulity But what was there in the prospect of a future lawsuit to prevent his son coming to Tretton There need be no word spoken as to the property Tretton would be infinitely more comfortable than those rooms in Victoria Street and he was aware that the hospitality of Victoria Street would not be given in an ungrudging spirit I shouldn t like it said the old squire to himself as he lay quiet on his sofa I shouldn t like at all to be the humble guest of Augustus Augustus would certainly say a nasty word or two The old man knew his younger son well and he had known too the character of his elder son but he had not calculated enough on the change which must have been made by such a revelation as he his father had made to him Mountjoy had felt that all the world was against him and that as best he might he would make use of all the world excepting only his father who of all the world was the falsest and the most cruel As for his brother he would bleed his brother to the very last drop without any compunction Every bottle of champagne that came into the house was to Mountjoy s thinking his own bought with his money and therefore fit to be enjoyed by him But as for his father he doubted whether he could remain with his father without flying at his throat The old man decidedly preferred his elder son of the two He had found that Augustus could not bear success and had first come to dislike him and then to hate him What had he not done for Augustus And with what a return No doubt Augustus had till the spring of this present year been kept in the background but no injury had come to him from that His father of his own good will with infinite labor and successful ingenuity had struggled to put him back in the place which had been taken from him Augustus might not unnaturally have expressed himself as angry He had not done so but had made himself persistently disagreeable and had continued to show that he was waiting impatiently for his father s death It had come to pass that at their last meeting he had hardly scrupled to tell his father that the world would be no world for him till his father had left it This was the reward which the old man received for having struggled to provide handsomely and luxuriously for his son He still made his son a sufficient allowance befitting the heir of a man of large property but he had resolved never to see him again It was true that he almost hated him and thoroughly despised him But since the departure and mysterious disappearance of his eldest son his regard for the sinner had returned He had become apparently a hopeless gambler His debts had been paid and repaid At last the squire had learned that Mountjoy owed so much on post obits that the farther payment of them was an impossibility There was no way of saving him To save the property he must undo the doings of his early youth and prove that the elder son was illegitimate He had still kept the proofs and he did it To the great disgust of mister Grey to the dismay of creditors to the incredulous wonder of Augustus and almost to the annihilation of Mountjoy himself he had done it But there had been nothing in Mountjoy s conduct which had in truth wounded him Mountjoy s vices had been dangerous destructive absurdly foolish but not to his father a shame He ridiculed gambling as a source of excitement No man could win much without dishonest practices and fraud at cards would certainly be detected But he did not on that account hate cards There was no reason why Mountjoy should not become to him as pleasant a companion as ever for the few days that might be left to him if only he would come But when asked he refused to come When the squire received the letter above given he was not in the least angry with his son but simply determined if possible that he should be brought to Tretton Mountjoy s debts would now be paid and something if possible should be done for him He was so angry with Augustus that he would if possible revoke his last decision but that alas would be impossible Sir William Brodrick had when he last saw him expressed some hope not of his recovery which was by all admitted to be impossible but of his continuance in the land of the living for another three months or perhaps six as Sir William had finally suggested opening out as he himself seemed to think indefinite hope The most wonderful constitution mister Scarborough I ever saw in my life I ve never known a dog even so cut about and yet bear it mister Scarborough bowed and smiled and accepted the compliment He would have taken the hat off his head had it been his practice to wear a hat in his sitting room mister Merton had gone farther Of course he did not mean he said to set up his opinion against Sir William s but if mister Scarborough would live strictly by rule mister Merton did not see why either three months or six should be the end of it mister Scarborough had replied that he could not undertake to live precisely by rule and mister Merton had shaken his head But from that time forth mister Scarborough did endeavor to obey the injunctions given to him He had something worth doing in the six months now offered to him He had heard lately very much of the story of Harry Annesley and had expressed great anger at the ill usage to which that young man had been subjected It had come to his ears that it was intended that Harry should lose the property he had expected and that he had already lost his immediate income This had come to him through mister Merton between whom and Augustus Scarborough there was no close friendship And the squire understood that Florence Mountjoy had been the cause of Harry s misfortune He himself recognized it as a fact that his son Mountjoy was unfit to marry any young lady Starvation would assuredly stare such young lady in the face But not the less was he acerbated and disgusted at the idea that Augustus should endeavor to take the young lady to himself What he had exclaimed to mister Merton he wants both the property and the girl There is nothing on earth that he does not want The greater the impropriety in his craving the stronger the craving Then he picked up by degrees all the details of the midnight feud between Harry and Mountjoy and set himself to work to undermine Augustus But he had steadily carried out the plan for settling with the creditors and with the aid of mister Grey had as he thought already concluded that business Conjunction with Augustus had been necessary but that had been obtained It is not too much to say that at the present moment of his life the idea of doing some injury to Augustus was the one object which exercised mister Scarborough s mind Since he had fallen into business relations with his younger son he had become convinced that a more detestable young man did not exist The reader will perhaps agree with mister Scarborough but it can hardly be hoped that he should entertain the opinion as strongly Augustus was now the recognized eldest legitimate son of the squire and as the property was entailed it must no doubt belong to him But the squire was turning in his mind all means of depriving that condition as far as was possible of its glory When he had first heard of the injury that had been done to Harry Annesley he thought that he would leave to our hero all the furniture all the gems all the books all the wine all the cattle which were accumulated at Tretton Augustus should have the bare acres and still barer house but nothing else In thinking of this he had been actuated by a conviction that it would be useless for him to leave them to Mountjoy Whatever might be left to Mountjoy would in fact be left to the creditors and therefore Harry Annesley with his injuries had been felt to be a proper recipient not of the squire s bounty but of the results of his hatred for his son To run counter to the law That had ever been the chief object of the squire s ambition To arrange everything so that it should be seen that he had set all laws at defiance That had been his great pride He had done so notably and with astonishing astuteness in reference to his wife and two sons But now there had come up a condition of things in which he could again show his cleverness Augustus had been most anxious to get up all the post obit bonds which the creditors held feeling as his father well understood that he would thus prevent them from making any farther inquiry when the squire should have died Why should they stir in the matter by going to law when there would be nothing to be gained Those bonds had now been redeemed and were in the possession of mister Grey They had been bought up nominally by himself and must be given to him mister Grey at any rate would have the proof that they had been satisfied They could not be used again to gratify any spite that Augustus might entertain The captain therefore could now enjoy any property which might be left to him Of course it would all go to the gaming table It might even yet be better to leave it to Harry Annesley But blood was thicker than water though it were but the blood of a bastard He would do a good turn for Harry in another way All the furniture and all the gems and all the money should again be the future property of Mountjoy But in order that this might be effected before he died he must not let the grass grow under his feet He thought of the promised three months with a possible extension to six as suggested by Sir William Sir William says three months he said to mister Merton speaking in the easiest way of the possibility of his living He said six Ah that is if I do what I m told But I shall not exactly do that Three or six would be all the same only for a little bit of business I want to get through Sir William s orders would include the abandonment of my business The less done the better Then I do not see why Sir William should limit you to six months I think that three will nearly suffice A man does not want to die I suppose said Merton There are various ways of looking at that question replied the squire Many men desire the prolongation of life as a lengthened period of enjoyment There is perhaps something of that feeling with me but when you see how far I am crippled and curtailed how my enjoyments are confined to breathing the air to eating and drinking and to the occasional reading of a few pages you must admit that there cannot be much of that A conversation with you is the best of it Some want to live for the sake of their wives and children In the ordinary acceptation of the words that is all over with me Many desire to live because they fear to die There is nothing of that in me I can assure you I am not afraid to meet my Creator But there are those who wish for life that their purposes of love or stronger purposes of hatred may be accomplished I am among the number But on that account I only wish it till those purposes have been completed I think I ll go to sleep for an hour but there are a couple of letters I want you to write before post time Then mister Scarborough turned himself round and thought of the letters he was to write mister Merton went out and as he wandered about the park in the dirt and slush of December tried to make up his mind whether he most admired his patron s philosophy or condemned his general lack of principle At the proper hour he appeared again and found mister Scarborough quite alert I don t know whether I shall have the three months unless I behave better he said I have been thinking about those letters and very nearly made an attempt to write them There are things about a son which a father doesn t wish to communicate to any one Merton only shook his head I m not a bit afraid of you nor do I care for your knowing what I have to say But there are words which it would be difficult even to write and almost impossible to dictate But he did make the attempt though he did not find himself able to say all that he had intended The first letter was to the lawyer My dear mister Grey You will be surprised at my writing to summon you once again to my bedside I think there was some kind of a promise made that the request should not be repeated but the circumstances are of such a nature that I do not well know how to avoid it However if you refuse to come I will give you my instructions It is my purpose to make another will and to leave everything that I am capable of leaving to my son Mountjoy You are aware that he is now free from debt and capable of enjoying any property that he may possess As circumstances are at present he would on my death be absolutely penniless and Heaven help the man who should find himself dependent on the mercy of Augustus Scarborough What I possess would be the balance at the bank the house in town and everything contained in and about Tretton as to which I should wish that the will should be very explicit in making it understood that every conceivable item of property is to belong to Mountjoy I know the strength of an entail and not for worlds would I venture to meddle with anything so holy There came a grin of satisfaction over his face as he uttered these words and his scribe was utterly unable to keep from laughing But as Augustus must have the acres let him have them bare Underscore that word if you please and the word was underscored If I had time I would have every tree about the place cut down I don t think you could under the entail said Merton I would use up every stick in building the farmers barns and mending the farmers gates and I would cover an acre just in front of the house with a huge conservatory I respect the law my boy and they would find it difficult to prove that I had gone beyond it But there is no time for that kind of finished revenge Then he went on with the letter You will understand what I mean I wish to divide my property so that Mountjoy may have everything that is not strictly entailed You will of course say that it will all go to the gambling table It may go to the devil so that Augustus does not have it But it need not go to the gambling table If you would consent to come down to me once more we might possibly devise some scheme for saving it But whether we can do so or not it is my request that my last will may be prepared in accordance with these instructions Very faithfully yours JOHN SCARBOROUGH And now for the other said mister Scarborough Had you not better rest a bit asked Merton No this is a kind of work at which a man does not want to rest He is carried on by his own solicitudes and his own eagerness This will be very short and when it is done then perhaps I may sleep The second letter was as follows My dear Mountjoy I think you are foolish in allowing yourself to be prevented from coming here by a sentiment But in truth independently of the pleasure I should derive from your company I wish you to be here on a matter of business which is of some importance to yourself I am about to make a new will and although I am bound to pay every respect to the entail and would not for worlds do anything in opposition to the law still I may be enabled to do something for your benefit Your brother has kindly interfered for the payment of your creditors and as all the outstanding bonds have been redeemed you would now by his generosity be enabled to enjoy any property which might be left to you There are a few tables and chairs at my disposal and a gem or two and some odd volumes which perhaps you might like to possess I have written to mister Grey on the subject and I would wish you to see him This you might do whether you come here or not But I do not the less wish that you should come Your affectionate father JOHN SCARBOROUGH I think that the odd volumes will fetch him He was always fond of literature I suppose it means the entire library replied Merton And he likes tables and chairs I think he will come and look after the tables and chairs Why not beds and washhand stands said mister Merton Well yes he may have the beds and washhand stands Mountjoy is not a fool and will understand very well what I mean I wonder whether I could scrape the paper off the drawing room walls and leave the scraps to his brother without interfering with the entail But now I am tired and will rest But he did not even then go to rest but lay still scheming scheming scheming about the property There was now another letter to be written for the writing of which he would not again summon mister Merton He was half ashamed to do so and at last sent for his sister Martha said he I want you to write a letter for me mister Merton has been writing letters for you all the morning That s just the reason why you should write one now I am still in some slight degree afraid of his authority but I am not at all afraid of yours You ought to be quiet John indeed you ought And in order that I may be quiet you must write this letter It s nothing particular or I should not have asked you to do it It s only an invitation An invitation to ask somebody here Yes to ask somebody to come here I don t know whether he ll come Do I know him I hope you may if he comes He s a very good looking young man if that is anything Don t talk nonsense John But I believe he s engaged to another young lady with whom I must beg you not to interfere You remember Florence Florence Mountjoy Of course I remember my own niece The young man is engaged to her She was intended for poor Mountjoy Poor Mountjoy has put himself beyond all possibility of a wife Poor Mountjoy and the soft hearted aunt almost shed tears But we haven t to do with Mountjoy now Sit down there and begin Dear mister Annesley Oh It s mister Annesley is it Yes it is mister Annesley is the handsome young man Have you any objection Only people do say What do they say Of course I don t know only I have heard That he is a scoundrel Scoundrel is very strong said the old lady shocked A villain a liar a thief and all the rest of it That s what you have heard And I ll tell you who has been your informant Either first or second hand it has come to you from mister Augustus Scarborough Now we ll begin again Dear mister Annesley The old lady paused a moment and then setting herself firmly to the task commenced and finished her letter as follows Dear mister Annesley You spent a few days here on one occasion and I want to renew the pleasure which your visit gave me Will you extend your kindness so far as to come to Tretton for any time you may please to name beyond two or three days I am sorry to say that your friend Augustus Scarborough cannot be here to meet you My other son Mountjoy may be here If you wish to escape him I will endeavor so to fix the time when I shall have heard from you But I think there need be no ill blood there Neither of you did anything of which you are probably ashamed though as an old man I am bound to express my disapproval Surely he must be ashamed said Miss Scarborough Never you mind Believe me you know nothing about it Then he went on with his letter But it is not merely for the pleasure of your society that I ask you I have a word to say to you which may be important Yours faithfully JOHN SCARBOROUGH CHAPTER XXXIX HOW THE LETTERS WERE RECEIVED We must now describe the feelings of mister Scarborough s correspondents as they received his letters When mister Grey begun to read that which was addressed to him he declared that on no consideration would he go down to Tretton But when he came to inquire within himself as to his objection he found that it lay chiefly in his great dislike to Augustus Scarborough For poor Mountjoy as he called him he entertained a feeling of deep pity and pity we know is akin to love And for the squire he in his heart felt but little of that profound dislike which he was aware such conduct as the squire s ought to have generated He is the greatest rascal that I ever knew he said again and again both to Dolly and to mister Barry But yet he did not regard him as an honest man regards a rascal and was angry with himself in consequence He knew that there remained with him even some spark of love for mister Scarborough which to himself was inexplicable From the moment in which he had first admitted the fact that Augustus Scarborough was the true heir at law he had been most determined in taking care that that heirship should be established It must be known to all men that Mountjoy was not the eldest son of his father as the law required him to be for the inheritance of the property and that Augustus was the eldest son but in arranging that these truths should be notorious it had come to pass that he had learned to hate Augustus with an intensity that had redounded to the advantage both of Mountjoy and their father It must be so Augustus must become Augustus Scarborough Esquire of Tretton but the worse luck for Tretton and all connected with it And mister Grey did resolve that when that day should come all relation between himself and Tretton should cease It had never occurred to him that by redeeming the post obit bonds Mountjoy would become capable of owning and enjoying any property that might be left to him With Tretton all the belongings of Tretton in the old fashioned way would of course go to the heir The belongings of Tretton which were personal property would in themselves amount to wealth for a younger son That which mister Scarborough would in this way be able to bequeath might probably be worth thirty thousand pounds Out of the proceeds of the real property the debts had been paid And because Augustus had consented so to pay them he was now to be mulcted of those loose belongings which gave its charm to Tretton Because Augustus had paid Mountjoy s debts Mountjoy was to be enabled to rob Augustus There was a wickedness in this redolent of the old squire But it was a wickedness in arranging which mister Grey hesitated to participate As he thought of it however he could not but feel what a very clever man he had for a client It will all go to the gambling table of course he said that night to Dolly It is no affair of ours No but when a lawyer is consulted he has to think of the prudent or imprudent disposition of property mister Scarborough hasn t consulted you papa I must look at it as though he had He tells me what he intends to do and I am bound to give him my advice I cannot advise him to bestow all these things on Augustus whom I regard as a long way the worst of the family You need not care about that And here again continued mister Grey comes up the question what is it that duty demands Augustus is the eldest son and is entitled to what the law allots him but Mountjoy was brought up as the eldest son and is certainly entitled to what provision the father can make him You cannot provide for such a gambler I don t know that that comes within my duty It is not my fault that Mountjoy is a gambler any more than that it is my fault that Augustus is a beast Gambler and beast there they are And moreover nothing will turn the squire from his purpose I am only a tool in his hands a trowel for the laying of his mortar and bricks Of course I must draw his will and shall do it with some pleasure because it will dispossess Augustus Then mister Grey went to bed as did also Dolly but she was not at all surprised at being summoned to his couch after she had been an hour in her own bed I think I shall go down to Tretton said mister Grey You declared that you would never go there again So I did but I did not know then how much I might come to hate Augustus Scarborough Would you go to Tretton merely to injure him said his daughter I have been thinking about that said mister Grey I don t know that I would go simply to do him an injury but I think that I would go to see that justice is properly done That can be arranged without your going to Tretton By putting our heads together I think we can contrive that the deed shall be more effectually performed What we must attempt to do is to save this property from going to the gambling table There is only one way that occurs to me What is that It must be left to his wife He hasn t a wife It must be left to some woman whom he will consent to marry There are three objects to keep it from Augustus to give the enjoyment of it to Mountjoy and to prevent Mountjoy from gambling with it The only thing I can see is a wife There is a girl he wants to marry said Dolly But she doesn t want to marry him and I doubt whether he can be got to marry any one else There is still a peck of difficulties Oh papa I wish you would wash your hands of the Scarboroughs I must go to Tretton first said he And now my dear you are doing no good by sitting up here and talking to me Then with a smile Dolly took herself off to her own chamber Mountjoy when he got his letter was sitting over a late breakfast in Victoria Street It was near twelve o clock and he was enjoying the delicious luxury of having his breakfast to eat with a cigar after it and nothing else that he need do But the fruition of all these comforts was somewhat marred by the knowledge that he had no such dinner to expect He must go out and look for a dinner among the eating houses The next morning would bring him no breakfast and if he were to remain longer in Victoria Street he must do so in direct opposition to the owner of the establishment He had that morning received notice to quit and had been told that the following breakfast would be the last meal served to him Let it be good of its kind Mountjoy had said I believe you care for nothing but eating and drinking There s little else that you can do for me And so they had parted Mountjoy had taken the precaution of having his letters addressed to the house of the friendly bootmaker and now as he was slowly pouring out his first cup of coffee and thinking how nearly it must be his last his father s letter was brought to him The letter had been delayed one day as he himself had omitted to call for it It was necessarily a sad time for him He was a man who fought hard against melancholy taking it as a primary rule of life that for such a one as he had become the pleasures of the immediate moment should suffice If one day or better still one night of excitement was in store for him the next day should be regarded as the unlimited future for which no man can be responsible But such philosophy will too frequently be insufficient for the stoutest hearts Mountjoy s heart would occasionally almost give way and then his thoughts would be dreary enough Hunger absolute hunger without the assured expectation of food had never yet come upon him but in order to put a stop to its cravings if he should find it troublesome to bear he had already provided himself with pistol and bullets And now with his cup of coffee before him aromatic creamy and hot with a filleted sole rolled up before him on a little dish three or four plover s eggs on which to finish lying by and on the distance of the table a chasse of brandy of which he already well knew the virtues he got his father s letter He did not at first open it disliking all thoughts as to his father Then gradually he tore the envelope and was slow in understanding the full meaning of the last lines He did not at once perceive the irony of his brother s kindly interference and of the generosity which had enabled him Mountjoy to be a recipient of property But his father purposed to do something for his benefit Gradually it dawned upon him that his father could only do that something effectually because of his brother s dealings with the creditors Then the chairs and the tables and the gem or two and the odd volumes one by one made themselves intelligible That a father should write so to one son and should so write of another was marvellous But then his father was a marvellous man whose character he was only beginning to understand His father he told himself had fortunately taken it into his head to hate Augustus and intended in consequence to strip Tretton and the property generally of all their outside personal belongings Yes he thought that with such an object before him he would certainly go and see mister Grey And if mister Grey should so advise him he would go down to Tretton On such business as this he would consent to see his father He did not think that just at present he need have recourse to his pistol for his devices He could not on the very day go to Tretton as it would be necessary that he should write to his father first His brother would probably extend his hospitality for a couple of days when he should hear of the proposed journey and if not would lend him money for his present purposes or under existing circumstances he might probably be able to borrow it from mister Grey With a heart elevated to almost absolute bliss he ate his breakfast and drank his chasse and smoked his cigar and then rose slowly that he might proceed to mister Grey s chambers But at this moment Augustus came in He had only breakfasted at his own club much less comfortably than he would have done at home in order that he might not sit at table with his brother He had now returned so that he might see to Mountjoy s departure After all Augustus I am going down to Tretton said the elder brother as he folded up his father s letter What argument has the old man used now Mountjoy did not think it well to tell his brother the exact nature of the arguments used and therefore put the letter into his pocket He wishes to say something to me about property said Mountjoy Then some idea of the old squire s scheme fell with a crushing weight of anticipated sorrow on Augustus In a moment it all occurred to him what his father might do what injuries he might inflict and saddest of all feelings there came the immediate reflection that it had all been rendered possible by his own doings With the conviction that so much might be left away from him there came also a farther feeling that after all there was a chance that his father had invented the story of his brother s illegitimacy that Mountjoy was now free from debt and that Tretton with all its belongings might now go back to him That his father would do it if it were possible he did not doubt From week to week he had waited impatiently for his father s demise and had expected little or none of that mental activity which his father had exercised What a fool he had been he said to himself sitting opposite to Mountjoy who in the vacancy of the moment had lighted another cigar what an ass Had he played his cards better had he comforted and flattered and cosseted the old man Mountjoy might have gone his own way to the dogs Now at the best Tretton would come to him stripped of everything and at the worst no Tretton would come to him at all Well what are you going to do he said roughly I think I shall probably go down and just see the governor All your feelings about your mother then are blown to the winds My feelings about your mother are not blown to the winds at all but to speak of her to you would be wasting breath I hadn t the pleasure of knowing her said Augustus And I am not aware that she did me any great kindness in bringing me into the world Do you go to Tretton this afternoon Probably not Or to morrow Possibly to morrow said Mountjoy Because I shall find it convenient to have your room To day of course I cannot stir To morrow morning I should at any rate like to have my breakfast Here he paused for a reply but none came from his brother I must have some money to go down to Tretton with I suppose you can lend it me just for the present Not a shilling said Augustus in thorough ill humor I shall be able to pay you very shortly Not a shilling The return I have had from you for all that I have done is not of a nature to make me do more If I had ever thought that you had expended a sovereign except for the object of furthering some plot of your own I should have been grateful As it is I do not know that we owe very much to each other Then he left the room and getting into a cab went away to Lincoln s Inn Harry Annesley received mister Scarborough s letter down at Buston and was much surprised by it He had not spent the winter hitherto very pleasantly His uncle he had never seen though he had heard from day to day sundry stories of his wooing He had soon given up his hunting feeling himself ashamed in his present nameless position to ride Joshua Thoroughbung s horses He had taken to hard reading but the hard reading had failed and he had been given up to the miseries of his position The hard reading had been continued for a fortnight or three weeks during which he had at any rate respected himself but in an evil hour he had allowed it to escape from him and now was again miserable Then the invitation from Tretton had been received I have got a letter tis from mister Scarborough of Tretton What does mister Scarborough say He wants me to go down there Do you know mister Scarborough I believe you have altogether quarrelled with his son Oh yes I have quarrelled with Augustus and have had an encounter with Mountjoy not on the most friendly terms But the father and Mountjoy seem to be reconciled You can see his letter I at any rate shall go there To this mister Annesley senior had no objection to make CHAPTER XL VISITORS AT TRETTON It so happened that the three visitors who had been asked to Tretton all agreed to go on the same day There was indeed no reason why Harry should delay his visit and much why the other two should expedite theirs mister Grey knew that the thing if done at all should be done at once and Mountjoy as he had agreed to accept his father s offer could not put himself too quickly under the shelter of his father s roof You can have twenty pounds mister Grey had said when the subject of the money was mooted Will that suffice Mountjoy had said that it would suffice amply and then returning to his brother s rooms had waited there with what patience he possessed till he sallied forth to The Continental to get the best dinner which that restaurant could afford him He was beginning to feel that his life was very sad in London and to look forward to the glades of Tretton with some anticipation of rural delight He went down by the same train with mister Grey a great grind as Mountjoy called it when mister Grey proposed a departure at ten o clock Harry followed so as to reach Tretton only in time for dinner If I may venture to advise you said mister Grey in the train I should do in this matter whatever my father asked me Hereupon Mountjoy frowned He is anxious to make some provision for you I m not grateful to my father if you mean that It is hard to say whether you should be grateful But from the first he has done the best he could for you according to his lights You believe all this about my mother I do I don t That s the difference And I don t think that Augustus believes it The story is undoubtedly true You must excuse me if I will not accept it At any rate you had parted with your share in the property My share was the whole After your father s death said mister Grey and that was gone We needn t discuss the property What is it that he expects me to do now Simply to be kind in your manner to him and to agree to what he says about the personal property It is his intention as far as I understand it to leave you everything He is very kind I think he is Only it would all have been mine if he had not cheated me of my birthright Or mister Tyrrwhit s and mister Hart s and mister Spicer s mister Tyrrwhit and mister Hart and mister Spicer could not have robbed me of my name Let them have done what they would with their bonds I should have been at any rate Scarborough of Tretton My belief is that I need not blush for my mother He has made it appear that I should do so I can t forgive him because he gives me the chairs and tables They will be worth thirty thousand pounds said mister Grey I can t forgive him The cloud sat very black upon Mountjoy Scarborough s face as he said this and the blacker it sat the more mister Grey liked him If something could be done to redeem from ruin a young man who so felt about his mother who so felt about his mother simply because she had been his mother it would be a good thing to do Augustus had entertained no such feeling He had said to mister Grey as he had said also to his brother that he had not known the lady When the facts as to the distribution of the property had been made known to him he had cared nothing for the injury done by the story to his mother s name The story was too true mister Grey knew that it was true but he could not on that account do other than feel an intense desire to confer some benefit on Mountjoy Scarborough He put his hand out affectionately and laid it on the other man s knee Your father has not long to live Captain Scarborough I suppose not And he is at present anxious to make what reparation is in his power What he can leave you will produce let us say fifteen hundred a year Without a will from him you would have to live on your brother s bounty By Heaven no said Mountjoy thinking of the pistol and the bullets I see nothing else I see but I cannot explain Do you not think that fifteen hundred a year would be better than nothing with a wife let us say said mister Grey beginning to introduce the one argument on which he believed so much must depend With a wife Yes with a wife With what wife A wife may be very well but a wife must depend on who it is Is there any one that you mean Not exactly any particular person said the lawyer lamely Pshaw What do I want with a wife Do you mean to say that my father has told you that he intends to clog his legacy with the burden of a wife I would not accept it with such a burden unless I could choose the wife myself To tell the truth there is a girl Your cousin Yes my cousin When I was well to do in the world I was taught to believe that I could have her If she will be mine mister Grey I will renounce gambling altogether If my father can manage that I will forgive him or will endeavor to do so The property which he can leave me shall be settled altogether upon her I will endeavor to reform myself and so to live that no misfortune shall come upon her If that is what you mean say so Well not quite that To no other marriage will I agree That has been the dream of my life through all those moments of hot excitement and assured despair which I have endured Her mother has always told me that it should be so and she herself in former days did not deny it Now you know it all If my father wishes to see me married Florence Mountjoy must be my wife Then he sunk back on his seat and nothing more was said between them till they had reached Tretton The father and son had not met each other since the day on which the former had told the latter the story of his birth Since then Mountjoy had disappeared from the world and for a few days his father had thought that he had been murdered But now they met as they might have done had they seen each other a week ago Well Mountjoy how are you And How are you sir Such were the greetings between them And no others were spoken In a few minutes the son was allowed to go and look after the rural joys he had anticipated and the lawyer was left closeted with the squire mister Grey soon explained his proposition Let the property be left to trustees who should realize from it what money it should fetch and keep the money in their own hands paying Mountjoy the income There could he said be nothing better done unless Mountjoy would agree to marry He is attached it seems to his cousin said mister Grey and he is unwilling at present to marry any one else He can t marry her said the squire I do not know the circumstances He can t marry her She is engaged to the young man who will be here just now I told you did I not that Harry Annesley is coming here My son knows that he will be here to day Everybody knows the story of mister Annesley and the captain They are to sit down to dinner together and I trust they may not quarrel The lady of whom you are speaking is engaged to young Annesley and Mountjoy s suit in that direction is hopeless Hopeless you think Utterly hopeless Your plan of providing him with a wife would be very good if it were feasible I should be very glad to see him settled But if he will marry no one but Florence Mountjoy he must remain unmarried Augustus has had his hand in that business and don t let us dabble in it Then the squire gave the lawyer full instructions as to the will which was to be made mister Grey and mister Bullfist were to be named as trustees with instructions to sell everything which it would be in the squire s legal power to bequeath The books the gems the furniture both at Tretton and in London the plate the stock the farm produce the pictures on the walls and the wine in the cellars were all named He endeavored to persuade mister Grey to consent to a cutting of the timber so that the value of it might be taken out of the pocket of the younger brother and put into that of the elder But to this mister Grey would not assent There would be an air of persecution about it he said and it mustn t be done But to the general stripping of Tretton for the benefit of Mountjoy he gave a cordial agreement I am not quite sure that I have done with Augustus as yet said the squire I had made up my mind not to be put out by trifles not to be vexed at a little My treatment of my children has been such that though I have ever intended to do them good I must have seemed to each at different periods to have injured him I have not therefore expected much from them But I have received less than nothing from Augustus It is possible that he may hear from me again To this mister Grey said nothing but he had taken his instructions about the drawing of the will Harry came down by the train in time for dinner On the journey down he had been perplexed in his mind thinking of various things He did not quite understand why mister Scarborough had sent for him His former intimacy had been with Augustus and though there had been some cordiality of friendship shown by the old man to the son s companion it had amounted to no more than might be expected from one who was notably good natured A great injury had been done to Harry and he supposed that his visit must have some reference to that injury He had been told in so many words that come when he might he would not find Augustus at Tretton From this and from other signs he almost saw that there existed a quarrel between the squire and his son Therefore he felt that something was to be said as to the state of his affairs at Buston But if as the train drew near to Tretton he was anxious as to his meeting with the squire he was much more so as to the captain The reader will remember all the circumstances under which they two had last seen each other Harry had been furiously attacked by Mountjoy and had then left him sprawling dead as some folks had said on the following day under the rail His only crime had been that he was drunk If the disinherited one would give him his hand and let by gones be by gones he would do the same He felt no personal animosity But there was a difficulty As he was driven up to the door in a cab belonging to the squire there was Mountjoy standing before the house He too had thought of the difficulties and had made up his mind that it would not do for him to meet his late foe without some few words intended for the making of peace I hope you are well mister Annesley he said offering his hand as the other got out of the cab It may be as well that I should apologize at once for my conduct I was at that moment considerably distressed as you may have heard I had been declared to be penniless and to be nobody The news had a little unmanned me and I was beside myself I quite understand it quite understand it said Annesley giving his hand I am very glad to see you back again and in your father s house Then Mountjoy turned on his heel and went through the hall leaving Harry to the care of the butler The captain thought that he had done enough and that the affair in the street might now be regarded as a dream Harry was taken up to shake hands with the old man and in due time came down to dinner where he met mister Grey and the young doctor They were all very civil to him and upon the whole he spent a pleasant evening On the next day about noon the squire sent for him He had been told at breakfast that it was the squire s intention to see him in the middle of the day and he had been unable therefore to join Mountjoy s shooting party Sit down mister Annesley said the old man You were surprised no doubt when you got my invitation Well yes perhaps so but I thought it very kind I meant to be kind but still it requires some explanation You see I am such an old cripple that I cannot give invitations like anybody else Now you are here I must not eat and drink with you and in order to say a few words to you I am obliged to keep you in the house till the doctor tells me I am strong enough to talk I am glad to find you so much better than when I was here before I don t know much about that There will never be a much better in my case The people about me talk with the utmost unconcern of whether I can live one month or possibly two Anything beyond that is quite out of the question The squire took a pride in making the worst of his case so that the people to whom he talked should marvel the more at his vitality But we won t mind my health now It is true I fear that you have quarrelled with your uncle It is quite true that he has quarrelled with me I am afraid that that is more important He means if he can to cut you out of the entail He does not mean that I shall have the property if he can prevent it I don t think very much of entails myself said the squire If a man has a property he should be able to leave it as he pleases or or else he doesn t have it That is what the law intends I suppose said Harry Just so but the law is such an old woman that she never knows how to express herself to any purpose I haven t allowed the law to bind me I dare say you know the story About your two sons and the property I think all the world knows the story I suppose it has been talked about a little said the squire with a chuckle My object has been to prevent the law from handing over my property to the fraudulent claims which my son s creditors were enabled to make and I have succeeded fairly well On that head I have nothing to regret Now your uncle is going to take other means Yes he is going to take means which are at any rate lawful But which will be tedious and may not perhaps succeed He is intending to have an heir of his own That I believe is his purpose said Harry There is no reason why he shouldn t but he mayn t you know He is not married yet No he is not married yet And then he has also stopped the allowance he used to make you Harry nodded assent Now all this is a great shame I think so The poor gentleman has been awfully bamboozled He is not so very old said Harry I don t think he is more than fifty But he is an old goose You ll excuse me I know Augustus Scarborough got him up to London and filled him full of lies I am aware of it And so am I aware of it He has told him stories as to your conduct with Mountjoy which added to some youthful indiscretions of your own It was simply because I didn t like to hear him read sermons That was an indiscretion as he had the power in his hands to do you an injury Most men have got some little bit of petty tyranny in their hearts I have had none To this Harry could only bow I let my two boys do as they pleased only wishing that they should lead happy lives I never made them listen to sermons or even to lectures Probably I was wrong Had I tyrannized over them they would not have tyrannized over me as they have done Now I ll tell you what it is that I propose to do I will write to your uncle or will get mister Merton to write for me and will explain to him as well as I can the depth and the blackness and the cruelty the unfathomable heathen cruelty together with the falsehoods the premeditated lies and the general rascality on all subjects of my son Augustus I will explain to him that of all men I know he is the least trustworthy I will explain to him that if led in a matter of such importance by Augustus Scarborough he will be surely led astray And I think that between us between Merton and me that is we can concoct a letter that shall be efficacious But I will get Mountjoy also to go and see him and explain to him out of his own mouth what in truth occurred that night when he and you fell out in the streets mister Prosper must be a more vindictive man than I take him to be in regard to sermons if he will hold out after that Then mister Scarborough allowed him to go out and if possible find the shooters somewhere about the park CHAPTER XLI MOUNTJOY SCARBOROUGH GOES TO BUSTON mister Grey returned to London after staying but one night having received fresh instructions as to the will The will was to be prepared at once and mister Barry was to bring it down for execution Shall I not inform Augustus asked mister Grey But this did not suit with mister Scarborough s views of revenge I think not I would do by him whatever honesty requires but I have never told him that I mean to leave him anything Of course he knows that he is to have the estate He is revelling in the future poverty of poor Mountjoy He turned him out of his house just now because Mountjoy would not obey him by going to Brazil He would turn him out of this house if he could because I won t at once go to the devil He is something overmasterful is Master Augustus and a rub or two will do him good I d rather you wouldn t tell him if you please Then mister Grey departed without making any promise but he determined that he would be guided by the squire s wishes Augustus Scarborough was not of a nature to excite very warmly the charity of any man Harry remained for two or three days shooting with Mountjoy and once or twice he saw the squire again Merton and I have managed to concoct that letter said the squire I m afraid your uncle will find it rather long Is he impatient of long letters He likes long sermons If anybody will listen to his reading I think you have a deal to answer for yourself when you could not make so small a sacrifice to the man to whom you were to owe everything But he ought to look for a wife in consequence of that crime and not falsely allege another If as I fear he finds the wife plan troublesome our letter may perhaps move him and Mountjoy is to go down and open his eyes Mountjoy hasn t made any difficulty about it I shall be greatly distressed Harry begun Not at all He must go I like to have my own way in these little matters He owes you as much reparation as that and we shall be able to see what members of the Scarborough family you would trust the most Harry during the two days shot some hares in company with Mountjoy but not a word more was said about the adventure in London Nor was the name of Florence Mountjoy ever mentioned between the two suitors I m going to Buston you know Mountjoy said once So your father told me What sort of a fellow shall I find your uncle He s a gentleman but not very wise No more was said between them on that head but Mountjoy spoke at great length about his own brother and his father s will My father is the most singular man you ever came across I think he is I am not going to say a good word for him I wouldn t let him think that I had said a good word for him In order to save the property he has maligned my mother and has cheated me and the creditors most horribly most infernally That s my conviction though Grey thinks otherwise I can t forgive him and won t and he knows it But after that he is going to do the best thing he can for me And he has begun by making me a decent allowance again as his son But I m to have that only as long as I remain here at Tretton Of course I have been fond of cards I suppose so Not a doubt of it But I haven t touched a card now for a month nearly And then he is going to leave me what property he has to leave And he and my brother have paid off those Jews among them I m not a bit obliged to my brother He s got some game of his own which I don t quite clearly see and my father is doing this for me simply to spite my brother He d cut down every tree upon the place if Grey would allow it And yet to give Augustus the property my father has done this gross injustice I suppose the money lenders would have had the best of it had he not That s true They would have had it all They had measured every yard of it and had got my name down for the full value Now they re paid That s a comfort Nothing s a comfort I know that they re right and that if I got the money into my own hand it would be gone to morrow I should be off to Monte Carlo like a shot and of course it would go after the other There is but one thing would redeem me What s that Never mind We won t talk of it Then he was silent but Harry Annesley knew very well that he had alluded to Florence Mountjoy Then Harry went and Mountjoy was left to the companionship of mister Merton and such pleasure as he could find in a daily visit to his father He was at any rate courteous in his manner to the old man and abstained from those irritating speeches which Augustus had always chosen to make He had on one occasion during this visit told his father what he thought about him but this the squire had taken quite as a compliment I believe you know that you ve done a monstrous injustice to everybody concerned I rather like doing what you call injustices You have set the law at defiance Well yes I think I have done that According to my belief it s all untrue You mean about your mother I like you for that I do indeed I like you for sticking up for your poor mother Well now you shall have fifty pounds a month say twelve pounds ten a week as long as you remain at Tretton and you may have whom you like here as long as they bring no cards with them And if you want to hunt there are horses and if they ain t good enough you can get others But if you go away from Tretton there s an end of it It will all be stopped the next day Nevertheless he did make arrangements by which Mountjoy should proceed to Buston stopping two nights as he went to London There isn t a club he can enter said the squire comforting himself nor a Jew that will lend him a five pound note Mountjoy had told the truth when he had said that nothing was a comfort Though it seemed to his father and to the people around him at Tretton that he had everything that a man could want he had in fact nothing nothing to satisfy him In the first place he was quite alive to the misery of that decision given by the world against him which had been of such comfort to his father Not a club in London would admit him He had been proclaimed a defaulter after such a fashion that all his clubs had sent to him for some explanation and as he had given none and had not answered their letters his name had been crossed out in the books of them all He knew himself to be a man disgraced and when he had fled from London he had gone under the conviction that he would certainly never return There were the pistol and bullet as his last assured resource but a certain amount of good fortune had awaited him enough to save him from having recourse to their aid His brother had supplied him with small sums of money and from time to time a morsel of good luck had enabled him to gamble not to his heart s content but still in some manner so as to make his life bearable But now he was back in his own country and he could gamble not at all and hardly even see those old companions with whom he had lived It was not only for the card tables that he sighed but for the companions of the card table And though he knew that he had been scratched out from the lists of all clubs as a dishonest man he knew also or thought that he knew that he had been as honest as the best of those companions As long as he could by any possibility raise money he had paid it away and by no false trick had he ever endeavored to get it back again Had a little time been allowed him all would have been paid and all had been paid He knew that by the rules of such institutions time could not be granted but still he did not feel himself to have been a dishonest man Yet he had been so disgraced that he could hardly venture to walk about the streets of London in the daylight And then there came upon him when he found himself alone at Tretton an irrepressible desire for gambling It was as though his throat were parched with an implacable thirst He walked about ever meditating certain fortunate turns of the cards and when he had worked himself up to some realization of his old excitement he would remember that it was all a vain and empty bubble He had money in his pocket and could rush up to London if he would and if he did so he could no doubt find some coarse hell at which he could stake it till it would be all gone but the gates of the A and the B and the C would be closed against him and he would then be driven to feel that he had indeed fallen into the nethermost pit Were he once to play at such places as his mind painted to him he could never play at any other and yet when the day drew nigh on which he was to go to London on his way to Buston he did bethink himself where these places were to be found His throat was parched and the thirst upon him was extreme Cards were the weapons he had used He had played ecarte piquet whist and baccarat with an occasional night of some foolish game such as cribbage or vingt et un Though he had always lost he had always played with men who had played honestly There is much that is in truth dishonest even in honest play A man who can keep himself sober after dinner plays with one who flusters himself with drink The man with a trained memory plays with him who cannot remember a card The cool man plays with the impetuous the man who can hold his tongue with him who cannot but talk the man whose practised face will tell no secrets with him who loses a point every rubber by his uncontrolled grimaces And then there is the man who knows the game and plays with him who knows it not at all Of course the cool the collected the thoughtful the practised they who have given up their whole souls to the study of cards will play at a great advantage which in their calculations they do not fail to recognize See the man standing by and watching the table and leaving all the bets he can on A and B as against C and D and however ignorant you may be you will soon become sure that A and B know the game whereas C and D are simply infants That is all fair and acknowledged but looking at it from a distance as you lie under your apple trees in your orchard far from the shout of Two by honors you will come to doubt the honesty of making your income after such a fashion Such as it is Mountjoy sighed for it bitterly sighed for it but could not see where it was to be found He had a gentleman s horror of those resorts in gin shops or kept by the disciples of gin shops where he would surely be robbed which did not appal him but robbed in bad company Thinking of all this he went up to London late in the afternoon and spent an uncomfortable evening in town It was absolutely innocent as regarded the doings of the night itself but was terrible to him There was a slow drizzling rain but not the less after dinner at his hotel he started off to wander through the streets With his great coat and his umbrella he was almost hidden and as he passed through Pall Mall up saint James s Street and along Piccadilly he could pause and look in at the accustomed door He saw men entering whom he knew and knew that within five minutes they could be seated at their tables I had an awfully heavy time of it last night one said to another as he went up the steps and Mountjoy as he heard the words envied the speaker Then he passed back and went again a tour of all the clubs What had he done that he like a poor Peri should be unable to enter the gates of all these paradises He had now in his pocket fifty pounds Could he have been made absolutely certain that he would have lost it he would have gone into any paradise and have staked his money with that certainty At last having turned up Waterloo Place he saw a man standing in the door way of one of these palaces and he was aware at once that the man had seen him He was a man of such a nature that it would be impossible that he should have seen a worse He was a small dry good looking little fellow with a carefully preserved mustache and a head from the top of which age was beginning to move the hair He lived by cards and lived well He was called Captain Vignolles but it was only known of him that he was a professional gambler He probably never cheated Men who play at the clubs scarcely ever cheat there are so many with whom they play sharp enough to discover them and with the discovered gambler all in this world is over Captain Vignolles never cheated but he found that an obedience to those little rules which I have named above stood him well in lieu of cheating He was not known to have any particular income but he was known to live on the best of everything as far as club life was concerned He immediately followed Mountjoy down into the street and greeted him Captain Scarborough as I am a living man Well Vignolles how are you And so you have come back once more to the land of the living I was awfully sorry for you and think that they treated you uncommon harshly As you ve paid your money of course they ll let you in again In answer to this Mountjoy had very little to say but the interview ended by his accepting an invitation from Captain Vignolles to supper for the following evening If Captain Scarborough would come at eleven o clock Captain Vignolles would ask a few fellows to meet him and they would have just a little rubber of whist Mountjoy knew well the nature of the man who asked him and understood perfectly what would be the result but there thrilled through his bosom as he accepted the invitation a sense of joy which he could himself hardly understand On the following morning Mountjoy was up for him very early and taking a return ticket went down to Buston He had written to mister Prosper sending his compliments and saying that he would do himself the honor of calling at a certain hour At the hour named he drew up at Buston Hall in a fly from Buntingford Station and was told by Matthew the old butler that his master was at home If Captain Mountjoy would step into the drawing room mister Prosper should be informed Mountjoy did as he was bidden and after half an hour he was joined by mister Prosper You have received a letter from my father he began by saying A very long letter said the Squire of Buston I dare say I did not see it and have in fact very little to say as to its contents I do not know indeed what they were The letter refers to my nephew mister Henry Annesley I suppose so What I have to say refers to mister Henry Annesley also You are kind very kind I don t know about that but I have come altogether at my father s instance and I think indeed that in fairness I ought to tell you the truth as to what took place between me and your nephew You are very good but your father has already given me his account and I suppose yours I don t know what my father may have done but I think that you ought to desire to hear from my lips an account of the transaction An untrue account has been told to you I have heard it all from your own brother An untrue account has been told to you I attacked your nephew What made you do that asked the squire That has nothing to do with it but I did I understood all that before But you didn t understand that mister Annesley behaved perfectly well in all that occurred Did he tell a lie about it afterward My brother no doubt lured him on to make an untrue statement A lie You may call it so if you will If you think that Augustus was to have it all his own way I disagree with you altogether In point of fact your nephew behaved through the whole of that matter as well as a man could do Practically he told no lie at all He did just what a man ought to do and anything that you have heard to the contrary is calumnious and false As I am told that you have been led by my brother s statement to disinherit your nephew I have done nothing of the kind I am very glad to hear it He has not at any rate deserved it and I have felt it to be my duty to come and tell you Then Mountjoy retired not without hospitality having been coldly offered by mister Prosper and went back to Buntingford and to London Now at last would come he said to himself through the whole afternoon now at last would come a repetition of those joys for which his very soul had sighed so eagerly CHAPTER XLII CAPTAIN VIGNOLLES ENTERTAINS HIS FRIENDS

8033-104515-0004	train-other-500	simply as a piece of prey whom chance had thrown up on the shore And Moody who would no doubt show himself before long was another bird of the same covey though less rapacious Mountjoy put his hand up
8033-104515-0005	train-other-500	to his breast pocket and knew that the fifty pounds was there but he knew also that it would soon be gone Even to him it seemed to be expedient to get up and at once to go What delight would there be
8033-104515-0006	train-other-500	to him in playing piquet with such a face opposite to him as that of Captain Vignolles
none	none	 or with such a one as that of old Moody There could be none of the brilliance of the room 
8033-104515-0007	train-other-500	no pleasant hum of the voices of companions no sense of his own equality with others There would be none to sympathize with him when he cursed his ill luck there would be no chance of contending with an innocent
8033-104515-0008	train-other-500	who would be as reckless as was he himself He looked round The room was gloomy and uncomfortable
none	none	 Captain Vignolles watched him 
8033-104515-0009	train-other-500	and was afraid that his prey was about to escape Won t you light a cigar Mountjoy took the cigar and then felt that he could not go quite at once I suppose you went to Monaco I was there for a short time
8033-104515-0010	train-other-500	Monaco isn t bad though there is of course the pull which the tables have against you But it s a grand thing to think that skill can be of no avail
none	none	 I often think that I ought to play nothing but rouge et noir You 
8033-104515-0011	train-other-500	Yes I I don t deny that I m the luckiest fellow going but I never can remember cards Of course I know my trade Every fellow knows his trade and I m up pretty nearly in all that the books tell you That s a great deal
8033-104515-0012	train-other-500	Not when you come to play with men who know what play is Look at Grossengrannel I d sooner bet on him than any man in London Grossengrannel never forgets a card I ll bet a hundred pounds that he knows the best card
8033-104515-0013	train-other-500	in every suit throughout the entire day s play That s his secret He gives his mind to it which I can t Hang it I m always thinking of something quite different of what I m going to eat
none	none	 or that sort of thing Grossengrannel is always looking at the cards and he wins the odd rubber out of every eleven by his attention Shall we have a game of piquet Now on the moment in spite of all that he had felt during the entire day 
8033-104515-0014	train-other-500	in the teeth of all his longings in opposition to all his thirst Mountjoy for a minute or two did think that he could rise and go His father was about to put him on his legs again if only he would abstain
none	none	 But Vignolles had the card table open with clean packs and chairs at the corners before he could decide What is it to be Twos on the game I suppose But Mountjoy would not play piquet He named ecarte 
8033-104515-0015	train-other-500	and asked that it might be only ten shillings a game
none	none	 It was many months now since he had played a game of ecarte 
8033-104515-0016	train-other-500	Oh hang it said Vignolles still holding the pack in his hands When thus appealed to Mountjoy relented and agreed
none	none	 that a pound should be staked on each game When they had played seven games Vignolles had won but one pound and expressed an opinion that that kind of thing wouldn t suit them at all School girls would do better he said Then Mountjoy pushed back his chair as though to go when the door opened and Major Moody entered the room Now we ll have a rubber at dummy said Captain Vignolles Major Moody was a gray headed old man of about sixty 
8033-104515-0017	train-other-500	who played his cards with great attention and never spoke a word either then or at any other period of his life He was the most taciturn of men and was known not at all to any of his companions It was rumored of him
8033-104515-0018	train-other-500	that he had a wife at home whom he kept in moderate comfort on his winnings It seemed to be the sole desire of his heart to play with reckless foolish young men who up to a certain point did not care what they lost
none	none	 He was popular as being always ready to oblige every one and as was frequently said of him was the very soul of honor He certainly got no amusement from the play working at it very hard and very constantly No one ever saw him anywhere but at the club At eight o clock he went home to dinner let us hope to the wife of his bosom 
8033-104515-0019	train-other-500	and at eleven he returned and remained as long as there were men to play with A tedious and unsatisfactory life he had and it would have been well for him could his friends have procured on his behoof the comparative ease
none	none	 of a stool in a counting house But as no such Elysium was opened to him the major went on accepting the smaller profits and the harder work of club life In what regiment he had been a major no one knew 
8033-104515-0020	train-other-500	or cared to inquire He had been received as Major Moody for twenty years or more and twenty years is surely time enough to settle a man s claim to a majority without reference to the Army List How are you Major Moody asked Mountjoy
none	none	 Not much to boast of I hope you re pretty well Captain Scarborough Beyond that there was no word of salutation and no reference to Mountjoy s wonderful absence What s it to be twos and tens said Captain Vignolles 
8033-104515-0021	train-other-500	arranging the cards and the chairs Not for me said Mountjoy who seemed to have been enveloped by a most unusual prudence What are you afraid you who used to fear neither man nor devil
none	none	 There is so much in not being accustomed to it said Mountjoy I haven t played a game of whist since I don t knew when Twos and tens is heavy against dummy said Major Moody I ll take dummy if you like it said Vignolles Moody only looked at him We ll each have our own dummy of course said Mountjoy Just as you please said Vignolles 
8033-104515-0022	train-other-500	I m host here and of course will give way to anything you may propose What s it to be Scarborough Pounds and fives I shan t play higher than that
none	none	 There came across Mountjoy s mind 
8033-104515-0023	train-other-500	as he stated the stakes for which he consented to play a remembrance that in the old days he had always been called Captain Scarborough by this man who now left out the captain Of course he had fallen since that
8033-104515-0024	train-other-500	fallen very low He ought to feel obliged to any man who had in the old days been a member of the same club with him who would now greet him with the familiarity of his unadorned name But the remembrance of the old sounds came back upon his ear
none	none	 and the consciousness that before his father s treatment of him 
8033-104515-0025	train-other-500	he had been known to the world at large as Captain Scarborough of Tretton Well well pounds and fives said Vignolles
none	none	 It s better than pottering away at ecarte at a pound a game Of course a man could win something if the games were to run all one way 
8033-104515-0026	train-other-500	but where they alternate so quickly it amounts to nothing You ve got the first dummy Scarborough
none	none	 Where will you sit Which cards will you take 
8033-104515-0027	train-other-500	I do believe that at whist everything depends upon the cards or else on the hinges I ve known eleven rubbers running to follow the hinges People laugh at me because I believe in luck I speak as I find it that s all
8033-104515-0028	train-other-500	You ve turned up an honor already When a man begins with an honor he ll always go on with honors that s my observation I know you re pretty good at this game Moody so I ll leave it to you to arrange the play and will follow up as well as I can
8033-104515-0029	train-other-500	You lead up to the weak of course This was not said till the card was out of his partner s hand But when your adversary has got ace king queen in his own hand there is no weak Well we ve saved that
none	none	 and it s as much as we can expect If I d begun by leading a trump it would have been all over with us Won t you light a cigar Moody I never smoke at cards That s all very well for the club but you might relax a little here Scarborough will take another cigar 
8033-104515-0030	train-other-500	But even Mountjoy was too prudent He did not take the cigar but he did win the rubber You re in for a good thing to night I feel as certain of it as though the money were in your pocket Mountjoy though he would not smoke did drink
none	none	 What would they have asked Vignolles There was champagne and whiskey and brandy He was afraid there was no other wine He opened a bottle of champagne and Mountjoy took the tumbler that was filled for him He always drank whiskey and water himself so he said and filled for himself a glass in which he poured a very small allowance of alcohol Major Moody 
8033-104515-0031	train-other-500	asked for barley water As there was none he contented himself with sipping Apollinaris A close record of the events of that evening would make but a tedious tale for readers Mountjoy of course lost his fifty pounds Alas
none	none	 he lost much more than his fifty pounds The old spirit soon came upon him and the remembrance of what his father was to do for him passed away from him and all thoughts of his adversaries who and what they were 
8033-104515-0032	train-other-500	The major pertinaciously refused to increase his stakes and worse again refused to play for anything but ready money It s a kind of thing I never do You may think me very odd but it s a kind of thing I never do
none	none	 It was the longest speech he made through the entire evening Vignolles reminded him 
8033-104515-0033	train-other-500	that he did in fact play on credit at the club The committee look to that
none	none	 he murmured and shook his head 
8033-104515-0034	train-other-500	Then Vignolles offered again to take the dummy so that there should be no necessity for Moody and Scarborough to play against each other and offered to give one point every other rubber as the price to be paid for the advantage But Moody
none	none	 whose success for the night was assured by the thirty pounds which he had in his pocket would come to no terms You mean to say you re going to break us up said Vignolles 
8033-104515-0035	train-other-500	That ll be hard on Scarborough I ll go on for money said the immovable major I suppose you won t have it out with me at double dummy said Vignolles to his victim But double dummy is a terrible grind at this time of night
none	none	 And he pushed all the cards up together 
8033-104515-0036	train-other-500	so as to show that the amusement for the night was over He too saw the difficulty which Moody so pertinaciously avoided He had been told wondrous things of the old squire s intentions toward his eldest son but he had been told them
none	none	 only by that eldest son himself No doubt he could go on winning Unless in the teeth of a most obstinate run of cards he would be sure to win against Scarborough s apparent forgetfulness of all rules and ignorance of the peculiarities of the game he was playing 
8033-104515-0037	train-other-500	But he would more probably obtain payment of the two hundred and thirty pounds now due to him that or nearly that than of a larger sum He already had in his possession the other twenty pounds which poor Mountjoy had brought with him
none	none	 So he let the victim go Moody went first and Vignolles then demanded the performance of a small ceremony Just put your name to that said Vignolles 
8033-104515-0038	train-other-500	It was a written promise to pay to Captain Vignolles the exact sum of two hundred and twenty seven pounds on or before that day week You ll be punctual won t you Of course I ll be punctual said Mountjoy scowling Well yes no doubt
8033-104515-0039	train-other-500	But there have been mistakes I tell you you ll be paid Why the devil did you win it of me if you doubt it I saw you just roaming about and I meant to be good natured You know as well as any man what chances you should run
8033-104515-0040	train-other-500	and when to hold your hand If you tell me about mistakes I shall make it personal I didn t say anything Scarborough that ought to be taken up in that way Hang your Scarborough
none	none	 When one gentleman talks another about mistakes he means something 
8033-104515-0041	train-other-500	Then he smashed down his hat upon his head and left the room
none	none	 Vignolles emptied the bottle of champagne 
8033-104515-0042	train-other-500	in which one glass was left and sat himself down with the document in his hand Just the same fellow he said to himself overbearing reckless pig headed and a bully He d lose the Bank of England if he had it But then he don t pay
8033-104515-0043	train-other-500	He hasn t a scruple about that If I lose I have to pay By Jove yes Never didn t pay a shilling I lost in my life It s deuced hard when a fellow is on the square like that to make two ends meet when he comes across defaulters Those fellows should be hung
none	none	 They re the very scum of the earth Talk of welchers They re worse than any welcher 
8033-104515-0044	train-other-500	Welcher is a thing you needn t have to do with if you re careful But when a fellow turns round upon you as a defaulter at cards there is no getting rid of him
none	none	 Where the play is all straightforward and honorable a defaulter when he shows himself ought to be well nigh murdered Such were Captain Vignolles s plaints to himself 
8033-104515-0045	train-other-500	as he sat there looking at the suspicious document which Mountjoy had left in his hands To him it was a fact that he had been cruelly used in having such a bit of paper thrust upon him instead of being paid by a check
8033-104515-0046	train-other-500	which on the morning would be honored And as he thought of his own career his ready money payments his obedience to certain rules of the game rules I mean against cheating
8033-104515-0047	train-other-500	as he thought of his hands which in his own estimation were beautifully clean his diligence in his profession which to him was honorable his hard work his late hours his devotion to a task which was often tedious
8033-104515-0048	train-other-500	his many periods of heart rending loss which when they occurred would drive him nearly mad his small customary gains
none	none	 his inability to put by anything for old age of the narrow edge by which he himself was occasionally divided from defalcation he spoke to himself of himself as of an honest hard working professional man upon whom the world was peculiarly hard But Major Moody went home to his wife quite content with the thirty pounds which he had won CHAPTER XLIII mister PROSPER IS VISITED BY HIS LAWYERS mister Prosper had not been in good spirits at the time at which Mountjoy Scarborough had visited him He had received some time previously a letter from mister Grey as described in a previous chapter and had also known exactly what proposal had been made by mister Grey to Messrs Soames Simpson An equal division of the lady s income one half to go to the lady herself and the other half to mister Prosper with an annuity of two hundred and fifty pounds out of the estate for the lady if mister Prosper should die first these were the terms which had been offered to Miss Thoroughbung with the object of inducing her to become the wife of mister Prosper But to these terms Miss Thoroughbung had declined to accede and had gone about the arrangement of her money matters in a most precise and business like manner A third of her income she would give up since mister Prosper desired it but more than that she would owe it to herself and her friends to decline to abandon The payment for the fish and the champagne must be omitted from any agreement on her part As to the ponies and their harness and the pony carriage she would supply them The ponies and the carriage would be indispensable to her happiness But the maintenance of the ponies must be left to mister Prosper As for the dower she could not consent to accept less than four hundred or five hundred if no house was to be provided She thought that seven hundred and fifty would be little enough if there were no children as in that case there was no heir for whom mister Prosper was especially anxious But as there probably would be children Miss Thoroughbung thought that this was a matter to which mister Prosper would not give much consideration Throughout it all she maintained a beautiful equanimity and made two or three efforts to induce mister Prosper to repeat his visit to Marmaduke Lodge She herself wrote to him saying that she thought it odd that considering their near alliance he should not come and see her Once she said that she had heard that he was ill and offered to go to Buston Hall to visit him All this was extremely distressing to a gentleman of mister Prosper s delicate feelings As to the proposals in regard to money the letters from Soames Simpson to Grey Barry all of which came down to Buston Hall seemed to be innumerable With Soames Simpson mister Prosper declined to have any personal communication But every letter from the Buntingford attorneys was accompanied by a farther letter from the London attorneys till the correspondence became insupportable mister Prosper was not strong enough to stick firmly to his guns as planted for him by Messrs Grey Barry He did give way in some matters and hence arose renewed letters which nearly drove him mad Messrs Soames Simpson s client was willing to accept four hundred pounds as the amount of the dower without reference to the house and to this mister Prosper yielded He did not much care about any heir as yet unborn and felt by no means so certain in regard to children as did the lady But he fought hard about the ponies He could not undertake that his wife should have ponies That must be left to him as master of the house He thought that a pair of carriage horses for her use would be sufficient He had always kept a carriage and intended to do so She might bring her ponies if she pleased but if he thought well to part with them he would sell them He found himself getting deeper and deeper into the quagmire till he began to doubt whether he should be able to extricate himself unmarried if he were anxious to do so And all the while there came affectionate little notes from Miss Thoroughbung asking after his health and recommending him what to take till he entertained serious thoughts of going to Cairo for the winter Then mister Barry came down to see him after Mountjoy had made his visit It was now January and the bargaining about the marriage had gone on for more than two months The letter which he had received from the Squire of Tretton had moved him but he had told himself that the property was his own and that he had a right to enjoy it as he liked best Whatever might have been Harry s faults in regard to that midnight affair it had certainly been true that he had declined to hear the sermons mister Prosper did not exactly mention the sermons to himself but there was present to him a feeling that his heir had been wilfully disobedient and the sermons no doubt had been the cause When he had read the old squire s letter he did not as yet wish to forgive his nephew He was becoming very tired of his courtship but in his estimation the wife would be better than the nephew Though he had been much put out by the precocity of that embrace there was nevertheless a sweetness about it which lingered on his lips Then Mountjoy had come down and he had answered Mountjoy very stoutly A lie he had exclaimed Did he tell a lie he had asked as though all must be over with a young man who had once allowed himself to depart from the rigid truth Mountjoy had made what excuse he could but mister Prosper had been very stern On the very day after Mountjoy s coming mister Barry came His visit had been arranged and mister Prosper was with great care prepared to encounter him He was wrapped in his best dressing gown and Matthew had shaved him with the greatest care The girls over at the parsonage declared that their uncle had sent into Buntingford for a special pot of pomatum The story was told to Joe Thoroughbung in order that it might be passed on to his aunt and no doubt it did travel as it was intended But Miss Thoroughbung cared nothing for the pomatum with which the lawyer from London was to be received It would be very hard to laugh her out of her lover while the title deeds to Buston held good But mister Prosper had felt that it would be necessary to look his best so that his marriage might be justified in the eyes of the lawyer mister Barry was shown into the book room at Buston in which mister Prosper was seated ready to receive him The two gentlemen had never before met each other and mister Prosper did no doubt assume something of the manner of an aristocratic owner of land He would not have done so had mister Grey come in his partner s place But there was a humility about mister Barry on an occasion such as the present which justified a little pride on the part of the client I am sorry to give you the trouble to come down mister Barry he said I hope the servant has shown you your room I shall be back in London to day mister Prosper thank you I must see these lawyers here and when I have received your final instructions I will return to Buntingford Then mister Prosper pressed him much to stay He had quite expected he said that mister Barry would have done him the pleasure of remaining at any rate one night at Buston But mister Barry settled the question by saying that he had not brought a dress coat mister Prosper did not care to sit down to dinner with guests who did not bring their dress coats And now continued mister Barry what final instructions are we to give to Soames Simpson I don t think much of Messrs Soames Simpson I believe they have the name of being honest practitioners I dare say I do not in the least doubt it But they are people to whom I am not at all desirous of intrusting my own private affairs Messrs Soames Simpson have not I think a large county business I had no idea that Miss Thoroughbung would have put this affair into their hands Just so mister Prosper But I suppose it was necessary for her to employ somebody There has been a good deal of correspondence Indeed there has mister Barry It has not been our fault mister Prosper Now what we have got to decide is this What are the final terms which you mean to propose I think sir the time has come when some final terms should be suggested Just so Final terms must be what you call the very last That is when they have once been offered you must must Just stick to them mister Prosper Exactly mister Barry That is what I intend There is nothing I dislike so much as this haggling about money especially with a lady Miss Thoroughbung is a lady for whom I have the highest possible esteem That s of course For whom I repeat I have the highest possible esteem But she has friends who have their own ideas as to money The brewery in Buntingford belongs to them and they are very worthy people I should explain to you mister Barry as you are my confidential adviser that were I about to form a matrimonial alliance in the heyday of my youth I should probably not have thought of connecting myself with the Thoroughbungs As I have said before they are most respectable people but they do not exactly belong to that class in which I should under those circumstances have looked for a wife I might probably have ventured to ask for the hand of the daughter of some county family But years have slipped by me and now wishing in middle life to procure for myself the comfort of wedded happiness I have looked about and have found no one more likely to give it me than Miss Thoroughbung Her temper is excellent and her person pleasing mister Prosper as he said this thought of the kiss which had been bestowed upon him Her wit is vivacious and I think that upon the whole she will be desirable as a companion She will not come to this house empty handed but of her pecuniary affairs you already know so much that I need perhaps tell you nothing farther But though I am exceedingly desirous to make this lady my wife and am I may say warmly attached to her there are certain points which I cannot sacrifice Now about the ponies I think I understand about the ponies She may bring them on trial I m not to be bound to keep any ponies at all There are a pair of carriage horses which must suffice On second thoughts she had better not bring the ponies This decision had at last come from some little doubt on his mind as to whether he was treating Harry justly And four hundred pounds is the sum fixed on for her jointure She is to have her own money for her own life said mister Prosper That s a matter of course Don t you think that under these circumstances four hundred will be quite enough Quite enough if you ask me But we must decide Four hundred it shall be And she is to have two thirds of her own money for her own expenses during your life asked mister Barry I don t see why she should want six hundred a year for herself I don t indeed I am afraid it will only lead to extravagance Barry assumed a look of despair Of course as I have said so I will not go back from my word She shall have two thirds But about the ponies my mind is quite made up There shall be no ponies at Buston I hope you understand that mister Barry mister Barry said that he did understand it well and then folding up his papers prepared to go congratulating himself that he would not have to pass a long evening at Buston Hall But before he went and when he had already put on his great coat in the hall mister Prosper called him back to ask him one farther question and for that purpose he shut the door carefully and uttered his words in a whisper Did mister Barry know anything of the life and recent adventures of mister Henry Annesley mister Barry knew nothing but he thought that his partner mister Grey knew something He had heard mister Grey mention the name of mister Henry Annesley Then as he stood there enveloped in his great coat with his horse standing in the cold mister Prosper told him much of the story of Harry Annesley and asked him to induce mister Grey to write and tell him what he thought of Harry s conduct CHAPTER XLIV mister PROSPER S TROUBLES As mister Prosper sunk into his arm chair after the fatigue of the interview with his lawyer he reflected that when all was considered Harry Annesley was an ungrateful pig it was thus he called him and that Miss Thoroughbung had many attractions Miss Thoroughbung had probably done well to kiss him though the enterprise had not been without its peculiar dangers He often thought of it when alone and as distance lent enchantment to the view he longed to have the experiment repeated Perhaps she had been right And it would be a good thing certainly to have dear little children of his own Miss Thoroughbung felt very certain on the subject and it would be foolish for him to doubt Then he thought of the difference between a pretty fair haired little boy and that ungrateful pig Harry Annesley He told himself that he was very fond of children The girls over at the parsonage would not have said so but they probably did not know his character When Harry had come back with his fellowship his uncle had for a few weeks been very proud of him had declared that he should never be called upon to earn his bread and had allowed him two hundred and fifty pounds a year to begin with but no return had been made to this favor Harry had walked in and out of the Hall as though it had already belonged to him as many a father delights to see his eldest son doing But the uncle in this instance had not taken any delight in seeing it An uncle is different from a father an uncle who has never had a child of his own He wanted deference what he would have called respect while Harry was at first prepared to give him a familiar affection based on equality on an equality in money matters and worldly interests though I fear that Harry allowed to be seen his own intellectual superiority mister Prosper though an ignorant man and by no means clever was not such a fool as not to see all this Then had come the persistent refusal to hear the sermons and mister Prosper had sorrowfully declared to himself that his heir was not the young man that he should have been He did not then think of marrying nor did he stop the allowance but he did feel that his heir was not what he should have been But then the terrible disgrace of that night in London had occurred and his eyes had been altogether opened by that excellent young man mister Augustus Scarborough then he began to look about him Then dim ideas of the charms and immediate wealth of Miss Thoroughbung flitted before his eyes and he told himself again and again of the prospects and undoubted good birth of Miss Puffle Miss Puffle had disgraced herself and therefore he had thrown Buston Hall at the feet of Miss Thoroughbung But now he had heard stories about that excellent young man Augustus Scarborough which had shaken his faith He had been able to exclaim indignantly that Harry Annesley had told a lie A lie He had been surprised to find that a young man who had lived so much in the fashionable world as Captain Scarborough had cared nothing for this And as Miss Thoroughbung became more and more exacting in regard to money he thought himself less and less of the lie It might be well that Harry should ultimately have the property though he should never again be taken into favor and there should be no farther question of the allowance As Miss Thoroughbung reiterated her demands for the ponies he began to feel that the acres of Buston would not be disgraced forever by the telling of that lie But the sermons remained and he would never willingly again see his nephew As he turned all this in his mind the idea of spending what was left of the winter at Cairo returned to him He would go to Cairo for the winter and to the Italian lakes for the spring and to Switzerland for the summer Then he might return to Cairo At the present moment Buston Hall and the neighborhood of Buntingford had few charms for him He was afraid that Miss Thoroughbung would not give way about the ponies and against the ponies he was resolved He was sitting in this state with a map before him and with the squire s letter upon the map when Matthew the butler opened the door and announced a visitor As soon as mister Barry had gone he had supported nature by a mutton chop and a glass of sherry and the debris were now lying on the side table His first idea was to bid Matthew at once remove the glass and the bone and the unfinished potato and the crust of bread To be taken with such remnants by any visitor would be bad but by this visitor would be dreadful Lunch should be eaten in the dining room where chop bones and dirty glasses would be in their place But here in his book room they would be disgraceful But then as Matthew was hurriedly collecting the two plates and the salt cellar his master began to doubt whether this visitor should be received at all It was no other than Miss Thoroughbung mister Prosper in order to excuse his slackness in calling on the lady had let it be known that he was not quite well and Miss Thoroughbung had responded to this move by offering her services as nurse to her lover He had then written to herself that though he had been a little unwell suffering from a cold in the chest to which at this inclement season of the year it was peculiarly liable he was not in need of anything beyond a little personal attention and would not trouble her for those services for the offer of which he was bound to be peculiarly grateful Thus he had thought to keep Miss Thoroughbung at a distance but here she was with those hated ponies at his very door Matthew he said making a confidant in the distress of the moment of his butler I don t think I can see her You must sir indeed you must Must Well yes I m afraid so Considering all things the matrimonial prospects and the rest of it I think you must sir She hasn t a right to come here you know as yet It will be understood that mister Prosper was considerably discomposed when he spoke with such familiar confidence to his servant She needn t come in here at any rate In the drawing room if I might be allowed to suggest sir Show Miss Thoroughbung into the drawing room said he with all his dignity Then Matthew retired and the Squire of Buston felt that five minutes might be allowed to collect himself and the mutton chop bone need not be removed When the five minutes were over with slow steps he walked across the intervening billiard room and slowly opened the drawing room door Would she rush into his arms and kiss him again as he entered He sincerely hoped that there would be no such attempt but if there were he was sternly resolved to repudiate it There should be nothing of the kind till she had clearly declared and had put it under writing by herself and her lawyers that she would consent to come to Buston without the ponies But there was no such attempt How do you do mister Prosper she said in a loud voice standing up in the middle of the room Why don t you ever come and see me I take it very ill of you and so does Miss Tickle There is no one more partial to you than Miss Tickle We were talking of you only last night over a despatched crab that we had for supper Did they have despatched crabs for supper every night thought mister Prosper to himself It was certainly a strong reason against his marriage I told her that you had a cold in your head In my chest said mister Prosper meekly Bother colds said Miss Tickle When people are keeping company together they ought to see each other Those were Miss Tickle s very words That it should be said of him mister Prosper of Buston that he was keeping company with any woman He almost resolved on the spur of the moment that under no circumstances could he now marry Miss Thoroughbung But unfortunately his offer had been made and the terms of the settlement as suggested by himself placed in the hands of his lawyer If Miss Thoroughbung chose to hold him to his offer he must marry her It was not that he feared an action for breach of promise but that as a gentleman it would behoove him to be true to his word He need not however marry Miss Tickle He had offered no terms in respect to Miss Tickle With great presence of mind he resolved at once that Miss Tickle should never find a permanent resting place for her foot at Buston Hall I am extremely indebted to Miss Tickle said he Why haven t you come over just to have a little chat in a friendly way It s all because of those stupid lawyers I suppose What need you and I care for the lawyers They can do their work without troubling us except that they will be sure to send in their bills fast enough I have had mister Barry from the firm of Messrs Grey Barry of Lincoln s Inn with me this morning I know you have I saw the little man at Soames Simpson s and drove out here immediately after five minutes conversation Now mister Prosper you must let me have those ponies That was the very thing which he was determined not to do The ponies grew in imagination and became enormous horses capable of consuming any amount of oats mister Prosper was not of a stingy nature but he had already perceived that his escape if it were effected must be made good by means of those ponies A steady old pair of carriage horses had been kept by him and by his father before him and he was not going to be driven out of the old family ways by a brewer s daughter And he had but that morning instructed his lawyer to stand out against the ponies He felt that this was the moment for firmness Now this instant he must be staunch or he would be saddled with this woman and with Miss Tickle for the whole of his life She had left him no time for consideration but had come upon him as soon almost as the words spoken to the lawyer had been out of his mouth But he would be firm Miss Thoroughbung opened out instantly about the ponies and he at once resolved that he would be firm But was it not very indelicate on her part to come to him and to press him in this manner He began to hope that she also would be firm about the ponies and that in this way the separation might be effected At the present moment he stood dumb Silence would not in this case be considered as giving consent Now like a good man do say that I shall have the ponies she continued I can keep em out of my own money you know if that s all He perceived at once that the offer amounted to a certain yielding on her part but he was no longer anxious that she should give way Do ee now say yes like a dear old boy She came closer to him and took hold of his arm as though she were going to perform that other ceremony But he was fully aware of the danger If there came to be kissing between them it would be impossible for him to go back afterward in such a manner but that the blame of the kiss should rest with him When he should desire to be off he could not plead that the kissing had been all her doing A man in mister Prosper s position has difficulties among which he must be very wary And then the ridicule of the world is so strong a weapon and is always used on the side of the women He gave a little start but he did not at once shake her off What s the objection to the ponies dear Two pair of horses It s more than we ought to keep He should not have said we He felt when it was too late that he should not have said we They aren t horses It s the same as far as the stables are concerned But there s room enough Lord bless you I ve been in to look I can assure you that doctor Stubbs says they are required for my health You ask him else It s just what I m up to is driving I ve only taken to them lately and I cannot bring myself to give em up Do ee love You re not going to throw over your own Matilda for a couple of little beasts like that Every word that came out of her mouth was an offence But he could not tell her so nor could he reject her on that score He should have thought beforehand what kind of words might probably come out of her mouth Was her name Matilda Of course he knew the fact Had any one asked him he could have said with two minutes consideration that her name was Matilda But it had never become familiar to his ears and now she spoke of it as though he had called her Matilda since their earliest youth And to be called Love It might be very nice when he had first called her Love a dozen times but now it sounded extravagant and almost indelicate And he was about to throw her over for a couple of little beasts He felt that that was his intention and he blushed because it was so He was a true gentleman who would not willingly depart from his word If he must go on with the ponies he must But he had never yet yielded about the ponies He felt now that they were his only hope But as the difficulties of his position pressed upon him the sweat stood out upon his brow She saw it all and understood it all and deliberately determined to take advantage of his weakness I don t think that there is anything else astray between us We ve settled about the jointure four hundred a year It s too little Soames Simpson say but I m soft and in love you know Here she leered at him and he began to hate her You oughtn t to want a third of my income you know But you re to be lord and master and you must have your own way All that s settled There is Miss Tickle he said in a voice that was almost cadaverous Miss Tickle is of course to come You said that from the very first moment when you made the offer Never Oh Peter how can you say so He shrunk visibly from the sound of his own Christian name But she determined to persevere The time must come when she should call him Peter and why not commence the practice now at once Lovers always do call each other Peter and Matilda She wasn t going to stand any nonsense and if he intended to marry her and use a large proportion of her fortune Peter he should be to her You did Peter You know you told me how much attached you were to her I didn t say anything about her coming with you Oh Peter how can you be so cruel Do you mean to say that you will deprive me of the friend of my youth At any rate there shall never be a pony come into my yard He knew when he made this assertion that he was abandoning his objection to Miss Tickle She had called him cruel and his conscience told him that if he received Miss Thoroughbung and refused admission to Miss Tickle he would be cruel Miss Tickle for aught that he knew might have been a friend of her youth At any rate they had been constant companions for many years Therefore as he had another solid ground on which to stand he could afford to yield as to Miss Tickle But as he did so he remembered that Miss Tickle had accused him of keeping company and he declared to himself that it would be impossible to live in the same house with her But Miss Tickle may come said Miss Thoroughbung Was the solid ground the rock as he believed it to be of the ponies about to sink beneath his feet Say that Miss Tickle may come I should be nothing without Miss Tickle You cannot be so hard hearted as that I don t see what is the good of talking about Miss Tickle till we have come to some settlement about the ponies You say that you must have the ponies To tell you the truth Miss Thoroughbung I don t like any such word as must And a good many things have occurred to me What kind of things deary I think you are inclined to be gay Me gay While I am sober and perhaps a little grave in my manners of life I am thinking only of domestic happiness while your mind is intent upon social circles I fear that you would look for your bliss abroad In France or Germany When I say abroad I mean out of your own house There is perhaps some discrepancy of taste of which I ought earlier to have taken cognizance Nothing of the kind said Miss Thoroughbung I am quite content to live at home and do not want to go abroad either to France nor yet to any other English county I should never ask for anything unless it be for a single month in London Here was a ground upon which he perhaps could make his stand Quite impossible said mister Prosper Or for a fortnight said Miss Thoroughbung I never go up to London except on business But I might go alone you know with Miss Tickle I shouldn t want to drag you away I have always been in the habit of having a few weeks in London about the Exhibition time I shouldn t wish to be left by my wife Of course we could manage all that We re not to settle every little thing beforehand and put it into the deeds A precious sum we should have to pay the lawyers It s as well we should understand each other I think it pretty nearly is all settled that has to go into the deeds I thought I d just run over after seeing mister Barry and give the final touch If you ll give way dear about Miss Tickle and the ponies I ll yield in everything else Nothing surely can be fairer than that He knew that he was playing the hypocrite and he knew also that it did not become him as a gentleman to be false to a woman He was aware that from minute to minute and almost from word to word he was becoming ever more and more averse to this match which he had proposed to himself And he knew that in honesty he ought to tell her that it was so It was not honest in him to endeavor to get rid of her by a side blow as it were And yet this was the attempt which he had hitherto been making But how was he to tell her the truth Even mister Barry had not understood the state of his mind Indeed his mind had altered since he had seen mister Barry He had heard within the last half hour many words spoken by Miss Thoroughbung which proved that she was altogether unfit to be his wife It was a dreadful misfortune that he should have rushed into such peril but was he not bound as a gentleman to tell her the truth Say that I shall have Jemima Tickle The added horrors of the Christian name operated upon him with additional force Was he to be doomed to have the word Jemima hallooed about his rooms and staircases for the rest of his life And she had given up the ponies and was taking her stand upon Miss Tickle as to whom at last he would be bound to give way He could see now that he should have demanded her whole income and have allowed her little or no jointure That would have been grasping monstrous altogether impracticable but it would not have been ungentleman like This chaffering about little things was altogether at variance with his tastes and it would be futile He must summon courage to tell her that he no longer wished for the match but he could not do it on this morning Then for that morning some benign god preserved him Matthew came into the room and whispered into his ear that a gentleman wished to see him What gentleman Matthew again whispered that it was his brother in law Show him in said mister Prosper with a sudden courage He had not seen mister Annesley since the day of his actual quarrel with Harry I shall have the ponies said Miss Thoroughbung during the moment that was allowed to her We are interrupted now I am afraid that the rest of this interview must be postponed It should never be renewed though he might have to leave the country forever Of that he gave himself assurance Then the parson was shown into the room The constrained introduction was very painful to mister Prosper but was not at all disagreeable to the lady mister Annesley knows me very well We are quite old friends Joe is going to marry his eldest girl I hope Molly is quite well The rector said that Molly was quite well When he had come away from home just now he had left Joe at the parsonage You ll find him there a deal oftener than at the brewery said Miss Thoroughbung You know what we re going to do mister Annesley There are no fools like old fools A thunder black cloud came across mister Prosper s face That this woman should dare to call him an old fool We were discussing a few of our future arrangements We ve arranged everything about money in the most amicable manner and now there is merely a question of a pair of ponies We need not trouble mister Annesley about that I think And Miss Tickle I m sure the rector will agree with me that old friends like me and Miss Tickle ought not to be separated And it isn t as though there was any dislike between them because he has already said that he finds Miss Tickle charming D Miss Tickle he said whereupon the rector looked astonished and Miss Thoroughbung jumped a foot from off the ground I beg the lady s pardon said mister Prosper piteously and yours Miss Thoroughbung and yours mister Annesley It was as though a new revelation of character had been given No one except Matthew had ever heard the Squire of Buston swear And with Matthew the cursings had been by no means frequent and had been addressed generally to some article of his clothing or to some morsel of food prepared with less than the usual care But now the oath had been directed against a female and the chosen friend of his betrothed And it had been uttered in the presence of a clergyman his brother in law and the rector of his parish mister Prosper felt that he was disgraced forever Could he have overheard them laughing over his ebullition in the drawing room half an hour afterward and almost praising his violence some part of the pain might have been removed As it was he felt at the time that he was disgraced forever We will return to the subject when next we meet said Miss Thoroughbung I am very sorry that I should so far have forgotten myself said mister Prosper but It does not signify not as far as I am concerned and she made a little motion to the clergyman half bow and half courtesy mister Annesley bowed in return as though declaring that neither did it signify very much as far as he was concerned Then she left the room and Matthew handed her into the carriage when she took the ponies in hand with quite as much composure as though her friend had not been sworn at Upon my word sir said Prosper as soon as the door was shut I beg your pardon But I was so moved by certain things which have occurred that I was carried much beyond my usual habits Don t mention it It is peculiarly distressing to me that I should have been induced to forget myself in the presence of a clergyman of the parish and my brother in law But I must beg you to forget it Oh certainly I will tell you now why I have come over I can assure you that such is not my habit continued mister Prosper who was thinking much more of the unaccustomed oath which he had sworn than of his brother in law s visit strange as it was No one as a rule is more guarded in his expressions than I am How it should have come to pass that I was so stirred I can hardly tell But Miss Thoroughbung had said certain words which had moved me very much She had called him Peter and deary and had spoken of him as keeping company with her All these disgusting terms of endearment he could not repeat to his brother in law but felt it necessary to allude to them I trust that you may be happy with her when she is your wife I can t say I really don t know It s a very important step to take at my age and I m not quite sure that I should be doing wisely It s not too late said mister Annesley I don t know I can t quite say Then mister Prosper drew himself up remembering that it would not become him to discuss the matter of his marriage with the father of his heir I have come over here said mister Annesley to say a few words about Harry mister Prosper again drew himself up Of course you re aware that Harry is at present living with us Here mister Prosper bowed Of course in his altered circumstances it will not do that he shall be idle and yet he does not like to take a final step without letting you know what it is Here mister Prosper bowed twice There is a gentleman of fortune going out to the United States on a mission which will probably occupy him for three or four years I am not exactly warranted in mentioning his name but he has taken in hand a political project of much importance Again mister Prosper bowed Now he has offered Harry the place of private secretary on condition that Harry will undertake to stay the entire term He is to have a salary of three hundred a year and his travelling expenses will of course be paid for him If he goes poor boy he will in all probability remain in his new home and become a citizen of the United States Under these circumstances I have thought it best to step up and tell you in a friendly manner what his plans are Then he had told his tale and mister Prosper again bowed The rector had been very crafty There was no doubt about the wealthy gentleman with the American project and the salary had been offered But in other respects there had been some exaggeration It was well known to the rector that mister Prosper regarded America and all her institutions with a religious hatred An American was to him an ignorant impudent foul mouthed fraudulent creature to have any acquaintance with whom was a disgrace Could he have had his way he would have reconstituted the United States as British Colonies at a moment s notice Were he to die without having begotten another heir Buston must become the property of Harry Annesley and it would be dreadful to him to think that Buston should be owned by an American citizen The salary offered is too good to be abandoned said mister Annesley when he saw the effect which his story had produced Everything is going against me exclaimed mister Prosper Well I will not talk about that I did not come here to discuss Harry or his sins nor for the matter of that his virtues But I felt it would be improper to let him go upon his journey without communicating with you So saying he took his departure and walked back to the rectory CHAPTER XLV A DETERMINED YOUNG LADY When this offer had been made to Harry Annesley he found it to be absolutely necessary that he should write a farther letter to Florence He was quite aware that he had been forbidden to write He had written one letter since that order had been given to him and no reply had come to him He had not expected a reply but still her silence had been grievous to him It might be that she was angry with him really angry But let that be as it might he could not go to America and be absent for so long a period without telling her She and her mother were still at Brussels when January came missus Mountjoy had gone there as he had understood for a month and was still at the embassy when three months had passed I think I shall stay here the winter missus Mountjoy had said to Sir Magnus but we will take lodgings I see that very nice sets of apartments are to be let But Sir Magnus would not hear of this He said and said truly that the ministerial house was large and at last he declared the honest truth His sister in law had been very kind to him about money and had said not a word on that troubled subject since her arrival missus Mountjoy with that delicacy which still belongs to some English ladies would have suffered extreme poverty rather than have spoken on such a matter In truth she suffered nothing and hardly thought about it But Sir Magnus was grateful and told her that if she went to look for lodgings he should go to the lodgings and say that they were not wanted Therefore missus Mountjoy remained where she was entertaining a feeling of increased good will toward Sir Magnus Life went on rather sadly with Florence Anderson was as good as his word He pleaded his own cause no farther telling both Sir Magnus and Lady Mountjoy of the pledge he had made He did in fact tell two or three other persons regarding himself as a martyr to chivalry All this time he went about his business looking very wretched But though he did not speak for himself he could not hinder others from speaking for him Sir Magnus took occasion to say a word on the subject once daily to his niece Her mother was constant in her attacks But Lady Mountjoy was the severest of the three and was accounted by Florence as her bitterest enemy The words which passed between them were not the most affectionate in the world Lady Mountjoy would call her miss to which Florence would reply by addressing her aunt as my lady Why do you call me my lady It isn t usual in common conversation Why do you call me miss If you cease to call me miss I ll cease to call you my lady But no reverence was paid by the girl to the wife of the British Minister It was this that Lady Mountjoy specially felt as she complained to her companion Miss Abbott Then another cause for trouble sprang up during the winter of which mention must be made farther on The result was that Florence was instant with her mother to take her back to England We will return however to Harry Annesley and give the letter verbatim which he wrote to Florence DEAR FLORENCE I wonder whether you ever think of me or ever remember that I exist I know you do I cannot have been forgotten like that And you yourself are the truest girl that ever owned to loving a man But there comes a chill across my heart when I think how long it is since I wrote to you and that I have not had a line even to acknowledge my letter You bade me not to write and you have not even forgiven me for disobeying your order I cannot but get stupid ideas into my mind which one word from you would dissipate Now however I must write again order or no order Between a man and a woman circumstanced as you and I things will arise which make it incumbent on one or the other to write It is absolutely necessary that you should now know what are my intentions and understand the reasons which have actuated me I have found myself left in a most unfortunate condition by my uncle s folly He is going on with a stupid marriage for the purpose of disinheriting me and has in the mean time stopped the allowance which he had made me since I left college Of course I have no absolute claim on him But I cannot understand how he can reconcile himself to do so when he himself prevented my going to the Bar saying that it would be unnecessary But so it is I am driven to look about for myself It is very hard at my time of life to find an opening in any profession I think I told you before that I had ideas of going to Cambridge and endeavoring to get pupils trusting to my fellowship rather than to my acquirements But this I have always looked upon with great dislike and would only have taken to it if nothing else was to be had Now there has come forward an old college acquaintance a man who is three or four years my senior who has offered to take me to America as his private secretary He proposes to remain there for three years I of course shall not bind myself to stay as long but I may not improbably do so He is to pay my expenses and to give me a salary of three hundred a year This will perhaps lead to nothing else but will for the present be better than nothing I am to start in just a month from the present time Now you know it all except that the man s name is Sir William Crook He is a decent sort of a fellow and has got a wife who is to go with him He is the hardest working man I know but between you and me will never set the Thames on fire If the Thames is to be illumined at all I rather think that I shall be expected to do it Now my own one what am I to say about you and of myself as your husband that is to be Will you wait at any rate for three years with the conviction that the three years will too probably end in your having to wait again I do feel that in my altered position I ought to give you back your troth and tell you that things shall be as they used to be before that happy night at missus Armitage s party I do not know but that it is clearly my duty I almost think that it is But I am sure of this that it is the one thing in the world that I cannot do I don t think that a man ought to be asked to tear himself altogether in pieces because some one has ill treated him At any rate I cannot If you say that it must be so you shall say it I don t suppose it will kill me but it will go a long way In writing so far I have not said a word of love because as far as I understand you that is a subject on which you expect me to be silent When you order me not to write I suppose you intend that I am to write no love letters This therefore you will take simply as a matter of business and as such I suppose you will acknowledge it In this way I shall at any rate see your handwriting Yours affectionately HARRY ANNESLEY Harry when he had written this letter considered that it had been cold calm and philosophical He could not go to America for three years without telling her of his purpose nor could he mention that purpose as he thought in any language less glowing But Florence when she received it did not regard it in the same light To her thinking the letter was full of love and of love expressed in the warmest possible language Sir William Crook she said to herself What can he want of Harry in America for three years I am sure he is a stupid man Will I wait Of course I will wait What are three years And why should I not wait But for the matter of that Then thoughts came into her mind which even to herself she could not express in words Sir William Crook had got a wife and why should not Harry take a wife also She did not see why a private secretary should not be a married man and as for money there would be plenty for such a style of life as they would live She could not exactly propose this but she thought that if she were to see Harry just for one short interview before he started that he might probably then propose it himself Things be as they used to be she exclaimed to herself Never Things cannot be as they used to be I know what is his duty It is his duty not to think of anything of the kind Remember that he exists she said turning back to the earlier words of the letter That of course is his joke I wonder whether he knows that every moment of my life is devoted to him Of course I bade him not to write But I can tell him now that I have never gone to bed without his letter beneath my pillow This and much more of the same kind was uttered in soliloquies but need not be repeated at length to the reader But she had to think what steps she must first take She must tell her mother of Harry s intention She had never for an instant allowed her mother to think that her affection had dwindled or her purpose failed her She was engaged to marry Harry Annesley and marry him some day she would That her mother should be sure of that was the immediate purpose of her life And in carrying out that purpose she must acquaint her mother with the news which this letter had brought to her Mamma I have got something to tell you Well my dear Harry Annesley is going to America There was something pleasing to missus Mountjoy in the sound of these words If Harry Annesley went to America he might be drowned or it might more probably be that he would never come back America was to her imagination a long way off Lovers did not go to America except with the intention of deserting their ladyloves Such were her ideas She felt at the moment that Florence would be more easily approached in reference either to her cousin Mountjoy or to mister Anderson Another lover had sprung up too in Brussels of whom a word shall be said by and by If her Harry the pernicious Harry should have taken himself to America the chances of all these three gentlemen would be improved Any one of them would now be accepted by missus Mountjoy as a bar fatal to Harry Annesley Mountjoy was again the favorite with her She had heard that he had returned to Tretton and was living amicably with his father She knew even of the income allotted to him for the present of the six hundred pounds a year and had told Florence that as a preliminary income it was more than double that two hundred and fifty pounds which had been taken away from Harry taken away never to be restored There was not much in this argument but still she thought well to use it The captain was living with his father and she did not believe a word about the entail having been done away with It was certain that Harry s uncle had quarrelled with him and she did understand that a baby at Buston would altogether rob Harry of his chance And then look at the difference in the properties It was thus that she argued the matter But in truth her word had been pledged to Mountjoy Scarborough and Mountjoy Scarborough had ever been a favorite with her Though she could talk about the money it was not the money that touched her feelings Well he may go to America It is a dreadful destiny for a young man but in his case it may be the best thing that he can do Of course he intends to come back again That is as it may be I do not understand what you mean by a dreadful destiny mamma I don t see that it is a destiny at all He is getting a very good offer for a year or two and thinks it best to take it I might go with him for that matter A thunder bolt had fallen at missus Mountjoy s feet Florence go with him to America Among all the trials which had come upon her with reference to this young man there had been nothing so bad as this proposal Go with him The young man was to start in a month Then she began to think whether it would be within her power to stop her daughter What would all the world be to her with one daughter and she in America married to Harry Annesley Her quarrel with Florence was not at all as was the quarrel of Lady Mountjoy Lady Mountjoy would be glad to get rid of the girl whom she thought to be impertinent and believed to be false But to her mother Florence was the very apple of her eye It was because she thought that Mountjoy Scarborough was a grand fellow and because she thought all manner of evil of Harry Annesley that she wished Florence to marry her cousin and to separate herself forever from the other When she had heard that Harry was to go to America she had rejoiced as though he was to be transported to Botany Bay Her ideas were old fashioned But when it was hinted that Florence was to go with him she nearly fell to the ground Florence certainly had behaved badly in making the suggestion She had not intended to make it had not in truth thought of it But when her mother talked of Harry s destiny as though some terrible evil had come upon him as though she were speaking of a poor wretch condemned to be hanged when all chances of a reprieve were over then her spirit rose within her She had not meant to say that she was going Harry had never asked her to go If you talk of his destiny I am quite prepared to share it with him That was her meaning But her mother already saw her only child in the hands of those American savages She threw herself on to a sofa buried her face in her hands and burst into tears I don t say that I am going mamma My darling my dearest my child Only that there is no reason why I shouldn t except that it would not suit him At least I suppose it would not Has he said so He has said nothing about it Thank Heaven for that He does not intend to rob me of my child But mamma I am to be his wife No no no It is that that I want to make you understand You know nothing of his character nothing I do know that he told a base falsehood Nothing of the kind I will not admit it It is of no use going into that again but there was nothing base about it He has got an appointment in the United States and is going out to do the work He has not asked me to go with him The two things would probably not be compatible Here missus Mountjoy rose from the sofa and embraced her child as though liberated from her deepest grief But mamma you must remember this that I have given him my word and will never be induced to abandon it Here her mother threw up her hands and again began to weep Either to day or to morrow or ten years hence if he will wait as long I will we shall be married As far as I can see we need not wait ten years or perhaps more than one or two My money will suffice for us He proposes to live upon you He proposes nothing of the kind He is going to America because he will not propose it Nor am I proposing it just at present At any rate I am glad of that And now mamma you must take me back home as soon as possible When he has started No mamma I must be there before he starts I cannot let him go without seeing him If I am to remain here here he must come Your uncle would never receive him I should receive him This was dreadful this flying into actual disobedience Whatever did she mean Where was she to receive him How could you receive a young man in opposition to the wishes and indeed to the commands of all your friends I m not going to be at all shamefaced about it mamma I am the woman he has selected to be his wife and he is the man I have selected to be my husband If he were coming I should go to my uncle and ask to have him received Think of your aunt Yes I do think of her My aunt would make herself very disagreeable Upon the whole mamma I think it would be best that you should take me back to England There is this M Grascour here who is a great trouble and you may be sure of this that I intend to see Harry Annesley before he starts for America So the interview was ended but missus Mountjoy was left greatly in doubt as to what she might best do She felt sure that were Annesley to come to Brussels Florence would see him would see him in spite of all that her uncle and aunt and mister Anderson and M Grascour could do to prevent it That reprobate young man would force his way into the embassy or Florence would force her way out In either case there would be a terrible scene But if she were to take Florence back to Cheltenham interviews to any extent would be arranged for her at the house of missus Armitage As she thought of all this the idea came across her that when a young girl is determined to be married nothing can prevent it Florence in the mean time wrote an immediate answer to her lover as follows DEAR HARRY Of course you were entitled to write when there was something to be said which it was necessary that I should know When you have simply to say that you love me I know that well enough without any farther telling Go to America for three years It is very very serious But of course you must know best and I shall not attempt to interfere What are three years to you and me If we were rich people of course we should not wait but as we are poor of course we must act as do other people who are poor I have about four hundred a year and it is for you to say how far that may be sufficient If you think so you will not find that I shall want more But there is one thing necessary before you start I must see you There is no reason on earth for our remaining here except that mamma has not made up her mind If she will consent to go back before you start it will be best so Otherwise you must take the trouble to come here where I am afraid you will not be received as a welcome guest I have told mamma that if I cannot see you here in a manner that is becoming I shall go out and meet you in the streets in a manner that is unbecoming Your affectionate wife that is to be FLORENCE MOUNTJOY This letter she took to her mother and read aloud to her in her own room missus Mountjoy could only implore that it might not be sent but prevailed not at all There is not a word in it about love said Florence It is simply a matter of business and as such I must send it I do not suppose my uncle will go to the length of attempting to lock me up He would I think find it difficult to do so There was a look in Florence s face as she said this which altogether silenced her mother She did not think that Sir Magnus would consent to lock Florence up and she did think that were he to attempt to do so he would find the task very difficult CHAPTER XLVI M GRASCOUR M Grascour was a Belgian about forty years old who looked as though he were no more than thirty except that his hair was in patches beginning to be a little gray He was in the government service of his country well educated and thoroughly a gentleman As is the case with many Belgians he would have been taken to be an Englishman were his country not known He had dressed himself in English mirrors living mostly with the English He spoke English so well that he would only be known to be a foreigner by the correctness of his language He was a man of singularly good temper and there was running through all that he did somewhat of a chivalric spirit which came from study rather than nature He had looked into things and seen whether they were good or at any rate popular and endeavored to grasp and to make his own whatever he found to be so He was hitherto unmarried and was regarded generally by his friends as a non marrying man But Florence Mountjoy was powerful over him and he set to work to make her his wife He was intimate at the house of Sir Magnus and saw no doubt that Anderson was doing the same thing But he saw also that Anderson did not succeed He had told himself from the first that if Anderson did succeed he would not wish to do so The girl who would be satisfied with Anderson would hardly content him He remained therefore quiet till he saw that Anderson had failed The young man at once took to an altered mode of life which was sufficiently marked He went like Sir Proteus ungartered Everything about him had of late demonstrated a careless desolation All this M Grascour observed and when he saw it he felt that his own time had come He took occasion at first to wait upon Lady Mountjoy He believed that to be the proper way of going to work He was very intimate with the Mountjoys and was aware that his circumstances were known to them There was no reason on the score of money why he should not marry the niece of Sir Magnus He had already shown some attention to Florence which though it had excited no suspicion in her mind had been seen and understood by her aunt and it had been understood also by mister Anderson That accursed Belgian If after all she should take up with him I shall tell her a bit of my mind if anything of that kind should occur My niece M Grascour Yes my lady M Grascour had not quite got over the way of calling Lady Mountjoy my lady It is presumption I know Not at all I have not spoken to her Nor would I do so till I had first addressed myself to you or to her mother May I speak to missus Mountjoy Oh certainly I do not in the least know what the young lady s ideas are She has been much admired here and elsewhere and that may have turned her head I think not You may be the better judge M Grascour I think that Miss Mountjoy s head has not been turned by any admiration She does not appear to be a young lady whose head would easily be turned It is her heart of which I am thinking The interview ended by Lady Mountjoy passing the Belgian lover on to missus Mountjoy Florence said missus Mountjoy Yes missus Mountjoy I have the great honor of asking your permission I am well known to Sir Magnus and Lady Mountjoy and they can tell what are my circumstances I am forty years of age Oh yes everything is I am sure quite as it should be But my daughter thinks about these things for herself Then there was a pause and M Grascour was about to leave the room having obtained the permission he desired when missus Mountjoy thought it well to acquaint him with something of her daughter s condition I ought to tell you that my daughter has been engaged Indeed Yes and I hardly know how to explain the circumstances I should say that she had been promised to her cousin Captain Scarborough but to this she will not give her assent She has since met a gentleman mister Annesley for whom she professes an attachment Neither can I nor can her uncle and aunt hear of mister Annesley as a husband for Florence She is therefore at present disengaged If you can gain her affections you have my leave With this permission M Grascour departed professing himself to be contented He did not see Florence for two or three days no doubt leaving the matter to be discussed with her by her mother and her aunt To him it was quite indifferent what might be the fate of Captain Scarborough or of mister Annesley or indeed of mister Anderson And to tell the truth he was not under any violent fear or hope as to his own fate He admired Miss Mountjoy and thought it would be well to secure for a wife such a girl with such a fortune as would belong to her But he did not intend to go ungartered nor yet to assume an air of desolation If she would come to him it would be well if she would not why it would still be well The only outward difference made by his love was that he brushed his clothes and his hair a little more carefully and had his boots brought to a higher state of polish than was usual Her mother spoke to her first My dear M Grascour is a most excellent man I am sure he is mamma And he is a great friend to your uncle and Lady Mountjoy Why do you say this mamma What can it matter to me My dear M Grascour wishes you to to to become his wife Oh mamma why didn t you tell him that it is impossible How was I to know my dear Mamma I am engaged to marry Harry Annesley and no word shall ever turn me from that purpose unless it be spoken by himself The crier may say that all round the town if he wishes You must know that it is so What can be the use of sending M Grascour or any other gentleman to me It is only giving me pain and him too I wish mamma you could be got to understand this But missus Mountjoy could not altogether be got as yet to understand the obstinacy of her daughter s character There was one point on which Florence received information from these two suitors who had come to her at Brussels They were both favored one after the other by her mother and would not have been so favored had her mother absolutely believed in Captain Mountjoy It seemed to her as though her mother would be willing that she should marry any one so long as it was not Harry Annesley It is a pity that there should be such a difference she said to herself But we will see what firmness can do Then Lady Mountjoy spoke to her You have heard of M Grascour my dear Yes I have heard of him aunt He intends to do you the honor of asking you to be his wife So mamma tells me I have only to say that he is a man most highly esteemed here He is well known at the court and is at the royal parties Should you become his wife you would have all the society of Brussels at your feet All the society of Brussels would do no good Perhaps not Nor the court and the royal parties If you choose to be impertinent when I tell you what are his advantages and condition in life I cannot help it I do not mean to be impertinent What you say about the royal parties and the court is intended for impertinence knowing as you do know your uncle s position Not at all You know my position I am engaged to marry another man and cannot therefore marry M Grascour Why should he be sent to me except that you won t believe me when I tell you that I am engaged Then she marched out of the room and considered within her own bosom what answer she would give to this new Belgian suitor She was made perfectly aware when the Belgian suitor was about to arrive On the day but one after the interview with her aunt she was left alone when the other ladies went out and suspected that even the footmen knew what was to happen when M Grascour was shown into the drawing room There was a simple mode of dealing with the matter on his part very different from that state of agitation into which Harry had been thrown when he had made his proposition She was quite prepared to admit that M Grascour s plan might be the wisest but Harry s manner had been full of real love and had charmed her M Grascour was not in the least flustered whereas poor Harry had been hardly able to speak his mind But it had not mattered much whether Harry spoke his mind or not whereas all the eloquence in the world could have done no good for M Grascour Florence had known that Harry did love her whereas of M Grascour she only knew that he wanted to make her his wife Miss Mountjoy he said I am charmed to find you here Allow me to add that I am charmed to find you alone Florence who knew all about it only bowed She had to go through it and thought that she would be able to do so with equanimity I do not know whether your aunt or your mother have done me the honor of mentioning my name to you They have both spoken to me I thought it best that they should have the opportunity of doing so In our country these things are arranged chiefly by the lady s friends With your people I know it is different Perhaps it is much better that it should be so in a matter in which the heart has to be concerned It would come to the same thing with me I must decide for myself I am sure of it May I venture to feel a hope that ultimately that decision may not go against me M Grascour as he said this did throw some look of passion into his face But I have spoken nothing as yet of my own feelings It is unnecessary This might be taken in either one of two senses but the gentleman was not sufficiently vain to think that the lady had intended to signify to him that she would accept his love as a thing of which she could have no doubt Ah Miss Mountjoy he continued if you would allow me to say that since you have been at Brussels not a day has passed in which mingled love and respect have not grown within my bosom I have sat by and watched while my excellent young friend mister Anderson has endeavored to express his feelings I have said to myself that I would bide my time If you could give yourself to him why then the aspiration should be quenched within my own breast But you have not done so though as I am aware he has been assisted by my friend Sir Magnus I have seen and have heard and have said to myself at last Now too my turn may come I have loved much but I have been very patient Can it be that my turn should have come at last Though he had spoken of mister Anderson he had not thought it expedient to say a word either of Captain Scarborough or of mister Annesley He knew quite as much of them as he did of mister Anderson He was clever and had put together with absolute correctness what missus Mountjoy had told him with other little facts which had reached his ears M Grascour I suppose I am very much obliged to you I ought to be Here he bowed his head But my only way of being grateful is to tell you the truth Again he bowed his head I am in love with another man That s the truth Here he shook his head with the smallest possible shake as though deprecating her love but not doing so with any harshness I engaged to marry him too There was another shake of the head somewhat more powerful And I intend to marry him This she said with much bold assurance All my old friends know that it is so and ought not to have sent you to me I have given a promise to Harry Annesley and Harry Annesley alone can make me depart from it This she said in a low voice but almost with violence because there had come another shake of the head in reply to her assurance that she meant to marry Annesley And though he were to make me depart from it which he will never do I should be just the same as regards anybody else Can t you understand that when a girl has given herself heart and soul to a man she won t change Girls do change sometimes You may know them I don t not girls that are worth anything But when all your friends are hostile What can they do They can t make me marry another person They may hinder my happiness but they can t hand me over like a parcel of goods to any one else Do you mean to say that you would accept such a parcel Oh yes such a parcel You would accept a girl who would come to you telling you that she loved another man I don t believe it of you I should know that my tenderness would beget tenderness in you It wouldn t do anything of the kind It would be all horror horror I should kill myself or else you or perhaps both Is your aversion so strong No not at all not at present I like you very much I do indeed I d do anything for you in the way of friendship I believe you to be a real gentleman But you would kill me You make me talk of a condition of things which is quite quite impossible When I say that I like you I am talking of the present condition of things I have not the least desire to kill you or myself or anybody I want to be taken back to England and there to be allowed to marry mister Henry Annesley That s what I want But I intend to remain engaged to him That s my purpose and no man and no woman shall stir me from it He smiled and again shook his head and she began to doubt whether she did like him so much Now I ve told you all about myself she said rising to her feet You may believe me or not as you please but as I have believed you I have told you all Then she walked out of the room M Grascour as soon as he was alone left the room and the house and making his way into the park walked round it twice turning in his mind his success and his want of success For in truth he was not at all dispirited by what had occurred With her other Belgian lover that is with mister Anderson Florence had at any rate succeeded in making the truth appear to be the truth He did believe that she had taken such a fancy to that fellow Harry Annesley that there would be no overcoming it He had got a glimpse into the firmness of her character which was denied to M Grascour M Grascour as he walked up and down the shady paths of the park told himself that such events as this so called love on the part of Florence were very common in the lives of English young ladies They are the best in the world he said to himself and they make the most charming wives but their education is such that there is no preventing these accidents The passion displayed in the young lady s words he attributed solely to her power of expression One girl would use language such as had been hers and such a girl would be clever eloquent and brave another girl would hum and haw with half a yes and a quarter of a no and would mean just the same thing He did not doubt but that she had engaged herself to Harry Annesley nor did he doubt that she had been brought to Brussels to break off that engagement and he thought it most probable that her friends would prevail Under these circumstances why should he despair or why rather as he was a man not given to despair should he not think that there was for him a reasonable chance of success He must show himself to be devoted true and not easily repressed She had used he did not doubt the same sort of language in silencing Anderson mister Anderson had accepted her words but he knew too well the value of words coming from a young lady s mouth to take them at their true meaning He had at this interview affected a certain amount of intimacy with Florence of which he thought that he appreciated the value She had told him that she would kill him of course in joke and a joke from a girl on such an occasion was worth much No Belgian girl would have joked But then he was anxious to marry Florence because Florence was English Therefore when he went back to his own home he directed that the system of the high polish should be continued with his boots I don t suppose he will come again Florence had said to her mother misunderstanding the character of her latest lover quite as widely as he misunderstood hers But M Grascour though he did not absolutely renew his offer at once gave it to be understood that he did not at all withdraw from the contest He obtained permission from Lady Mountjoy to be constantly at the Embassy and succeeded even in obtaining a promise of support from Sir Magnus You re quite up a tree Sir Magnus had said to his Secretary of Legation It s clear she won t look at you I have pledged myself to abstain said poor Anderson in a tone which seemed to confess that all chance was over with him I suppose she must marry some one and I don t see why Grascour should not have as good a chance as another Anderson had stalked away brooding over the injustice of his position and declaring to himself that this Belgian should never be allowed to marry Florence Mountjoy in peace But M Grascour continued his attentions and this it was which had induced Florence to tell her mother that the Belgian was a great trouble which ought to be avoided by a return to England CHAPTER XLVII FLORENCE BIDS FAREWELL TO HER LOVERS Mamma had you not better take me back to Cheltenham at once Has that unfortunate young man written to you Yes The young man whom you call unfortunate has written Of course I cannot agree to have him so called And to tell the truth I don t think he is so very unfortunate He has got a girl who really loves him and that I think is a step to happiness Every word of this was said by Florence as though with the purpose of provoking her mother and so did missus Mountjoy feel it But behind this purpose there was that other fixed resolution to get Harry at last accepted as her husband and perhaps the means taken were the best missus Mountjoy was already beginning to feel that there would be nothing for her but to give up the battle and to open her motherly arms to Harry Annesley Sir Magnus had told her that M Grascour would probably prevail M Grascour was said to be exactly the man likely to be effective with such a girl as Florence That had been the last opinion expressed by Sir Magnus But missus Mountjoy had found no comfort in it Florence was going to have her own way Her mother knew that it was so and was very unhappy But she was still anxious to continue a weak ineffective battle It was very impertinent of him writing she said When he was going to America for years Dear mamma do put yourself in my place How was it possible that he should not write A young man has no business to come and insinuate himself into a family in that way and then when he knows he is not welcome to open a correspondence But mamma he knows that he is welcome If he had gone to America without writing to me Oh it would have been impossible I should have gone after him No no never I am quite in earnest mamma But it is no good talking about what could not have taken place We ought to have prevented you from receiving or sending letters Here missus Mountjoy touched on a subject on which the practice of the English world has been much altered during the last thirty or forty years perhaps we may say fifty or sixty years Fifty years ago young ladies were certainly not allowed to receive letters as they chose and to write them and to demand that this practice should be carried on without any supervision from their elder friends It is now usually the case that they do so A young lady before she falls into a correspondence with a young man is expected to let it be understood that she does so But she does not expect that his letters either coming or going shall be subject to any espial and she generally feels that the option of obeying or disobeying the instructions given to her rests with herself Practically the use of the post office is in her own hands And as this spirit of self conduct has grown up the morals and habits of our young ladies have certainly not deteriorated In America they carry latch keys and walk about with young gentlemen as young gentlemen walk about with each other In America the young ladies are as well behaved as with us as well behaved as they are in some Continental countries in which they are still watched close till they are given up as brides to husbands with whom they have had no means of becoming acquainted Whether the latch key system or that of free correspondence may not rob the flowers of some of that delicate aroma which we used to appreciate may be a question but then it is also a question whether there does not come something in place of it which in the long run is found to be more valuable Florence when this remark was made as to her own power of sending and receiving letters remained silent but looked very firm She thought that it would have been difficult to silence her after this fashion Sir Magnus could have done it at any rate if I had not been able Sir Magnus could have done nothing I think which would not have been within your power But it is useless talking of this Will you not take me back to England so as to prevent the necessity of Harry coming here Why should he come Because mamma I intend to see my future husband before he goes from me for so great a distance and for so long a time Don t you feel any pity for me mamma Do you feel pity for me Because one day you wish me to marry my cousin Scarborough and the next mister Anderson and then the next M Grascour How can I pity you for that It is all done because you have taken it in your head to think ill of one whom I believe to be especially worthy You began by disliking him because he interfered with your plans about Mountjoy I never would have married my cousin Mountjoy He is not to my taste and he is a gambler But you have thought that you could do what you liked with me It has always been for your own happiness But I must be the judge of that How could I be happy with any of these men seeing that I do not care for them in the least It would be utterly impossible for me to have myself married to either of them To Harry Annesley I have given myself altogether but you because you are my mother are able to keep us apart Do you not pity me for the sorrow and trouble which I must suffer I suppose a mother always pities the sufferings of a child And removes them when she can do so But now mamma is he to come here or will you take me back to England This was a question which missus Mountjoy found it very difficult to answer On the spur of the moment she could not answer it as it would be necessary that she should first consult Sir Magnus Could Sir Magnus undertake to confine her daughter within the precincts of the Embassy and to exclude the lover during such time as Harry Annesley night remain in Brussels As she thought of the matter in her own room she conceived that there would be a great difficulty All the world of Brussels would become aware of what was going on The young lady would endeavor to get out and could only be constrained by the company operation of the servants and the young gentleman in his endeavors to get in could only be prevented by the assistance of the police Dim ideas presented themselves to her mind of farther travel But wherever she went there would be a post office and she was aware that the young man could pursue her much quicker than she could fly How good it would be that in such an emergency she might have the privilege of locking her daughter up in some convent And yet it must be a Protestant convent as all things savoring of the Roman Catholic religion were abhorrent to her Altogether as she thought of her own condition and that of her daughter she felt that the world was sadly out of joint Coming here is he said Sir Magnus Then he will just have to go back again as wise as he came But can you shut your doors against him Shut my doors Of course I can He ll never be able to get his nose in here if once an order has been given for his exclusion Who s mister Annesley I don t suppose he knows an Englishman in Brussels But she will go out to meet him What in the streets said Sir Magnus in horror I fear she would By George she must be a stiff necked one if she ll do that Then missus Mountjoy with tears in her eyes began to explain with very many epithets that her daughter was the best girl in all the world She was entirely worthy of confidence Those who knew her were aware that no better behaved young woman could exist She was conscientious religious and high principled But she ll go out in the streets and walk with a young man when all her friends tell her not Is that her idea of religion Then missus Mountjoy with some touch of anger in the tone of her voice said that she would return to England and carry her daughter with her What the deuce can I do Sarah when the young lady is so unruly I can give orders to have him shut out and can take care that they are obeyed but I cannot give orders to have her shut in I should be making her a prisoner and everybody would talk about it In that matter you must give her the orders only you say that she would not comply with them On the following day missus Mountjoy informed her daughter that they would go back to Cheltenham She did not name an immediate day because it would be well she thought to stave off the evil hour Nor did she name a distant day because were she to do so the terrible evil of Harry Annesley s arrival in Brussels would not be prevented At first she wished to name no day thinking that it would be a good thing to cross Harry on the road But here Florence was too strong for her and at last a day was fixed In a week s time they would take their departure and go home by slow stages With this arrangement Florence expressed herself well pleased and of course made Harry acquainted with the probable time of their arrival M Grascour when he heard that the day had been suddenly fixed for the departure of missus Mountjoy and her daughter not unnaturally conceived that he himself was the cause of the ladies departure Nor did he on that account resign all hope The young lady s mother was certainly on his side and he thought it quite possible that were he to appear in England he might be successful But when he had heard of her coming departure of course it was necessary that he should say some special farewell He dined one evening at the British Embassy and took an opportunity during the evening of finding himself alone with Florence And so Miss Florence he said you and your estimable mamma are about to return to England We have been here a very long time and are going home at last It seems to me but the other day when you came said M Grascour with all a lover s eagerness It was in autumn and the weather was quite mild and soft Now we are in the middle of January I suppose so But still the time has gone only too rapidly The heart can hardly take account of days and weeks As this was decidedly lover s talk and was made in terms which even a young lady cannot pretend to misunderstand Florence was obliged to answer it in some manner equally direct And now she was angry with him She had informed him that she was in love with another man In doing so she had done much more than the necessity of the case demanded and had told him as the best way of silencing him that which she might have been expected to keep as her own secret And yet here he was talking to her about his heart She made him no immediate answer but frowned at him and looked stern It was clear to her intelligence that he had no right to talk to her about his heart after the information she had given him I hope Miss Mountjoy that I may look forward to the pleasure of seeing you when I go over to England But we don t live in London or near it We live down in the country at Cheltenham Distance would be nothing This was very bad and must be stopped thought Florence I suppose I shall be married by that time I don t know where we may live but I shall be happy to see you if you call She had here made a bold assertion and one which M Grascour did not at all believe He was speaking of a visit which he might make perhaps in a month or six weeks and the young lady told him that he would find her married And yet as he knew very well her mother and her uncle and her aunt were all opposed to this marriage And she spoke of it without a blush without any reticence Young ladies were much emancipated but he did not think that they generally carried their emancipation so far as this I hope not that he said I don t know why you should be so ill natured as to hope it The fact is M Grascour you don t believe what I told you the other day Perhaps as a young lady I ought not to have alluded to it but I did so in order to set the matter at rest altogether Of course I can t tell when you may come If you come quite at once I shall not be married No not married But I shall be as much engaged as is possible for a girl to be I have given my word and nothing will make me false to it I don t suppose you will come on my account Solely on your account Then stay at home I am quite in earnest And now I must say good bye She departed and left him seated alone on the sofa He at first told himself that she was unfeminine There was a hard way with her of talking about herself which he almost pronounced to be unladylike An unmarried girl should he thought under no circumstances speak of the gentleman to whom her affections had been given as Miss Mountjoy spoke of mister Annesley But nevertheless he would sooner possess her as his own wife than any other girl he had ever met Something of the real passion of unsatisfied love made him feel chill at his heart Who was this Harry Annesley for whom she professed so warm a feeling Her mother declared Harry Annesley to be a scapegrace and something of the story of a discreditable midnight street quarrel between him and the young lady s cousin had reached his ears He did not suppose it to be possible that the young lady could actually get married without her mother s company operation and therefore he thought that he still would go to England In one respect he was altogether untouched If he could ultimately succeed in marrying the young lady she would not be a bit the worse as his wife because she had been attached to Harry Annesley That was a kind of folly which a girl could very quickly get over when she had not been allowed to have her own way Therefore upon the whole he thought that he would go to England But the parting with Anderson had also to be endured and must necessarily be more difficult She owed him a debt for having abstained and she could not go without paying the debt by some expression of gratitude That she would have done so had he kept aloof was a matter of course but equally a matter of course was it that he would not keep aloof I shall want to see you for just five minutes to morrow morning before you take your departure he said in a lugubrious voice during her last evening He had kept his promise to the very letter mooning about in his desolate manner very conspicuously The desolation had been notorious and very painful to Florence but the promise had been kept and she was grateful Oh certainly if you wish it she said I do wish it Then he made an appointment and she promised to keep it It was in the ball room a huge chamber very convenient for its intended purpose and always handsome at night time but looking as desolate in the morning as did poor Anderson himself He was stalking up and down the long room when she entered it and being at the farther end stalked up to her and addressed her with words which he had chosen for the purpose Miss Mountjoy he said you found me here a happy light hearted young man I hope I leave you soon to be the same in spite of this little accident He did not say that he was a blighted being because the word had he thought become ridiculous but he would have used it had he dared as expressing most accurately his condition A cloud has passed over me and its darkness will never be effaced It has certainly been your doing Oh mister Anderson what can I say I have loved before but never like this And so you will again Never When I declare that I expect my word to be respected He paused for an answer but what could she say She did not at all respect his word on such a subject but she did respect his conduct Yes I call upon you to believe me when I say that for me all that is over But it can be nothing to you It will be very much to me I shall go on in the same disconsolate miserable way I suppose I shall stay here because I shall be as well here as anywhere else I might move to Lisbon but what good would that do me Your image would follow me to whatever capital I might direct my steps But there is one thing you can do Here he brightened up putting on quite an altered face I will do anything mister Anderson in my power If if if you should change I shall never change she said with an angry look If you should change I think you should remember the promise you exacted and the fidelity with which it has been kept I do remember it And then I should be allowed to come again and have my chance Wherever I may be at the court of the Shah of Persia or at the Chinese capital I will instantly come I promised you when you asked me Will you not now promise me I cannot promise anything so impossible It will bind you to nothing but to let me know that mister Annesley has gone his way But she had to explain to him that it was impossible she should make any promise founded on the idea that mister Henry Annesley should ever go any way in which she would not accompany him With that he had to be as well satisfied as the circumstances of the case would admit and he left her with an assurance not intended to be quite audible that he was and ever should be a blighted individual When the carriage was at the door Sir Magnus came down into the hall full of smiles and good humor but at that moment Lady Mountjoy was saying a last word of farewell to her relatives in her own chamber Good bye my dear I hope you will get well through all your troubles This was addressed to missus Mountjoy And as for you my dear she said turning to Florence if you would only contrive to be a little less stiff necked I think the world would go easier with you I think my stiff neck aunt as you call it is what I have chiefly to depend upon I mean in reference to other advice than mamma s Good bye aunt Good bye Florence And the two parted hating each other as only female enemies can hate But Florence when she was in the carriage threw herself on to her mother s neck and kissed her CHAPTER XLVIII mister PROSPER CHANGES HIS MIND When Florence with her mother reached Cheltenham she found a letter lying for her which surprised her much The the letter was from Harry and seemed to have been written in better spirits than he had lately displayed But it was very short DEAREST FLORENCE When can I come down It is absolutely necessary that I should see you All my plans are likely to be changed in the most extraordinary manner Nobody can say that this is a love letter Yours affectionately H A Florence of course showed the letter to her mother who was much frightened by its contents What am I to say to him when he comes she exclaimed If you will be so very very good as to see him you must not say anything unkind Unkind How can I say anything else than what you would call unkind I disapprove of him altogether And he is coming here with the express object of taking you away from me Oh no not at once But at some day which I trust may be very distant How can I speak to him kindly when I feel that he is my enemy But the matter was at last set at rest by a promise from Florence that she would not marry her lover in less than three years without her mother s express consent Three years is a long time was missus Mountjoy s thought and many things might occur within that term Harry of whom she thought all manner of unnatural things might probably in that time have proved himself to be utterly unworthy And Mountjoy Scarborough might again have come forward in the light of the world She had heard of late that Mountjoy had been received once more into his father s full favor And the old man had become so enormously rich through the building of mills which had been going on at Tretton that as missus Mountjoy thought he would be able to make any number of elder sons On the subject of entail her ideas were misty but she felt sure that Mountjoy Scarborough would even yet become a rich man That Florence should be made to change on that account she did not expect But she did think that when she should have learned that Harry was a murderer or a midnight thief or a wicked conspirator she would give him up Therefore she agreed to receive him with not actually expressed hostility when he should call at Montpelier Place But now in the proper telling of our story we must go back to Harry Annesley himself It will be remembered that his father had called upon mister Prosper to inform him of Harry s projected journey to America that Mountjoy Scarborough had also called at Buston Hall and that previous to these two visits old mister Scarborough had himself written a long letter giving a detailed account of the conflict which had taken place in the London streets These three events had operated strongly on mister Prosper s mind but not so strongly as the conduct of Miss Thoroughbung and Messrs Soames Simpson It had been made evident to him from the joint usage which he had received from these persons that he was simply made use of with the object of obtaining from him the best possible establishment for the lady in question After that interview at which the lady having obtained in way of jointure much more than was due to her demanded also for Miss Tickle a life long home and for herself a pair of ponies he received a farther letter from the lawyers This offended him greatly Nothing on earth should induce him to write a line to Messrs Soames Simpson Nor did he see his way to writing again to Messrs Grey Barry about such trifles as those contained in the letter from the Buntingford lawyers Trifles to him they were not but trifles they must become if put into a letter addressed to a London firm Our client is anxious to know specifically that she is to be allowed to bring Miss Tickle with her when she removes to Buston Hall Her happiness depends greatly on the company of Miss Tickle to which she had been used now for many years Our client wishes to be assured also that she shall be allowed to keep a pair of ponies in addition to the carriage horses which will be maintained no doubt chiefly for your own purposes These were the demands as made by Messrs Soames Simpson and felt by mister Prosper to be altogether impossible He recollected the passionate explosion of wrath to which the name of Miss Tickle had already brought him in presence of the clergyman of his parish He would endure no farther disgrace on behalf of Miss Tickle Miss Tickle should never be an inmate of his house and as for the ponies no pony should ever be stabled in his stalls A pony was an animal which of its very nature was objectionable to him There was a want of dignity in a pony to which Buston Hall should never be subjected And also he said to himself at last there is a lack of dignity about Miss Thoroughbung herself which would do me an irreparable injury But how should he make known his decision to the lady herself and how should he escape from the marriage in such a manner as to leave no stain on his character as a gentleman If he could have offered her a sum of money he would have done so at once but that he thought would not be gentleman like and would be a confession on his own part that he had behaved wrongly At last he determined to take no notice of the lawyers letter and himself to write to Miss Thoroughbung telling her that the objects which they proposed to themselves by marriage were not compatible and that therefore their matrimonial intentions must be allowed to subside He thought it well over and felt assured that very much of the success of such a measure must depend upon the wording of the letter There need be no immediate haste Miss Thoroughbung would not come to Buston again quite at once to disturb him by a farther visit Before she would come he would have flown to Italy The letter must be courteous and somewhat tender but it must be absolutely decisive There must be no loop hole left by which she could again entangle him no crevice by which she could creep into Buston The letter should be a work of time He would give himself a week or ten days for composing it And then when it should have been sent he would be off to Italy But before he could allow himself to go upon his travels he must settle the question about his nephew which now lay heavy upon his conscience He did feel that he had ill treated the young man He had been so told in very strong language by mister Scarborough of Tretton and mister Scarborough of Tretton was a man of very large property and much talked about in the world Very wonderful things were said about mister Scarborough but they all tended to make mister Prosper believe that he was a man of distinction And he had also heard lately about mister Scarborough s younger son or indeed his only son according to the new way of speaking of him tidings which were not much in that young man s favor It was from Augustus Scarborough that he had heard those evil stories about his own nephew Therefore his belief was shaken and it was by no means clear to him that there could be any other heir for their property Miss Thoroughbung had proved herself to be altogether unfit for the high honor he had intended her Miss Puffle had gone off with Farmer Tazlehurst s son mister Prosper did not think that he had energy enough to look for a third lady who might be fit at all points to become his wife And now another evil had been added to all these His nephew had declared his purpose of emigrating to the United States and becoming an American It might be true that he should be driven to do so by absolute want He mister Prosper had stopped his allowance and had done so after deterring him from following any profession by which he might have earned his bread He had looked into the law and as far as he could understand it Buston must become the property of his nephew even though his nephew should become an American citizen His conscience pricked him sorely as he thought of the evil which might thus accrue and of the disgrace which would be attached to his own name He therefore wrote the following letter to his nephew and sent it across to the parsonage done up in a large envelope and sealed carefully with the Buston arms And on the corner of the envelope Peter Prosper was written very legibly MY DEAR NEPHEW HENRY ANNESLEY Under existing circumstances you will I think be surprised at a letter written in my handwriting but facts have arisen which make it expedient that I should address you You are about I am informed to proceed to the United States a country against which I acknowledge I entertain a serious antipathy They are not a gentlemanlike people and I am given to understand that they are generally dishonest in all their dealings Their President is a low person and all their ideas of government are pettifogging Their ladies I am told are very vulgar though I have never had the pleasure of knowing one of them They are an irreligious nation and have no respect for the Established Church of England and her bishops I should be very sorry that my heir should go among them With reference to my stopping the income which I have hitherto allowed you it was a step I took upon the best advice nor can I allow it to be thought that there is any legal claim upon me for a continuance of the payment But I am willing for the present to continue it on the full understanding that you at once give up your American project But there is a subject on which it is essentially necessary that I should receive from you as my heir a full and complete explanation Under what circumstances did you beat Captain Scarborough in the streets late on the night of the threed of June last And how did it come to pass that you left him bleeding speechless and motionless on that occasion As I am about to continue the payment of the sum hitherto allowed I think it only fitting that I should receive this explanation under your own hand I am your affectionate uncle PETER PROSPER P S A rumor may probably have reached you of a projected alliance between me and a young lady belonging to a family with which your sister is about to connect herself It is right that I should tell you that there is no truth in this report This letter which was much easier to write than the one intended for Miss Thoroughbung was unfortunately sent off a little before the completion of the other A day s interval had been intended But the missive to Miss Thoroughbung was under the press of difficulties delayed longer than was intended There was we grieve to say much of joy but more of laughter at the rectory when this letter was received As usual Joe Thoroughbung was there and it was found impossible to keep the letter from him The postscript burst upon them all as a surprise and was welcomed by no one with more vociferous joy than by the lady s nephew So there is an end forever to the hope that a child of the Buntingford Brewery should sit upon the throne of the Prospers It was thus that Joe expressed himself Why shouldn t he have sat there said Polly A Thoroughbung is as good as a Prosper any day But this was not said in the presence of missus Annesley who on that subject entertained views very different from her daughter I wonder what his idea is of the Church of England said mister Annesley Does he think that the Archbishop of Canterbury is supreme in all religious matters in America How on earth he knows that the women are all vulgar when he has never seen one of them is a mystery said Harry And that they are dishonest in all their dealings said Joe I suppose he got that out of some of the radical news papers For Joe after the manner of brewers was a staunch Tory And their President too is vulgar as well as the ladies said mister Annesley And this is the opinion of an educated Englishman who is not ashamed to own that he entertains serious antipathies against a whole nation But at the parsonage they soon returned to a more serious consideration of the matter Did Uncle Prosper intend to forgive the sinner altogether And was he coerced into doing so by a conviction that he had been told lies or by the uncommon difficulties which presented themselves to him in reference to another heir At any rate it was agreed by them all that Harry must meet his uncle half way and write the full and complete explanation as desired Bleeding speechless and motionless said Harry I can t deny that he was bleeding he certainly was speechless and for a few moments may have been motionless What am I to say But the letter was not a difficult one to write and was sent across on the same day to the Hall There mister Prosper gave up a day to its consideration a day which would have been much better devoted to applying the final touch to his own letter to Miss Thoroughbung And he found at last that his nephew s letter required no rejoinder But Harry had much to do It was first necessary that he should see his friend and explain to him that causes over which he had no control forbade him to go to America Of course you know I can t fly in my uncle s face I was going because he intended to disinherit me but he finds that more troublesome than letting me alone and therefore I must remain You see what he says about the Americans The gentleman whose opinion about our friends on the other side of the Atlantic was very different from mister Prosper s fell into a long argument on the subject But he was obliged at last to give up his companion Then came the necessity of explaining the change in all his plans to Florence Mountjoy and with this view he wrote the short letter given at the beginning of the chapter following it down in person to Cheltenham Mamma Harry is here said Florence to her mother Well my dear I did not bring him But what am I to say to him How can I tell Why do you ask me Of course he must come and see me said Florence He has sent a note to say that he will be here in ten minutes Oh dear oh dear exclaimed missus Mountjoy Do you mean to be present mamma That is what I want to know But that was the question which at the moment missus Mountjoy could not answer She had pledged herself not to be unkind on condition that no marriage should take place for three years But she could not begin by being kind as otherwise she would immediately have been pressed to abandon that very condition Perhaps mamma it would be less painful if you would not see him But he is not to make repeated visits No not at present I think not He must come only once said missus Mountjoy firmly He was to have come because he was going to America But now he has changed all his plans It isn t fair Florence What can I do I cannot send him to America because you thought he was to go there I thought so too and so did he I don t know what has changed him but it wasn t likely that he d write and say he wouldn t come because he had altered his plans Of course he wants to see me and so do I want to see him very much Here he is There was a ring at the bell and missus Mountjoy was driven to resolve what she would do at the moment You mustn t be above a quarter of an hour I won t have you together for above a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes at the farthest So saying missus Mountjoy escaped from the room and within a minute or two Florence found herself in Harry Annesley s arms The twenty minutes had become forty before Harry had thought of stirring although he had been admonished fully a dozen times that he must at that moment take his departure Then the maid knocked at the door and brought word that missus wanted to see Miss Florence in her bedroom Now Harry you must go You really shall go or I will I am very very happy to hear what you have told me But three years Unless mamma will agree It is quite out of the question I never heard of anything so absurd Then you must get mamma to consent I have promised her for three years and you ought to know that I will keep my word Harry I always keep my word do I not If she will consent I will Now sir I really must go Then there was a little form of farewell which need not be especially explained and Florence went up stairs to her mother CHAPTER XLIX CAPTAIN VIGNOLLES GETS HIS MONEY When we last left Captain Scarborough he had just lost an additional sum of two hundred and twenty seven pounds to Captain Vignolles which he was not able to pay besides the sum of fifty pounds which he had received the day before as the first instalment of his new allowance This was but a bad beginning of the new life he was expected to lead under the renewed fortunes which his father was preparing for him He had given his promissory note for the money at a week s date and had been extremely angry with Captain Vignolles because that gentleman had under the circumstances been a little anxious about it It certainly was not singular that he should have been so as Captain Scarborough had been turned out of more than one club in consequence of his inability to pay his card debts As he went home to his lodgings with Captain Vignolles s champagne in his head he felt very much as he had done that night when he attacked Harry Annesley But he met no one whom he could consider as an enemy and therefore got himself to bed and slept off the fumes of the drink On that day he was to return to Tretton but when he awoke he felt that before he did so he must endeavor to make some arrangements for paying the amount due at the end of the week He had already borrowed twenty pounds from mister Grey and had intended to repay him out of the sum which his father had given him but that sum now was gone and he was again nearly penniless In this emergency there was nothing left to him but again to go to mister Grey As he was shown up the stairs to the lawyer s room he did feel thoroughly ashamed of himself mister Grey knew all the circumstances of his career and it would be necessary now to tell him of this last adventure He did tell himself as he dragged himself up the stairs that for such a one as he was there could be no redemption It would be better that I should go back he said and throw myself from the Monument But yet he felt that if Florence Mountjoy could still be his there might yet be a hope that things would go well with him mister Grey began by expressing surprise at seeing Captain Scarborough in town Oh yes I have come up It does not matter why because as usual I have put my foot in it It was at my father s bidding but that does not matter How have you put your foot in it said the attorney There was one way in which the captain was always putting both his feet in it but since he had been turned out of his clubs mister Grey did not think that that way was open to him The old story Do you mean that you have been gambling again Yes I met a friend last night and he asked me to his rooms And he had the cards ready Of course he had What else would any one have ready for me And he won that remnant of the twenty pounds which you borrowed from me and therefore you want another Hereupon the captain shook his head What is it then that you do want Such a man as I met said the captain would not be content with the remnant of twenty pounds I had received fifty from my father and had intended to call here and pay you That has all gone too Yes indeed And in addition to that I have given him a note for two hundred and twenty seven pounds which I must take up in a week s time Otherwise I must disappear again and this time forever It is a bottomless gulf said the attorney Captain Scarborough sat silent with something almost approaching to a smile on his mouth but his heart within him certainly was not smiling A bottomless gulf repeated the attorney Upon this the captain frowned What is it that you wish me to do for you I have no money of your father s in my hands nor could I give it you if I had it I suppose not I must go back to him and tell him that it is so Then it was the lawyer s turn to be silent and he remained thinking of it all till Captain Scarborough rose from his seat and prepared to go I won t trouble you any more mister Grey he said Sit down said mister Grey But the captain still remained standing Sit down Of course I can take out my check book and write a check for this sum of money nothing would be so easy and if I could succeed in explaining it to your father during his lifetime he no doubt would repay me And for the sake of auld lang syne I should not be unhappy about my money whether he did so or not But would it be wise On your own account would it be wise I cannot say that anything done for me would be wise unless you could cut my throat And yet there is no one whose future life might be easier Your father the circumstances of whose life are the most singular I ever knew I shall never believe all this about my mother Never mind that now We will pass that by for the present He has disinherited you That will be a question some day for the lawyers should I live But circumstances have so gone with him that he is enabled to leave you another fortune He is very angry with your brother in which anger I sympathize He will strip Tretton as bare as the palm of my hand for your sake You have always been his favorite and so in spite of all things you are still They tell me he cannot last for six months longer Heaven knows I do not wish him to die But he thinks that your brother does He feels that Augustus begrudges him a few months longer life and he is angry If he could again make you his heir now that the debts are all paid he would do so Here the captain shook his head But as it is he will leave you enough for all the needs of even a luxurious life Here is his will which I am going to send down to him for final execution this very day My senior clerk will take it and you will meet him there That will give you ample for life But what is the use of it all if you can lose it in one night or in one month among a pack of scoundrels If they be scoundrels I am one of them You lose your money You are their dupe To the best of my belief you have never won The dupes lose and the scoundrels win It must be so You know nothing about it mister Grey This man who had your money last does he not live on it as a profession Why should he win always and you lose It is my luck Luck There is no such thing as luck Toss up right hand against left for an hour together and the result will be the same If not for an hour then do it for six hours Take the average and your cards will be the same as another man s Another man has his skill said Mountjoy And uses it against the unskillful to earn his daily bread That is the same as cheating But what is the use of all this You must have thought of it all before Yes indeed And thinking of it you are determined to persevere You are impetuous not thoughtless with your brain clouded with drink and for the mere excitement of the thing you are determined to risk all in a contest for which there is no chance for you and by which you acknowledge you will be driven to self destruction as the only natural end I fear it is so said the captain How much shall I draw it for said the attorney taking out his check book and to whom shall I make it payable I suppose I may date it to day so that the swindler who gets it may think that there is plenty more behind for him to get Do you mean that you are going to lend it me Oh yes And how do you mean to get it again I must wait I suppose till you have won it back among your friends If you will tell me that you do not intend to look for it in that fashion then I shall have no doubt as to your making me a legitimate payment in a very short time Two hundred and twenty pounds won t ruin you unless you are determined to ruin yourself mister Grey the meanwhile went on writing the check Here is provided for you a large sum of money and he laid his hand upon the will out of which you will be able to pay me without the slightest difficulty It is for you to say whether you will or not I will You need not say it in that fashion that s easy You must say it at some moment when the itch of play is on you when there shall be no one by to hear when the resolution if held shall have some meaning in it Then say there s that money which I had from old Grey I am bound to pay it But if I go in there I know what will be the result The very coin that should go into his coffers will become a part of the prey on which those harpies will feed There s the check for the two hundred and twenty seven pounds I have drawn it exact so that you may send the identical bit of paper to your friend He will suppose that I am some money lender who has engaged to supply your needs while your recovered fortune lasts Tell your father he shall have the will to morrow I don t suppose I can send Smith with it to day Then it became necessary that Scarborough should go but it would be becoming that he should first utter some words of thanks I think you will get it back mister Grey I dare say I think you will It may be that the having to pay you will keep me for a while from the gambling table You don t look for more than that I am an unfortunate man mister Grey There is one thing that would cure me but that one thing is beyond my reach Some woman Well it is a woman I think I could keep my money for the sake of her comfort But never mind Good bye mister Grey I think I shall remember what you have done for me Then he went and sent the identical check to Captain Vignolles with the shortest and most uncourteous epistle DEAR SIR I send you your money Send back the note Yours M SCARBOROUGH I hardly expected this said the captain to himself as he pocketed the check at any rate not so soon Nothing venture nothing have That Moody is a slow coach and will never do anything I thought there d be a little money about with him for a time Then the captain turned over in his mind that night s good work with the self satisfied air of an industrious professional worker But mister Grey was not so well satisfied with himself and determined for a while to say nothing to Dolly of the two hundred and twenty seven pounds which he had undoubtedly risked by the loan But his mind misgave him before he went to sleep and he felt that he could not be comfortable till he had made a clean breast of it During the evening Dolly had been talking to him of all the troubles of all the Carrolls how Amelia would hardly speak to her father or her mother because of her injured lover and was absolutely insolent to her Dolly whenever they met how Sophia had declared that promises ought to be kept and that Amelia should be got rid of and how missus Carroll had told her in confidence that Carroll pere had come home the night before drunker than usual and had behaved most abominably But mister Grey had attended very little to all this having his mind preoccupied with the secret of the money which he had lent Therefore Dolly did not put out her candle and arrayed herself for bed in the costume with which she was wont to make her nocturnal visits She had perceived that her father had something on his mind which it would be necessary that he should tell She was soon summoned and having seated herself on the bed began the conversation I knew you would want me to night Why so Because you ve got something to tell It s about mister Barry No indeed That s well Just at this moment I seem to care about mister Barry more than any other trouble But I fear that he has forgotten me altogether which is not complimentary mister Barry will turn up all in proper time said her father I have got nothing to say about mister Barry just at present so if you are love lorn you had better go to bed Very well When I am love lorn I will Now what have you got to tell me I have lent a man a large sum of money two hundred and twenty seven pounds You are always lending people large sums of money I generally get it back again From mister Carroll for instance when he borrows it for a pair of breeches and spends it in gin and water I never lent him a shilling He is a burr and has to be pacified not by loans but gifts It is too late now for me to prevent the brother in lawship of poor Carroll Who has got this money A professed gambler who never wins anything and constantly loses more than he is able to pay Yet I do think this man will pay me some day It is Captain Scarborough said Dolly Seeing that his father is a very rich man indeed and as far as I can understand gives you a great deal more trouble than he is worth I don t see why you should lend a large sum of money to his son Simply because he wanted it Oh dear oh dear He wanted it very much He had gone away a ruined man because of his gambling and now when he had come back and was to be put upon his legs again I could not see him again ruined for the need of such a sum It was very foolish Perhaps a little rash papa But now I have told you and so there may be an end of it But I ll tell you what Dolly I ll bet you a new straw hat he pays me within a month of his father s death Then Dolly was allowed to escape and betake herself to her bed On that same day Mountjoy Scarborough went down to Tretton and was at once closeted with his father mister Scarborough had questions to ask about mister Prosper and was anxious to know how his son had succeeded in his mission But the conversation was soon turned from mister Prosper to Captain Vignolles and mister Grey Mountjoy had determined as soon as he had got the check from mister Grey to say nothing about it to his father He had told mister Grey in order that he need not tell his father if the money were forthcoming But he had not been five minutes in his father s room before he rushed to the subject You got among those birds of prey again said his father There was only one bird or at least two A big bird and a small one And you lost how much Then the captain told the precise sum And Grey has lent it you The captain nodded his head Then you must ride into Tretton and catch the mail to night with a check to repay him That you should have been able in so short a time to have found a man willing to fleece you I suppose it s hopeless I cannot tell Altogether hopeless What am I to say sir If I make a promise it will go for nothing For absolutely nothing Then what would be the use of my promising You are quite logical and look upon the matter in altogether a proper light As you have ruined yourself so often and done your best to ruin those that belong to you what hope can there be About this money that I have left you I do not know that anything farther can be said unless I leave it all to an hospital It is better that you should have it and throw it away among the gamblers than that it should fall into the hands of Augustus Besides the demand is moderate No doubt it is only a beginning but we will see Then he got out his check book and made Mountjoy himself write the check including the two sums which had been borrowed And he dictated the letter to mister Grey MY DEAR GREY I return the money which Mountjoy has had from you two hundred and twenty seven pounds and twenty That I think is right You are the most foolish man I know with your money To have given it to such a scapegrace as my son Mountjoy But you are the sweetest and finest gentleman I ever came across You have got your money now which is a great deal more than you can have expected or ought to have obtained However on this occasion you have been in great luck Yours faithfully JOHN SCARBOROUGH This letter his son himself was forced to write though it dealt altogether with his own delinquencies and yet as he told himself he was not sorry to write it as it would declare to mister Grey that he had himself acknowledged at once his own sin The only farther punishment which his father exacted was that his son should himself ride into Tretton and post the letter before he ate his dinner I ve got my money said mister Grey waving the check as he went into his dressing room with Dolly at his heels Who has paid it Old Scarborough and he made Mountjoy write the letter himself calling me an old fool for lending it I don t think I was such a fool at all However I ve got my money and you may pay the bet and not say anything more about it CHAPTER L THE LAST OF MISS THOROUGHBUNG mister Prosper with that kind of energy which was distinctively his own had sent off his letter to Harry Annesley with his postscript in it about his blighted matrimonial prospects a letter easy to be written before he had completed his grand epistle to Miss Thoroughbung The epistle to Miss Thoroughbung was one requiring great consideration It had to be studied in every word and re written again and again with the profoundest care He was afraid that he might commit himself by an epithet He dreaded even an adverb too much He found that a full stop expressed his feelings too violently and wrote the letter again for the fifth time because of the big initial which followed the full stop The consequence of all this long delay was that Miss Thoroughbung had heard the news through the brewery before it reached her in its legitimate course mister Prosper had written his postscript by accident and in writing it had forgotten the intercourse between his brother in law s house and the Buntingford people He had known well of the proposed marriage but he was a man who could not think of two things at the same time and thus had committed the blunder Perhaps it was better for him as it was and the blow came to him with a rapidity which created less of suffering than might have followed the slower mode of proceeding which he had intended He was actually making the fifth copy of the letter rendered necessary by that violent full stop when Matthew came to him and announced that Miss Thoroughbung was in the drawing room In the house ejaculated mister Prosper She would come into the hall and then where was I to put her Matthew Pike you will not do for my service This had been said about once every three months throughout the long course of years in which Matthew had lived with his master Very well sir I am to take it for a month s warning of course Matthew understood well enough that this was merely an expression of his master s displeasure and being anxious for his master s welfare knew that it was decorous that some decision should be come to at once as to Miss Thoroughbung and that time should not be lost in his own little personal quarrel She is waiting you know sir and she looks uncommon irascible There is the other lady left outside in the carriage Miss Tickle Don t let her in whatever you do She is the worst Oh dear oh dear Where are my coat and waistcoat and my braces And I haven t brushed my hair And these slippers won t do What business has she to come at this time of day without saying a word to anybody Then Matthew went to work and got his master into decent apparel with as little delay as possible After all said mister Prosper I don t think I ll see her Why should I see her She knows you are at home sir Why does she know I m at home That s your fault She oughtn t to know anything about it Oh dear oh dear oh dear These last ejaculations arose from his having just then remembered the nature of his postscript to Harry Annesley and the engagement of Joe Thoroughbung to his niece He made up his mind at the moment or thought that he had made up his mind that Harry Annesley should not have a shilling as long as he lived I am quite out of breath I cannot see her yet Go and offer the lady cake and wine and tell her that you had found me very much indisposed I think you will have to tell her that I am not well enough to receive her to day Get it over sir and have done with it It s all very well to say have done with it I shall never have done with it Because you have let her in to day she ll think that she can come always Good Lord There she is on the stairs Pick up my slippers Then the door was opened and Miss Thoroughbung herself entered the room It was an up stairs chamber known as mister Prosper s own and from it was the door into his bedroom How Miss Thoroughbung had learned her way to it he never could guess But she had come up the stairs as though she had been acquainted with all the intricacies of the house from her childhood mister Prosper she said I hope I see you quite well this morning and that I have not disturbed you at your toilet That she had done so was evident from the fact that Matthew with the dressing gown and slippers was seen disappearing into the bedroom I am not very well thank you said mister Prosper rising from his chair and offering her his hand with the coldest possible salutation I am sorry for that very I hope it is not your indisposition which has prevented you from coming to see me I have been expecting you every day since Soames wrote his last letter But it s no use pretending any longer Oh Peter Peter This use of his Christian name struck him absolutely dumb so that he was unable to utter a syllable He should first of all have told her that any excuse she had before for calling him by his Christian name was now at an end But there was no opening for speech such as that Well she continued have you got nothing to say to me You can write flippant letters to other people and turn me into ridicule glibly enough I have never done so Did you not write to Joe Thoroughbung and tell him you had given up all thoughts of having me Joe he exclaimed His very surprise did not permit him to go farther at the moment than this utterance of the young man s Christian name Yes Joe Joe Thoroughbung my nephew and yours that is to be Did you not write and tell him that everything was over I never wrote to young mister Thoroughbung in my life I should not have dreamed of such a correspondence on such a subject Well he says you did Or if you didn t write to Joe himself you wrote to somebody I may have written to somebody certainly And told them that you didn t mean to have anything farther to say to me That traitor Harry had now committed a sin worse that knocking a man down in the middle of the night and leaving him bleeding speechless and motionless worse than telling a lie about it worse even than declining to listen to sermons read by his uncle Harry had committed such a sin that no shilling of allowance should evermore be paid to him Even at this moment there went through mister Prosper s brain an idea that there might be some unmarried female in England besides Miss Puffle and Miss Thoroughbung Peter Prosper why don t you answer like a man and tell me the honest truth He had never before been called Peter Prosper in his whole life Perhaps you had better let me make a communication by letter he said At that very moment the all but completed epistle was lying on the table before him where even her eyes might reach it In the flurry of the moment he covered it up Perhaps that is the letter which has taken you so long to write she said It is the letter Then hand it me over and save yourself the penny stamp In his confusion he gave her the letter and threw himself down on the sofa while she read it You have been very careful in choosing your language mister Prosper It will be expedient that I should make known to you the entire truth Certainly mister Prosper certainly The entire truth is the best thing next to entire beer my brother would say The horrid vulgar woman mister Prosper ejaculated to himself There seems to have been a complete misunderstanding with regard to that amiable lady Miss Tickle No misunderstanding at all You said you liked her and I supposed you did And when I had been living for twenty years with a female companion who hasn t sixpence in the world to buy a rag with but what she gets from me was it to be expected that I should turn her out for any man An annuity might have been arranged Miss Thoroughbung Bother an annuity That s all you think about feelings Was she to go and live alone and desolate because you wanted some one to nurse you And then those wretched ponies I tell you Peter Prosper that let me marry whom I will I mean to drive a pair of ponies and am able to do so out of my own money Ponies indeed It s an excuse Your heart has failed you You ve come to know a woman of spirit and now you are afraid that she ll be too much for you I shall keep this letter though it has not been sent You can do as you please about that Miss Thoroughbung Oh yes of course I shall keep it and shall give it to Messrs Soames Simpson They are most gentlemanlike men and will be shocked at such conduct as this from the Squire of Buston The letter will be published in the newspapers of course It will be very painful to me no doubt but I shall owe it to my sex to punish you When all the county are talking of your conduct to a lady and saying that no man could have done it let alone no gentleman then you will feel it Miss Tickle and a pair of ponies You expected to get my money and nothing to give for it Oh you mean man She must have been aware that every word she spoke was a dagger There was a careful analysis of his peculiar character displayed in every word of reproach which she uttered Nothing could have wounded him more than the comparison between himself and Soames Simpson They were gentlemen The vulgarest men in all Buntingford he declared to himself and always ready for any sharp practice Whereas he was no man Miss Thoroughbung said a mean creature altogether unworthy to be regarded as a gentleman He knew himself to be mister Prosper of Buston Hall with centuries of Prospers for his ancestors whereas Soames was the son of a tax gatherer and Simpson had come down from London as a clerk from a solicitor s office in the City And yet it was true that people would talk of him as did Miss Thoroughbung His cruelty would be in every lady s mouth And then his stinginess about the ponies would be the gossip of the county for twelve months And as he found out what Miss Thoroughbung was the disgrace of even having wished to marry her loomed terribly large before him But there was a twinkle of jest in the lady s eyes all the while which he did not perceive and which had he perceived it he could not have understood Her anger was but simulated wrath She too had thought that it might be well under circumstances if she were to marry mister Prosper but had quite understood that those circumstances might not be forthcoming I don t think it will do at all my dear she had said to Miss Tickle Of course an old bachelor like that won t want to have you I beg you won t think of me for a moment Miss Tickle had answered with solemnity Bother why can t you tell the truth I m not going to throw you over and of course you d be just nowhere if I did I shan t break my heart for mister Prosper I know I should be an old fool if I were to marry him and he is more of an old fool for wanting to marry me But I did think he wouldn t cut up so rough about the ponies And then when no answer came to the last letter from Soames Simpson and the tidings reached her round from the brewery that mister Prosper intended to be off she was not in the least surprised But the information she thought had come to her in an unworthy manner So she determined to punish the gentleman and went out to Buston Hall and called him Peter Prosper We may doubt however whether she had ever realized how terribly her scourges would wale him And to think that you would let it come round to me in that way through the young people writing about it just as a joke I never wrote about it like a joke said mister Prosper almost crying I remember now It was to your nephew and of course everybody at the rectory saw it Of course they were all laughing at you There was one thing now written in the book of fate and sealed as certainly as the crack of doom no shilling of allowance should ever be paid to Harry Annesley He would go abroad He said so to himself as he thought of this and said also that if he could find a healthy young woman anywhere he would marry her sacrificing every idea of his own happiness to his desire of revenge upon his nephew This however was only the passionate feeling of the moment Matrimony had become altogether so distasteful to him since he had become intimately acquainted with Miss Thoroughbung as to make any release in that manner quite impossible to him Do you propose to make me any amends asked Miss Thoroughbung Money said he Yes money Why shouldn t you pay me money I should like to keep three ponies and to have Miss Tickle s sister to come and live with me I do not know whether you are in earnest Miss Thoroughbung Quite in earnest Peter Prosper But perhaps I had better leave that matter in the hands of Soames Simpson very gentleman like men and they ll be sure to let you know how much you ought to pay Ten thousand pounds wouldn t be too much considering the distress to my wounded feelings Here Miss Thoroughbung put her handkerchief up to her eyes There was nothing that he could say Whether she were laughing at him as he thought to be most probable or whether there was some grain of truth in the demand which she made he found it equally impossible to make any reply There was nothing that he could say nor could he absolutely turn her out of the room But after ten minutes farther continuation of these amenities during which it did at last come home to his brain that she was merely laughing at him he began to think that he might possibly escape and leave her there in possession of his chamber If you will excuse me Miss Thoroughbung I will retire he said rising from the sofa Regularly chaffed out of your own den she said laughing I do not like this interchange of wit on subjects that are so serious Interchange There is very little interchange according to my idea You haven t said anything witty What an idea of interchange the man has At any rate I will escape from your rudeness Now Peter Prosper before you go let me ask you one question Which of the two has been the rudest to the other You have come and asked me to marry you and have evidently wished to back out of it from the moment in which you found that I had ideas of my own about money And now you call me rude because I have my little revenge I have called you Peter Prosper and you can t stand it You haven t spirit enough to call me Matty Thoroughbung in reply But good bye mister Prosper for I never will call you Peter again As to what I said to you about money that of course is all bosh I ll pay Soames s bill and will never trouble you There s your letter which however would be of no use because it is not signed A very stupid letter it is If you want to write naturally you should never copy a letter Good bye mister Prosper Peter that never shall be Then she got up and walked out of the room mister Prosper when he was left alone remained for a while nearly paralyzed That he should have ever entertained the idea of making that woman his wife Such was his first thought Then he reflected that he had in truth escaped from her more easily than he had hoped and that she had certainly displayed some good qualities in spite of her vulgarity and impudence She did not at any rate intend to trouble him any farther He would never again hear himself called Peter by that terribly loud voice But his anger became very fierce against the whole family at the rectory They had ventured to laugh at him and he could understand that in their eyes he had become very ridiculous He could see it all the manner in which they had made fun of him and had been jocose over his intended marriage He certainly had not intended to be funny in their eyes But while he had been exercising the duty of a stern master over them and had been aware of his own extreme generosity in his efforts to forgive his nephew that very nephew had been laughing at him in conjunction with the nephew of her whom he had intended to make his wife Not a shilling again should ever be allowed to Harry Annesley If it could be so arranged by any change of circumstances he might even yet become the father of a family of his own CHAPTER LI mister PROSPER IS TAKEN ILL When Harry Annesley returned from Cheltenham which he did about the beginning of February he was a very happy man It may be said indeed that within his own heart he was more exalted than is fitting for a man mortal for a human creature who may be cut off from his joys to morrow or may have the very source of his joy turned into sorrow He walked like a god not showing it by his outward gesture not declaring that it was so by any assumed grace or arrogant carriage of himself but knowing within himself that that had happened down at Cheltenham which had all but divested him of humanity and made a star of him To no one else had it been given to have such feelings such an assurance of heavenly bliss together with the certainty that under any circumstances it must be altogether his own for ever and ever It was thus he thought of himself and what had happened to him He had succeeded in getting himself kissed by a young woman Harry Annesley was in truth very proud of Florence and altogether believed in her He thought the better of himself because Florence loved him not with the vulgar self applause of a man who fancies himself to be a lady killer and therefore a grand sort of fellow but in conceiving himself to be something better than he had hitherto believed simply because he had won the heart of this one special girl During that half hour at Cheltenham she had so talked to him and managed in her own pretty way so to express herself as to make him understand that of all that there was of her he was the only lord and master May God do so to me and more also if to the end I do not treat her not only with all affection but also with all delicacy of observance It was thus that he spoke to himself of her as he walked away from the door of missus Mountjoy s house in Cheltenham From thence he went back to Buston and entered his father s house with all that halo of happiness shining round his heart He did not say much about it but his mother and his sisters felt that he was altered and he understood their feelings when his mother said to him after a day or two that it was a great shame that they none of them knew his Florence But you will have to know her well That s of course but it s a thousand pities that we should not be able to talk of her to you as one whom we know already Then he felt that they had among them all acknowledged her to be such as she was There came to the rectory some tidings of the meeting which had taken place at the Hall between his uncle and Miss Thoroughbung It was Joe who brought to them the first account and then farther particulars leaked out among the servants of the two houses Matthew was very discreet but even Matthew must have spoken a word or two In the first place there came the news that mister Prosper s anger against his nephew was hotter than ever mister Harry must have put his foot in it somehow That had been Matthew s assurance made with much sorrow to the house keeper or head servant at the rectory And then Joe had declared that all the misfortunes which had attended mister Prosper s courtship had been attributed to Harry s evil influences At first this could not but be a matter of joke Joe s stories as he told them were full of ridicule and had no doubt come to him from Miss Thoroughbung either directly or through some of the ladies at Buntingford It does seem that your aunt has been too many for him This had been said by Molly and had been uttered in the presence both of Joe Thoroughbung and of Harry Why yes said Joe She has had him under the thong altogether and has not found it difficult to flog him when she had got him by the hind leg This idea had occurred to Joe from his remembrance of a peccant hound in the grasp of a tyrant whip It seems that he offered her money I should hardly think that said Harry standing up for his uncle She says so and says that she declared that ten thousand pounds would be the very lowest sum Of course she was laughing at him Uncle Prosper doesn t like to be laughed at said Molly And she did not spare him said Joe And then she had by heart the whole story how she had called him Peter and how angry he had been at the appellation Nobody calls him Peter except my mother said Harry I should not dream of calling him Uncle Peter said Molly Do you mean to say that Miss Thoroughbung called him Peter Where could she have got the courage To this Joe replied that he believed his aunt had courage for anything under the sun I don t think that she ought to have called him Peter continued Molly Of course after that there couldn t be a marriage I don t quite see why not said Joe I call you Molly and I expect you to marry me And I call you Joe and I expect you to marry me but we ain t quite the same The Squire of Buston said Joe considers himself Squire of Buston I suppose that the old Queen of Heaven didn t call Jupiter Jove till they d been married at any rate some centuries Well done Joe said Harry He ll become fellow of a college yet said Molly If you ll let me alone I will said Joe But only conceive the kind of scene there must have been at the house up there when Aunt Matty had forced her way in among your uncle s slippers and dressing gowns I d have given a five pound note to have seen and heard it I d have given two if it had never occurred He had written me a letter which I had taken as a pardon in full for all my offences He had assured me that he had no intention of marrying and had offered to give me back my old allowance Now I am told that he has quarrelled with me again altogether because of some light word as to me and my concerns spoken by this vivacious old aunt of yours I wish your vivacious old aunt had remained at Buntingford And we had wished that your vivacious old uncle had remained at Buston when he came love making to Marmaduke Lodge He was an old fool and among ourselves always has been said Molly who on the occasion thought it incumbent upon her to take the Thoroughbung rather than the Prosper side of the quarrel But in truth this renewed quarrel between the Hall and the rectory was likely to prove extremely deleterious to Harry Annesley s interests For his welfare depended not solely on the fact that he was at present heir presumptive to his uncle nor yet on the small allowance of two hundred and fifty pounds made to him by his uncle and capable of being withdrawn at any moment but also on the fact supposed to be known to all the world which was known to all the world before the affair in the streets with Mountjoy Scarborough that Harry was his uncle s heir His position had been that of eldest son and indeed that of only child to a man of acres and squire of a parish He had been made to hope that this might be restored to him and at this moment absolutely had in his pocket the check for sixty two pounds ten which had been sent to him by his uncle s agent in payment of the quarter s income which had been stopped But he also had a farther letter written on the next day telling him that he was not to expect any repetition of the payment Under these circumstances what should he do Two or three things occurred to him But he resolved at last to keep the check without cashing it for some weeks and then to write to his uncle when the fury of his wrath might be supposed to have passed by offering to restore it His uncle was undoubtedly a very silly man but he was not one who could acknowledge to himself that he had done an unjust act without suffering for it At the present moment while his wrath was hot there would be no sense of contrition His ears would still tingle with the sound of the laughter of which he had supposed himself to have been the subject at the rectory But that sound in a few weeks might die away and some feeling of the propriety of justice would come back upon the poor man s mind Such was the state of things upon which Harry resolved to wait for a few weeks But in the mean time tidings came across from the Hall that mister Prosper was ill He had remained in the house for two or three days after Miss Thoroughbung s visit This had given rise to no special remarks because it was well known that mister Prosper was a man whose feelings were often too many for him When he was annoyed it would be long before he would get the better of the annoyance and during such periods he would remain silent and alone There could be no question that Miss Thoroughbung had annoyed him most excessively And Matthew had been aware that it would be better that he should abstain from all questions He would take the daily newspaper in to his master and ask for orders as to the daily dinner and that would be all mister Prosper when in a fairly good humor would see the cook every morning and would discuss with her the propriety of either roasting or boiling the fowl and the expediency either of the pudding or the pie His idiosyncrasies were well known and the cook might always have her own way by recommending the contrary to that which she wanted because it was a point of honor with mister Prosper not to be led by his servants But during these days he simply said Let me have dinner and do not trouble me This went on for a day or two without exciting much comment at the rectory But when it went on beyond a day or two it was surmised that mister Prosper was ill At the end of a week he had not been seen outside the house and then alarm began to be felt The rumor had got abroad that he intended to go to Italy and it was expected that he would start but no sign came of his intended movements not a word more had been said to Matthew on the subject He had been ordered to admit no visitor into the house at all unless it were some one from the firm of Grey Barry From the moment in which he had got rid of Miss Thoroughbung he had been subject to some dread lest she should return Or if not she herself she might he thought send Soames Simpson or some denizen from the brewery And he was conscious that not only all Buston but all Buntingford was aware of what he had attempted to do Every one whom he chanced to meet would as he thought be talking of him and therefore he feared to be seen by the eye of man woman or child There was a self consciousness about him which altogether overpowered him That cook with whom he used to have the arguments about the boiled chicken was now an enemy a domestic enemy because he was sure that she talked about his projected marriage in the kitchen He would not see his coachman or his groom because some tidings would have reached them about that pair of ponies Consequently he shut himself up altogether and the disease became worse with him because of his seclusion And now from day to day or it may be more properly said from hour to hour news came across to the rectory of the poor squire s health Matthew to whom alone was given free intercourse with his master became very gloomy mister Prosper was no doubt gloomy and the feeling was contagious I think he s going off his head that s what I do think he said in confidential intercourse with the cook That conversation resulted in Matthew s walking across to the rectory and asking advice from the rector and in the rector paying a visit to the Hall He had again consulted with his wife and she had recommended him to endeavor to see her brother Of course what we hear about his anger only comes from Joe or through the servants If he is angry what will it matter Not in the least to me said the rector only I would not willingly trouble him I would go said the rector s wife only I know he would require me to agree with him about Harry That of course I cannot do Then the rector walked across to the Hall and sent up word by Matthew that he was there and would be glad to see mister Prosper if mister Prosper were disengaged But Matthew after an interval of a quarter of an hour came back with merely a note I am not very well and an interview at the present moment would only be depressing But I would be glad to see my sister if she would come across to morrow at twelve o clock I think it would be well that I should see some one and she is now the nearest P P Then there arose a great discussion at the rectory as to what this note indicated She is now the nearest He might have so written had the doctor who attended him told him that death was imminent Of course she was the nearest What did the now mean Was it not intended to signify that Harry had been his heir and therefore the nearest but that now he had been repudiated But it was of course resolved that missus Annesley should go to the Hall at the hour indicated on the morrow Oh yes I m up here where else should I be unless you expected to find me in my bed It was thus that he answered his sister s first inquiry as to his condition In bed Oh no Why should any one expect to find you in bed Peter Never call me by that name again he said rising up from his chair and standing erect with one arm stretched out She called him Peter simply because it had been her custom so to do during the period of nearly fifty years in which they had lived in the same parish as brother and sister She could therefore only stare at him and his tragic humor as he stood there before her Though of course it is madness on my part to object to it My godfather and godmother christened me Peter and our father was Peter before me and his father too was Peter Prosper But that woman has made the name sound abominable in my ears Miss Thoroughbung you mean She came here and so be Petered me in my own house nay up in this very room that I hardly knew whether I was on my head or my heels I would not mind what she said They all know that she is a little flighty Nobody told me so Why couldn t you let me know that she was flighty beforehand I thought that she was a person whom it would have done to marry If you will only think of it Peter Here he shuddered visibly I beg your pardon I will not call you so again But it is unreasonable to blame us for not telling you about Miss Thoroughbung Of course it is I am unreasonable I know it Let us hope that it is all over now Cart ropes wouldn t drag me up to the hymeneal altar at least not with that woman You have sent for me Peter I beg pardon I was so glad when you sent I would have come before only I was afraid that you would be annoyed Is there anything that we can do for you Nothing at all that you can do I fear Somebody told us that you were thinking of going abroad Here he shook his head I think it was Harry Here he shook his head and frowned Had you not some idea of going abroad That is all gone he said solemnly It would have enabled you to get over this disappointment without feeling it so acutely I do feel it but not exactly the disappointment There I think I have been saved from a misfortune which would certainly have driven me mad That woman s voice daily in my ear could have had no other effect I have at any rate been saved from that What is it then that troubles you Everybody knows that I intended it All the country has heard of it But yet was not my purpose a good one Why should not a gentleman marry if he wants to leave his estate to his own son Of course he must marry before he can do that Where was I to get a young lady just outside of my own class There was Miss Puffle I did think of her But just at the moment she went off with young Tazlehurst That was another misfortune Why should Miss Puffle have descended so low just before I had thought of her And I couldn t marry quite a young girl How could I expect such a one to live here with me at Buston where it is rather dull When I looked about there was nobody except that horrid Miss Thoroughbung You just look about and tell me if there was any one else Of course my circle is circumscribed I have been very careful whom I have admitted to my intimacy and the result is that I know almost nobody I may say that I was driven to ask Miss Thoroughbung But why marry at all unless you re fond of somebody to be attached to Ah Why marry at all I say I ask the question knowing very well why you intended to do it Then why do you ask he said angrily Because it is so difficult to talk of Harry to you Of course I cannot help feeling that you have injured him It is he that has injured me It is he that has brought me to this condition Don t you know that you ve all been laughing at me down at the rectory since this affair of that terrible woman While he paused for an answer to his question missus Annesley sat silent You know it is true He and that man whom Molly means to marry and the other girls and their father and you have all been laughing at me I have never laughed But the others And again he waited for a reply But the no reply which came did as well as any other answer There was the fact that he had been ridiculed by the very young man whom it was intended that he should support by his liberality It was impossible to tell him that a man who had made himself so absurd must expect to be laughed at by his juniors There was running through his mind an idea that very much was due to him from Harry but there was also an idea that something too was due from him There was present even to him a noble feeling that he should bear all the ignominy with which he was treated and still be generous But he had sworn to himself and had sworn to Matthew that he would never forgive his nephew Of course you all wish me to be out of the way Why do you say that Because it is true How happy you would all be if I were dead and Harry were living here in my place Do you think so Yes I do Of course you would all go into mourning and there would be some grimace of sorrow among you for a few weeks but the sorrow would soon be turned into joy I shall not last long and then his time will come There you may tell him that his allowance shall be continued in spite of all his laughing It was for that purpose that I sent for you And now you know it you can go and leave me Then missus Annesley did go and rejoiced them all up at the rectory by these latest tidings from the Hall But now the feeling was how could they show their gratitude and kindness to poor Uncle Prosper CHAPTER LII mister BARRY AGAIN mister Barry has given me to understand that he means to come down to morrow This was said by mister Grey to his daughter What does he want to come here for I suppose you know why he wants to come here Then the father was silent and for some time Dolly remained silent also He is coming to ask you to consent to be his wife Why do you let him come papa I cannot hinder him That in the first place And then I don t want to prevent his coming Oh papa I do not want to prevent his coming And I do not wish you now at this instant to pledge yourself to anything I cannot but pledge myself You can at any rate remain silent while I speak to you There was a solemnity in his manner which almost awed her so that she could only come nearer to him and sit close to him holding his hand in hers I wish you to hear what I have got to say to you and to make no answer till you shall make it to morrow to him after having fully considered the whole matter In the first place he is an honest and good man and certainly will not ill treat you Is that so much It is a great deal as men go It would be a great deal to me to be sure that I had left you in the hands of one who is of his nature tender and affectionate That is something but not enough And then he is a careful man who will certainly screen you from all want and he is prudent walking about the world with his eyes open much wider than your father has ever done Here she only pressed his hand There is nothing to be said against him except that something which you spotted at once when you said that he was not a gentleman According to your ideas and to mine he is not quite a gentleman but we are both fastidious We must pay the penalty of our tastes in that respect You are paying the penalty now by your present doubts But it is not yet too late for you to get the better of it Though I have acknowledged that he is not quite a gentleman he is by no means the reverse You are quite a lady I hope so But you are not particularly good looking Papa you are not complimentary My dear I do not intend to be so To me your face such as it is is the sweetest thing on earth to look upon Oh papa dear papa and she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him But having lived so long with me you have acquired my habits and thoughts and have learned to disregard utterly your outward appearance I would be decent and clean and womanly That is not enough to attract the eyes of men in general But he has seen deeper than most men do Into the value of the business you mean said she No Dolly I will not have that that is ill natured and as I believe altogether untrue I think of mister Barry that he would not marry any girl for the sake of the business unless he loved her That is nonsense papa How can mister Barry love me Did he and I ever have five minutes of free conversation together Unless he meant to love would be nearer the mark and knew that he could do so You will be quite safe in his hands Safe papa So much for yourself and now I must say a few words as to myself You are not bound to marry him or any one else to do me a good turn but I think you are bound to remember what my feelings would be if on my death bed I were leaving you quite alone in the world As far as money is concerned you would have enough for all your wants but that is all that you would have You have become so thoroughly my friend that you have hardly another real friend in the world That is my disposition Yes but I must guard against the ill effects of that disposition I know that if some man came the way whom you could in truth love you would make the sweetest wife that ever a man possessed Oh papa how you talk No such man will come the way and there s an end of it mister Barry has come the way and as things go is deserving of your regard My advice to you is to accept him Now you will have twenty four hours to think of that advice and to think of your own future condition How will life go with you if you should be left living in this house all alone Why do you speak as though we were to be parted to morrow To morrow or next day he said very solemnly The day will surely come before long mister Barry may not be all that your fancy has imagined Decidedly not But he has those good qualities which your reason should appreciate Think it over my darling And now we will say nothing more about mister Barry till he shall have been here and pleaded his own cause Then there was not another word said on the subject between them and on the next morning mister Grey went away to his chambers as usual Though she had strenuously opposed her father through the whole of the conversation above given still as it had gone on she had resolved to do as he would her not indeed that is to marry this suitor but to turn him over in her mind yet once again and find out whether it would be possible that she should do so She had dismissed him on that former occasion and had not since given a thought to him except as to a nuisance of which she had so far ridded herself Now the nuisance had come again and she was to endeavor to ascertain how far she could accustom herself to its perpetual presence without incurring perpetual misery But it has to be acknowledged that she did not begin the inquiry in a fair frame of mind She declared to herself that she would think about it all the night and all the morning without a prejudice so that she might be able to accept him if she found it possible But at the same time there was present to her a high black stone wall at one side of which stood she herself while mister Barry was on the other That there should be any clambering over that wall by either of them she felt to be quite impossible though at the same time she acknowledged that a miracle might occur by which the wall would be removed So she began her thinking and used all her father s arguments mister Barry was honest and good and would not ill treat her She knew nothing about him but would take all that for granted as though it were gospel because her father had said so And then it was to her a fact that she was by no means good looking the meaning of which was that no other man would probably want her Then she remembered her father s words To me your face is the sweetest thing on earth to look upon This she did believe Her plainness did not come against her there Why should she rob her father of the one thing which to him was sweet in the world And to her her father was the one noble human being whom she had ever known Why should she rob herself of his daily presence Then she told herself as she had told him that she had never had five minutes free conversation with mister Barry in her life That certainly was no reason why free conversation should not be commenced But then she did not believe that free conversation was within the capacity of mister Barry It would never come though she might be married to him for twenty years He too might perhaps talk about his business but there would be none of those considerations as to radical good or evil which made the nucleus of all such conversations with her father There would be a flatness about it all which would make any such interchange of words impossible It would be as though she had been married to a log of wood or rather a beast of the field as regarded all sentiment How much money would be coming to him Now her father had never told her how much money was coming to him There had been no allusion to that branch of the subject And then there came other thoughts as to that interior life which it would be her destiny to lead with mister Barry Then came a black cloud upon her face as she sat thinking of it Never at last she said never never He is very foolish not to know that it is impossible The he of whom she then spoke was her father and not mister Barry If I have to be left alone I shall not be the first Others have been left alone before me I shall at any rate be left alone Then the wall became higher and more black than ever and there was no coming of that miracle by which it was to be removed It was clearer to her than ever that neither of them could climb it And after all she said to herself to know that your husband is not a gentleman Ought that not to be enough Of course a woman has to pay for her fastidiousness Like other luxuries it is costly but then like other luxuries it cannot be laid aside So before that morning was gone she made up her mind steadily that mister Barry should never be her lord and master How could she best make him understand that it was so so that she might be quickly rid of him When the first hour of thinking was done after breakfast it was that which filled her mind She was sure that he would not take an answer easily and go He would have been prepared by her father to persevere not by his absolute words but by his mode of speaking Her father would have given him to understand that she was still in doubt and therefore might possibly be talked over She must teach him at once as well as she could that such was not her character and that she had come to a resolution which left him no chance And she was guilty of one weakness which was almost unworthy of her When the time came she changed her dress and put on an old shabby frock in which she was wont to call upon the Carrolls Her best dresses were all kept for her father and perhaps accounted for that opinion that to his eyes her face was the sweetest thing on earth to look upon As she sat there waiting for mister Barry she certainly did look ten years older than her age In truth both mister Grey and Dolly had been somewhat mistaken in their reading of mister Barry s character There was more of intellect and merit in him than he had obtained credit for from either of them He did care very much for the income of the business and perhaps his first idea in looking for Dolly s hand had been the probability that he would thus obtain the whole of that income for himself But while wanting money he wanted also some of the good things which ought to accompany it A superior intellect an intellect slightly superior to his own of which he did not think meanly a power of conversation which he might imitate and that fineness of thought which he flattered himself he might be able to achieve while living with the daughter of a gentleman these were the treasures which mister Barry hoped to gain by his marriage with Dorothy Grey And there had been something in her personal appearance which to his eyes had not been distasteful He did not think her face the sweetest thing in the world to look at as her father had done but he saw in it the index of that intellect which he had desired to obtain for himself As for her dress that of course should all be altered He imagined that he could easily become so far master of his wife as to make her wear fine clothes without difficulty But then he did not know Dolly Grey He had studied deeply his manner of attacking her He would be very humble at first but after a while his humility should be discontinued whether she accepted or rejected him He knew well that it did not become a husband to be humble and as regarded a lover he thought that humility was merely the outside gloss of love making He had been humble enough on the former occasion and would begin now in the same strain But after a while he would stir himself and assume the manner of a man Miss Grey he said as soon as they were alone you see that I have been as good as my word and have come again He had already observed her old frock and her mode of dressing up her hair and had guessed the truth I knew that you were to come mister Barry Your father has told you so Yes And he has spoken a good word in my favor Yes he has Which I trust will be effective Not at all He knows that it is the only subject on which I cannot take his advice I would burn my hand off for my father but I cannot afford to give it to any one at his instance It must be exclusively my own unless some one should come very different from those who are likely to ask for it There was something mister Barry thought of offence in this but he could not altogether throw off his humility as yet I quite admit the value of the treasure he said There need not be any nonsense between us mister Barry It has no special value to any one except to myself but to myself I mean to keep it At my father s instance I had thought over the proposition you have made me much more seriously than I had thought it possible that I should do That is not flattering he said There is no need for flattery either on the one side or on the other You had better take that as established You have done me the honor of wishing for certain reasons that I should be your wife The common reason that I love you But I am not able to return the feeling and do not therefore wish that you should be my husband That sounds to be uncivil Rather But I say it in order to make you understand the exact truth A woman cannot love a man because she feels for him even the most profound respect She will often do so when there is neither respect nor esteem My father has so spoken of you to me that I do esteem you but that has no effect in touching my heart therefore I cannot become your wife Now as mister Barry thought had come the time in which he must assert himself Miss Grey he said you have probably a long life before you Long or short it can make no difference If I understood you aright you are one who lives very much to yourself To myself and my father He is growing in years So am I for the matter of that We are all growing in years Have you looked out for yourself and thought what manner of home yours will be when he shall have been dead and buried He paused but she remained silent and assumed a special cast of countenance as though she might say a word if he pressed her which it would be disagreeable for him to hear When he has gone will you not be very solitary without a husband No doubt I shall Had you not better accept one when one comes your way who is not as he tells you quite unworthy of you In spite of such worth solitude would be preferable You certainly have a knack Miss Grey of making the most unpalatable assertions I will make another more unpalatable Solitude I could bear and death but not such a marriage You force me to tell you the whole truth because half a truth will not suffice I have endeavored to be at any rate civil to you he said And I have endeavored to save you what trouble I could by being straightforward Still he paused sitting in his chair uneasily but looking as though he had no intention of going If you will only take me at my word and have done with it Still he did not move I suppose there are young ladies who like this kind of thing but I have become old enough to hate it I have had very little experience of it but it is odious to me I can conceive nothing more disagreeable than to have to sit still and hear a gentleman declare that he wants to make me his wife when I am quite sure that I do not intend to make him my husband Then Miss Grey he said rising from his chair suddenly I shall bid you adieu Good bye mister Barry Good bye Miss Grey Farewell And so he went Oh papa we have had such a scene she said the moment she felt herself alone with her father You have not accepted him Accepted him Oh dear no I am sure at this moment he is only thinking how he would cut my throat if he could get hold of me You must have offended him then very greatly Oh mortally I said everything I possibly could to offend him But then he would have been here still had I not done so There was no other way to get rid of him or indeed to make him believe that I was in earnest I am sorry that you should have been so ungracious Of course I am ungracious But how can you stand bandying compliments with a man when it is your object to make him know the very truth that is in you It was your fault papa You ought to have understood how very impossible it is that I should marry mister Barry CHAPTER LIII THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST PLOT When mister Scarborough had written the check and sent it to mister Grey he did not utter another word on the subject of gambling Let us make another beginning he said as he told his son to make out another check for sixty pounds as his first instalment of the allowance I do not like to take it said the son I don t think you need be scrupulous now with me That was early in the morning at their first interview about ten o clock Later on in the day mister Scarborough saw his son again and on this occasion kept him in the room some time I don t suppose I shall last much longer now he said Your voice is as strong as I ever heard it But unfortunately my body does not keep pace with my voice From what Merton says I don t suppose there is above a month left I don t see why Merton is to know Merton is a good fellow and if you can do anything for him do it for my sake I will Then he added after a pause If things go as we expect Augustus can do more for him than I Why don t you leave him a sum of money Then Miss Scarborough came into the room and hovered about her brother and fed him and entreated him to be silent but when she had gone he went back to the subject I will tell you why Mountjoy I have not wished to load my will with other considerations so that it might be seen that solicitude for you has been in my last moments my only thought Of course I have done you a deep injury 
8156-104526-0000	train-other-500	I think you have And because you tell me so I like you all the better As for Augustus But I will not burden my spirit now at the last with uttering curses against my own son He is not worth it
none	none	 No he is not worth it What a fool he has been not to have understood me better 
8156-104526-0001	train-other-500	Now you are not half as clever a fellow as he is
none	none	 I dare say not You never read a book I suppose I don t pretend to read them which he does I don t know anything about that 
8156-104526-0002	train-other-500	but he has been utterly unable to read me I have poured out my money with open hands for both of you That is true sir certainly as regards me And have thought nothing of it Till it was quite hopeless with you I went on and would have gone on
8156-104526-0003	train-other-500	As things were then I was bound to do something to save the property
none	none	 These poor devils have put themselves out of the running now said Mountjoy Yes Augustus with his suspicions has enabled us to do that 
8156-104526-0004	train-other-500	After all he was quite right with his suspicions
none	none	 What do you mean by that sir 
8156-104526-0005	train-other-500	Well it was natural enough that he should not trust me
none	none	 I think too that perhaps he saw a screw loose where old Grey did not 
8156-104526-0006	train-other-500	but he was such an ass that he could not bring himself to keep on good terms with me for the few months that were left And then he brought that brute Jones down here without saying a word to me as to asking my leave
none	none	 And here he used to remain hardly ever coming to see me 
8156-104526-0007	train-other-500	but waiting for my death from day to day He is a cold blooded selfish brute
none	none	 He certainly takes after neither his father nor his mother But he will find yet perhaps 
8156-104526-0008	train-other-500	that I am even with him before all is over I shall try it on with him sir
none	none	 I have told you so from the beginning 
8156-104526-0009	train-other-500	and now if I have this money it will give me the means of doing so You ought to know for what purpose I shall use it That is all settled said the father The document properly completed has gone back with the clerk
8156-104526-0010	train-other-500	Were I to die this minute you would find that everything inside the house is your own
none	none	 and everything outside except the bare acres 
8156-104526-0011	train-other-500	There is a lot of plate with the banker which I have not wanted of late years
none	none	 And there are a lot of trinkets too 
8156-104526-0012	train-other-500	things which I used to fancy though I have not cared so much about them lately
none	none	 And there are a few pictures which are worth money 
8156-104526-0013	train-other-500	But the books are the most valuable only you do not care for them I shall not have a house to put them in There is no saying What an idiot what a fool what a blind unthinking ass Augustus has been
8156-104526-0014	train-other-500	Do you regret it sir that he should not have them and the house too I regret that my son should have been such a fool
none	none	 I did not expect that he should love me 
8156-104526-0015	train-other-500	I did not even want him to be kind to me
none	none	 Had he remained away and been silent that would have been sufficient 
8156-104526-0016	train-other-500	But he came here to enjoy himself
none	none	 as he looked about the park which he thought to be his own and insulted me because I would not die at once and leave him in possession And then he was fool enough to make way for you again and did not perceive that by getting rid of your creditors he once again put you into a position to be his rival 
8156-104526-0017	train-other-500	I don t know whether I hate him most for the hardness of his heart or despise him for the slowness of his intellect
none	none	 During the time that these words had been spoken Miss Scarborough had once or twice come into the room and besought her brother to take some refreshment which she offered him and then give himself up to rest But he had refused to be guided by her till he had come to a point in the conversation 
8156-104526-0018	train-other-500	at which he had found himself thoroughly exhausted Now she came for the third time and that period had arrived
none	none	 so that Mountjoy 
8156-104526-0019	train-other-500	was told to go about his business and shoot birds or hunt foxes
none	none	 in accordance with his natural proclivities It was then three o clock on a gloomy December afternoon and was too late for the shooting of birds and as for the hunting of foxes the hounds were not in the neighborhood So he resolved to go through the house and look at all those properties which were so soon to become his own And he at once strolled into the library 
8156-104526-0020	train-other-500	This was a long gloomy room which contained perhaps ten thousand volumes
none	none	 the greater number of which had in the days of Mountjoy s early youth been brought together by his own father and they had been bound in the bindings of modern times so that the shelves were bright 
8156-104526-0021	train-other-500	although the room itself was gloomy He took out book after book and told himself with something of sadness in his heart that they were all caviare to him
none	none	 Then he reminded himself that he was not yet thirty years of age and that there was surely time enough left for him to make them his companions He took one at random and found it to be a volume of Clarendon s History of the Rebellion He pitched upon a sentence in which he counted that there were sixteen lines and when he began to read it 
8156-104526-0022	train-other-500	it became to him utterly confused and unintelligible
none	none	 So he put it back and went to another portion of the room and took down Wittier s Hallelujah 
8156-104526-0023	train-other-500	and of this he could make neither head nor tail He was informed by a heading in the book itself that a piece of poetry was to be sung as the ten commandments He could not do that and put the book back again and declared to himself that farther search would be useless
none	none	 He looked round the room and tried to price the books and told himself that three or four days at the club might see an end of it all 
8156-104526-0024	train-other-500	Then he wandered on into the state drawing room
none	none	 an apartment which he had not entered for years 
8156-104526-0025	train-other-500	and found that all the furniture was carefully covered Of what use could it all be to him
none	none	 unless that it too might be sent to the melting pot and brought into some short lived use at the club But as he was about to leave the room he stood for a moment on the rug before the fireplace 
8156-104526-0026	train-other-500	and looked into the huge mirror which stood there
none	none	 If the walls might be his as well as the garnishing of them and if Florence Mountjoy could come and reign there then he fancied that they all might be put to a better purpose than that of which he had thought 
8156-104526-0027	train-other-500	In earlier days two or three years ago at a time which now seemed to him to be very distant he had regarded Florence as his own and as such had demanded her hand
none	none	 In the pride of his birth and position and fashion he had had no thought of her feelings and had been imperious 
8156-104526-0028	train-other-500	He told himself that it had been so with much self condemnation At any rate he had learned during those months of solitary wandering the power of condemning himself And now he told him that if she would yet come
8156-104526-0029	train-other-500	he might still learn to sing that song of the old fashioned poet as to the ten commandments
none	none	 At any rate he would endeavor to sing it as she bade him He went on through all the bedrooms remembering but hardly more than remembering them as he entered them 
8156-104526-0030	train-other-500	Oh Florence my Florence he said as he passed on He had done it all for himself brought down upon his own head this infinite ruin and for what He had scarcely ever won and Tretton was gone from him forever
8156-104526-0031	train-other-500	But still there might yet be a chance if he could abstain from gambling And then when it was dusk within the house he went out and passed through the stables and roamed about the gardens till the evening had altogether set in and black night had come upon him
8156-104526-0032	train-other-500	Two years ago he had known that he was the heir to it all though even then that habit was so strong upon him he had felt that his tenure of it would be but slight
none	none	 But he had then always to tell himself that when his marriage had taken place a great change would be effected 
8156-104526-0033	train-other-500	His marriage had not taken place and the next fatal year had fallen upon him As long as the inheritance of the estate was certainly his he could assuredly raise money at a certain cost
none	none	 It was well known that the property was rising in value 
8156-104526-0034	train-other-500	and the money had always been forthcoming at a tremendous sacrifice
none	none	 He had excused to himself his recklessness on the ground of his delayed marriage but still always treating her 
8156-104526-0035	train-other-500	on the few occasions on which they had met with an imperiousness which had been natural to him
none	none	 Then the final crash had come and the estate was as good as gone But the crash 
8156-104526-0036	train-other-500	which had been in truth final had come afterward
none	none	 almost as soon as his father had learned what was to be the fate of Tretton and he had found himself to be a bastard with a dishonored mother just a nobody in the eyes of the world And he learned at the same time that Harry Annesley was the lover whom Florence Mountjoy really loved 
8156-104526-0037	train-other-500	What had followed has been told already perhaps too often But at this moment as he stood in the gloom of the night below the porch in the front of the house
none	none	 swinging his stick at the top of the big steps an acknowledgment of contrition was very heavy upon him 
8156-104526-0038	train-other-500	Though he was prepared to go to law the moment that Augustus put himself forward as the eldest son he did recognize how long suffering his father had been and how much had been done for him in order if possible to preserve him
none	none	 And he knew whatever might be the result of his lawsuit that his father s only purpose had been to save the property for one of them As it was legacies which might be valued at perhaps thirty thousand pounds would be his He would expend it all on the lawsuit if he could find lawyers to undertake his suit 
8156-104526-0039	train-other-500	His anger too against his brother was quite as hot as was that of his father
none	none	 When he had been obliterated and obliged to vanish from the joint effects of his violence in the streets and his inability to pay his gambling debts at the club he had in an evil moment submitted himself to Augustus 
8156-104526-0040	train-other-500	and from that hour Augustus had become to him the most cruel of tyrants And this tyranny had come to an end with his absolute banishment from his brother s house
none	none	 Though he had been subdued to obedience in the lowest moment of his fall 
8156-104526-0041	train-other-500	he was not the man who could bear such tyranny well I can forgive my father he said but Augustus I will never forgive
none	none	 Then he went into the house 
8156-104526-0042	train-other-500	and in a short time was sitting at dinner with Merton the young doctor and secretary Miss Scarborough seldom came to table at that hour but remained in a room up stairs close to her brother
none	none	 so that she might be within call should she be wanted 
8156-104526-0043	train-other-500	Upon the whole Merton he said what do you think of my father
none	none	 The doctor shrugged his shoulders 
8156-104526-0044	train-other-500	Will he live or will he die He will die certainly Do not joke with me But I know you would not joke on such a subject And my question did not merely go to the state of his health What do you think of him as a man generally
8156-104526-0045	train-other-500	Do you call him an honest man How am I to answer you Just the truth If you will have an answer I do not consider him an honest man All this story about your brother is true or is not true
8156-104526-0046	train-other-500	In neither case can one look upon him as honest Just so But I think that he has within him a capacity for love and an unselfishness which almost atones for his dishonesty and there is about him a strange dislike to conventionality
8156-104526-0047	train-other-500	and to law which is so interesting as to make up the balance I have always regarded your father as a most excellent man but thoroughly dishonest He would rob any one but always to eke out his own gifts to other people He has therefore to my eyes been most romantic
8156-104526-0048	train-other-500	And as to his health Ah as to that I cannot answer so decidedly He will do nothing because I tell him Do you mean that you could prolong his life
none	none	 Certainly I think that I could He has exerted himself this morning whereas I have advised him not to exert himself He could have given himself the same counsel and would certainly live longer by obeying it than the reverse As there is no difficulty in the matter there need be no conceit on my part in saying that so far my advice might be of service to him How long will he live 
8156-104526-0049	train-other-500	Who can say Sir William Brodrick when that fearful operation was performed in London thought that a month would see the end of it That is eight months ago and he has more vitality now than he had then
none	none	 For myself I do not think that he can live another month 
8156-104526-0050	train-other-500	Later on in the evening Mountjoy Scarborough began again
none	none	 The governor thinks that you have behaved uncommonly well to him 
8156-104526-0051	train-other-500	I am paid for it all But he has not left you anything by his will I have certainly expected nothing and there could be no reason why he should
none	none	 He has entertained an idea of late that he wishes to make what reparation may be possible to me 
8156-104526-0052	train-other-500	and therefore as he says he does not choose to burden his will with legacies There is some provision made for my aunt who however has her own fortune He has told me to look after you It will be quite unnecessary said mister Merton
8156-104526-0053	train-other-500	If you choose to cut up rough you can do so I would propose that we should fix upon some sum which shall be yours at his death just as though he had left it to you Indeed he shall fix the sum himself Merton of course
none	none	 said that nothing of the kind would be necessary 
8156-104526-0054	train-other-500	but with this understanding Mountjoy Scarborough went that night to bed Early on the following morning his father again sent for him Mountjoy he said
none	none	 I have thought much about it and I have changed my mind 
8156-104526-0055	train-other-500	About your will No not about my will at all That shall remain as it is I do not think I should have strength to make another will nor do I wish to do so You mean about Merton I don t mean about Merton at all Give him five hundred pounds and he ought to be satisfied
none	none	 This is a matter of more importance than mister Merton or even than my will What is it said Mountjoy in a tone of much surprise I don t think I can tell you now But it is right that you should know that Merton wrote by my instructions to mister Grey early this morning and has implored him to come to Tretton once again There I cannot say more than that now Then he turned round on his couch as was his custom and was unassailable CHAPTER LIV RUMMELSBURG mister Scarborough again sent for mister Grey but a couple of weeks passed before he came At first he refused to come saying that he would send his clerk down if any work were wanted such as the clerk might do And the clerk did come and was very useful But mister Scarborough persevered using arguments which mister Grey found himself unable at last to resist He was dying and there would soon be an end of it That was his strongest argument Then it was alleged that a lawyer of experience was certainly needed and that mister Scarborough could not very well put his affairs into the hands of a stranger And old friendship was brought up And then at last the squire alleged that there were other secrets to be divulged respecting his family of which mister Scarborough thought that mister Grey would approve What could be the other secrets But it ended in mister Grey assenting to go in opposition to his daughter s advice I would have nothing more to do with him or his secrets Dolly had said You do not know him I know as much about him as a woman can know of a man she doesn t know and all from yourself You have said over and over again that he is a rascal Not a rascal I don t think I said he was a rascal I believe you used that very word Then I unsay it A rascal has something mean about him Juniper s a rascal He cares nothing for his word Nothing at all when the law is concerned And he has defamed his own wife That was done many years ago For a fixed purpose and not from passion Dolly continued He is a thoroughly bad man You have made his will for him and now I would leave him After that mister Grey declined for a second time to go But at last he was persuaded On the evening of his arrival he dined with Mountjoy and Merton and on that occasion Miss Scarborough joined them Of course there was much surmise as to the cause of this farther visit Merton declared that as he had acted as the sick man s private secretary he was bound to keep his secret as far as he knew it He only surmised what he believed to be the truth but of that he could say nothing Miss Scarborough was altogether in the dark She and she alone spoke of her brother with respect but in that she knew nothing I cannot tell what it is said Mountjoy but I suspect it to be something intended for my benefit and for the utter ruin of Augustus Miss Scarborough had now retired If it could be possible I should think that he intended to declare that all he had said before was false To this however mister Grey would not listen He was very stout in denying the possibility of any reversion of the decision to which they had all come Augustus was undoubtedly by law his father s eldest son He had seen with his own eyes copies of the registry of the marriage which mister Barry had gone across the Continent to make And in that book his wife had signed her maiden name according to the custom of the country This had been done in the presence of the clergyman and of a gentleman a German then residing on the spot who had himself been examined and had stated that the wedding as a wedding had been regular in all respects He was since dead but the clergyman who had married them was still alive Within twelve months of that time mister Scarborough and his bride had arrived in England and Augustus had been born Nothing but the most indisputable evidence would have sufficed to prove a fact by which you were so cruelly wronged he said addressing himself to Mountjoy And when your father told me that no wrong could be done to you as the property was hopelessly in the hands of the Jews I told him that for all purposes of the law the Jews were as dear to me as you were I do say that nothing but the most certain facts would have convinced me Such facts when made certain are immovable If your father has any plot for robbing Augustus he will find me as staunch a friend to Augustus as ever I have been to you When he had so spoken they separated for the night and his words had been so strong that they had altogether affected Mountjoy If such were his father s intentions it must be by some farther plot that he endeavored to carry it out and in his father s plots he would put no trust whatever And yet he declared his own purpose as he discussed the matter late into the night with Merton I cannot trust Grey at all nor my father either because I do not believe as Grey believes this story of the marriage My father is so clever and so resolute in his purpose to set aside all control over the property as arranged by law that to my mind it has all been contrived by himself Either mister Barry has been squared or the German parson or the foreign gentleman or more probably all of them mister Grey himself may have been squared for all I know though he is the kindest hearted gentleman I ever came across Anything shall be more probable to me than that I am not my father s eldest son To all this mister Merton said very little though no doubt he had his own ideas The next morning the three gentlemen with mister Grey s clerk sat down to breakfast solemn and silent The clerk had been especially entreated to say nothing of what he had learned and was therefore not questioned by his master But in truth he had learned but little having spent his time in the sorting and copying of letters which though they all bore upon the subject in hand told nothing of the real tale Farther surmises were useless now as at eleven o clock mister Grey and mister Merton were to go up together to the squire s room The clerk was to remain within call but there would be no need of Mountjoy I suppose I may as well go to bed said he or up to London or anywhere mister Grey very sententiously advised him at any rate not to go up to London The hour came and mister Grey with Merton and the clerk disappeared up stairs They were summoned by Miss Scarborough who seemed to feel heavily the awful solemnity of the occasion I am sure he is going to do something very dreadful this time she whispered to mister Grey who seemed himself to be a little awe struck and did not answer her At two o clock they all met again at lunch and mister Grey was silent and in truth very unhappy Merton and the clerk were also silent as was Miss Scarborough silent as death She indeed knew nothing but the other three knew as much as mister Scarborough could or would tell them Mountjoy was there also and in the middle of the meal broke out violently Why the mischief don t you tell me what it is that my father has said to you Because I do not believe a word of his story said mister Grey Oh mister Grey ejaculated Miss Scarborough I do not believe a word of his story repeated mister Grey Your father s intelligence is so high and his principles so low that there is no scheme which he does not think that he cannot carry out against the established laws of his country His present tale is a made up fable What do you say Merton asked Mountjoy It looks to me to be true said Merton But I am no lawyer Why don t you tell me what it is said Mountjoy I cannot tell you said Grey though he commissioned me to do so Greenwood there will tell you Greenwood was the name of the clerk But I advise you to take him with you to your own room And mister Merton would I am sure go with you As for me it would be impossible that I should do credit in the telling of it to a story of which I do not believe a single word Am I not to know asked Miss Scarborough plaintively Your nephew will tell you said mister Grey or mister Merton or mister Greenwood can do so if he has permission from mister Scarborough I would rather tell no one It is to me incredible With that he got up and walked away Now then Merton said Mountjoy rising from his chair Upon my word I hardly know what to do said Merton You must come and tell me this wonderful tale I suppose that in some way it does affect my interests It affects your interests very much Then I think I may say that I certainly shall believe it My father at present would not wish to do me an injury It must be told so come along mister Greenwood had better come also Then he left the room and the two men followed him They went away to the smoking room leaving mister Grey with Miss Scarborough Am I to know nothing about it said Miss Scarborough Not from me Miss Scarborough You can understand that I cannot tell you a story which will require at every word that I should explain my thorough disbelief in your brother I have been very angry with him and he has been more energetic than can have been good for him Ah me you will have killed him among you It has been his own doing You however had better go to him I must return to town this evening You will stay for dinner No I cannot stay for dinner I cannot sit down with Mountjoy who has done nothing in the least wrong because I feel myself to be altogether opposed to his interests I would rather be out of the house So saying he did leave the house and went back to London by train that afternoon The meeting that morning which had been very stormy cannot be given word by word From the moment in which the squire had declared his purpose the lawyer had expressed his disbelief in all that was said to him This mister Scarborough had at first taken very kindly but mister Grey clung to his purpose with a pertinacity which had at last beaten down the squire s good humor and had called for the interference of mister Merton How can I be quiet the squire had said when he tells me everything I say is a lie It is a lie said mister Grey who had lost all control of himself You should not say that mister Grey said Merton He should spare a man on his death bed who is endeavoring to do his duty by his children said the man who thus declared himself to be dying I will go away said mister Grey rising He has forced me to come here against my will and has known must have known that I should tell him what I thought Even though a man be dying a man cannot accept what he says on a matter of business such as this unless he believe him I must tell him that I believe him or that I do not I disbelieve the whole story and will not act upon it as though I believed it But even after this the meeting was continued mister Grey consenting to sit there and to hear what was said to the end The purport of mister Scarborough s story will probably have been understood by our readers It was mister Scarborough s present intention to make it understood that the scheme intended for the disinheritance of Mountjoy had been false from the beginning to the end and had been arranged not for the injury of Mountjoy but for the salvation of the estate from the hands of the Jews Mountjoy would have lost nothing as the property would have gone entirely to the Jews had mister Scarborough then died and Mountjoy been taken as his legitimate heir He was not anxious he had declared to say anything on the present occasion in defence of his conduct in that respect He would soon be gone and he would leave men to judge him who might do so the more honestly when they should have found that he had succeeded in paying even the Jews in full the moneys which they had actually advanced But now things were again changed and he was bound to go back to the correct order of things No shouted mister Grey To the correct order of things he went on Mountjoy Scarborough was he declared undoubtedly legitimate And then he made Merton and the clerk bring forth all the papers as though he had never brought forth any papers to prove the other statement to mister Grey And he did expect mister Grey to believe them mister Grey simply put them all back metaphorically with his hand There had been two marriages absolutely prepared with the intent of enabling him at some future time to upset the law altogether if it should seem good to him to do so And your wife shouted mister Grey Dear woman She would have done anything that I told her unless I had told her to do what was absolutely wrong Not wrong Well you know what I mean She was the purest and best of women Then he went on with his tale There had been two marriages and he now brought forth all the evidence of the former marriage It had taken place in a remote town a village in the northern part of Prussia whither she had been taken by her mother to join him The two ladies had both been since long dead He had been laid up at the little Prussian town under the plea of a bad leg He did not scruple to say now that the bad leg had been pretence and a portion of his scheme The law he thought in endeavoring to make arrangements for his property the property which should have been his own had sinned so greatly as to drive a wise man to much scheming He had begun scheming early in the business But for his bad leg the old lady would not have brought her daughter to be married at so out of the way a place as Rummelsburg in Pomerania He had travelled about and found Rummelsburg peculiarly fitted for his enterprise There was a most civil old Lutheran clergyman there to whom he had made himself peculiarly acceptable He had now certified copies of the registry at Rummelsburg which left no loop hole for doubt But he had felt that probably no inquiry would have been made about what had been done thirty years ago at Rummelsburg had he himself desired to be silent on the subject There will be no difficulty he said in making the Rummelsburg marriage known to all the world I think there will very great difficulty mister Grey had said Not the least But when I had to be married in the light of day after Mountjoy s birth at Nice in Italy then there was the difficulty It had to be done in the light of day and that little traveller with his nurse were with us Nice was in Italy then and some contrivance was I assure you necessary But it was done and I have always had with me the double sets of certificates As things have turned up I have had to keep mister Grey altogether in the dark as regards Rummelsburg It was very difficult but I have succeeded That mister Grey should have been almost driven to madness by such an outrage as this was a matter of course But he preferred to believe that Rummelsburg and not Nice was the myth How did your wife travel with you during the whole of that year he had asked As missus Scarborough no doubt But we had been very little in society and the world at large seemed willing to believe almost anything of me that was wrong However there s the Rummelsburg marriage and if you send to Rummelsburg you ll find that it s all right a little white church up a corner with a crooked spire The old clergyman is no doubt dead but I should imagine that they would keep their registers Then he explained how he had travelled about the world with the two sets of certificates and had made the second public when his object had been to convert Augustus into his eldest son Many people then had been found who had remembered something of the marriage at Nice and remembered to have remembered something at the time of having been in possession of some secret as to the lady But Rummelsburg had been kept quite in the dark Now it was necessary that a strong light should be thrown on the absolute legality of the Rummelsburg marriage He declared that he had more than once made up his mind to destroy those Rummelsburg documents but had always been deterred by the reflection that when they were once gone they could not be brought back again I had always intended he had said to burn the papers the last thing before my death But as I learned Augustus s character I made quite certain by causing them to be sealed up in a parcel addressed to him so that if I had died by accident they might have fallen into proper hands But I see now the wickedness of my project and therefore I give them over to mister Grey So saying he tendered the parcel to the attorney mister Grey of course refused to take or even to touch the Rummelsburg parcel He then prepared to leave the room declaring it would be his duty to act on the part of Augustus should Augustus be pleased to accept his services But mister Scarborough almost with tears implored him to change his purpose Why should you set two brothers by the ears At this mister Grey only shook his head incredulously And why ruin the property without an object The property will come to ruin Not if you will take the matter up in the proper spirit But if you determine to drive one brother to hostility against the other and promote unnecessary litigation of course the lawyers will get it all Then mister Grey left the room boiling with anger in that he with his legal knowledge and determination to do right had been so utterly thrown aside while mister Scarborough sank exhausted by the effort he had gone through CHAPTER LV mister GREY S REMORSE mister Grey s feeling as he returned home was chiefly one of self reproach so that though he persisted in not believing the story which had been told to him he did in truth believe it He believed at any rate in mister Scarborough mister Scarborough had determined that the property should go hither and thither according to his will without reference to the established laws of the land and had carried and would carry his purpose His object had been to save his estate from the hands of those harpies the money lenders and as far as he was concerned he would have saved it He had in fact forced the money lenders to lend their money without interest and without security and then to consent to accept their principal when it was offered to them No one could say but that the deed when done was a good deed But this man in doing it had driven his coach and horses through all the laws which were to mister Grey as Holy Writ and in thus driving his coach and horses he had forced mister Grey to sit upon the box and hold the reins mister Grey had thought himself to be a clever man at least a well instructed man but mister Scarborough had turned him round his finger this way and that way just as he had pleased mister Grey when in his rage he had given the lie to mister Scarborough had no doubt spoken as he had believed at that moment To him the new story must have sounded like a lie as he had been driven to accept the veritable lie as real truth He had looked into all the circumstances of the marriage at Nice and had accepted it He had sent his partner over and had picked up many incidental confirmations That there had been a marriage at Nice between mister Scarborough and the mother of Augustus was certain He had traced back mister Scarborough s movements before the marriage and could not learn where the lady had joined him who afterward became his wife but it had become manifest to him that she had travelled with him bearing his name But in Vienna mister Barry had learned that mister Scarborough had called the lady by her maiden name He might have learned that he had done so very often at other places but it had all been done in preparation for the plot in hand as had scores of other little tricks which have not cropped up to the surface in this narrative mister Scarborough s whole life had been passed in arranging tricks for the defeat of the law and it had been his great glory so to arrange them as to make it impossible that the law should touch him Mountjoy had declared that he had been defrauded The creditors swore with many oaths that they had been horribly cheated by this man Augustus no doubt would so swear very loudly No man could swear more loudly than did mister Grey as he left the squire s chamber after this last revelation But there was no one who could punish him The money lenders had no writing under his hand Had Mountjoy been born without a marriage ceremony it would have been very wicked but the vengeance of the law would not have reached him If you deceive your attorney with false facts he cannot bring you before the magistrates Augustus had been the most injured of all but a son though he may bring an action against his father for bigamy cannot summon him before any tribunal because he has married his mother twice over These were mister Scarborough s death bed triumphs but they were very sore upon mister Grey On his journey back to town as he turned the facts over more coolly in his mind he began to fear that he saw a glimmer of the truth Before he reached London he almost thought that Mountjoy would be the heir He had not brought a scrap of paper away with him having absolutely refused to touch the documents offered to him He certainly would not be employed again either by mister Scarborough or on behalf of his estate or his executors He had threatened that he would take up the cudgels on behalf of Augustus and had felt at the moment that he was bound to do so because as he had then thought Augustus had the right cause But as that idea crumbled away from him Augustus and his affairs became more and more distasteful to him After all it ought to be wished that Mountjoy should become the elder son even Mountjoy the incurable gambler It was terrible to mister Grey that the old fixed arrangement should be unfixed and certainly there was nothing in the character of Augustus to reconcile him to such a change But he was a very unhappy man when he put himself into a cab to be carried down to Fulham How much better would it have been for him had he taken his daughter s advice and persistently refused to make this last journey to Tretton He would have to acknowledge to his daughter that mister Scarborough had altogether got the better of him and his unhappiness would consist in the bitterness of that acknowledgment But when he reached the Manor House his daughter met him with news of her own which for the moment kept his news in abeyance Oh papa she said I am so glad you ve come He had sent her a telegram to say that he was coming Just when I got your message I was frightened out of my life Who do you think was here with me How am I to think my dear mister Juniper Who on earth is mister Juniper he asked Oh I remember Amelia s lover Do you mean to say you forgot mister Juniper I never shall forget him What a horrid man he is I never saw mister Juniper in my life What did he want of you He says you have ruined him utterly He came here about two o clock and found me at work in the garden He made his way in through the open gate and would not be sent back though one of the girls told him that there was nobody at home He had seen me and I could not turn him out of course What did he say to you Was he impudent He did not insult me if you mean that but he was impudent in not going away and I could not get rid of him for an hour He says that you have doubly ruined him As how You would not let Amelia have the fortune that you promised her and I think his object now was to get the fortune without the girl And he said also that he had lent five hundred pounds to your Captain Scarborough He is not my Captain Scarborough And that when you were settling the captain s debts his was the only one you would not pay in full He is a rogue an arrant rogue But he says that he s got the captain s name to the five hundred pounds and he means to get it some of these days now that the captain and his father are friends again The long and the short of it is that he wants five hundred pounds by hook or by crook and that he thinks you ought to let him have it He ll get it or the greater part of it There s no doubt he ll get it if he has got the captain s name If I remember right the captain did sign a note for him to that amount and he ll get the money if he has stuck to it Do you mean that Captain Scarborough would pay all his debts He will have to pay that one because it was not included in the schedule What do you think has turned up now Some other scheme It is all scheming base false scheming to have been concerned with which will be a disgrace to my name forever Oh papa Yes forever He has told me now that Mountjoy is his true legitimate eldest son He declares that that story which I have believed for the last eight months has been altogether false and made out of his own brain to suit his own purposes In order to enable him to defraud these money lenders he used a plot which he had concocted long since and boldly declared Augustus to be his heir He made me believe it and because I believed it even those greedy grasping men who would not have given up a tithe of their prey to save the whole family even they believed it too Now at the very point of death he comes forward with perfect coolness and tells me that the whole story was a plot made out of his own head Do you believe him now I became very wroth and said that it was a lie I did think that it was a lie I did flatter myself that in a matter concerning my own business and in which I was bound to look after the welfare of others he could not have so deceived me but I find myself as a child as a baby in his hands Then you do believe him now I am afraid so I will never see him again if it be possible for me to avoid him He has treated me as no one should have treated his enemy let alone a faithful friend He must have scoffed and scorned at me merely because I had faith in his word Who could have thought of a man laying his plots so deeply arranging for twenty years past the frauds which he has now executed For thirty years or nearly his mind has been busy on these schemes and on others no doubt which he has not thought it necessary to execute and has used me in them simply as a machine It is impossible that I should forgive him And what will be the end of it she asked Who can say But this is clear He has utterly destroyed my character as a lawyer No Nothing of the kind And it will be well if he have not done so as a man Do you think that when people hear that these changes have been made with my assistance they will stop to unravel it all and to see that I have been only a fool and not a knave Can I explain under what stress of entreaty I went down there on this last occasion Papa you were quite right to go He was your old friend and he was dying Even for this he was grateful Who will judge me as you do you who persuaded me that I should not have gone See how the world will use my name He has made me a party to each of his frauds He disinherited Mountjoy and he forced me to believe the evidence he brought Then when Mountjoy was nobody he half paid the creditors by means of my assistance They got all they were entitled to get No till the law had decided against them they were entitled to their bonds But they ruffians though they are had advanced so much hard money and I was anxious that they should get their hard money back again But unless Mountjoy had been illegitimate so as to be capable of inheriting nothing they would have been cheated and they have been cheated Will it be possible that I should make them or make others think that I have had nothing to do with it And Augustus who will be open mouthed what will he say against me In every turn and double of the man s crafty mind I shall be supposed to have turned and doubled with him I do not mind telling the truth about myself to you I should hope not The light that has guided me through my professional life has been a love of the law As far as my small powers have gone I have wished to preserve it intact I am sure that the Law and Justice may be made to run on all fours I have been so proud of my country as to make that the rule of my life The chance has brought me into the position of having for a client a man the passion of whose life has been the very reverse Who would not say that for an attorney to have such a man as mister Scarborough of Tretton for his client was not a feather in his cap But I have found him to be not only fraudulent but too clever for me In opposition to myself he has carried me into his paths He has never induced you to do anything that was wrong Nil conscire sibi that ought to be enough for a simple man But it is not enough for me It cannot be enough for a man who intends to act as an attorney for others Others must know it as well as I myself You know it But can I remain an attorney for you only There are some of whom just the other thing is known but then they look for work of the other kind I have never put up a shop board for sharp practice After this the sharpest kind of practice will be all that I shall seem to be fit for It isn t the money I can retire with enough for your wants and for mine If I could retire amid the good words of men I should be happy But even if I retire men will say that I have filled my pockets with plunder from Tretton That will never be said Were I to publish an account of the whole affair which I am bound in honor not to do explaining it all from beginning to end people would only say that I was endeavoring to lay the whole weight of the guilt upon my confederate who was dead Why did he pick me out for such usage me who have been so true to him There was something almost weak almost feminine in the tone of mister Grey s complaints But to Dolly they were neither feminine nor weak To her her father s grief was true and well founded but for herself in her own heart there was some joy to be drawn from it How would it have been with her if the sharp practice had been his and the success What would have been her state of mind had she known her father to have conceived these base tricks Or what would have been her condition had her father been of such a kind as to have taught her that the doing of such tricks should be indifferent to her To have been high above them all for him and for her was not that everything And was she not sure that the truth would come to light at last And if not here would not the truth come to light elsewhere where light would be of more avail than here Such was the consolation with which Dolly consoled herself On the next two days mister Grey went to his chambers and returned without any new word as to mister Scarborough and his affairs One day he did bring back some tidings as to Juniper Juniper has got into some row about a horse he said and is I fear in prison All the same he ll get his five hundred pounds and if he knew that fact it would help him I can t tell him papa I don t know where he lives Perhaps Carroll could do so I never speak to mister Carroll And I would not willingly mention Juniper s name to my aunt or to either of the girls It will be better to let Juniper go on in his row With all my heart said mister Grey And then there was an end of that On the next morning the fourth after his return from Tretton mister Grey received a letter from Mountjoy Scarborough He was sure he said that mister Grey would be sorry to hear that his father had been very weak since mister Grey had gone and unable even to see him Mountjoy for more than two or three minutes at a time He was afraid that all would soon be over but he and everybody around the squire had been surprised to find how cheerful and high spirited he was It seems wrote Mountjoy as though he had nothing to regret either as regards this world or the next He has no remorse and certainly no fear Nothing I think could make him angry unless the word repentance were mentioned to him To me and to his sister he is unwontedly affectionate but Augustus s name has not crossed his lips since you left the house Then he went on to the matter as to which his letter had been written What am I to do when all is over with him It is natural that I should come to you for advice I will promise nothing about myself but I trust that I may not return to the gambling table If I have this property to manage I may be able to remain down here without going up to London But shall I have the property to manage and what steps am I to take with the view of getting it Of course I shall have to encounter opposition but I do not think that you will be one of those to oppose me I presume that I shall be left here in possession and that they say is nine points of the law In the usual way I ought I presume simply to do nothing but merely to take possession The double story about the two marriages ought to count for nothing and I should be as though no such plots had ever been hatched But they have been hatched and other people know of them The creditors I presume can do nothing You have all the bonds in your possession They may curse and swear but will I imagine have no power I doubt whether they have a morsel of ground on which to raise a lawsuit for whether I or Augustus be the eldest son their claims have been satisfied in full But I presume that Augustus will not sit quiet What ought I to do in regard to him As matters stand at present he will not get a shilling I fear my father is too ill to make another will But at any rate he will make none in favor of Augustus Pray tell me what I ought to do and tell me whether you can send any one down to assist me when my father shall have gone I will meddle no farther with anything in which the name of Scarborough is concerned Such had been mister Grey s first assertion when he received Mountjoy s letter He would write to him and tell him that after what had passed there could be nothing of business transacted between him and his father s estate Nor was he in the position to give any advice on the subjects mooted He would wash his hands of it altogether But as he went home he thought over the matter and told himself that it would be impossible for him thus to repudiate the name He would undertake no lawsuit either on behalf of Augustus or of Mountjoy But he must answer Mountjoy s letter and tender him some advice During the long hours of the subsequent night he discussed the whole matter with his daughter and the upshot of his discussion was this that he would withdraw his name from the business and leave mister Barry to manage it mister Barry might then act for either party as he pleased CHAPTER LVI SCARBOROUGH S REVENGE All these things were not done at Tretton altogether unknown to Augustus Scarborough Tidings as to the will reached him and then he first perceived the injury he had done himself in lending his assistance to the payment of the creditors Had his brother been utterly bankrupt so that the Jews might have seized any money that might have come to him his father would have left no will in his favor All that was now intelligible to Augustus The idea that his father should strip the house of every stick of furniture and the estate of every chattel upon it had not occurred to him before the thing was done He had thought that his father was indifferent to all personal offence and therefore he had been offensive He found out his mistake and therefore was angry with himself But he still thought that he had been right in regard to the creditors Had the creditors been left in the possession of their unpaid bonds they would have offered terrible impediments to the taking possession of the property He had been right then he thought The fact was that his father had lived too long However the property would be left to him Augustus and he must make up his mind to buy the other things from Mountjoy He at any rate would have to provide the funds out of which Mountjoy must live and he would take care that he did not buy the chattels twice over It was thus he consoled himself till rumors of something worse reached his ears How the rumors reached him it would be difficult to say There were probably some among the servants who got an inkling of what the squire was doing when mister Grey again came down or Miss Scarborough had some confidential friend or mister Grey s clerk may have been indiscreet The tidings in some unformed state did reach Augustus and astounded him His belief in his father s story as to his brother s illegitimacy had been unfixed and doubtful Latterly it had verged toward more thorough belief as the creditors had taken their money less than a third of what would have been theirs had the power remained with them of recovering their full debt The creditors had thus proved their belief and they were a people not likely to believe such a statement without some foundation But at any rate he had conceived it to be impossible that his own father should go back from his first story and again make himself out to be doubly a liar and doubly a knave But if it were so what should he do Was it not the case that in such event he would be altogether ruined a penniless adventurer with his profession absolutely gone from him What little money he had got together had been expended on behalf of Mountjoy a sprat thrown out to catch a whale Everything according to the present tidings had been left to Mountjoy He had only half known his father who had turned against him with virulence because of his unkindness Who could have expected that a man in such a condition should have lived so long and have been capable of a will so powerful He had not dreamed of a hatred so inveterate as his father s for him He received news also from Tretton that his father was not now expected by any one to live long It may be a week the doctors say and it is hardly possible that he should remain alive for another month Such was the news which reached him from his own emissary at Tretton What had he better do in the emergency of the moment There was only one possibly effective step that he could take He might of course remain tranquil and accept what chance might give him when his father should have died But he might at once go down to Tretton and demand an interview with the dying man He did not think that his father even on his death bed would refuse to see him His father s pluck was indomitable and he thought that he could depend on his own pluck At any rate he resolved that he would immediately go to Tretton and take his chance He reached the house about the middle of the day and at once sent his name up to his father Miss Scarborough was sitting by her brother s bedside and from time to time was reading to him a few words Augustus he said as soon as the servant had left the room What does Augustus want with me The last time he saw me he bade me die out of hand if I wished to retrieve the injury I had done him Do not think of that now John his sister said As God is my judge I will think of it to the last moment Words such as those spoken by a son to his father demand a little thought Were I to tell you that I did not think of them would you not know that I was a hypocrite You need not speak of them John Not unless he came here to harass my last moments I strove to do very much for him you know with what return Mountjoy has been at any rate honest and straightforward and considering all things not lacking in respect I shall at any rate have some pleasure in letting Augustus know the state of my mind What shall I say to him his sister asked Tell him that he had better go back to London I have tried them both as few sons can be tried by their father and I know them now Tell him with my compliments that it will be better for him not to see me There can be nothing pleasant said between us I have no communication to make to him which could in the least interest him But before night came the squire had been talked over and had agreed to see his son The interview will be easy enough for me he had said but I cannot imagine what he will get from me But let him come as he will Augustus spent much of the intervening time in discussing the matter with his aunt But not a word on the subject was spoken by him to Mountjoy whom he met at dinner and with whom he spent the evening in company with mister Merton The two hours after dinner were melancholy enough The three adjourned to the smoking room and sat there almost without conversation A few words were said about the hunting but Mountjoy had not hunted this winter There were a few also of greater interest about the shooting The shooting was of course still the property of the old man and in the early months had without many words spoken become as it were an appanage of the condition of life to which Augustus aspired but of late Mountjoy had assumed the command You found plenty of pheasants here I suppose Augustus remarked Well yes not too many I didn t trouble myself much about it When I saw a pheasant I shot it I ve been a little troubled in spirit you know Gambling again I heard That didn t trouble me much Merton can tell you that we ve had a sick house Yes indeed said Merton It hasn t seemed to be a time in which a man would think very much of his pheasants I don t know why said Augustus who was determined not to put up with the rebuke implied in the doctor s words After that there was nothing more said between them till they all went to their separate apartments Don t contradict him his aunt said to him the next morning and if he reprimands you acknowledge that you have been wrong That s hard when I haven t been wrong But so much depends upon it and he is so stern Of course I wish well for both of you There is plenty enough plenty if only you could agree together But the injustice of his treatment Is it true that he now declares Mountjoy to be the eldest son I believe so I do not know but I believe it Think of what his conduct has been to me And then you tell me that I am to own that I have been wrong In what have I been wrong He is your father and I suppose you have said hard words to him Did I rebuke him because he had fraudulently kept me for so many years in the position of a younger son Did I not forgive him that iniquity But he says you are a younger son This last move he said with great passion has only been made in an attempt to punish me because I would not tell him that I was under a world of obligations to him for simply declaring the truth as to my birth We cannot both be his eldest son No certainly not both At last he declared that I was his heir If I did say hard words to him were they not justified Not to your father said Miss Scarborough shaking her head That is your idea How was I to abstain Think what had been done to me Through my whole life he had deceived me and had attempted to rob me But he says that he had intended to get the property for you To get it It was mine According to what he said it was my own He had robbed me to give it to Mountjoy Now he intends to rob me again in order that Mountjoy may have it He will leave such a kettle of fish behind him with all his manoeuvring that neither of us will be the better of Tretton Then he went to the squire In spite of what had passed between him and his aunt he had thought deeply of his conduct to his father in the past and of the manner in which he would now carry himself He was aware that he had behaved not badly for that he esteemed nothing but most unwisely When he had found himself to be the heir to Tretton he had fancied himself to be almost the possessor and had acted on the instincts which on such a case would have been natural to him To have pardoned the man because he was his father and then to have treated him with insolent disdain as some dying old man almost entirely beneath his notice was what he felt the nature of the circumstances demanded And whether the story was true or false it would have been the same He had come at last to believe it to be true and had therefore been the more resolute but whether it were true or false the old man had struck his blow and he must abide by it Till the moment came in which he had received that communication from Tretton the idea had never occurred to him that another disposition of the property might still be within his father s power But he had little known the old man s power or the fertility of his resources or the extent of his malice After what you have done you should cease to stay and disturb us he had once said when his father had jokingly alluded to his own death He had at once repented and had felt that such a speech had been iniquitous as coming from a son But his father had at the moment expressed no deep animosity Some sarcastic words had fallen from him of which Augustus had not understood the bitterness But he had remembered it since and was now not so much surprised at his father s wish to injure him as at his power But could he have any such power mister Grey he knew was on his side and mister Grey was a thorough lawyer All the world was on his side all the world having been instructed to think and to believe that mister Scarborough had not been married till after Mountjoy was born All the world had been much surprised and would be unwilling to encounter another blow Should he go into his father s room altogether penitent or should he hold up his head and justify himself One thing was brought home to him by thinking as a matter of which he might be convinced No penitence could now avail him anything He had at any rate by this time looked sufficiently into his father s character to be sure that he would not forgive such an offence as had been his Any vice any extravagance almost any personal neglect would have been pardoned I have so brought him up the father would have said and the fault must be counted as my own But his son had deliberately expressed a wish for his father s death and had expressed it in his father s presence He had shown not only neglect which may arise at a distance and may not be absolutely intentional but these words had been said with the purpose of wounding and were and would be unpardonable Augustus as he went along the corridor to his father s room determined that he would at any rate not be penitent Well sir how do you find yourself he said walking in briskly and putting out his hand to his father The old man languidly gave his hand but only smiled I hear of you though not from you and they tell me that you have not been quite so strong of late I shall soon cease to stay and trouble you said the squire with affected weakness in a voice hardly above a whisper using the very words which Augustus had spoken There have been some moments between us sir which have been unfortunately unpleasant And yet I have done so much to make them pleasant to you I should have thought that the offer of all Tretton would have gone for much with you Augustus was again taken in There was a piteous whine about his father s voice which once more deceived him He did not dream of the depth of the old man s anger He did not imagine that at such a moment it could boil over with such ferocity nor was he altogether aware of the cat like quietude with which he could pave the way for his last spring Mountjoy by far the least gifted of the two had gained the truer insight to his father s character You had done much or rather as I supposed circumstances had done much Circumstances The facts I mean as to Mountjoy s birth and my own I have not always left myself to be governed by actual circumstances If there was any omission on my part of an expression of proper feeling I regret it I don t know that there was What is proper feeling There was no hypocrisy at any rate You sometimes are a little bitter sir I hope you won t find it so when I am gone I don t know what I said that has angered you but I may have been driven to say what I did not feel Certainly not to me I m not here to beg pardon for any special fault as I do not quite know of what I am accused Of nothing There is no accusation at all Nor what the punishment is to be I have learned that you have left to Mountjoy all the furniture in the house Yes poor boy when I found that you had turned him out I never turned him out not till your house was open to receive him You would not have wished him to go into the poor house I did the very best for him I kept him going when there was no one else to give him a shilling He must have had a bitter time said the father I hope it may have done him good I think I behaved to him just as an elder brother should have done He was not particularly grateful but that was not my fault Still I thought it best to leave him the old sticks about the place As he was to have the property it was better that he should have the sticks As he said this he managed to turn himself round and look his son full in the face Such a look as it was There was the gleam of victory and the glory of triumph and the venom of malice You wouldn t have them separated would you I have heard of some farther trick of this kind Just the ordinary way in which things ought to be allowed to run mister Grey who is a very good man persuaded me No man ought to interfere with the law An attempt in that direction led to evil Mountjoy is the eldest son you know I know nothing of the kind Oh dear no there is no question at all as to the date of my marriage with your mother We were married in quite a straightforward way at Rummelsburg When I wanted to save the property from those harpies I was surprised to find how easily I managed it Grey was a little soft there an excellent man but too credulous for a lawyer I do not believe a word of it You ll find it all go as naturally as possible when I have ceased to stay and be troublesome But one thing I must say in your favor What do you mean I never could have managed it all unless you had consented to that payment of the creditors Indeed I must say that was chiefly your own doing When you first suggested it I saw what a fine thing you were contriving for your brother I should think after that of leaving it all so that you need not find out the truth when I am dead I do think I had so managed it that you would have had the property Mountjoy who has some foolish feeling about his mother and who is obstinate as a pig would have fought it out but I had so contrived that you would have had it I had sealed up every document referring to the Rummelsburg marriage and had addressed them all to you I couldn t have made it safer could I I don t know what you mean You would have been enabled to destroy every scrap of the evidence which will be wanted to prove your brother s legitimacy Had I burned the papers I could not have put them more beyond poor Mountjoy s reach Now they are quite safe in mister Grey s office his clerk took them away with him I would not leave them here with Mountjoy because well you might come and he might be murdered Now mister Scarborough had had his revenge You think you have done your duty said Augustus I do not care two straws about doing my duty young man Here mister Scarborough raised himself in part and spoke in that strong voice which was supposed to be so deleterious to him Or rather in seeking my duty I look beyond the conventionalities of the world I think that you have behaved damnably and that I have punished you Because of Mountjoy s weakness because he had been knocked off his legs I endeavored to put you upon yours You at once turned upon me when you thought the deed was done and bade me go and bury myself You were a little too quick in your desire to become the owner of Tretton Park at once I have stayed long enough to give some farther trouble You will not say after this that I am non compos and unable to make a will You will find that under mine not one penny piece not one scrap of property will become yours Mountjoy will take care of you I do not doubt He must hate you but will recognize you as his brother I am not so soft hearted and will not recognize you as my son Now you may go away So saying he turned himself round to the wall and refused to be induced to utter another word Augustus began to speak but when he had commenced his second sentence the old man rung his bell Mary said he to his sister will you have the goodness to get Augustus to go away I am very weak and if he remains he will be the death of me He can t get anything by killing me at once it is too late for that Then Augustus did leave the room and before the night came had left Tretton also He presumed there was nothing for him to do there One word he did say to Mountjoy You will understand Mountjoy that when our father is dead Tretton will not become your property I shall understand nothing of the kind said Mountjoy but I suppose mister Grey will tell me what I am to do CHAPTER LVII mister PROSPER SHOWS HIS GOOD NATURE While these things were going on at Tretton and while mister Scarborough was making all arrangements for the adequate disposition of his property in doing which he had happily come to the conclusion that there was no necessity for interfering with what the law had settled mister Prosper was lying very ill at Buston and was endeavoring on his sick bed to reconcile himself to what the entail had done for him There could be no other heir to him but Harry Annesley As he thought of the unmarried ladies of his acquaintance he found that there was no one who would have done for him but Miss Puffle and Matilda Thoroughbung All others were too young or too old or chiefly penniless Miss Puffle would have been the exact thing only for that intruding farmer s son As he lay there alone in his bedroom his mind used to wander a little and he would send for Matthew his butler and hold confidential discussions with him I never did think sir that Miss Thoroughbung was exactly the lady said Matthew Why not Well sir there is a saying But you ll excuse me Go on Matthew There is a saying as how you can t make a silk purse out of a sow s ear I ve heard that Just so sir Now Miss Thoroughbung is a very nice lady I don t think she s a nice lady at all But Of course it s not becoming in me to speak against my betters and as a menial servant I never would Go on Matthew Miss Thoroughbung is Go on Matthew Well she is a sow s ear Ain t she now The servants here never would have looked upon her as a silk purse Wouldn t they Never She has a way with her just as though she didn t care for silk purses And it s my mind sir that she don t She wishes however to be uppermost and if she had come here she d have said so That can never be Thank God that can never be Oh no Brewers is brewers and must be There s mister Joe He s very well no doubt I haven t the pleasure of his acquaintance Him as is to marry Miss Molly But Miss Molly ain t the head of the family is she sir Here the squire shook his head You re the head of the family sir I suppose so And is I might make so bold as to speak Go on Matthew Miss Thoroughbung would be a little out of place at Buston Hall Now as to Miss Puffle Miss Puffle is a lady or was No doubt sir The Puffles is not quite equal to the Prospers as I can hear But the Puffles is ladies and gentlemen The servants below all give it up to them that they re real gentlefolk But Well She demeaned herself terribly with young Tazlehurst They all said as there were more where that came from What should they mean by that She d indulge in low abits such as never would have been put up with at Buston Hall a cursing and a swearing Miss Puffle Not herself I don t say that but it s like enough if you ad heard all But them as lets others do it almost does it themselves And them as lets others drink sperrrits o mornings come nigh to having a dram down their own throats Oh laws exclaimed mister Prosper thinking of the escape he had had You wouldn t have liked it sir if there had been a bottle of gin in the bedroom Here mister Prosper hid his face among the bedclothes It ain t all that comes silk out of the skein that does to make a purse of There were difficulties in the pursuit of matrimony of which mister Prosper had not thought His imagination at once pictured to himself a bride with a bottle of gin under her pillow and he went on shivering till Matthew almost thought that he had been attacked by an ague fit I shall give it up at any rate he said after a pause Of course you re a young man sir No I m not That is not exactly young You re an old fool to tell such lies Of course I m an old fool but I endeavor to be veracious I never didn t take a shilling as were yours nor a shilling s worth all the years I have known you mister Prosper What has that to do with it I m not a young man What am I to say sir Shall I say as you are middle aged The truth is Matthew I m worn out Then I wouldn t think of taking a wife Troubles have been too heavy for me to bear I don t think I was intended to bear trouble Man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward said Matthew I suppose so But one man s luck is harder than another s They ve been too many for me and I feel that I m sinking under them It s no good my thinking of marrying now That s what I was coming to when you said I was an old fool Of course I am an old fool Do have done with it mister Harry hasn t been exactly what he ought to have been to me He s a very comely young gentleman What has comely to do with it Them as is plain featured is more likely to stay at home and be quiet You couldn t expect one as is so handsome to stay at Buston and hear sermons I don t expect him to be knocking men about in the streets at midnight It ain t that sir I say it is that Very well sir Only we ve all heard down stairs as mister Harry wasn t him as struck the first blow It was all about a young lady I know what it was about A young lady as is a young lady This was felt to the quick by mister Prosper in regard to the gin drinking Miss Puffle and the brewer bred Miss Thoroughbung but as he was beginning to think that the continuation of the family of the Prospers must depend on the marriage which Harry might make he passed over the slur upon himself for the sake of the praise given to the future mother of the Prospers And when a young gentleman has set his heart on a young lady he s not going to be braggydoshoed out of it Captain Scarborough knew her first First come first served isn t always the way with lovers mister Harry was the conquering hero Weni widi wici Halloo Matthew Them s the words as they say a young gentleman ought to use when he s got the better of a young lady s affections and I dare say they re the very words as put the captain into such a towering passion I can understand how it happened just as if I saw it But he went away and left him bleeding and speechless He d knocked his weni widi wici out of him I guess I think mister Prosper you should forgive him mister Prosper had thought so too but had hardly known how to express himself after his second burst of anger But he was at the present ill and weak and was anxious to have some one near to him who should be more like a silk purse than his butler Matthew Suppose you was to send for him sir He wouldn t come Let him alone for coming They tell me sir Who tells you Why sir the servants now at the rectory Of course sir where two families is so near connected the servants are just as near it s no more than natural They tell me now that since you were so kind about the allowance their talk of you is all changed Then the squire s anger was heated hot again Their talk had all been against him till he had opened his hand in regard to the allowance And now when there was something again to be got they could be civil There was none of that love of him for himself for which an old man is always hankering for which the sick man breaks his heart but which the old and sick find it so difficult to get from the young and healthy It is in nature that the old man should keep the purse in his own pocket or otherwise he will have so little to attract He is weak querulous ugly to look at apt to be greedy cross and untidy Though he himself can love what is his love to any one Duty demands that one shall smooth his pillow and some one does smooth it as a duty But the old man feels the difference and remembers the time when there was one who was anxious to share it mister Prosper was not in years an old man and had not as yet passed that time of life at which many a man is regarded by his children as the best of their playfellows But he was weak in body self conscious and jealous in spirit He had the heart to lay out for himself a generous line of conduct but not the purpose to stick to it steadily His nephew had ever been a trouble to him because he had expected from his nephew a kind of worship to which he had felt that he was entitled as the head of the family All good things were to come from him and therefore good things should be given to him Harry had told himself that his uncle was not his father and that it had not been his fault that he was his uncle s heir He had not asked his uncle for an allowance He had grown up with the feeling that Buston Hall was to be his own and had not regarded his uncle as the donor His father with his large family had never exacted much had wanted no special attention from him And if not his father then why his uncle But his inattention his absence of gratitude for peculiar gifts had sunk deep into mister Prosper s bosom Hence had come Miss Thoroughbung as his last resource and Miss Thoroughbung had called him Peter Hence his mind had wandered to Miss Puffle and Miss Puffle had gone off with the farmer s son and as he was now informed had taken to drinking gin Therefore he turned his face to the wall and prepared himself to die On the next day he sent for Matthew again Matthew first came to him always in the morning but on that occasion very little conversation ever took place In the middle of the day he had a bowl of soup brought to him and by that time had managed to drag himself out of bed and to clothe himself in his dressing gown and to seat himself in his arm chair Then when the soup had been slowly eaten he would ring his bell and the conversation would begin I have been thinking over what I was saying yesterday Matthew Matthew simply assented but he knew in his heart that his master had been thinking over what he himself had said Is mister Harry at the rectory Oh yes he s there now He wouldn t stir from the rectory till he hears that you are better Why shouldn t he stir Does he mean to say that I m going to die Perhaps I am I m very weak but he doesn t know it Matthew felt that he had made a blunder and that he must get out of it as well as he could It isn t that he is thinking anything of that but you are confined to your room sir Of course he knows that I never told him He s most particular in his inquiries from day to day Does he come here He don t venture on that because he knows as how you wouldn t wish it Why shouldn t I wish it It d be the most natural thing in the world But there has been a little I m quite sure mister Harry don t wish to intrude If you d let me give it to be understood that you d like him to call he d be over here in a jiffy Then very slowly mister Prosper did give it to be understood that he would take it as a compliment if his nephew would walk across the park and ask after him He was most particular as to the mode in which this embassy should be conducted Harry was not to be made to think that he was to come rushing into the house after his old fashion Halloo uncle aren t you well Hope you ll be better when I come back Have got to be off by the next train Then he used to fly away and not be heard of again for a week And yet the message was to be conveyed with an alluring courtesy that might be attractive and might indicate that no hostility was intended But it was not to be a positive message but one which would signify what might possibly take place If it should happen that mister Harry was walking in this direction it might also happen that his uncle would be pleased to see him There was no better ambassador at hand than Matthew and therefore Matthew was commissioned to arrange matters If you can get at missus Weeks and do it through his mother suggested mister Prosper Then Matthew winked and departed on his errand In about two hours there was a ring at the back door of which mister Prosper knew well the sound Miss Thoroughbung had not been there very often but he had learned to distinguish her ring or her servant s In old days not so very far removed Harry had never been accustomed to ring at all But yet his uncle knew that it was he and not the doctor who might probably come or mister Soames of whose coming he lived in hourly dread You can show him up he said to Matthew opening the door with great exertion and attempting to speak to the servant down the stairs Harry at any rate was shown up and in two minutes time was standing over his uncle s sick chair I have not been quite well just lately he said in answer to the inquiries made We are very sorry to hear that sir I suppose you ve heard it before We did hear that you were a little out of sorts Out of sorts I don t know what you call out of sorts I have not been out of this room for well nigh a month My sister came to see me one day and that s the last Christian I ve seen My mother would be over daily if she fancied you d like it She has her own duties and I don t want to be troublesome The truth is Uncle Prosper that we have all felt that we have been in your black books and as we have not thought that we deserved it there has been a little coolness I told your mother that I was willing to forgive you Forgive me what A fellow does not care to be forgiven when he has done nothing But if you ll only say that by gones shall be by gones quite past I ll take it so He could not give up his position as head of the family so easily an injured head of the family And yet he was anxious that by gones should be by gones if only the young man would not be so jaunty as he stood there by his arm chair Just say the word and the girls shall come up and see you as they used to do mister Prosper thought at the moment that one of the girls was going to marry Joe Thoroughbung and that he would not wish to see her As for myself if I ve been in any way negligent I can only say that I did not intend it I do not like to say more because it would seem as though I were asking you for money I don t know why you shouldn t ask me A man doesn t like to do that But I d tell you of everything if you d only let me What is there to tell said Uncle Prosper knowing well that the love story would be communicated to him I ve got myself engaged to marry a young woman A young woman Yes she s a young woman of course but she s a young lady as well You know her name it is Florence Mountjoy That is the young lady that I ve heard of Was there not some other gentleman attached to her There was her cousin Mountjoy Scarborough His father wrote to me His father is the meanest fellow I ever met And he himself came to me down here They were fighting your battle for you I m much obliged to them For even I have interfered with him about the lady Then Harry had to repeat his veni vidi vici after his own fashion Of course I interfered with him How is a fellow to help himself We both of us were spooning on the same girl and of course she had to decide it And she decided for you I fancy she did At any rate I decided for her and I mean to have her Then mister Prosper was for him very gracious in his congratulations saying all manner of good things of Miss Mountjoy I think you d like her Uncle Prosper mister Prosper did not doubt but that he would appease the solicitor He also had heard of Miss Mountjoy and what he had heard had been much to the young lady s credit Then he asked a few questions as to the time fixed for the marriage Here Harry was obliged to own that there were difficulties Miss Mountjoy had promised not to marry for three years without her mother s consent Three years said mister Prosper Then I shall be dead and buried Harry did not tell his uncle that in that case the difficulty might probably vanish as the same degree of fate which had robbed him of his poor uncle would have made him owner of Buston In such a case as that missus Mountjoy might probably give way But why is the young lady to be kept from marriage for three years Does she wish it Harry said that he did not exactly think that Miss Mountjoy on her own behalf did wish for so prolonged a separation The fact is sir that missus Mountjoy is not my best friend This nephew of hers Mountjoy Scarborough has always been her favorite But he s a man that always loses his money at cards He s to have all Tretton now it seems And what does the young lady say All Tretton won t move her I m not a bit afraid I ve got her word and that s enough for me How it is that her mother should think it possible that s what I do not know The three years are quite fixed I don t quite say that altogether But a young lady who will be true to you will be true to her mother also Harry shook his head He was quite willing to guarantee Florence s truth as to her promise to him but he did not think that her promise to her mother need be put on the same footing I shall be very glad if you can arrange it any other way Three years is a long time Quite absurd you know said Harry with energy What made her fix on three years I don t know how they did it between them missus Mountjoy perhaps thought that it might give time to her nephew Ten years would be the same as far as he is concerned Florence is a girl who when she says that she loves a man means it For you don t suppose I intend to remain three years What do you intend to do One has to wait a little and see Then there was a long pause during which Harry stood twiddling his fingers He had nothing farther to suggest but he thought that his uncle might say something Shall I come again to morrow Uncle Prosper he said I have got a plan said Uncle Prosper What is it uncle I don t know that it can lead to anything It s of no use of course if the young lady will wait the three years I don t think she s at all anxious said Harry You might marry almost at once That s what I should like And come and live here In this house Why not I m nobody You d soon find that I m nobody That s nonsense Uncle Prosper Of course you re everybody in your own house You might endure it for six months in the year Harry thought of the sermons but resolved at once to face them boldly I am only thinking how generous you are It s what I mean I don t know the young lady and perhaps she mightn t like living with an old gentleman In regard to the other six months I ll raise the two hundred and fifty pounds to five hundred pounds If she thinks well of it she should come here first and let me see her She and her mother might both come Then there was a pause I should not know how to bear it I should not indeed But let them both come After some farther delay this was at last decided on Harry went away supremely happy and very grateful and mister Prosper was left to meditate on the terrible step he had taken CHAPTER LVIII mister SCARBOROUGH S DEATH It is a melancholy fact that mister Barry when he heard the last story from Tretton began to think that his partner was not so wide awake as he had hitherto always regarded him As time runs on such a result generally takes place in all close connections between the old and the young Ten years ago mister Barry had looked up to mister Grey with a trustful respect Words which fell from mister Grey were certainly words of truth but they were in mister Barry s then estimation words of wisdom also Gradually an altered feeling had grown up and mister Barry though he did not doubt the truth thought less about it But he did doubt the wisdom constantly The wisdom practised under mister Barry s vice management was not quite the same as mister Grey s And mister Barry had come to understand that though it might be well to tell the truth on occasions it was folly to suppose that any one else would do so He had always thought that mister Grey had gone a little too fast in believing Squire Scarborough s first story But you ve been to Nice yourself and discovered that it is true mister Grey would say mister Barry would shake his head and declare that in having to deal with a man of such varied intellect as mister Scarborough there was no coming at the bottom of a story But there had been no question of any alterations in the mode of conducting the business of the firm mister Grey had been of course the partner by whose judgment any question of importance must ultimately be decided and though mister Barry had been sent to Nice the Scarborough property was especially in mister Grey s branch He had been loud in declaring the iniquity of his client but had altogether made up his mind that the iniquity had been practised and all the clerks in the office had gone with him trusting to his great character for sober sagacity And mister Grey was not a man who would easily be put out of his high position The respect generally felt for him was too high and he carried himself before his partner and clerks too powerfully to lose at once his prestige But mister Barry when he heard the new story looked at his own favorite clerk and almost winked an eye and when he came to discuss the matter with mister Grey he declined even to pretend to be led at once by mister Grey s opinion A gentleman who has been so very clever on one occasion may be very clever on another That had been his argument mister Grey s reply had simply been to the effect that you cannot twice catch an old bird with chaff mister Barry seemed however to think in discussing the matter with the favorite clerk that the older the bird became the more often he could be caught with chaff mister Grey in these days was very unhappy not made so simply by the iniquity of his client but by the insight which he got into his partner s aptitude for business He began to have his doubts about mister Barry mister Barry was tending toward sharp practice mister Barry was beginning to love his clients not with a proper attorney s affection as his children but as sheep to be shorn With mister Grey the bills had gone out and had been paid no doubt and the money had in some shape found its way into mister Grey s pockets But he had never looked at the two things together mister Barry seemed to be thinking of the wool as every client came or was dismissed mister Grey as he thought of these things began to fancy that his own style of business was becoming antiquated He had said good words of mister Barry to his daughter but just at this period his faith both in himself and in his partner began to fail His partner was becoming too strong for him and he felt that he was failing Things were changed and he did not love his business as he used to do He had fancies and he knew that he had fancies and that fancies were not good for an attorney When he saw what was in mister Barry s mind as to this new story from Tretton he became convinced that Dolly was right Dolly was not fit he thought to be mister Barry s wife She might have been the wife of such another as himself had the partner been such another But it was not probable that any partner should have been such as he was Old times are changed he said to himself old manners gone Then he determined that he would put his house in order and leave the firm A man cannot leave his work forever without some touch of melancholy But it was necessary that some one should go to Rummelsburg and find what could be learned there mister Grey had sworn that he would have nothing to do with the new story as soon as the new story had been told to him but it soon became apparent to him that he must have to do with it As soon as the breath should be out of the old squire s body some one must take possession of Tretton and Mountjoy would be left in the house In accordance with mister Grey s theory Augustus would be the proper possessor Augustus no doubt would go down and claim the ownership unless the matter could be decided to the satisfaction of them both beforehand mister Grey thought that there was little hope of such satisfaction but it would of course be for him or his firm to see what could be done That I should ever have got such a piece of business he said to himself But it was at last settled among them that mister Barry should go to Rummelsburg He had made the inquiry at Nice and he would go on with it at Rummelsburg mister Barry started with mister Quaverdale of saint John s the gentleman whom Harry Annesley had consulted as to the practicability of his earning money by writing for the Press mister Quaverdale was supposed to be a German scholar and therefore had his expenses paid for him with some bonus for his time A conversation between mister Barry and mister Quaverdale which took place on their way home shall be given as it will best describe the result of their inquiry This inquiry had been conducted by mister Barry s intelligence but had owed so much to mister Quaverdale s extensive knowledge of languages that the two gentlemen may be said as they came home to be equally well instructed in the affairs of mister Scarborough s property He has been too many for the governor said Barry mister Barry s governor was mister Grey It seems to me that Scarborough is a gentleman who is apt to be too many for most men The sharpest fellow I ever came across either in the way of a cheat or in any other walk of life If he wanted any one else to have the property he d come out with something to show that the entail itself was all moonshine But when he married again at Nice he couldn t have quarrelled with his eldest son already The child was not above four or five months old This came from Quaverdale It s my impression said Barry that it was then his intention to divide the property and that this was done as a kind of protest against primogeniture Then he found that that would fail that if he came to explain the whole matter to his sons they would not consent to be guided by him and to accept a division From what I have seen of both of them they are bad to guide after that fashion Then Mountjoy got frightfully into the hands of the money lenders and in order to do them it became necessary that the whole property should go to Augustus They must look upon him as a nice sort of old man said Quaverdale Rather But they have never got at him to speak a bit of their mind to him And then how clever he was in getting round his own younger son The property got into such a condition that there was money enough to pay the Jews the money they had really lent Augustus who was never quite sure of his father thought it would be best to disarm them and he consented to pay them getting back all their bonds But he was very uncivil to the squire told him that the sooner he died the better or something of that sort and then the squire immediately turned round and sprung this Rummelsburg marriage upon us and has left every stick about the place to Mountjoy It must all go to Mountjoy every acre every horse every bed and every book And these in twelve months time will have been divided among the card players of the metropolis said Quaverdale We ve got nothing to do with that If ever a man did have a lesson he has had it If he chose to take it no man would ever have been saved in so miraculous a manner But there can be no doubt that John Scarborough and Ada Sneyd were married at Rummelsburg and that it will be found to be impossible to unmarry them Old missus Sneyd the lady s mother was then present said Quaverdale Not a doubt about it and that Fritz Deutchmann was present at the marriage I almost think that we ought to have brought him away with us It would have cost a couple of hundred pounds but the estate can bear that We can have him by sending for him if we should want it Then after many more words on the same subject and to the same effect mister Barry went on to give his own private opinions In fact the only blemish in old Scarborough s plans was this that the Rummelsburg marriage was sure to come out sooner or later Do you think so Fritz Deutchmann is the only one of the party alive and it s not probable that he would ever have heard of Tretton These things always do come out But it does not signify now And the world will know how godless and reprobate old Scarborough has been but that will not interfere with Mountjoy s legitimacy And the world has pretty well understood already that the old man has cared nothing for God or man It was bad enough according to the other story that he should have kept Augustus so long in the dark and determined to give it all to a bastard by means of a plot and a fraud The world has got used to that The world will simply be amused by this other turn And as the world generally is not very fond of Augustus Scarborough and entertains a sort of a good natured pity for Mountjoy the first marriage will be easily accepted There ll be a lawsuit I suppose said Quaverdale I don t see that they ll have a leg to stand on When the old man dies the property will be exactly as it would have been This latter intended fraud in favor of Augustus will be understood as having been old Scarborough s farce The Jews are the party who have really suffered And Augustus He will have lost nothing to which he was by law entitled His father might of course make what will he pleased If Augustus was uncivil to his father his father could of course alter his will The world would see all that But the world will be inclined to say that these poor money lenders have been awfully swindled The world won t pity them I m not so sure It s a hard case to get hold of a lot of men and force them to lend you a hundred pounds without security and without interest That s what has been done in this case They ll have no means of recovering anything Not a shilling The wonder is that they should have got three hundred thousand pounds They never would have had it unless the squire had wished to pave the way back for Mountjoy And then he made Augustus do it for him In my mind he has been so clever that he ought to be forgiven all his rascality There has been too no punishment for him and no probability of punishment He has done nothing for which the law can touch him He has proposed to cheat people but before he would have cheated them he might be dead The money lenders will have been swindled awfully but they have never had any ground of tangible complaint against him Who are you he has said I don t know you They alleged that they had lent their money to his eldest son That s as you thought he replied I ain t bound to come and tell you all the family arrangements about my marriage If you look at it all round it was uncommonly well done When mister Barry got back he found that it was generally admitted at the Chambers that the business had been well done Everybody was prepared to allow that mister Scarborough had not left a screw loose in the arrangement though he was this moment on his death bed and had been under surgical tortures and operations and in fact slowly dying during the whole period that he had been thus busy Every one concerned in the matter seemed to admire mister Scarborough except mister Grey whose anger either with himself or his client became the stronger the louder grew the admiration of the world A couple of barristers very learned in the law were consulted and they gave it as their opinion that from the evidence as shown to them there could be no doubt but that Mountjoy was legitimate There was no reason in the least for doubting it but for that strange episode which had occurred when in order to get the better of the law mister Scarborough had declared that at the time of Mountjoy s birth he had not been married They went on to declare that on the squire s death the Rummelsburg marriage must of course have been discovered and had given it as their opinion that the squire had never dreamed of doing so great an injustice either to his elder or his younger son He had simply desired as they thought to cheat the money lenders and had cheated them beautifully That mister Tyrrwhit should have been so very soft was a marvel to them but it only showed how very foolish a sharp man of the world might be when he encountered one sharper And Augustus through an attorney acting on his own behalf consulted two other barristers whose joint opinion was not forthcoming quite at once but may have to be stated Augustus was declared by them to have received at his father s hands a most irreparable injury to such an extent that an action for damages would in their opinion lie He had by accepting his father s first story altered the whole course of his life abandoned his profession and even paid large sums of money out of his own pocket for the maintenance of his elder brother A jury would probably award him some very considerable sum if a jury could get hold of his father while still living No doubt the furniture and other property would remain and might be held to be liable for the present owner s laches But these two learned lawyers did not think that an action could be taken with any probability of success against the eldest son with reference to his tables and chairs when the Tretton estates should have become his As these learned lawyers had learned that old mister Scarborough was at this moment almost in articulo mortis would it not be better that Augustus should apply to his elder brother to make him such compensation as the peculiarities of the case would demand But as this opinion did not reach Augustus till his father was dead the first alternative proposed was of no use I suppose sir we had better communicate with mister Scarborough mister Barry said to his partner on his return Not in my name mister Grey replied I ve put mister Scarborough in such a state that he is not allowed to see any business letter Sir William Brodrick is there now But communications were made both to Mountjoy and to Augustus There was nothing for Mountjoy to do his case was in mister Barry s hands nor could he take any steps till something should be done to oust him from Tretton Augustus however immediately went to work and employed his counsel learned in the law You will do something I suppose for poor Gus the old man said to his son one morning It was the last morning on which he was destined to awake in the world and he had been told by Sir William and by mister Merton that it would probably be so But death to him had no terror Life to him for many weeks past had been so laden with pain as to make him look forward to a release from it with hope But the business of life had pressed so hard upon him as to make him feel that he could not tell what had been accomplished The adjustment of such a property as Tretton required he thought his presence and till it had been adjusted he clung to life with a pertinacity which had seemed to be oppressive Now Mountjoy s debts had been paid and Mountjoy could be left a bit happier Having achieved so much he was delighted to think that he might But there had come latterly a claim upon him equally strong that he should wreak his vengeance upon Augustus Had Augustus abused him for keeping him in the dark so long he would have borne it patiently He had expected as much But his son had ridiculed him laughed at him made nothing of him and had at last told him to die out of the way He would at any rate do something before he died He had had his revenge very bitter of its kind Augustus should be made to feel that he had not been ridiculous not to be laughed at in his last days He had ruined his son inevitably ruined him and was about to leave him penniless upon the earth But now in his last moments in his very last there came upon him some feeling of pity and in speaking of his son he once more called him Gus I don t know how it will all be sir but if the property is to be mine It will be yours it must be yours Then I will do anything for him that he will accept Do not let him starve or have to earn his bread Say what you wish sir and it shall be done as far as I can do it Make an offer to him of some income and settle it on him Do it at once The old man as he said this was thinking probably of the great danger that all Tretton might before long have been made to vanish And Mountjoy Sir You have gambled surely enough for amusement With such a property as this in your hands gambling becomes very serious They were the last words the last intelligible words which the old man spoke He died with his left hand on his son s neck and took Merton and his sister by his side It was a death bed not without its lesson not without a certain charm in the eyes of some fancied beholder Those who were there seemed to love him well and should do so He had contrived in spite of his great faults to create a respect in the minds of those around him which is itself a great element of love But there was something in his manner which told of love for others He was one who could hate to distraction and on whom no bonds of blood would operate to mitigate his hatred He would persevere to injure with a terrible persistency but yet in every phase of his life he had been actuated by love for others He had never been selfish thinking always of others rather than of himself Supremely indifferent he had been to the opinion of the world around him but he had never run counter to his own conscience For the conventionalities of the law he entertained a supreme contempt but he did wish so to arrange matters with which he was himself concerned as to do what justice demanded Whether he succeeded in the last year of his life the reader may judge But certainly the three persons who were assembled around his death bed did respect him and had been made to love him by what he had done Merton wrote the next morning to his friend Henry Annesley respecting the scene The poor old boy has gone at last and in spite of all his faults I feel as though I had lost an old friend To me he has been most kind and did I not know of all his sins I should say that he had been always loyal and always charitable mister Grey condemns him and all the world must condemn him One cannot make an apology for him without being ready to throw all truth and all morality to the dogs But if you can imagine for yourself a state of things in which neither truth nor morality shall be thought essential then old mister Scarborough would be your hero He was the bravest man I ever knew He was ready to look all opposition in the face and prepared to bear it down And whatever he did he did with the view of accomplishing what he thought to be right for other people Between him and his God I cannot judge but he believed in an Almighty One and certainly went forth to meet him without a fear in his heart CHAPTER LIX JOE THOROUGHBUNG S WEDDING While some men die others are marrying While the funeral dirge was pealing sadly at Tretton the joyful marriage bells were ringing both at Buntingford and Buston Joe Thoroughbung dressed all in his best was about to carry off Molly Annesley to Rome previous to settling down to a comfortable life of hunting and brewing in his native town Miss Thoroughbung sent her compliments to missus Annesley Would her brother be there She thought it probable that mister Prosper would not be glad to see her She longed to substitute Peter for mister Prosper but abstained In such case she would deny herself the pleasure of seeing Joe turned off Then there was an embassy sent to the Hall The two younger girls went with the object of inviting Uncle Prosper but with a desire at their hearts that Uncle Prosper might not come I presume the family at Buntingford will be represented Uncle Prosper had asked Somebody will come I suppose said Fanny Then Uncle Prosper had sent down a pretty jewelled ring and said that he would remain in his room His health hardly permitted of his being present with advantage So it was decided that Miss Thoroughbung should come and every one felt that she would be the howling spirit if not at the ceremony at the banquet which would be given afterward Miss Thoroughbung was not the only obstacle had the whole been known Young Soames the son of the attorney with whom mister Prosper had found it so evil a thing to have to deal was to act as Joe s best man mister Prosper learned this probably from Matthew but he never spoke of it to the family It was a sad disgrace in his eyes that any Soames should have been so far mixed up with the Prosper blood Young Algy Soames was in himself a very nice sort of young fellow who liked a day s hunting when he could be spared out of his father s office and whose worst fault was that he wore loud cravats But he was an abomination to mister Prosper who had never seen him As it was he carried himself very mildly on this occasion It s a pity we re not to have two marriages at the same time said mister Crabtree a clerical wag from the next parish Don t you think so missus Annesley missus Annesley was standing close by as was also Miss Thoroughbung but she made no answer to the appeal People who understood anything knew that missus Annesley would not be gratified by such an allusion But mister Crabtree was a man who understood nothing The old birds never pair so readily as the young ones said Miss Thoroughbung Old Who talks of being old said mister Crabtree My friend Prosper is quite a boy There s a good time coming and I hope you ll give way yet Miss Thoroughbung Then they were all marshalled on their way to church It is quite out of my power to describe the bride s dress or that of the bride s maids They were the bride s sisters and two of Joe s sisters An attempt had been made to induce Florence Mountjoy to come down but it had been unsuccessful Things had gone so far now at Cheltenham that missus Mountjoy had been driven to acknowledge that if Florence held to her project for three years she should be allowed to marry Harry Annesley But she had accompanied this permission by many absurd restrictions Florence was not to see him at any rate during the first year but she was to see Mountjoy Scarborough if he came to Cheltenham Florence declared this to be impossible but as the Buston marriage took place just at this moment she could not have her way in everything Joe drove up to the church with Algy Soames it not having been thought discreet that he should enter the parsonage on that morning though he had been there nearly every day through the winter I declare here he is said Miss Thoroughbung very loudly I never thought he d have the courage at the last moment I wonder how a certain gentleman would have felt when it came to his last moment said mister Crabtree missus Annesley took to weeping bitterly which seemed to be unnecessary as she had done nothing but congratulate herself since the match had first been made and had rejoiced greatly that one of her numerous brood should have put into such a haven of rest My dear missus Annesley said missus Crabtree consoling her in that she would not be far removed from her child you can almost see the brewery chimneys from the church tower Those who knew the two ladies well were aware that there was some little slur intended by the allusion to brewery chimneys missus Crabtree s girl had married the third son of Sir Reginald Rattlepate The Rattlepates were not rich and the third son was not inclined to earn his bread Thank God yes said missus Annesley through her tears Whenever I shall see them I shall know that there s an income coming out with the smoke The boys were home from school for the occasion Molly there s Joe coming after you said the elder If he gives you a kiss now you needn t pretend to mind said the other My darling my own one that so soon will be my own no longer said the father as he made his way into the vestry to put on his surplice Dear papa It was the only word the bride said as she walked in at the church door and prepared to make her way up the nave at the head of her little bevy They were all very bright as they stood there before the altar but the brightest spot among them was Algy Soames s blue necktie Joe for the moment was much depressed and thought nothing of the last run in which he had distinguished himself but nevertheless he held up his head well as a man and a brewer Dont ee take on so Miss Thoroughbung said to missus Annesley at the last moment He ll give her plenty to eat and to drink and will never do her a morsel of harm Joe overheard this and wished that his aunt was back in her bed at Marmaduke Lodge Then the marriage was over and they all trooped into the vestry to sign the book You can t get out of that now said missus Crabtree to Joe I don t want to I have got the fairest girl in these parts for my wife and as I believe the best young woman This he said with a spirit for which missus Crabtree had not given him credit and Algy Soames heard him and admired his friend beneath his blue necktie And one of the girls heard it and cried tears of joy as she told her sister afterward in the bedroom Oh what a darling he is Molly had said amid her own sobbing Joe stood an inch higher among them all because of that word Then came the breakfast that dullest saddest hour of all To feed heavily about twelve in the morning is always a nuisance a nuisance so abominable that it should be avoided under any other circumstances than a wedding in your own family But that wedding breakfast when it does come is the worst of all feeding The smart dresses and bare shoulders seen there by daylight the handing people in and out among the seats the very nature of the food made up of chicken and sweets and flummery the profusion of champagne not sometimes of the very best on such an occasion and then the speeches They fall generally to the lot of some middle aged gentlemen who seem always to have been selected for their incapacity But there is a worse trouble yet remaining in the unnatural repletion which the sight even of so much food produces and the fact that your dinner for that day is destroyed utterly and forever mister Crabtree and the two fathers made the speeches over and beyond that which was made by Joe himself Joe s father was not eloquent He brewed no doubt good beer without a taste in it beyond malt and hops no man in the county brewed better beer but he couldn t make a speech He got up dressed in a big white waistcoat and a face as red as his son s hunting coat and said that he hoped his boy would make a good husband All he could say was that being a lover had not helped to make him a good brewer Perhaps when Molly Annesley was brought nearer to Buntingford Joe mightn t spend so much of his time in going to and fro Perhaps mister Joe might not demand so much of her attention This was the great point he made and it was received well by all but the bride who whispered to Joe that if he thought that he was to be among the brewing tubs from morning till night he d find he was mistaken mister Annesley threw a word or two of feeling into his speech as is usual with the father of the young lady but nobody seemed to care much for that mister Crabtree was facetious with the ordinary wedding jests as might have been expected seeing that he had been present at every wedding in the county for the last twenty years The elderly ladies laughed good humoredly and missus Crabtree was heard to say that the whole affair would have been very tame but that mister Crabtree had carried it all off But in truth when Joe got up the fun of the day had commenced for Miss Thoroughbung though she kept her chair was able to utter as many words as her nephew I m sure I m very much obliged to you for what you ve all been saying So you ought sir for you have heard more good of yourself than you ll ever hear again Then I m the more obliged to you What my people have said about my being so long upon the road That s only just what you have told them at the brewery Nobody knows where you have been Molly can tell you all about that I can t tell them anything Molly said in a whisper But it comes only once in a man s lifetime continued Joe and I dare say if we knew all about the governor when he was of my age which I don t remember he was as spooney as any one I only saw him once for six months before he was married said missus Thoroughbung in a funereal voice He s made up for it since said Miss Thoroughbung I m sure I m very proud to have got such a young lady to have come and joined her lot with mine continued Joe and nobody can think more about his wife s family than I do And all Buston said the aunt Yes and all Buston I m sure we re all sorry that the bride s uncle from Buston Hall has not been able to come here to day You ought to say that Joe Yes I do say it I m very sorry that mister Prosper isn t able to be here Perhaps Miss Thoroughbung can tell us something about him said mister Crabtree Me I know nothing special When I saw him last he was in good health I did nothing to him to make him keep his bed missus Crabtree seems to think that I have got your uncle in my keeping Molly I beg to say that I m not responsible It must be allowed that amid such free conversation it was difficult for Joe to shine as an orator But as he had no such ambition perhaps the interruptions only served him But Miss Thoroughbung s witticism did throw a certain damp over the wedding breakfast It was perhaps to have been expected that the lady should take her revenge for the injury done to her It was the only revenge that she did take She had been ill used she thought and yet she had not put mister Prosper to a shilling of expense And there was present to her a feeling that the uncle had at the last moment been debarred from complying with her small requests in favor of Miss Tickle and the ponies on behalf of the young man who was now sitting opposite to her and that the good things coming from Buston Hall were to be made to flow in the way of the Annesleys generally rather than in her way She did not regret them very much and it was not in her nature to be bitter but still all those little touches about mister Prosper were pleasant to her and were of course unpleasant to the Annesleys Then it will be said she should not have come to partake of a breakfast in mister Annesley s dining room That is a matter of taste and perhaps Miss Thoroughbung s taste was not altogether refined Joe s speech came to an end and with it his aunt s remarks But as she left the room she said a few words to mister Annesley Don t suppose that I am angry not in the least certainly not with you or Harry I d do him a good turn to morrow if I could and so for the matter of that I would to his uncle But you can t expect but what a woman should have her feelings and express them mister Annesley on the other hand thought it strange that a woman in such a position should express her feelings Then at last came the departure Molly was taken up into her mother s room and cried over for the last time I know that I m an old fool Oh mamma now dearest mamma A good husband is the greatest blessing that God can send a girl and I do think that he is good and sterling He is mamma he is I know he is And when that woman talks about brewery chimneys I know what a comfort it is that there should be chimneys and that they should be near Brewery chimneys are better than a do nothing scamp that can t earn a meal for himself or his children And when I see Joe with his pink coat on going to the meet I thank God that my Molly has got a lad that can work hard and ride his own horses and go out hunting with the best of them Oh mamma I do like to see him then He is handsome I would not have anything altered But but Oh my child you are going away As missus Crabtree says I sha n t be far No no But you won t be all mine The time will come when you ll think of your girls in the same way You haven t done a thing that I haven t seen and known and pondered over you haven t worn a skirt but what it has been dear to me you haven t uttered a prayer but what I have heard it as it went up to God s throne I hope he says his prayers I m sure he does said Molly with confidence more or less well founded Now go and leave me here I m such an old stupid that I can t help crying and if that woman was to say anything more to me about the chimneys I should give her a bit of my mind Then Molly went down with her travelling hat on looking twice prettier than she had done during the whole of the morning ceremonies It is I suppose on the bridegroom s behalf that the bride is put forth in all her best looks just as she is about to become for the first time exclusively his own Molly on the present occasion was very pretty and Joe was very proud It was not the least of his pride that he feeling himself to be not quite as yet removed from the Bung to the Thorough had married into a family by which his ascent might be matured And then as they went came the normal shower of rice to be picked up in the course of the next hour by the vicarage fowls and not by the London beggars and the air was darkened by a storm of old shoes In London white satin slippers are the fashion But Buston and Buntingford combined could not afford enough of such missiles and from the hands of the boys black shoes and boots too were thrown freely There go my best pair said one of the boys as the chariot was driven off and I don t mean to let them lie there Then the boots were recovered and taken up to the bedroom Now that Molly was gone Harry s affairs became paramount at Buston After all Harry was of superior importance to Molly though those chimneys at Buntingford could probably give a better income than the acres belonging to the park But Harry was to be the future Prosper of the county to assume at some future time the family name and there was undoubtedly present to them all at the parsonage a feeling that Harry Annesley Prosper would loom in future years a bigger squire than the parish had ever known before He had got a fellowship which no Prosper had ever done and he had the look and tone of a man who had lived in London which had never belonged to the Prospers generally And he was to bring a wife with a good fortune and one of whom a reputation for many charms had preceded her And Harry having been somewhat under a cloud for the last six months was now emerging from it brighter than ever Even Uncle Prosper could not do without him That terrible Miss Thoroughbung had thrown a gloom over Buston Hall which could only be removed as the squire himself had felt by the coming of the natural heir Harry was indispensable and was no longer felt by any one to be a burden It was now the end of March Old mister Scarborough was dead and buried and Mountjoy was living at Tretton Nothing had been heard of his coming up to London No rushing to the card tables had been announced That there were to be some terrible internecine law contests between him and Augustus had been declared in many circles but of this nothing was known at the Buston Rectory Harry had been one day at Cheltenham and had been allowed to spend the best part of an hour with his sweetheart but this permission had been given on the understanding that he was not to come again and now for a month he had abstained Then had come his uncle s offer that generous offer under which Harry was to bring his wife to Buston Hall and live there during half the year and to receive an increased allowance for his maintenance during the other half As he thought of his ways and means he fancied that they would be almost rich She would have four hundred a year and he as much and an established home would be provided for them Of all these good things he had written to Florence but had not yet seen her since the offer had been made Her answer had not been as propitious as it might be and it was absolutely necessary that he should go down to Cheltenham and settle things The three years had in his imagination been easily reduced to one which was still as he thought an impossible time for waiting By degrees it came down to six months in his imagination and now to three resulting in an idea that they might be easily married early in June so as to have the whole of the summer before them for their wedding tour Mother he said I shall be off to morrow To Cheltenham Yes to Cheltenham What is the good of waiting I think a girl may be too obedient to her mother It is a fine feeling which you will be glad to remember that she possessed Supposing that you had declared that Molly shouldn t have married Joe Thoroughbung Molly has got a father said missus Annesley Suppose she had none I cannot suppose anything so horrible As if you and he had joined together to forbid Molly But we didn t I think a girl may carry it too far said Harry missus Mountjoy has committed herself to Mountjoy Scarborough and will not go back from her word He has again come back to the fore and out of a ruined man has appeared as the rich proprietor of the town of Tretton Of course the mother hangs on to him still You don t think Florence will change Not in the least I m not a bit afraid of Mountjoy Scarborough and all his property but I can see that she may be subjected to much annoyance from which I ought to extricate her What can you do Harry Go and tell her so Make her understand that she should put herself into my hands at once and that I could protect her Take her away from her mother by force said missus Annesley with horror If she were once married her mother would think no more about it I don t believe that missus Mountjoy has any special dislike to me She thinks of her own nephew and as long as Florence is Florence Mountjoy there will be for her the chance I know that he has no chance and I don t think that I ought to leave her there to be bullied for some endless period of time Think of three years of dooming a girl to live three years without ever seeing her lover There is an absurdity about it which is revolting I shall go down to morrow and see if I cannot put a stop to it To this the mother could make no objection though she could express no approval of a project under which Florence was to be made to marry without her mother s consent CHAPTER LX mister SCARBOROUGH IS BURIED When mister Scarborough died and when he had been buried his son Mountjoy was left alone at Tretton living in a very desolate manner Till the day of the funeral Merton the doctor had remained with him and his aunt Miss Scarborough but when the old squire had been laid in his grave they both departed Miss Scarborough was afraid of her nephew and could not look forward to living comfortably at the big house and doctor Merton had the general work of his life to call him away You might as well stay for another week Mountjoy had said to him But Merton had felt that he could not remain at Tretton without some especial duty and he too went his way The funeral had been very strange Augustus had refused to come and stand at his father s grave Considering all things I had rather decline he had written to Mountjoy Other guests none were invited except the tenants They came in a body for the squire had been noted among them as a liberal landlord But a crowd of tenants does not in any way make up that look of family sorrow which is expected at the funeral of such a man as mister Scarborough Mountjoy was there and stood through the ceremony speechless and almost sullen He went down to the church behind the body with Merton and then walked away from the ground without having uttered a syllable But during the ceremony he had seen that which caused him to be sullen mister Samuel Hart had been there and mister Tyrrwhit And there was a man whom he called to his mind as connected with the names of Evans Crooke and mister Spicer and mister Richard Juniper He knew them all as they stood there round the grave not in decorous funeral array but as strangers who had strayed into the cemetery He could not but feel as he looked at them and they at him that they had come to look after their interest their heavy interest on the money which had been fraudulently repaid to them He knew that they had parted with their bonds But he knew also that almost all that was now his would have been theirs had they not been cheated into believing that he Mountjoy Scarborough was not and never would be Scarborough of Tretton Park They said nothing as they stood there and did not in any way interrupt the ceremony but they looked at Mountjoy as they were standing and their looks disconcerted him terribly He had declared that he would walk back to the house which was not above two miles distant from the graveyard and therefore when the funeral was over there was no carriage to take him But he knew that the men would dog his steps as he walked He had only just got within the precincts of the park when he saw them all But mister Tyrrwhit was by himself and came up to him What are you going to do Captain Scarborough he said as to our claims You have no claims of which I am aware he said roughly Oh yes Captain Scarborough we have claims certainly You ve come up to the front lately with a deal of luck I don t begrudge it for one but I have claims I and those other gentlemen we have claims You ll have to admit that Send in the documents mister Barry is acting as my lawyer he is mister Grey s partner and is now taking the leading share in the business I know mister Barry well a very sharp gentleman is mister Barry I cannot enter into conversation with yourself at such a time as this We are sorry to trouble you but then our interests are so pressing What do you mean to do Captain Scarborough That s the question Yes with the estate said mister Samuel Hart coming up and joining them Of the lot of men mister Samuel Hart was the most distasteful to Mountjoy He had last seen his Jew persecutor at Monte Carlo and had then as he thought been grossly insulted by him What are you hafter captain To this Mountjoy made no answer but Hart walking a step or two in advance turned upon his heels and looked at the park around him Tidy sort of place ain t it Tyrrwhit for a gentleman to hang his at up when we were told he was a bastard not worth a shilling I have nothing to do with all that said Mountjoy you and mister Tyrrwhit held my acceptances for certain sums of money They have I believe been paid in full No they ain t they ain t been paid in full at all you knows they ain t As he said this mister Hart walked on in front and stood in the pathway facing Mountjoy How can you ave the cheek to say we ve been paid in full You know it ain t true Evans Crooke haven t been paid so far said a voice from behind More ain t Spicer said another voice Captain Scarborough I haven t been paid in full said mister Juniper advancing to the front You don t mean to tell me that my five hundred pounds have been paid in full You ve ruined me Captain Scarborough I was to have been married to a young lady with a large fortune your mister Grey s niece and it has been broken off altogether because of your bad treatment Do you mean to assert that I have been paid in full If you have got any document take it to mister Barry No I won t I won t take it to any lawyer I ll take it right in before the Court and expose you My name is Juniper and I ve never parted with a morsel of paper that has your name to it Then no doubt you ll get your money said the captain I thought gentlemen you were to allow me to be the spokesman on this occasion said mister Tyrrwhit We certainly cannot do any good if we attack the captain all at once Now Captain Scarborough we don t want to be uncivil Uncivil be blowed said mister Hart I want to get my money and mean to ave it I agreed as you was to speak mister Tyrrwhit but I means to be spoken up for and if no one else can do it I can do it myself Is we to have any settlement made to us or is we to go to law I can only refer you to mister Barry said Mountjoy walking on very rapidly He thought that when he reached the house he might be able to enter in and leave them out and he thought also that if he kept them on the trot he would thus prevent them from attacking him with many words Evans Crooke were already lagging behind and mister Spicer was giving signs of being hard pressed Even Hart who was younger than the others was fat and short and already showed that he would have to halt if he made many speeches Barry be d d exclaimed Hart You see how it is Captain Scarborough said Tyrrwhit Your father as has just been laid to rest in hopes of a a happy resurrection was a very peculiar gentleman The most hinfernal swindler I ever eard tell of said Hart I don t wish to say a word disrespectful continued Tyrrwhit but he had his own notions He said as you was illegitimate didn t he now I can only refer you to mister Barry said Mountjoy And he said that mister Augustus was to have it all and he proved his words didn t he now And then he made out that if so our deeds weren t worth the paper they were written on Isn t it all true what I m saying And then when we d taken what small sums of money he chose to offer us just to save ourselves from ruin then he comes up and says you are the heir as legitimate as anybody else and are to have all the property And he proves that too What are we to think about it There was nothing left for Mountjoy Scarborough but to make the pace as good as possible mister Hart tried once and again to stop their progress by standing in the captain s path but could only do this sufficiently at each stoppage to enable him to express his horror with various interjections Oh laws that such a liar as e should ever be buried You can t do anything by being disrespectful mister Hart said Tyrrwhit What is it he means to do ejaculated Spicer mister Spicer said Mountjoy I mean to leave it all in the hands of mister Barry and if you will believe me no good can be done by any of you by hunting me across the park Hare you a bastard or haren t you ejaculated Hart No mister Hart I am not Then pay us what you h owes us You h ain t h agoing to say as you don t h owe us mister Tyrrwhit said the captain it is of no use my answering mister Hart because he is angry H angry By George I h am angry I d like to pull that h old sinner s bones h out of the ground But to you I can say that mister Barry will be better able to tell you than I am what can be done by me to defend my property Captain Scarborough said mister Tyrrwhit mildly we had your name you know We did have your name And my father bought the bonds back Oh laws And he calls himself a shentleman I have nothing farther to say to you now gentlemen and can only refer you to mister Barry The path on which they were walking had then brought them to the corner of a garden wall through which a door opened into the garden Luckily at the moment it occurred to Mountjoy that there was a bolt on the other side of the gate and he entered it quickly and bolted the door mister Tyrrwhit was left on the other side and was joined by his companions as quickly as their failing breath enabled them to do so Ere s a go said mister Hart striking the door violently with the handle of his stick He had nothing for it but to leave us when we attacked him altogether said mister Tyrrwhit If you had left it to me he would have told us what he intended to do You mister Hart had not so much cause to be angry as you had received a considerable sum for interest Then mister Hart turned upon mister Tyrrwhit and abused him all the way back to their inn But it was pleasant to see how these commercial gentlemen all engaged in the natural course of trade expressed their violent indignation not so much as to their personal losses but at the commercial dishonesty generally of which the Scarboroughs father and son had been and were about to be guilty Mountjoy when he reached the house of which he was now the only occupant besides the servants stood for an hour in the dining room with his back toward the fire thinking of his position He had many things of which to think In the first place there were these pseudo creditors who had just attacked him in his own park with much acrimony He endeavored to comfort himself by telling himself that they were certainly pseudo creditors to whom he did not in fact owe a penny mister Barry could deal with them But then his conscience reminded him that they had in truth been cheated cheated by his father for his benefit For every pound which they had received they would have claimed three or four They would no doubt have cheated him But how was he now to measure the extent of his father s fraud against that of his creditors And though it would have been right in him to resist the villany of these Jews he felt that it was not fit that he should escape from their fangs altogether by his father s deceit He had not become so dead to honor but that noblesse oblige did still live within his bosom And yet there was nothing that he could do to absolve his bosom The income of the estate was nearly clear the money brought in by the late sales having all but sufficed to give these gentlemen that which his father had chosen to pay them But was he sure of that income He had just now asserted boldly that he was the legitimate heir to the property but did he know that he was so Could he believe his father Had not mister Grey asserted that he would not accept this later evidence Was he not sure that Augustus intended to proceed against him and was he not aware that nothing could be called his own till that lawsuit should have been decided If that should be given against him then these harpies would have been treated only too well then there would be no question at any rate by him as to what noblesse oblige might require of him He could take no immediate step in regard to them and therefore for the moment drove that trouble from his mind But what should he do with himself as to his future life To be persecuted and abused by these wretched men as had this morning been his fate would be intolerable Could he shut himself up from mister Samuel Hart and still live in England And then could he face the clubs if the clubs would be kind enough to re elect him And then there came a dark frown across his brow as he bethought himself that even at this moment his heart was longing to be once more among the cards Could he not escape to Monaco and there be happy among the gambling tables mister Hart would surely not follow him there and he would be free from the surveillance of that double blackguard his brother s servant and his father s spy But after all as he declared to himself did it not altogether turn on the final answer which he might get from Florence Mountjoy Could Florence be brought to accede to his wishes he thought that he might still live happily respectably and in such a manner that his name might go down to posterity not altogether blasted If Florence would consent to live at Tretton then could he remain there He thought it over as he stood there with his back to the fire and he told himself that with Florence the first year would be possible and that after the first year the struggle would cease to be a struggle He knew himself he declared and he made all manner of excuses for his former vicious life basing them all on the hardness of her treatment of him He did not know himself and such assurances were vain But buoyed up by such assurances he resolved that his future fate must be in her hands and that her word alone should suffice either to destroy him or to save him Thinking thus of his future life he resolved that he would go at once to Cheltenham and throw himself and what of Tretton belonged to him at the girl s feet Nor could he endure himself to rest another night at Tretton till he had done so He started at once and got late to Gloucester where he slept and on the next morning at eleven o clock was at Cheltenham out on his way to Montpellier Terrace He at once asked for Florence but circumstances so arranged themselves that he first found himself closeted with her mother missus Mountjoy was delighted and yet shocked to see him My poor brother she said and he was buried only yesterday Such explanation as Mountjoy could give was given He soon made the whole tenor of his thoughts intelligible to her Yes Tretton was his at least he supposed so As to his future life he could say nothing It must depend on Florence He thought that if she would promise to become at once his wife there would be no more gambling He had felt it to be incumbent on him to come and tell her so missus Mountjoy frightened by the thorough blackness of his apparel and by the sternness of his manner had not a word to say to him in opposition Be gentle with her she said as she led the way to the room in which Florence was found Your cousin has come to see you she said has come immediately after the funeral I hope you will be gracious to him Then she closed the door and the two were alone together Florence he said Mountjoy We hardly expected you here so soon Where the heart strays the body is apt to follow I could speak to no one I could do nothing I could hope and pray for nothing till I had seen you You cannot depend on me like that she answered I do depend on you most entirely No human being can depend more thoroughly on another It is not my fortune that I have come to offer you or simply my love but in very truth my soul Mountjoy that is wicked Then wicked let it be It is true Tretton by singular circumstances is all my own free of debt At any rate I and others believe it to be so Tretton being all your own can make no difference I told you that I had not come to offer you my fortune And he almost scowled at her as he spoke You know what my career has hitherto been though you do not perhaps know what has driven me to it Shall I go back and live after the same fashion and let Tretton go to the dogs It will be so unless you take me and Tretton into your hands It cannot be Oh Florence think of it before you pronounce my doom It cannot be I love you well as my cousin and for your sake I love Tretton also I would suffer much to save you if any suffering on my part would be of avail But it cannot be in that fashion Then he scowled again at her Mountjoy you frighten me by your hard looks but though you were to kill me you cannot change me I am the promised wife of Harry Annesley and for his honor I must bid you plead this cause no more Then just at this moment there was a ring at the bell and a knock at the door each of them somewhat impetuous and Florence Mountjoy jumping up with a start knew that Harry Annesley was there CHAPTER LXI HARRY ANNESLEY IS ACCEPTED She knew that Harry Annesley was at the door He had written to say that he must come again though he had fixed no day for his coming She had been delighted to think that he should come though she had after her fashion scolded him for the promised visit But though his comings had not been frequent she recognized already the sounds of his advent When a girl really loves her lover the very atmosphere tells of his whereabouts She was expecting him with almost breathless expectation when her cousin Mountjoy was brought to her and so was her mother who had been told that Harry Annesley had business on which he intended to call But now the two foes must meet in her presence That was the idea which first came upon her She was sure that Harry would behave well Why should not a favored lover on such occasions always behave well But how would Mountjoy conduct himself when brought face to face with his rival As Florence thought of it she remembered that when last they met the quarrel between them had been outrageous And Mountjoy had been the sinner while Harry had been made to bear the punishment of the sin Harry when he was told that Miss Mountjoy was at home had at once walked in and opened for himself the door of the front room downstairs There he found Florence and Mountjoy Scarborough missus Mountjoy was still up stairs in her bedroom and was palpitating with fear as she thought of the anger of the two combative lovers To her belief Harry was of the two the most like to a roaring lion because she had heard of him that he had roared so dreadfully on that former occasion But she did not instantly go down detained in her bedroom by the eagerness of her fear and by the necessity of resolving how she would behave when she got there Harry when he entered stood a moment at the door and then hurrying across the room offered Scarborough his hand I have been so sorry he said to hear of your loss but your father s health was such that you could not have expected that his life should be prolonged Mountjoy muttered something but his mutterings as Florence had observed were made in courtesy And the two men had taken each other by the hand after that they could hardly fly at each other s throats in her presence Then Harry crossed to Florence and took her hand I never get a line from you he said laughing but what you scold me I think I escape better when I am present so here I am You always make wicked propositions and of course I scold you A girl has to go on scolding till she s married and then it s her turn to get it No wonder then that you talk of three years so glibly I want to be able to scold you All this was going on in Mountjoy s presence while he stood by silent black and scowling His position was very difficult that of hearing the billing and cooing of these lovers But theirs also was not too easy which made the billing and cooing necessary in his presence Each had to seem to be natural but the billing and cooing were in truth affected Had he not been there would they not have been in each other s arms and would not she have made him the proudest man in England by a loving kiss I was asking Miss Mountjoy when you came in to be my wife This Scarborough said with a loud voice looking Harry full in the face It cannot be said Florence I told you that for his honor and she laid her hand on Harry s arm I could listen to no such request The request has to be made again he said It will be made in vain said Harry So no doubt you think said Captain Scarborough You can ask herself said Harry Of course it will be made in vain said Florence Does he think that a girl in such a matter as that of loving a man can be turned here and there at a moment s notice that she can say yes and no alternately to two men It is impossible Harry Annesley has chosen me and I am infinitely happy in his choice Here Harry made an attempt to get his arm round her waist in which however she prevented him seeing the angry passion rising in her cousin s eyes He is to be my husband I hope I have told him that I love him and I tell you so also He has my promise and I cannot take it back without perjury to him and ruin absolute ruin to myself All my happiness in this world depends on him He is to me my own one absolute master to whom I have given myself altogether as far as this world goes Even were he to reject me I could not give myself to another My Florence my darling Harry exclaimed After having told you so much can you ask your cousin to be untrue to her word and to her heart and to become your wife when her heart is utterly within his keeping Mountjoy it is impossible What of me then he said Rouse yourself and love some other girl and marry her and so do well with yourself and with your property You talk of your heart he said and you bid me use my own after such fashion as that A man s heart can be changed but not a woman s His love is but one thing among many It is the one thing said Harry Then the door opened and missus Mountjoy entered the room Oh dear oh dear she said you both of you here together Yes we are both here together said Harry There was an unfortunate smile on his face as he said so which made Mountjoy Scarborough very angry The two men were both handsome two as handsome men as you shall see on a summer s day Mountjoy was dark visaged with coal black whiskers and mustaches with sparkling angry eyes and every feature of his face well cut and finely formed but there was absent from him all look of contentment or satisfaction Harry was light haired with long silken beard and bright eyes but there was usually present to his face a look of infinite joy which was comfortable to all beholders If not strong as was the other man s it was happy and eloquent of good temper But in one thing they were alike neither of them counted aught on his good looks Mountjoy had attempted to domineer by his bad temper and had failed but Harry without any attempt at domineering always doubting of himself till he had been assured of success by her lips had succeeded Now he was very proud of his success but he was proud of her and not of himself You come in here and boast of what you have done in my presence said Mountjoy Scarborough How can I not seem to boast when she tells me that she loves me said Harry For God s sake do not quarrel here said missus Mountjoy They shall not quarrel at all said Florence There is no cause for quarrelling When a girl has given herself away there should be an end of it No man who knows that she has done so should speak to her again in the way of love I will leave you now but Harry you must come again in order that I may tell you that you must not have it all your own way just as you please sir Then she gave him her hand and passing on at once to Mountjoy tendered her hand to him also You are my cousin and the head now of my mother s family I would fain know that you would say a kind word to me and bid me God speed He looked at her but did not take her hand I cannot do it he said I cannot bid you God speed You have ruined me trampled upon me destroyed me I am not angry with him and he pointed across the room to Harry Annesley nor with you but only with myself Then without speaking a word to his aunt he marched out of the room and left the house closing the front door after him with a loud noise which testified to his anger He has gone said missus Mountjoy with a tone of deep tragedy It is better so said Florence A man must take his chance in such warfare as this said Harry There is something about Mountjoy Scarborough that after all I like I do not love Augustus but with certain faults Mountjoy is a good fellow He is the head of our family said missus Mountjoy and is the owner of Tretton That is nothing to do with it said Florence It has much to do with it said her mother though you would never listen to me I had set my heart upon it but you have determined to thwart me And yet there was a time when you preferred him to every one else Never said Florence with energy Yes you did before mister Annesley here came in the way It was before I came at any rate said Harry I was young and I did not wish to be disobedient But I never loved him and I never told him so Now it is out of the question He will never come back again said missus Mountjoy mournfully I should be very glad to see him back when I and Florence are man and wife I don t care how soon we should see him No he will never come back said Florence not as he came to day That trouble is at last over mamma And my trouble is going to begin Why should there be any trouble Harry will not give you trouble will you Harry Never I trust said Harry He cannot understand said missus Mountjoy he knows nothing of the desire and ambition of my life I had promised him my child and my word to him is now broken He will have known mamma that you could not promise for me Now go Harry because we are flurried May I not ask him to come here to night and to drink tea with us This she said addressing her mother in a tone of sweetest entreaty To this missus Mountjoy unwillingly yielded and then Harry also took his departure Florence was aware that she had gained much by the interview of the morning Even to her it began to appear unnecessary that she should keep Harry waiting three years She had spoken of postponing the time of her servitude and of preserving for herself the masterdom of her own condition But in that respect the truth of her own desires was well understood by them all She was anxious enough to submit to her new master and she felt that the time was coming Her mother had yielded so much and Mountjoy had yielded Harry was saying to himself at this very moment that Mountjoy had thrown up the sponge She too was declaring the same thing for her own comfort in less sporting phraseology and what was much more to her her mother had nearly thrown up the sponge also In the worse days of her troubles any suitor had made himself welcome to her mother who would rescue her child from the fangs of that roaring lion Harry Annesley mister Anderson had been received with open arms and even M Grascour missus Mountjoy had then got it into her head that of all lions which were about in those days Harry roared the loudest His sins in regard to leaving poor Mountjoy speechless and motionless on the pavement had filled her with horror But Florence now felt that all that had come to an end Not only had Mountjoy gone away but no mention would probably be ever again made of Anderson or Grascour When Florence was preparing herself for tea that evening she sang a little song to herself as to the coming of the conquering hero A man must take his chance in such warfare as this she said repeating to herself her lover s words You can t expect me to be very bright her mother said to her before Harry came There was a sign of yielding in this also but Florence in her happiness did not wish to make her mother miserable Why not be bright mamma Don t you know that Harry is good No How am I to know anything about him He may be utterly penniless But his uncle has offered to let us live in the house and to give us an income mister Prosper has abandoned all idea of getting married He can be married any day And why do you want to live in another man s house when you may live in your own Tretton is ready for you the finest mansion in the whole county Here missus Mountjoy exaggerated a little but some exaggeration may be allowed to a lady in her circumstances Mamma you know that I cannot live at Tretton It is the house in which I was born How can that signify When such things happen they are used as additional grounds for satisfaction But I cannot marry your nephew because you were born in a certain house And all that is over now you know that Mountjoy will not come back again He would exclaimed the mother as though with new hopes Oh mamma how can you talk like that I mean to marry Harry Annesley you know that I do Why not make your own girl happy by accepting him Then missus Mountjoy left the room and went to her own chamber and cried there not bitterly I think but copiously Her girl would be the wife of the squire of Buston who after all was not a bad sort of fellow At any rate he would not gamble There had always been that terrible drawback And he was a fellow of his college in which she would look for and probably would find some compensation as to Tretton When therefore she came down to tea she was able to receive Harry not with joy but at least without rebuke Conversation was at first somewhat flat between the two If the old lady could have been induced to remain up stairs Harry felt that the evening would have been much more satisfactory But as it was he found himself enabled to make some progress He at once began to address Florence as his undoubted future spouse very slyly using words adapted for that purpose and she without any outburst of her intention as she had made when discussing the matter with her cousin answered him in the same spirit and by degrees came so to talk as though the matter were entirely settled And then at last that future day was absolutely brought on the tapis as though now to be named Three years ejaculated missus Mountjoy as though not even yet surrendering her last hope Florence from the nature of the circumstances received this in silence Had it been ten years she might have expostulated But a young lady s bashfulness was bound to appear satisfied with an assurance of marriage within three years But it was otherwise with Harry Good God missus Mountjoy we shall all be dead he cried out missus Mountjoy showed by her countenance that she was extremely shocked Oh Harry said Florence none of us I hope will be dead in three years I shall be a great deal too old to be married if I am left alive Three months you mean It will be just the proper time of year which does go for something And three months is always supposed to be long enough to allow a girl to get her new frocks You know nothing about it Harry said Florence And so the matter was discussed in such a manner that when Harry took his departure that evening he was half inclined to sing a song of himself about the conquering hero Dear mamma said Florence kissing her mother with all the warm clinging affection of former years It was very pleasant but still missus Mountjoy went to her room with a sad heart When there she sat for a while over the fire and then drew out her desk She had been beaten absolutely beaten and it was necessary that she should own so much in writing to one person So she wrote her letter which was as follows Dear Mountjoy After all it cannot be as I would have had it As they say Man proposes but God disposes I would have given her to you now and would even yet have trusted that you would have treated her well had it not been that mister Annesley has gained such a hold upon her affections She is wilful as you are and I cannot bend her It has been the longing of my heart that you two should live together at Tretton But such longings are I think wicked and are seldom realized I write now just this one line to tell you that it is all settled I have not been strong enough to prevent such settling He talks of three months But what does it matter Three months or three years will be the same to you and nearly the same to me Your affectionate aunt SARAH MOUNTJOY P S May I as your loving aunt add one word of passionate entreaty All Tretton is yours now and the honor of Tretton is within your keeping Do not go back to those wretched tables Mountjoy Scarborough when he received this letter cannot be said to have been made unhappy by it because he had already known all his unhappiness But he turned it in his mind as though to think what would now be the best course of life open to him And he did think that he had better go back to those tables against which his aunt had warned him and there remain till he had made the acres of Tretton utterly disappear There was nothing for him which seemed to be better And here at home in England even that would at present be impossible to him He could not enter the clubs and elsewhere Samuel Hart would be ever at his heels And there was his brother with his lawsuit though on that matter a compromise had already been offered to him Augustus had proposed to him by his lawyer to share Tretton He would never share Tretton His brother should have an income secured to him but he would keep Tretton in his own hands as long as the gambling tables would allow him He was in truth a wretched man as on that night he did make up his mind and ringing his bell called his servant out of his bed to bid him prepare everything for a sudden start He would leave Tretton on the following day or on the day after and intended at once to go abroad He is off for that place nigh to Italy where they have the gambling tables said the butler on the following morning to the valet who declared his master s intentions I shouldn t wonder mister Stokes said the valet I m told it s a beauteous country and I should like to see a little of that sort of life myself Alas alas Within a week from that time Captain Scarborough might have been seen seated in the Monte Carlo room without any friendly Samuel Hart to stand over him and guard him CHAPTER LXII THE LAST OF mister GREY I have put in my last appearance at the old chamber in Lincoln s Inn Fields said mister Grey on arriving home one day early in June Papa you don t mean it said Dolly I do Why not one day as well as another I have made up my mind that it is to be so I have been thinking of it for the last six weeks It is done now But you have not told me Well yes I have told you all that was necessary It has come now a little sudden that is all You will never go back again Well I may look in mister Barry will be lord and master At any rate he won t be my lord and master said Dolly showing by the tone of her voice that the matter had been again discussed by them since the last conversation which was recorded and had been settled to her father s satisfaction No you at least will be left to me But the fact is I cannot have any farther dealings with the affairs of mister Scarborough The old man who is dead was too many for me Though I call him old he was ever so much younger than I am Barry says he was the best lawyer he ever knew As things go now a man has to be accounted a fool if he attempts to run straight Barry does not tell me that I have been a fool but he clearly thinks so Do you care what mister Barry thinks or says Yes I do in regard to the professional position which I hold He is confident that Mountjoy Scarborough is his father s eldest legitimate son and he believes that the old squire simply was anxious to supersede him to get some cheap arrangement made as to his debts I supposed that was the case before But what am I to think of such a man mister Barry speaks of him almost with affection How am I to get on with such a man as mister Barry He himself is honest Well yes I believe so But he does not hate the absolute utter roguery of our own client And that is not quite all When the story of the Rummelsburg marriage was told I did not believe one word of it and I said so most strongly I did not at first believe the story that there had been no such marriage and I swore to mister Scarborough that I would protect Mountjoy and Mountjoy s creditors against any such scheme as that which was intended Then I was convinced All the details of the Nice marriage were laid before me It was manifest that the lady had submitted to be married in a public manner and with all regular forms while she had a baby as it were in her arms And I got all the dates Taking that marriage for granted Mountjoy was clearly illegitimate and I was driven so to confess Then I took up arms on behalf of Augustus Augustus was a thoroughly bad fellow a bully and a tyrant but he was the eldest son Then came the question of paying the debts I thought it a very good thing that the debts should be payed in the proposed fashion The men were all to get the money they had actually lent and no better arrangement seemed to be probable I helped in that feeling that it was all right But it was a swindle that I was made to assist in Of course it was a swindle if the Rummelsburg marriage be true and all these creditors think that I have been a party to it Then I swore that I wouldn t believe the Rummelsburg marriage But Barry and the rest of them only shake their heads and laugh and I am told that mister Scarborough was the best lawyer among us What does it matter How can that hurt you asked Dolly It does hurt me that is the truth I have been at my business long enough Another system has grown up which does not suit me I feel that they all can put their fingers in my eyes It may be that I am a fool and that my idea of honesty is a mistake No shouted Dolly I heard of a rich American the other day who had been poor and was asked how he had suddenly become so well off I found a partner said the American and we went into business together He had the capital and I had the experience We just made a change He has the experience now and I have the capital When I knew that story I went to strip his coat off the wretch s back but mister Barry would give him a fine fur cloak as a mark of respect When I find that clever rascals are respectable I think it is time that I should give up work altogether Thus it was that mister Grey left the house of Grey Barry driven to premature retirement by the vices or rather frauds of old mister Scarborough When Augustus went to work which he did immediately on his father s death to wrest the property from the hands of his brother or what part of the property might be possible mister Grey absolutely declined to have anything to do with the case mister Barry explained how impossible it was that the house even for its own sake should absolutely secede from all consideration of the question Mountjoy had been left in possession and according to all the evidence now before them was the true owner Of course he would want a lawyer and as mister Barry said would be very well able to pay for what he wanted It was necessary that the firm should protect themselves against the vindictiveness of mister Tyrrwhit and Samuel Hart Should the firm fail to do so it would leave itself open to all manner of evil calumnies The firm had been so long employed on behalf of the Scarboroughs that now when the old squire was dead it could not afford to relinquish the business till this final great question had been settled It was necessary as mister Barry said that they should see it out mister Barry taking a much more leading part in these discussions than had been his wont Consequently mister Grey had told him that he might do it himself and mister Barry had been quite contented mister Barry in talking the matter over with one of the clerks whom he afterward took into partnership expressed his opinion that poor old Grey was altogether off the hooks Old Grey had always been mister Grey when spoken of by mister Barry till that day and the clerk remarking this left mister Grey s bell unanswered for three or four minutes mister Grey though he was quite willing to shelf himself understood it all and knocked them about in the chambers that afternoon with unwonted severity He said nothing about it when he came home that evening but the next day was the last on which he took his accustomed chair What will you do with yourself papa Dolly said to him the next morning Do with myself What employment will you take in hand One has to think of that and to live accordingly If you would like to turn farmer we must live in the country Certainly I shall not do that I need not absolutely throw away what money I have saved Or if you were fond of shooting or hunting You know very well I never shot a bird and hardly ever crossed a horse in my life But you are fond of gardening Haven t I got garden enough here Quite enough if you think so but will there be occupation sufficient in that to find you employment for all your life I shall read It seems to me she said that reading becomes wearisome as an only pursuit unless you ve made yourself accustomed to it Sha n t I have as much employment as you A woman is so different Darning will get through an unlimited number of hours A new set of underclothing will occupy me for a fortnight Turning the big girl s dresses over there into frocks for the little girls is sufficient to keep my mind in employment for a month Then I have the maid servants to look after and to guard against their lovers I have the dinners to provide and to see that the cook does not give the fragments to the policeman I have been brought up to do these things and habit has made them usual occupations to me I never envied you when you had to encounter all mister Scarborough s vagaries but I knew that they sufficed to give you something to do They have sufficed said he to leave me without anything that I can do You must not allow yourself to be so left You must find out some employment Then they sat silent for a time while mister Grey occupied himself with some of the numerous papers which it would be necessary that he should hand over to mister Barry And now said Dolly mister Carroll will have gone out and I will go over to the Terrace I have to see them every day and mister Carroll has the decency to take himself off to some billiard table so as to make room for me What are they doing about that man said mister Grey About the lover mister Juniper has I fancy made himself extremely disagreeable not satisfying himself with abusing you and me but poor aunt as well and all the girls He has I fancy got some money of his own He has had money paid to him by Captain Scarborough but that I should fancy would rather make him in a good humor than the reverse He is only in a good humor I take it when he has something to get However I must be off now or the legitimate period of Uncle Carroll s absence will be over mister Grey when he was left alone at once gave up the manipulation of his papers and throwing himself back into his chair began to think of that future life of which he had talked so easily to his daughter What should he do with himself He believed that he could manage with his books for two hours a day but even of that he was not sure He much doubted whether for many years past the time devoted to reading in his own house had amounted to one hour a day He thought that he could employ himself in the garden for two hours but that would fail him when there should be hail or fierce sunshine or frost or snow or rain Eating and drinking would be much to him but he could not but look forward to self reproach if eating and drinking were to be the joy of his life Then he thought of Dolly s life how much purer and better and nobler it had been than his own She talked in a slighting careless tone of her usual day s work but how much of her time had been occupied in doing the tasks of others He knew well that she disliked the Carrolls She would speak of her own dislike of them as of her great sin of which it was necessary that she should repent in sackcloth and ashes But yet how she worked for the family turning old dresses into new frocks as though the girls who had worn them and the children who were to wear them had been to her her dearest friends Every day she went across to the house intent upon doing good offices and this was the repentance in sackcloth and ashes which she exacted from herself Could not he do as she did He could not darn Minnie s and Brenda s stockings but he might do something to make those children more worthy of their cousin s care He could not associate with his brother in law because he was sure that mister Carroll would not endure his society but he might labor to do something for the reform even of this abominable man Before Dolly had come back to him he had resolved that he could only redeem his life from the stagnation with which it was threatened by working for others now that the work of his own life had come to a close Well Dolly he said as soon as she had entered the room have you heard any thing more about mister Juniper Have you been here ever since papa Yes indeed I used to sit at chambers for six or seven hours at a stretch almost without getting out of my chair And are you still employed about those awful papers I have not looked at them since you left the room Then you must have been asleep No indeed I have not been asleep You left me too much to think of to enable me to sleep What am I to do with myself besides eating and drinking so that I shall not sleep always on this side of the grave There are twenty things papa thirty fifty for a man so minded as you are This she said trying to comfort him I must endeavor to find one or two of the fifty Then he went back to his papers and really worked hard on that day On the following morning early he went across to Bolsover Terrace to begin his task of reproving the Carroll family without saying a word to Dolly indicative of his purpose He found that the task would be difficult and as he went he considered within his mind how best it might be accomplished He had put a prayer book in his pocket without giving it much thought but before he knocked at the door he had assured himself that the prayer book would not be of avail He would not know how to begin to use it and felt that it would be ridiculed He must leave that to Dolly or to the clergyman He could talk to the girls but they would not care about the affairs of the firm and in truth he did not know what they would care about With Dolly he could hold sweet converse as long as she would remain with him But he had been present at the bringing up of Dolly and did think that gifts had been given to Dolly which had not fallen to the lot of the Carroll girls They all want to be married he said to himself and that at any rate is a legitimate desire With this he knocked at the door and when it was opened by Sophia he found an old gentleman with black cotton gloves and a doubtful white cravat just preparing for his departure There was Amelia then giving him his hat and looking as pure and proper as though she had never been winked at by Prince Chitakov Then the mother came through from the parlor into the passage Oh John how very kind of you to come mister Matterson pray let me introduce you to my brother mister Grey John this is the reverend mister Matterson a clergyman who is a very intimate friend of Amelia Me ma Why me in particular Well my dear because it is so I suppose it is so because mister Matterson likes you the best Laws ma what nonsense mister Matterson appeared to be a very shy gentleman and only anxious to escape from the hall door But mister Grey remembered that in former days before the coming of mister Juniper upon the scene he had heard of a clerical admirer He had been told that the gentleman s name was Matterson that he was not very young nor very rich that he had five or six children and that he could afford to marry if the wife could bring with her about one hundred pounds a year He had not then thought much of mister Matterson and no direct appeal had been made to him After that mister Juniper had come forward and then mister Juniper had been altogether abolished But it occurred to mister Grey that mister Matterson was at any rate better than mister Juniper that he was by profession a gentleman and that there might be a beginning of those good deeds by which he was anxious to make the evening of his days bearable to himself I am delighted to make mister Matterson s acquaintance he said as that old gentleman scrambled out of the door Then his sister took him by the arm and led him at once into the parlor You might as well come and hear what I have to say Amelia So the daughter followed them in He is the most praiseworthy gentleman you ever knew John began missus Carroll A clergyman I think Oh yes he is in orders in priest s orders said missus Carroll meaning to make the most of mister Matterson He has a church over at Putney I am glad of that said mister Grey Yes indeed though it isn t very good because it s only a curate s one hundred and fifty pounds Yes he does have one hundred and fifty pounds and something out of the surplice fees Another one hundred pounds I believe it is said Amelia Not quite so much as that my dear but it is something He is a widower with children I believe said mister Grey There are children five of them the prettiest little dears one ever saw The eldest is just about thirteen This was a fib because missus Carroll knew that the eldest boy was sixteen but what did it signify Amelia is so warmly attached to them It is a settled thing then We hope so It cannot be said to be quite settled because there are always money difficulties Poor mister Matterson must have some increase to his income before he can afford it Ah yes You did say something uncle about five hundred pounds said Amelia Four hundred and fifty my dear said mister Grey Oh I had forgotten I did say that I hoped there would be five hundred There shall be five hundred said mister Grey remembering that now had come the time for doing to one of the Carroll family the good things of which he had thought to himself As mister Matterson is a clergyman of whom I have heard nothing but good it shall be five hundred He had in truth heard nothing either good or bad respecting mister Matterson Then he asked Amelia to take a walk with him as he went home reflecting that now had come the time in which a little wholesome conversation might have its effect And an idea entered his head that in his old age an acquaintance with a neighboring clergyman might be salutary to himself So Amelia got her bonnet and walked home with him Is he an eloquent preacher my dear But Amelia had never heard him preach I suppose there will be plenty for you to do in your new home I don t mean to be put upon if you mean that uncle But five children There is a servant who looks after them Of course I shall have to see to mister Matterson s own things but I have told him I cannot slave for them all The three eldest have to be sent somewhere that has been agreed upon He has got an unmarried sister who can quite afford to do as much as that Then she explained her reasons for the marriage Papa is getting quite unbearable and Sophy spoils him in everything Poor mister Grey when his niece turned and went back home thought that as far as the girl was concerned or her future household there would be very little room for employment for him mister Matterson wanted an upper servant who instead of demanding wages would bring a little money with her and he could not but feel that the poor clergyman would find that he had taken into his house a bad and expensive upper servant Never mind papa said Dolly we will go on and persevere and if we intend to do good good will come of it CHAPTER LXIII THE LAST OF AUGUSTUS SCARBOROUGH When old mister Scarborough was dead and had been for a while buried Augustus made his application in form to Messrs Grey Barry He made it through his own attorney and had now received mister Barry s answer through the same attorney The nature of the application had been in this wise that mister Augustus Scarborough had been put in to the position of the eldest son that he did not himself in the least doubt that such was his true position that close inquiry had been made at the time and that the lawyers including mister Grey and mister Barry had assented to the statements as then made by old mister Scarborough that he himself had then gone to work to pay his brother s debts for the honor of the family and had paid them partly out of his own immediate pocket and partly out of the estate which was the same as his own property that during his brother s abeyance he had assisted in his maintenance and on his brother s return had taken him to his own home that then his father had died and that this incredible new story had been told mister Augustus Scarborough was in no way desirous of animadverting on his father s memory but was forced to repeat his belief that he was his father s eldest son and was in fact at that moment the legitimate owner of Tretton in accordance with the existing contract He did not wish to dispute his father s will though his father s mental and bodily condition at the time of the making of the will might perhaps enable him to do so with success The will might be allowed to pass valid but the rights of primogeniture must be held sacred Nevertheless having his mother s memory in great honor he felt himself ill inclined to drag the family history before the public For his mother s sake he was open to a compromise He would advise that the whole property that which would pass under the entail and that which was intended to be left by will should be valued and that the total should then be divided between them If his brother chose to take the family mansion it should be so Augustus Scarborough had no desire to set himself over his brother But if this offer were not accepted he must at once go to law and prove that their Nice marriage had been in fact the one marriage by which his father and mother had been joined together There was another proviso added to this offer as the valuation and division of the property must take time an income at the rate of two hundred pounds a month should be allowed to Augustus till such time as it should be completed Such was the offer which Augustus had authorized his attorney to make There was some delay in getting Mountjoy to consent to a reply Before the offer had reached mister Barry he was already at Monte Carlo with that ready money his father had left behind him At every venture that he made at least at every loss which he incurred he told himself that it was altogether the doings of Florence Mountjoy But he returned to England and consented to a reply He was the eldest son and meant to support that position both on his mother s behalf and on his own As to his father s will made in his favor he felt sure that his brother would not have the hardihood to dispute it A man s bodily sufferings were no impediment to his making a will of mental incapacity he had never heard his father accused till the accusation had now been made by his own son He was however well aware that it would not be preferred As to what his brother had done for himself it was hardly worth his while to answer such an allegation His memory carried him but little farther back than the day on which his brother turned him out of his rooms There were however many reasons and this was put in at the suggestion of mister Barry why he would not wish that his brother should be left penniless If his brother would be willing to withdraw altogether from any lawsuit and would lend his company operation to a speedy arrangement of the family matters a thousand a year or twenty five thousand pounds should be made over to him as a younger brother s portion To this offer it would be necessary that a speedy reply should be given and under such circumstances no temporary income need be supplied It was early in June when Augustus was sitting in his luxurious lodgings in Victoria Street contemplating this reply His own lawyer had advised him to accept the offer but he had declared to himself a dozen times since his father s death that in this matter of the property he would either make a spoon or spoil a horn And the lawyer was no friend of his own was not a man who knew nothing of the facts of the case beyond what were told him and nothing of the working of his client s mind Augustus had looked to him only for the law in the matter and the lawyer had declared the law to be against his client All that your father said about the Nice marriage will go for nothing It will be shown that he had an object But there certainly was such a marriage No doubt there was some ceremony performed with an object A second marriage cannot invalidate the first though it may itself be altogether invalidated The Rummelsburg marriage is and will be an established fact and of the Rummelsburg marriage your brother was no doubt the issue Accept the offer of an income Of course we can come to terms as to the amount and from your brother s character it is probable enough that he may increase it Such had been his lawyer s advice and Augustus was sitting there in his lodging thinking of it He was not a happy man as he sat there In the first place he owed a little money and the debt had come upon him chiefly from his lavish expenditure in maintaining Mountjoy and Mountjoy s servant upon their travels At that time he had thought that by lavish expenditure he might make Tretton certainly his own He had not known his brother s character and had thought that by such means he could keep him down with his head well under water His brother might drink take to drinking regularly at Monte Carlo or some other place and might so die Or he would surely gamble himself into farther and utter ruin At any rate he would be well out of the way and Augustus in his pride had been glad to feel that he had his brother well under his thumb Then the debt had been paid with the object of saving the estate from litigation on the part of the creditors That had been his one great mistake And he had not known his father or his father s guile or his father s strength Why had not his father died at once as all the world had assured him would be the case Looking back he could remember that the idea of paying the creditors had at first come from his father simply as a vague idea Oh what a crafty rascal his father had been And then he had allowed himself in his pride to insult his father and had spoken of his father s coming death as a thing that was desirable From that moment his father had plotted his ruin He could see it all now He was still minded to make the spoon but he found that he should spoil the horn Had there been any one to assist him he would still have persevered He thought that he could have persevered with a lawyer who would really have taken up his case with interest If Mountjoy could be made to drink so as to die He was still next in the entail and he was his brother s heir should his brother die without a will But so he would be if he took the twenty five thousand pounds But to accept so poor a modicum would go frightfully against the grain with him He seemed to think that by taking the allowance he would bring back his brother to all the long lived decencies of life He would have to surrender altogether that feeling of conscious superiority which had been so much to him D n the fellow he exclaimed to himself I should not wonder if he were in that fellow s pay The first fellow here was the lawyer and the second was his brother When he had sat there alone for half an hour he could not make up his mind When all his debts were paid he would not have much above twenty five thousand pounds His father had absolutely extracted five thousand pounds from him toward paying his brother s debts The money had been wanted immediately Together with the sum coming from the new purchasers father and son must each subscribe five thousand pounds to pay those Jews So it had been represented to him and he had borrowed the money to carry out his object Had ever any one been so swindled so cruelly treated This might probably be explained and the five thousand pounds might be added to the twenty five thousand pounds But the explanation would be necessary and all his pride would rebel against it On that night when by chance he had come across his brother bleeding and still half drunk as he was about to enter his lodging how completely under his thumb he had been And now he was offering him of his bounty this wretched pittance Then with half muttered curses he execrated the names of his father his brother of Grey and of Barry and of his own lawyer At that moment the door was opened and his bosom friend Septimus Jones entered the room At any rate this friend was the nearest he had to his bosom He was a man without friends in the true sense There was no one who knew the innermost wishes of his heart the secret desires of his soul There are thus so many who can divulge to none those secret wishes And how can such a one have a friend who can advise him as to what he shall do Scarcely can the honest man have such a friend because it is so difficult for him to find a man who will believe in him Augustus had no desire for such a friend but he did desire some one who would do his bidding as though he were such a friend He wanted a friend who would listen to his words and act as though they were the truth mister Septimus Jones was the man he had chosen but he did not in the least believe in mister Septimus Jones himself What does that man say asked Septimus Jones The man was the lawyer of whom Augustus was now thinking at this very moment all manner of evil D n him said Augustus With all my heart But what does he say As you are to pay him for what he says it is worth while listening to it There was a tone in the voice of Septimus Jones which declared at once some diminution of his usual respect So it sounded at least to Augustus He was no longer the assured heir of Tretton and in this way he was to be told of the failure of his golden hopes It would be odd he thought if he could not still hold his dominion over Septimus Jones I am not at all sure that I shall listen to him or to you either As for that you can do as you like Of course I can do as I like Then he remembered that he must still use the man as a messenger if in no other capacity Of course he wants to compromise it A lawyer always proposes a compromise He cannot be beat that way and it is safe for him You had agreed to that But what are the terms to be that is the question I made my offer half and half Nothing fairer can be imagined unless indeed I choose to stand out for the whole property But what does your brother say He could not use his friend even as a messenger without telling him something of the truth When I think of it of this injustice I can hardly hold myself He proposes to give me twenty five thousand pounds Twenty five thousand pounds for everything Everything yes What the devil do you suppose I mean Now just listen to me Then he told his tale as he thought that it ought to be told He recapitulated all the money he had spent on his brother s behalf and all that he chose to say that he had spent He painted in glowing colors the position in which he would have been put by the Nice marriage He was both angry and pathetic about the creditors And he tore his hair almost with vexation at the treatment to which he was subjected I think I d take the twenty five thousand pounds said Jones Never I d rather starve first That s about what you ll have to do if all that you tell me is true There was again that tone of disappearing subjection I ll be shot if I wouldn t take the money Then there was a pause Couldn t you do that and go to law with him afterward That was what your father would have done Yes but Augustus had to acknowledge that he was not as clever as his father At last he gave Jones a commission Jones was to see his brother and to explain to him that before any question could be raised as to the amount to be paid under the compromise a sum of ten thousand pounds must be handed to Augustus to reimburse him for money out of pocket Then Jones was to say as out of his own head that he thought that Augustus might probably accept fifty thousand pounds in lieu of twenty five thousand pounds That would still leave the bulk of the property to Mountjoy although Mountjoy must be aware of the great difficulties which would be thrown in his way by his father s conduct But Jones had to come back the next day with an intimation that Mountjoy had again gone abroad leaving full authority with mister Barry Jones was sent to mister Barry but without effect mister Barry would discuss the matter with the lawyer or if Augustus was so pleased with himself but he was sure that no good would be done by any conversation with mister Jones A month went on two months went by and nothing came of it It is no use your coming here mister Scarborough at last mister Barry said to him with but scant courtesy We are perfectly sure of our ground There is not a penny due you not a penny If you will sign certain documents which I would advise you to do in the presence of your own lawyer there will be twenty five thousand pounds for you You must excuse me if I say that I cannot see you again on the subject unless you accept your brother s liberality At this time Augustus was very short of money and as is always the case those to whom he owed aught became pressing as his readiness to pay them gradually receded But to be so spoken to by a lawyer he Scarborough of Tretton as he had all but been to be so addressed by a man whom he had regarded as old Grey s clerk was bitter indeed He had been so exalted by that Nice marriage had been so lifted high in the world that he was now absolutely prostrate He quarrelled with his lawyer and he quarrelled also with Septimus Jones There was no one with whom he could discuss the matter or rather no one who would discuss it with him on his terms So at last he accepted the money and went daily into the City in order that he might turn it into more What became of him in the City it is hardly the province of this chronicle to tell CHAPTER LXIV THE LAST OF FLORENCE MOUNTJOY Now at last in this chapter has to be told the fate of Florence Mountjoy as far as it can be told in these pages It was at any rate her peculiarity to attach to herself by bonds which could not easily be severed those who had once thought that they might be able to win her love An attempt has been made to show how firm and determined were the affections of Harry Annesley and how absolutely he trusted in her word when once it had been given to him He had seemed to think that when she had even nodded to him in answer to his assertion that he desired her to be his wife all his trouble as regarded her heart had been off his mind There might be infinite trouble as to time as to ten years three years or even one year trouble in inducing her to promise that she would become his wife in opposition to her mother but he had felt sure that she never would be the wife of any one else How he had at last succeeded in mitigating the opposition of her mother so as to make the three years or even the one year appear to himself an altogether impossible delay the reader knows How he at last contrived to have his own way altogether so that as Florence told him she was merely a ball in his hand the reader will have to know very shortly But not a shade of doubt had ever clouded Harry s mind as to his eventual success since she had nodded to him at missus Armitage s ball Though this girl s love had been so grand a thing to have achieved he was quite sure from that moment that it would be his forever With Mountjoy Scarborough there had never come such a moment and never could yet he had been very confident so that he had lived on the assurance that such a moment would come And the self deportment natural to her had been such that he had shown his assurance He never would have succeeded but he should not the less love her sincerely And when the time came for him to think what he should do with himself those few days after his father s death he turned to her as his one prospect of salvation If his cousin Florence would be good to him all might yet be well He had come by that time to lose his assurance He had recognized Harry Annesley as his enemy as has been told often enough in these pages Harry was to him a hateful stumbling block And he had not been quite as sure of her fidelity to another as Harry had been sure of it to himself Tretton might prevail Trettons do so often prevail And the girl s mother was all on his side So he had gone to Cheltenham true as the needle to the pole to try his luck yet once again He had gone to Cheltenham and there he found Harry Annesley All hopes for him were then over and he started at once for Monaco or as he himself told himself for the devil Among the lovers of Florence some memory may attach itself to poor Hugh Anderson He too had been absolutely true to Florence From the hour in which he had first conceived the idea that she would make him happy as his wife it had gone on growing upon him with all the weight of love He did not quite understand why he should have loved her so dearly but thus it was Such a missus Hugh Anderson with a pair of horses on the boulevards was to his imagination the most lovely sight which could be painted Then Florence took the mode of disabusing him which has been told and Hugh Anderson gave the required promise Alas in what an unfortunate moment had he done so Such was his own thought For though he was sure of his own attachment to her he could not mount high enough to be as sure of her to somebody else It was a sort of thing a man oughtn t to have been asked to promise he said to the third secretary And having so determined he made up his mind to follow her to England and to try his fortune once again Florence had just wished Harry good bye for the day or rather for the week She cared for nothing now in the way of protestations of affection Come Harry there now don t be so unreasonable Am not I just as impatient as you are This day fortnight you will be back and then Then there will be some peace won t there But mind you write every day And so Harry was whisked away as triumphant a man as ever left Cheltenham by the London train On the following morning Hugh Anderson reached Cheltenham and appeared in Montpellier Place My daughter is at home certainly said missus Mountjoy There was something in the tone which made the young man at once assure himself that he had better go back to Brussels He had even been a favorite with missus Mountjoy In his days of love making poor Mountjoy had been absent declared no longer to have a chance of Tretton and Harry had been the very evil one himself missus Mountjoy had been assured by the Brussels Mountjoy that with the view of getting well rid of the evil one she had better take poor Anderson to her bosom She had opened her bosom accordingly but with very poor results And now he had come to look after what result there might be missus Mountjoy felt that he had better go back to Brussels Could I not see her asked Anderson Well yes you could see her missus Mountjoy I ll tell you everything just as though you were my own mother I have loved your daughter oh I don t know how it is If she d be my wife for two years I don t think I d mind dying afterward Oh mister Anderson I wouldn t I never heard of a case where a girl had got such a hold of a man as she has of me You don t mean to say that she has behaved badly Oh no She couldn t behave badly it isn t in her But she can bowl a fellow over in the most well most desperate manner As for me I m not worth my salt since I first saw her When I go to ride with the governor I haven t a word to say to him But this ended in missus Mountjoy going and promising that she would send Florence down in her place She knew that it would be in vain but to a young man who had behaved so well as mister Anderson so much could not be refused Here I am again he said very much like Punch in the pantomime Oh mister Anderson how do you do A lover who is anxious to prevail with a lady should always hold up his head Where is the writer of novels or of human nature who does not know as much as that And yet the man who is in love truly in love never does hold up his head very high It is the man who is not in love who does so Nevertheless it does sometimes happen that the true lover obtains his reward In this case it was not observed to be so But now mister Anderson was sure of his fate so that there was no encouragement to him to make any attempt at holding up his head I have come once more to see you he said I am sure it gives mamma so much pleasure missus Mountjoy is very kind But it hasn t been for her The truth is I couldn t settle down in this world without having another interview What am I to say mister Anderson I ll just tell you how it all is You know what my prospects are She did not quite remember but she bowed to him You must know because I told you There is nothing I kept concealed Again she bowed There can be no possible family reason for my going to Kamtchatka Kamtchatka Yes indeed the F O The F O always meant the Foreign Office The F O wants a young man on whom it can thoroughly depend to go to Kamtchatka The allowances are handsome enough but the allowances are nothing to me Why should you go It is for you to decide Yes you can detain me If I go to that bleak and barren desert it will merely be to court exile from that quarter of the globe in which you and I would have to live together and not separate That I cannot stand In Kamtchatka Well there is no knowing what may happen to me then But I m engaged to be married to mister Annesley You told me something of that before But it s all fixed Mamma will tell you It s to be this day fortnight If you d only stay and come as one of my friends Surely such a proposition as this is the unkindest that any young lady can make but we believe that it is made not unfrequently In the present case it received no reply mister Anderson took up his hat and rushed to the door Then he returned for a moment God bless you Miss Mountjoy he said In spite of the cruelty of that suggestion I must bid God bless you And then he was gone About a week afterward M Grascour appeared upon the scene with precisely the same intention He too retained in his memory a most vivid recollection of the young lady and her charms He had heard that Captain Scarborough had inherited Tretton and had been informed that it was not probable that Miss Florence Mountjoy would marry her cousin He was somewhat confused in his ideas and thought that were he now to re appear on the scene there might still be a chance for him There was no lover more unlike mister Anderson than M Grascour Not even for Florence Mountjoy not even to own her would he go to Kamtchatka and were he not to see her he would simply go back to Brussels And yet he loved her as well as he knew how to love any one and would she have become his wife would have treated her admirably He had looked at it all round and could see no reason why he should not marry her Like a persevering man he persevered but as he did so no glimmering of an idea of Kamtchatka disturbed him But from this farther trouble missus Mountjoy was able to save her daughter M Grascour made his way into missus Mountjoy s presence and there declared his purpose He had been sent over on some question connected with the literature of commerce and had ventured to take the opportunity of coming down to Cheltenham He hoped that the truth of his affection would be evinced by the journey missus Mountjoy had observed while he was making his little speech how extremely well brushed was his hat She had observed also that poor mister Anderson s hat was in such a condition as almost to make her try to smooth it down for him If you make objection to my hat you should brush it yourself she had heard Harry say to Florence and Florence had taken the hat and had brushed it with fond lingering touches M Grascour I can assure you that she is really engaged missus Mountjoy had said M Grascour bowed and sighed She is to be married this day week Indeed To mister Harry Annesley Oh h h I remember the gentleman s name I had thought Well yes there were objections but they have luckily disappeared Though missus Mountjoy was only as yet happy in a melancholy manner rejoicing with but bated joy at her girl s joys she was too loyal to say a word now against Harry Annesley I should not have troubled you but I am sure of that M Grascour and we are both of us grateful to you for your good opinion I know very well how high is the honor which you are doing Florence and she will quite understand it But you see the thing is fixed it s only a week Florence was said at the moment to be not at home though she was up stairs looking at four dozen new pocket handkerchiefs which had just come from the pocket handkerchief merchant with the letters F A upon them She had much more pleasure in looking at them than she would have had in listening to the congratulations of M Grascour He s a very good man no doubt mamma a deal better perhaps than Harry That however was not her true opinion But one can t marry all the good men There was almost more trouble taken down at Buston about Harry s marriage than his sister s though Harry was to be married at Cheltenham and only his father and one of his sisters as a bride s maid were to go down to assist upon the occasion His father was to marry them And his mother had at last consented to postpone the joy of seeing Florence till she was brought home from her travels a bride three months old Nevertheless a great fuss was made especially at Buston Hall mister Prosper had become comparatively light in heart since the duty of providing a wife for Buston and a future mother for Buston s heirs had been taken off his shoulders and thrown upon those of his nephew The more he looked back upon the days of his own courtship the more did his own deliverance appear to him to be almost a work of Heaven Where would he have been had Miss Thoroughbung made good her footing in Buston Hall He used to shut his eyes and gently raise his left hand toward the skies as he told himself that this evil thing had passed by him But it had passed by and it was expected that there should be a lunch of some sort at Buston and as with all his diligent inquiry he had heard nothing but good of Florence she should be received with as hearty a welcome as he could give her There was one point which troubled him more than all others He was determined to refurnish the drawing room and also the bedroom in which Florence was destined to sleep He told his sister in the most solemn manner that he had at last made up his mind thoroughly The thing should be done She understood how great a thing it was for him to do The two centre rooms he said with an almost tragic air Then he sent for her the next day and told her that on farther considerations he had determined to add in the dressing room The whole parish felt the effect It was not so much that the parish was struck by the expenditure proposed because the squire was known to be a man who had not for years spent all his income but that he had given way so far on behalf of a nephew whom he had lately been so anxious to disinherit Rumor had already reached Buntingford of what the squire had intended to do on the receipt of his own wife rumors which had of course since faded away into nothing It had been positively notified to Buntingford that there should be really a new carpet and new curtains in the drawing room Miss Thoroughbung had been known to have declared at the brewery that the whole thing should be done before she had been there twelve months He shall go the whole hog she had said And there had been a little bet about it between her and her brother who entertained an idea that mister Prosper was an obstinate man And Joe had brought tidings of the bet to the parsonage so that there had been much commotion on the subject When the best room had been included and then the dressing room even Matthew had been alarmed It ll come to as much as five hundred pounds he had whispered to missus Annesley Matthew seemed to think that it was quite time that there should be somebody to control his master Why ma am it s only the other day because I can remember it myself when that loo table came into the house new Matthew had been in the place over twenty years When missus Annesley reminded him that fashions were changed and that other kinds of table were required he only shook his head But there was a question more vital than that of expense How was the new furniture to be chosen The first idea was that Florence should be invited to spend a week at her future home and go up and down to London with either missus Annesley or her brother and select the furniture herself But there were reasons against this mister Prosper would like to surprise her by the munificence of what he did And the suggestion of one day was sure to wane before the stronger lights of the next mister Prosper though he intended to be munificent was still a little afraid that it should be thrown away as a thing of course or that it should appear to have been Harry s work That would be manifestly unjust I think I had better do it myself he said to his sister Perhaps I could help you Peter He shuddered but it was at the memory of the sound of the word Peter as it had been blurted out for his express annoyance by Miss Thoroughbung I wouldn t mind going up to London with you He shook his head demanding still more time for deliberation Were he to accept his sister s offer he would be bound by his acceptance It s the last drawing room carpet I shall ever buy he said to himself with true melancholy as he walked back home across the park Then there had been the other grand question of the journey or not down to Cheltenham In a good natured way Harry had told him that the wedding would be no wedding without his presence That had moved him considerably It was very desirable that the wedding should be more than a merely legal wedding The world ought to be made aware that the heir to Buston had been married in the presence of the Squire of Buston But the journey was a tremendous difficulty If he could have gone from Buston direct to Cheltenham it would have been comparatively easy But he must pass through London and to do this must travel the whole way between the Northern and Western railway stations And the trains would not fit He studied his Bradshaw for an entire morning and found that they would not fit Where am I to spend the hour and a quarter he asked his sister mournfully And there would be four journeys going and coming four separate journeys And these would be irrespective of numerous carriages and cabs It was absolutely impossible that he should be present in the flesh on that happy day at Cheltenham He was left at home for three months July August and September in which to buy the furniture which however was at last procured by mister Annesley The marriage as far as the wedding was concerned was not nearly as good fun as that of Joe and Molly There was no mister Crabtree there and no Miss Thoroughbung And missus Mountjoy though she meant to do it all as well as it could be done was still joyous only with bated joy Some tinge of melancholy still clung to her She had for so many years thought of her nephew as the husband destined for her girl that she could not be as yet demonstrative in her appreciation of Harry Annesley I have no doubt we shall come to be true friends mister Annesley she had said to him Don t call me mister Annesley No I won t when you come back again and I am used to you But at present there there is a something A regret perhaps Well not quite a regret I am an old fashioned person and I can t change my manners all at once You know what it was that I used to hope Oh yes But Florence was very stupid and would have a different opinion Of course I am happy now Her happiness is all the world to me And things have undergone a change That s true mister Prosper has made over the marrying business to me and I mean to go through it like a man Only you must call me Harry This she promised to do and did in the seclusion of her room give him a kiss But still her joy was not loud and the hilarity of her guests was moderated mister Annesley did his best and the bridesmaids dresses were pretty which is all that is required of a bride s maid Then at last the father s carriage came and they were carried away to Gloucester where they were committed to the untender commonplace but much more comfortable mercies of the railway carriage There we will part with them and encounter them again but for a few moments as after a long day s ramble they made their way back to a solitary but comfortable hotel among the Bernese Alps Florence was on a pony which Harry had insisted on hiring for her though Florence had declared herself able to walk the whole way It had been very hot and she was probably glad of the pony They both had alpenstocks in their hands and on the pommel of her saddle hung the light jacket with which he had started and which had not been so light but that he had been glad to ease himself of the weight The guide was lagging behind and they two were close together Well old girl he said and now what do you think of it all I m not so very much older than I was when you took me pet Oh yes you are Half of your life has gone you have settled down into the cares and duties of married life none of which had been so much as thought of when I took you Not thought of They have been on my mind ever since that night at missus Armitage s Only in a romantic and therefore untrue sort of manner Since that time you have always thought of me with a white choker and dress boots Don t flatter yourself I never looked at your boots You knew that they were the boots and the clothes of a man making love didn t you I don t care personally very much about my own boots I never shall care about another pair but I should care about them Anything that might give me the slightest assistance Nothing was wanted it had all been done Harry My pet But still a pair of high lows heavy with nails would not have been efficacious then I should think I love him you might have said to yourself but he is such an awkward fellow It had gone much beyond that at missus Armitage s But now you have to take my high lows as part of your duty And you When a man loves a woman he falls in love with everything belonging to her You don t wear high lows Everything you possess as specially your own has to administer to my sense of love and beauty I wish I wish it might be so There is no danger about that at all But I have to come before you on an occasion such as this as a kind of navvy and you must accept me She glanced around furtively to see whether their guide was looking but the guide had gone back out of sight For sitting on her pony she had her arm around his neck and kissed him And then there is ever so much more he continued I don t think I snore Indeed no There isn t a sound comes from you I sometimes look to see if I think you are alive But if I do you ll have to put up with it That would be one of your duties as a wife You never could have thought of that when I had those dress boots on Of course I didn t How can you talk such rubbish I don t know whether it is rubbish Those are the kind of things that must fall upon a woman so heavily Suppose I were to beat you Beat me Yes hit you over the head with this stick I am sure you would not do that So am I But suppose I were to Your mother must be told of my leaving that poor man bloody and speechless What if I were to carry out my usual habits as then shown Take care my darling or that brute ll throw you This he said as the pony stumbled over a stone Almost as unlikely as you are One has to risk dangers in the world but one makes the risk as little as possible I know they won t give me a pony that will tumble down and I know that I ve told you to look to see that they don t You chose the pony but I had to choose you I don t know very much about ponies but I do know something about a lover and I know that I have got one that will suit me END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK mister SCARBOROUGH S FAMILY This file should

with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new
