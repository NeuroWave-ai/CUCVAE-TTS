OF NEW YORK COMPLETE BY WASHINGTON IRVING CHICAGO W B CONKEY COMPANY PUBLISHERS INTRODUCTION KNICKERBOCKER S HISTORY OF NEW YORK is the book published in December eighteen oh nine with which Washington Irving at the age of twenty six first won wide credit and influence Walter Scott wrote to an American friend who sent him the second edition I beg you to accept my best thanks for the uncommon degree of entertainment which I have received from the most excellently jocose History of New York I am sensible that as a stranger to American parties and politics I must lose much of the concealed satire of the piece but I must own that looking at the simple and obvious meaning only I have never read anything so closely resembling the style of Dean Swift as the annals of Diedrich Knickerbocker I have been employed these few evenings in reading them aloud to missus S and two ladies who are our guests and our sides have been absolutely sore with laughing I think too there are passages which indicate that the author possesses powers of a different kind and has some touches which remind me much of Sterne Washington Irving was the son of William Irving a sturdy native of the Orkneys allied to the Irvines of Drum among whose kindred was an old historiographer who said to them Some of the foolish write themselves Irving William Irving of Shapinsha in the Orkney Islands was a petty officer on board an armed packet ship in His Majesty s service when he met with his fate at Falmouth in Sarah Sanders whom he married at Falmouth in May seventeen sixty one Their first child was buried in England before July seventeen sixty three when peace had been concluded and William Irving emigrated to New York with his wife soon to be joined by his wife s parents At New York William Irving entered into trade and prospered fairly until the outbreak of the American Revolution His sympathy and that of his wife went with the colonists On the nineteenth of October seventeen eighty one Lord Cornwallis with a force of seven thousand men surrendered at Yorktown In October seventeen eighty two Holland acknowledged the independence of the United States in a treaty concluded at The Hague In January seventeen eighty three an armistice was concluded with Great Britain In February seventeen eighty three the independence of the United States was acknowledged by Sweden and by Denmark and in March by Spain On the third of April in that year an eleventh child was born to William and Sarah Irving who was named Washington after the hero under whom the war had been brought to an end In seventeen eighty three the peace was signed New York was evacuated and the independence of the United States acknowledged by England Of the eleven children eight survived William Irving the father was rigidly pious a just and honorable man who made religion burdensome to his children by associating it too much with restrictions and denials One of their two weekly half holidays was devoted to the Catechism The mother s gentler sensibility and womanly impulses gave her the greater influence but she reverenced and loved her good husband and when her youngest puzzled her with his pranks she would say Ah Washington if you were only good For his lively spirits and quick fancy could not easily be subdued He would get out of his bed room window at night walk along a coping and climb over the roof to the top of the next house only for the high purpose of astonishing a neighbor by dropping a stone down his chimney As a young school boy he came upon Hoole s translation of Ariosto and achieved in his father s back yard knightly adventures Robinson Crusoe and Sindbad the Sailor made him yearn to go to sea But this was impossible unless he could learn to lie hard and eat salt pork which he detested He would get out of bed at night and lie on the floor for an hour or two by way of practice He also took every opportunity that came in his way of eating the detested food But the more he tried to like it the nastier it grew and he gave up as impracticable his hope of going to sea He fastened upon adventures of real travelers he yearned for travel and was entranced in his youth by first sight of the beauties of the Hudson River He scribbled jests for his school friends and of course he wrote a school boy play At sixteen his schooling was at an end and he was placed in a lawyer s office from which he was transferred to another and then in January eighteen oh two to another where he continued his clerkship with a mister Hoffman who had a young wife and two young daughters by a former marriage With this family Washington Irving a careless student lively clever kind established the happiest relations of which afterwards there came the deep grief of his life and a sacred memory Washington Irving s eldest brothers were beginning to thrive in business A brother Peter shared his frolics with the pen His artist pleasure in the theater was indulged without his father s knowledge He would go to the play come home for nine o clock prayers go up to bed and climb out of his bed room window and run back and see the after piece So come evasions of undue restraint But with all this impulsive liveliness young Washington Irving s life appeared as he grew up to be in grave danger When he was nineteen and taken by a brother in law to Ballston springs it was determined by those who heard his incessant night cough that he was not long for this world When he had come of age in April eighteen oh four his brothers chiefly his eldest brother who was prospering provided money to send him to Europe that he might recover health by restful travel in France Italy and England When he was helped up the side of the vessel that was to take him from New York to Bordeaux the captain looked at him with pity and said There s a chap who will go overboard before we get across But Washington Irving returned to New York at the beginning of the year eighteen oh six with health restored What followed will be told in the Introduction to the other volume of this History of New York by Diedrich Knickerbocker H M THE AUTHOR S APOLOGY The following work in which at the outset nothing more was contemplated than a temporary jeu d esprit was commenced in company with my brother the late Peter Irving esquire Our idea was to parody a small hand book which had recently appeared entitled A Picture of New York Like that our work was to begin an historical sketch to be followed by notices of the customs manners and institutions of the city written in a serio comic vein and treating local errors follies and abuses with good humored satire To burlesque the pedantic lore displayed in certain American works our historical sketch was to commence with the creation of the world and we laid all kinds of works under contribution for trite citations relevant or irrelevant to give it the proper air of learned research Before this crude mass of mock erudition could be digested into form my brother departed for Europe and I was left to prosecute the enterprise alone I now altered the plan of the work Discarding all idea of a parody on the Picture of New York I determined that what had been originally intended as an introductory sketch should comprise the whole work and form a comic history of the city I accordingly moulded the mass of citations and disquisitions into introductory chapters forming the first book but it soon became evident to me that like Robinson Crusoe with his boat I had begun on too large a scale and that to launch my history successfully I must reduce its proportions I accordingly resolved to confine it to the period of the Dutch domination which in its rise progress and decline presented that unity of subject required by classic rule It was a period also at that time almost a terra incognita in history In fact I was surprised to find how few of my fellow citizens were aware that New York had ever been called New Amsterdam or had heard of the names of its early Dutch governors or cared a straw about their ancient Dutch progenitors This then broke upon me as the poetic age of our city poetic from its very obscurity and open like the early and obscure days of ancient Rome to all the embellishments of heroic fiction I hailed my native city as fortunate above all other American cities in having an antiquity thus extending back into the regions of doubt and fable neither did I conceive I was committing any grievous historical sin in helping out the few facts I could collect in this remote and forgotten region with figments of my own brain or in giving characteristic attributes to the few names connected with it which I might dig up from oblivion In this doubtless I reasoned like a young and inexperienced writer besotted with his own fancies and my presumptuous trespasses into this sacred though neglected region of history have met with deserved rebuke from men of soberer minds It is too late however to recall the shaft thus rashly launched To any one whose sense of fitness it may wound I can only say with Hamlet Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts That I have shot my arrow o er the house And hurt my brother I will say this in further apology for my work that if it has taken an unwarrantable liberty with our early provincial history it has at least turned attention to that history and provoked research It is only since this work appeared that the forgotten archives of the province have been rummaged and the facts and personages of the olden time rescued from the dust of oblivion and elevated into whatever importance they may actually possess The main object of my work in fact had a bearing wide from the sober aim of history but one which I trust will meet with some indulgence from poetic minds It was to embody the traditions of our city in an amusing form to illustrate its local humors customs and peculiarities to clothe home scenes and places and familiar names with those imaginative and whimsical associations so seldom met with in our new country but which live like charms and spells about the cities of the old world binding the heart of the native inhabitant to his home In this I have reason to believe I have in some measure succeeded Before the appearance of my work the popular traditions of our city were unrecorded the peculiar and racy customs and usages derived from our Dutch progenitors were unnoticed or regarded with indifference or adverted to with a sneer Now they form a convivial currency and are brought forward on all occasions they link our whole community together in good humor and good fellowship they are the rallying points of home feeling the seasoning of our civic festivities the staple of local tales and local pleasantries and are so harped upon by our writers of popular fiction that I find myself almost crowded off the legendary ground which I was the first to explore by the host who have followed in my footsteps I dwell on this head because at the first appearance of my work its aim and drift were misapprehended by some of the descendants of the Dutch worthies and because I understand that now and then one may still be found to regard it with a captious eye The far greater part however I have reason to flatter myself receive my good humored picturings in the same temper with which they were executed and when I find after a lapse of nearly forty years this haphazard production of my youth still cherished among them when I find its very name become a household word and used to give the home stamp to everything recommended for popular acceptation such as Knickerbocker societies Knickerbocker insurance companies Knickerbocker steamboats Knickerbocker omnibuses Knickerbocker bread and Knickerbocker ice and when I find New Yorkers of Dutch descent priding themselves upon being genuine Knickerbockers I please myself with the persuasion that I have struck the right chord that my dealings with the good old Dutch times and the customs and usages derived from them are n harmony with the feelings and humors of my townsmen that I have opened a vein of pleasant associations and quaint characteristics peculiar to my native place and which its inhabitants will not willingly suffer to pass away and that though other histories of New York may appear of higher claims to learned acceptation and may take their dignified and appropriate rank in the family library Knickerbocker s history will still be received with good humored indulgence and be thumbed and chuckled over by the family fireside Sunnyside eighteen forty eight W I Notices WHICH APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS PREVIOUS TO THE PUBLICATION OF THIS WORK From the Evening Post of October twenty six eighteen oh nine DISTRESSING Left his lodgings some time since and has not since been heard of a small elderly gentleman dressed in an old black coat and cocked hat by the name of Knickerbocker As there are some reasons for believing he is not entirely in his right mind and as great anxiety is entertained about him any information concerning him left either at the Columbian Hotel Mulberry Street or at the office of this paper will be thankfully received P S Printers of newspapers will be aiding the cause of humanity in giving an insertion to the above From the same November six eighteen oh nine To the Editor of the Evening Post SIR Having read in your paper of the twenty sixth of October last a paragraph respecting an old gentleman by the name of Knickerbocker who was missing from his lodgings if it would be any relief to his friends or furnish them with any clue to discover where he is you may inform them that a person answering the description given was seen by the passengers of the Albany stage early in the morning about four or five weeks since resting himself by the side of the road a little above King s Bridge He had in his hand a small bundle tied in a red bandana handkerchief he appeared to be traveling northward and was very much fatigued and exhausted A TRAVELER From the same November sixteen eighteen oh nine To the Editor of the Evening Post SIR You have been good enough to publish in your paper a paragraph about Mr Diedrich Knickerbocker who was missing so strangely some time since Nothing satisfactory has been heard of the old gentleman since but a very curious kind of a written book has been found in his room in his own handwriting Now I wish you to notice him if he is still alive that if he does not return and pay off his bill for boarding and lodging I shall have to dispose of his book to satisfy me for the same I am Sir your humble servant SETH HANDASIDE Landlord of the Independent Columbian Hotel Mulberry Street From the same November twenty eight eighteen oh nine LITERARY NOTICE INSKEEP and BRADFORD have in the press and will shortly publish A History of New York In two volumes duodecimo Price three dollars Containing an account of its discovery and settlement with its internal policies manners customs wars c c under the Dutch government furnishing many curious and interesting particulars never before published and which are gathered from various manuscript and other authenticated sources the whole being interspersed with philosophical speculations and moral precepts This work was found in the chamber of mister Diedrich Knickerbocker the old gentleman whose sudden and mysterious disappearance has been noticed It is published in order to discharge certain debts he has left behind From the American Citizen December six eighteen oh nine Is this day published By INSKEEP and BRADFORD No one hundred twenty eight Broadway A History of New York c c Containing same as above ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR It was some time if I recollect right in the early part of the fall of eighteen oh eight that a stranger applied for lodgings at the Independent Columbian Hotel in Mulberry Street of which I am landlord He was a small brisk looking old gentleman dressed in a rusty black coat a pair of olive velvet breeches and a small cocked hat He had a few gray hairs plaited and clubbed behind and his beard seemed to be of some eight and forty hours growth The only piece of finery which he bore about him was a bright pair of square silver shoe buckles and all his baggage was contained in a pair of saddle bags which he carried under his arm His whole appearance was something out of the common run and my wife who is a very shrewd little body at once set him down for some eminent country schoolmaster As the Independent Columbian Hotel is a very small house I was a little puzzled at first where to put him but my wife who seemed taken with his looks would needs put him in her best chamber which is genteelly set off with the profiles of the whole family done in black by those two great painters Jarvis and Wood and commands a very pleasant view of the new grounds on the Collect together with the rear of the Poor House and Bridewell and the full front of the Hospital so that it is the cheerfulest room in the whole house During the whole time that he stayed with us we found him a very worthy good sort of an old gentleman though a little queer in his ways He would keep in his room for days together and if any of the children cried or made a noise about his door he would bounce out in a great passion with his hands full of papers and say something about deranging his ideas which made my wife believe sometimes that he was not altogether compos Indeed there was more than one reason to make her think so for his room was always covered with scraps of paper and old mouldy books lying about at sixes and sevens which he would never let anybody touch for he said he had laid them all away in their proper places so that he might know where to find them though for that matter he was half his time worrying about the house in search of some book or writing which he had carefully put out of the way I shall never forget what a pother he once made because my wife cleaned out his room when his back was turned and put everything to rights for he swore he would never be able to get his papers in order again in a twelve month Upon this my wife ventured to ask him what he did with so many books and papers and he told her that he was seeking for immortality which made her think more than ever that the poor old gentleman s head was a little cracked He was a very inquisitive body and when not in his room was continually poking about town hearing all the news and prying into everything that was going on this was particularly the case about election time when he did nothing but bustle about him from poll to poll attending all ward meetings and committee rooms though I could never find that he took part with either side of the question On the contrary he would come home and rail at both parties with great wrath and plainly proved one day to the satisfaction of my wife and three old ladies who were drinking tea with her that the two parties were like two rogues each tugging at the skirt of the nation and that in the end they would tear the very coat off its back and expose its nakedness Indeed he was an oracle among the neighbors who would collect around him to hear him talk of an afternoon as he smoked his pipe on the bench before the door and I really believe he would have brought over the whole neighborhood to his own side of the question if they could ever have found out what it was He was very much given to argue or as he called it philosophize about the most trifling matter and to do him justice I never knew anybody that was a match for him except it was a grave looking old gentleman who called now and then to see him and often posed him in an argument But this is nothing surprising as I have since found out this stranger is the city librarian and of course must be a man of great learning and I have my doubts if he had not some hand in the following history As our lodger had been a long time with us and we had never received any pay my wife began to be somewhat uneasy and curious to find out who and what he was She accordingly made bold to put the question to his friend the librarian who replied in his dry way that he was one of the Literati which she supposed to mean some new party in politics I scorn to push a lodger for his pay so I let day after day pass on without dunning the old gentleman for a farthing but my wife who always takes these matters on herself and is as I said a shrewd kind of a woman at last got out of patience and hinted that she thought it high time some people should have a sight of some people s money To which the old gentleman replied in a mighty touchy manner that she need not make herself uneasy for that he had a treasure there pointing to his saddle bags worth her whole house put together This was the only answer we could ever get from him and as my wife by some of those odd ways in which women find out everything learnt that he was of very great connections being related to the Knickerbockers of Scaghtikoke and cousin german to the Congressman of that name she did not like to treat him uncivilly What is more she even offered merely by way of making things easy to let him live scot free if he would teach the children their letters and to try her best and get her neighbors to send their children also but the old gentleman took it in such dudgeon and seemed so affronted at being taken for a schoolmaster that she never dared to speak on the subject again About two months ago he went out of a morning with a bundle in his hand and has never been heard of since All kinds of inquiries were made after him but in vain I wrote to his relations at Scaghtikoke but they sent for answer that he had not been there since the year before last when he had a great dispute with the Congressman about politics and left the place in a huff and they had neither heard nor seen anything of him from that time to this I must own I felt very much worried about the poor old gentleman for I thought something bad must have happened to him that he should be missing so long and never return to pay his bill I therefore advertised him in the newspapers and though my melancholy advertisement was published by several humane printers yet I have never been able to learn anything satisfactory about him My wife now said it was high time to take care of ourselves and see if he had left anything behind in his room that would pay us for his board and lodging We found nothing however but some old books and musty writings and his pair of saddle bags which being opened in the presence of the librarian contained only a few articles of worn out clothes and a large bundle of blotted paper On looking over this the librarian told us he had no doubt it was the treasure which the old gentleman had spoke about as it proved to be a most excellent and faithful History of New York which he advised us by all means to publish assuring us that it would be so eagerly bought up by a discerning public that he had no doubt it would be enough to pay our arrears ten times over Upon this we got a very learned schoolmaster who teaches our children to prepare it for the press which he accordingly has done and has moreover added to it a number of notes of his own and an engraving of the city as it was at the time mister Knickerbocker writes about This therefore is a true statement of my reasons for having this work printed without waiting for the consent of the author and I here declare that if he ever returns though I much fear some unhappy accident has befallen him I stand ready to account with him like a true and honest man Which is all at present From the public s humble servant SETH HANDASIDE INDEPENDENT COLUMBIAN HOTEL NEW YORK The foregoing account of the author was prefixed to the first edition of this work Shortly after its publication a letter was received from him by mister Handaside dated at a small Dutch village on the banks of the Hudson whither he had traveled for the purpose of inspecting certain ancient records As this was one of those few and happy villages into which newspapers never find their way it is not a matter of surprise that mister Knickerbocker should never have seen the numerous advertisements that were made concerning him and that he should learn of the publication of his history by mere accident He expressed much concern at its premature appearance as thereby he was prevented from making several important corrections and alterations as well as from profiting by many curious hints which he had collected during his travels along the shores of the Tappan Sea and his sojourn at Haverstraw and Esopus Finding that there was no longer any immediate necessity for his return to New York he extended his journey up to the residence of his relations at Scaghtikoke On his way thither he stopped for some days at Albany for which city he is known to have entertained a great partiality He found it however considerably altered and was much concerned at the inroads and improvements which the Yankees were making and the consequent decline of the good old Dutch manners Indeed he was informed that these intruders were making sad innovations in all parts of the State where they had given great trouble and vexation to the regular Dutch settlers by the introduction of turnpike gates and country school houses It is said also that mister Knickerbocker shook his head sorrowfully at noticing the gradual decay of the great Vander Heyden palace but was highly indignant at finding that the ancient Dutch church which stood in the middle of the street had been pulled down since his last visit The fame of mister Knickerbocker s History having reached even to Albany he received much flattering attention from its worthy burghers some of whom however pointed out two or three very great errors he had fallen into particularly that of suspending a lump of sugar over the Albany tea tables which they assured him had been discontinued for some years past Several families moreover were somewhat piqued that their ancestors had not been mentioned in his work and showed great jealousy of their neighbors who had thus been distinguished while the latter it must be confessed plumed themselves vastly thereupon considering these recordings in the lights of letters patent of nobility establishing their claims to ancestry which in this republican country is a matter of no little solicitude and vain glory It is also said that he enjoyed high favor and countenance from the governor who once asked him to dinner and was seen two or three times to shake hands with him when they met in the street which certainly was going great lengths considering that they differed in politics Indeed certain of the governor s confidential friends to whom he could venture to speak his mind freely on such matters have assured us that he privately entertained a considerable good will for our author nay he even once went so far as to declare and that openly too and at his own table just after dinner that Knickerbocker was a very well meaning sort of an old gentleman and no fool From all which may have been led to suppose that had our author been of different politics and written for the newspapers instead of wasting his talents on histories he might have risen to some post of honor and profit peradventure to be a notary public or even a justice in the ten pound court Besides the honors and civilities already mentioned he was much caressed by the literati of Albany particularly by mister John Cook who entertained him very hospitably at his circulating library and reading room where they used to drink Spa water and talk about the ancients He found mister Cook a man after his own heart of great literary research and a curious collector of books At parting the latter in testimony of friendship made him a present of the two oldest works in his collection which were the earliest edition of the Heidelberg Catechism and Adrian Vander Donck s famous account of the New Netherlands by the last of which mister Knickerbocker profited greatly in this his second edition Having passed some time very agreeably at Albany our author proceeded to Scaghtikoke where it is but justice to say he was received with open arms and treated with wonderful loving kindness He was much looked up to by the family being the first historian of the name and was considered almost as great a man as his cousin the Congressman with whom by the by he became perfectly reconciled and contracted a strong friendship In spite however of the kindness of his relations and their great attention to his comforts the old gentleman soon became restless and discontented His history being published he had no longer any business to occupy his thoughts or any scheme to excite his hopes and anticipations This to a busy mind like his was a truly deplorable situation and had he not been a man of inflexible morals and regular habits there would have been great danger of his taking to politics or drinking both which pernicious vices we daily see men driven to by mere spleen and idleness It is true he sometimes employed himself in preparing a second edition of his history wherein he endeavored to correct and improve many passages with which he was dissatisfied and to rectify some mistakes that had crept into it for he was particularly anxious that his work should be noted for its authenticity which indeed is the very life and soul of history But the glow of composition had departed he had to leave many places untouched which he would fain have altered and even where he did make alterations he seemed always in doubt whether they were for the better or the worse After a residence of some time at Scaghtikoke he began to feel a strong desire to return to New York which he ever regarded with the warmest affection not merely because it was his native city but because he really considered it the very best city in the whole world On his return he entered into the full enjoyment of the advantages of a literary reputation He was continually importuned to write advertisements petitions handbills and productions of similar import and although he never meddled with the public papers yet had he the credit of writing innumerable essays and smart things that appeared on all subjects and all sides of the question in all which he was clearly detected by his style He contracted moreover a considerable debt at the postoffice in consequence of the numerous letter he received from authors and printers soliciting his subscription and he was applied to by every charitable society for yearly donations which he gave very cheerfully considering these applications as so many compliments He was once invited to a great corporation dinner and was even twice summoned to attend as a juryman at the court of quarter sessions Indeed so renowned did he become that he could no longer pry about as formerly in all holes and corners of the city according to the bent of his humor unnoticed and uninterrupted but several times when he has been sauntering the streets on his usual rambles of observation equipped with his cane and cocked hat the little boys at play have been known to cry There goes Diedrich at which the old gentleman seemed not a little pleased looking upon these salutations in the light of the praise of posterity In a word if we take into consideration all these various honors and distinctions together with an exuberant eulogium passed on his in the Portfolio with which we are told the old gentleman was so much overpowered that he was sick for two or three days it must be confessed that few authors have ever lived to receive such illustrious rewards or have so completely enjoyed in advance their own immortality After his return from Scaghtikoke mister Knickerbocker took up his residence at a little rural retreat which the Stuyvesants had granted him on the family domain in gratitude for his honorable mention of their ancestor It was pleasantly situated on the borders of one of the salt marshes beyond Corlear s Hook subject indeed to be occasionally over flowed and much infested in the summer time with mosquitoes but otherwise very agreeable producing abundant crops of salt grass and bulrushes Here we are sorry to say the good old gentleman fell dangerously ill of a fever occasioned by the neighboring marshes When he found his end approaching he disposed of his worldly affairs leaving the bulk of his fortune to the New York Historical Society his Heidelberg Catechism and Vander Donck s work to the City Library and his saddle bags to mister Handaside He forgave all his enemies that is to say all that bore any enmity towards him for as to himself he declared he died in good will to all the world And after dictating several kind messages to his relations at Scaghtikoke as well as to certain of our most substantial Dutch citizens he expired in the arms of his friend the librarian His remains were interred according to his own request in saint Mark s Churchyard close by the bones of his favorite hero Peter Stuyvesant and it is rumored that the Historical Society have it in mind to erect a wooden monument to his memory in the Bowling Green

none	none	To rescue from oblivion the memory of former incidents and to render a just tribute of renown to the many great and wonderful transactions of our Dutch progenitors Diedrich Knickerbocker native of the city of New York produces this historical essay one Like the great Father of History whose words I have just quoted I treat of times long past over which the twilight of uncertainty had already thrown its shadows and the night of forgetfulness was about to descend for ever With great solicitude had I long beheld the early history of this venerable and ancient city gradually slipping from our grasp trembling on the lips of narrative old age and day by day dropping piecemeal into the tomb In a little while thought I and those revered Dutch burghers who serve as the tottering monuments of good old times will be gathered to their fathers their children engrossed by the empty pleasures or insignificant transactions of the present age will neglect to treasure up the recollections of the past and posterity will search in vain for memorials of the days of the Patriarchs The origin of our city will be buried in eternal oblivion and even the names and achievements of Wouter Van Twiller William Kieft and Peter Stuyvesant be enveloped in doubt and fiction like those of Romulus and Remus of Charlemagne King Arthur Rinaldo and Godfrey of Boulogne Determined therefore to avert if possible this threatened misfortune I industriously set myself to work to gather together all the fragments of our ancient history which still existed and like my revered prototype Herodotus where no written records could be found I have endeavored to continue the chain of history by well authenticated traditions In this arduous undertaking which has been the whole business of a long and solitary life it is incredible the number of learned authors I have consulted and all to but little purpose Strange as it may seem though such multitudes of excellent works have been written about this country there are none extant which give any full and satisfactory account of the early history of New York or of its three first Dutch Governors I have however gained much valuable and curious matter from an elaborate manuscript written in exceeding pure and classic low Dutch excepting a few errors in orthography which was found in the archives of the Stuyvesant family Many legends letters and other documents have I likewise gleaned in my researches among the family chests and lumber garrets of our respectable Dutch citizens and I have gathered a host of well authenticated traditions from divers excellent old ladies of my acquaintance who requested that their names might not be mentioned Nor must I neglect to acknowledge how greatly I have been assisted by that admirable and praiseworthy institution the New York Historical Society to which I here publicly return my sincere acknowledgments In the conduct of this inestimable work I have adopted no individual model but on the contrary have simply contented myself with combining and concentrating the excellences of the most approved ancient historians Like Xenophon I have maintained the utmost impartiality and the strictest adherence to truth throughout my history I have enriched it after the manner of Sallust with various characters of ancient worthies drawn at full length and faithfully colored I have seasoned it with profound political speculations like Thucydides sweetened it with the graces of sentiment like Tacitus and infused into the whole the dignity the grandeur and magnificence of Livy I am aware that I shall incur the censure of numerous very learned and judicious critics for indulging too frequently in the bold excursive manner of my favorite Herodotus And to be candid I have found it impossible always to resist the allurements of those pleasing episodes which like flowery banks and fragrant bowers beset the dusty road of the historian and entice him to turn aside and refresh himself from his wayfaring But I trust it will be found that I have always resumed my staff and addressed myself to my weary journey with renovated spirits so that both my readers and myself have been benefited by the relaxation Indeed though it has been my constant wish and uniform endeavor to rival Polybius himself in observing the requisite unity of History yet the loose and unconnected manner in which many of the facts herein recorded have come to hand rendered such an attempt extremely difficult This difficulty was likewise increased by one of the grand objects contemplated in my work which was to trace the rise of sundry customs and institutions in these best of cities and to compare them when in the germ of infancy with what they are in the present old age of knowledge and improvement But the chief merit on which I value myself and found my hopes for future regard is that faithful veracity with which I have compiled this invaluable little work carefully winnowing away the chaff of hypothesis and discarding the tares of fable which are too apt to spring up and choke the seeds of truth and wholesome knowledge Had I been anxious to captivate the superficial throng who skim like swallows over the surface of literature or had I been anxious to commend my writings to the pampered palates of literary epicures I might have availed myself of the obscurity that overshadows the infant years of our city to introduce a thousand pleasing fictions But I have scrupulously discarded many a pithy tale and marvelous adventure whereby the drowsy ear of summer indolence might be enthralled jealously maintaining that fidelity gravity and dignity which should ever distinguish the historian For a writer of this class observes an elegant critic must sustain the character of a wise man writing for the instruction of posterity one who has studied to inform himself well who has pondered his subject with care and addresses himself to our judgment rather than to our imagination Thrice happy therefore is this our renowned city in having incidents worthy of swelling the theme of history and doubly thrice happy is it in having such an historian as myself to relate them For after all gentle reader cities of themselves and in fact empires of themselves are nothing without an historian It is the patient narrator who records their prosperity as they rise who blazons forth the splendor of their noontide meridian who props their feeble memorials as they totter to decay who gathers together their scattered fragments as they rot and who piously at length collects their ashes into the mausoleum of his work and rears a triumphant monument to transmit their renown to all succeeding ages What has been the fate of many fair cities of antiquity whose nameless ruins encumber the plains of Europe and Asia and awaken the fruitless inquiry of the traveler They have sunk into dust and silence they have perished from remembrance for want of a historian The philanthropist may weep over their desolation the poet may wander among their mouldering arches and broken columns and indulge the visionary flights of his fancy but alas alas the modern historian whose pen like my own is doomed to confine itself to dull matter of fact seeks in vain among their oblivious remains for some memorial that may tell the instructive tale of their glory and their ruin Wars conflagrations deluges says Aristotle destroy nations and with them all their monuments their discoveries and their vanities The torch of science has more than once been extinguished and rekindled a few individuals who have escaped by accident reunite the thread of generations The same sad misfortune which has happened to so many ancient cities will happen again and from the same sad cause to nine tenths of those which now flourish on the face of the globe With most of them the time for recording their history is gone by their origin their foundation together with the early stages of their settlement are for ever buried in the rubbish of years and the same would have been the case with this fair portion of the earth if I had not snatched it from obscurity in the very nick of time at the moment that those matters herein recorded were about entering into the widespread insatiable maw of oblivion if I had not dragged them out as it were by the very locks just as the monster s adamantine fangs were closing upon them for ever And here have I as before observed carefully collected collated and arranged them scrip and scrap punt en punt gat en gat and commenced in this little work a history to serve as a foundation on which other historians may hereafter raise a noble superstructure swelling in process of time until Knickerbocker s New York may be equally voluminous with Gibbon s Rome or Hume and Smollett s England And now indulge me for a moment while I lay down my pen skip to some little eminence at the distance of two or three hundred years ahead and casting back a bird s eye glance over the waste of years that is to roll between discover myself little I at this moment the progenitor prototype and precursor of them all posted at the head of this host of literary worthies with my book under my arm and New York on my back pressing forward like a gallant commander to honor and immortality Such are the vain glorious misgivings that will now and then enter into the brain of the author that irradiate as with celestial light his solitary chamber cheering his weary spirits and animating him to persevere in his labors And I have freely given utterance to these rhapsodies whenever they have occurred not I trust from an unusual spirit of egotism but merely that the reader may for once have an idea how an author thinks and feels while he is writing a kind of knowledge very rare and curious and much to be desired FOOTNOTES one Beloe s Herodotus HISTORY OF NEW YORK BOOK I CONTAINING DIVERS INGENIOUS THEORIES AND PHILOSOPHIC SPECULATIONS CONCERNING

none	none	According to the best authorities the world in which we dwell is a huge opaque reflecting inanimate mass floating in the vast ethereal ocean of infinite space It has the form of an orange being an oblate spheroid curiously flattened at opposite parts for the insertion of two imaginary poles which are supposed to penetrate and unite at the center thus forming an axis on which the mighty orange turns with a regular diurnal revolution The transitions of light and darkness whence proceed the alternations of day and night are produced by this diurnal revolution successively presenting the different parts of the earth to the rays of the sun The latter is according to the best that is to say the latest accounts a luminous or fiery body of a prodigious magnitude from which this world is driven by a centrifugal or repelling power and to which it is drawn by a centripetal or attractive force otherwise called the attraction of gravitation the combination or rather the counteraction of these two opposing impulses producing a circular and annual revolution Hence result the different seasons of the year viz spring summer autumn and winter This I believe to be the most approved modern theory on the subject though there be many philosophers who have entertained very different opinions some too of them entitled to much deference from their great antiquity and illustrious characters Thus it was advanced by some of the ancient sages that the earth was an extended plain supported by vast pillars and by others that it rested on the head of a snake or the back of a huge tortoise but as they did not provide a resting place for either the pillars or the tortoise the whole theory fell to the ground for want of proper foundation The Brahmins assert that the heavens rest upon the earth and the sun and moon swim therein like fishes in the water moving from east to west by day and gliding along the edge of the horizon to their original stations during the night two while according to the Pauranicas of India it is a vast plain encircled by seven oceans of mild nectar and other delicious liquids that it is studded with seven mountains and ornamented in the center by a mountainous rock of burnished gold and that a great dragon occasionally swallows up the moon which accounts for the phenomena of lunar eclipses three Beside these and many other equally sage opinions we have the profound conjectures of Aboul Hassan Aly son of Al Khan son of Aly son of Abderrahman son of Abdallah son of Masoud el Hadheli who is commonly called Masoudi and surnamed Cothbeddin but who takes the humble title of Laheb ar rasoul which means the companion of the ambassador of God He has written a universal history entitled Mouroudge ed dharab or the Golden Meadows and the Mines of Precious Stones four In this valuable work he has related the history of the world from the creation down to the moment of writing which was under the Khaliphat of Mothi Billah in the month Dgioumadi el aoual of the three hundred and thirty sixth year of the Hegira or flight of the Prophet He informs us that the earth is a huge bird Mecca and Medina constitute the head Persia and India the right wing the land of Gog the left wing and Africa the tail He informs us moreover that an earth has existed before the present which he considers as a mere chicken of seven thousand years that it has undergone divers deluges and that according to the opinion of some well informed Brahmins of his acquaintance it will be renovated every seventy thousandth hazarouam each hazarouam consisting of twelve thousand years These are a few of the many contradictory opinions of philosophers concerning the earth and we find that the learned have had equal perplexity as to the nature of the sun Some of the ancient philosophers have affirmed that it is a vast wheel of brilliant fire five others that it is merely a mirror or sphere of transparent crystal six and a third class at the head of whom stands Anaxagoras maintained that it was nothing but a huge ignited mass of iron or stone indeed he declared the heavens to be merely a vault of stone and that the stars were stones whirled upward from the earth and set on fire by the velocity of its revolutions seven But I give little attention to the doctrines of this philosopher the people of Athens having fully refuted them by banishing him from their city a concise mode of answering unwelcome doctrines much resorted to in former days Another sect of philosophers do declare that certain fiery particles exhale constantly from the earth which concentrating in a single point of the firmament by day constitute the sun but being scattered and rambling about in the dark at night collect in various points and form stars These are regularly burnt out and extinguished not unlike to the lamps in our streets and require a fresh supply of exhalations for the next occasion eight It is even recorded that at certain remote and obscure periods in consequence of a great scarcity of fuel the sun has been completely burnt out and sometimes not rekindled for a month at a time A most melancholy circumstance the very idea of which gave vast concern to Heraclitus that worthy weeping philosopher of antiquity In addition to these various speculations it was the opinion of Herschel that the sun is a magnificent habitable abode the light it furnishes arising from certain empyreal luminous or phosphoric clouds swimming in its transparent atmosphere nine But we will not enter further at present into the nature of the sun that being an inquiry not immediately necessary to the development of this history neither will we embroil ourselves in any more of the endless disputes of philosophers touching the form of this globe but content ourselves with the theory advanced in the beginning of this chapter and will proceed to illustrate by experiment the complexity of motion therein described to this our rotatory planet Professor Von Poddingcoft or Puddinghead as the name may be rendered into English was long celebrated in the University of Leyden for profound gravity of deportment and a talent at going to sleep in the midst of examinations to the infinite relief of his hopeful students who thereby worked their way through college with great ease and little study In the course of one of his lectures the learned professor seizing a bucket of water swung it around his head at arm s length The impulse with which he threw the vessel from him being a centrifugal force the retention of his arm operating as a centripetal power and the bucket which was a substitute for the earth describing a circular orbit round about the globular head and ruby visage of Professor Von Poddingcoft which formed no bad representation of the sun All of these particulars were duly explained to the class of gaping students around him He apprised them moreover that the same principle of gravitation which retained the water in the bucket restrains the ocean from flying from the earth in its rapid revolutions and he farther informed them that should the motion of the earth be suddenly checked it would incontinently fall into the sun through the centripetal force of gravitation a most ruinous event to this planet and one which would also obscure though it most probably would not extinguish the solar luminary An unlucky stripling one of those vagrant geniuses who seem sent into the world merely to annoy worthy men of the puddinghead order desirous of ascertaining the correctness of the experiment suddenly arrested the arm of the professor just at the moment that the bucket was in its zenith which immediately descended with astonishing precision upon the philosophic head of the instructor of youth A hollow sound and a red hot hiss attended the contact but the theory was in the amplest manner illustrated for the unfortunate bucket perished in the conflict but the blazing countenance of Professor Von Poddingcoft emerged from amidst the waters glowing fiercer than ever with unutterable indignation whereby the students were marvelously edified and departed considerably wiser than before It is a mortifying circumstance which greatly perplexes many a painstaking philosopher that nature often refuses to second his most profound and elaborate efforts so that often after having invented one of the most ingenious and natural theories imaginable she will have the perverseness to act directly in the teeth of his system and flatly contradict his most favorite positions This is a manifest and unmerited grievance since it throws the censure of the vulgar and unlearned entirely upon the philosopher whereas the fault is not to be ascribed to his theory which is unquestionably correct but to the waywardness of Dame Nature who with the proverbial fickleness of her sex is continually indulging in coquetries and caprices and seems really to take pleasure in violating all philosophic rules and jilting the most learned and indefatigable of her adorers Thus it happened with respect to the foregoing satisfactory explanation of the motion of our planet it appears that the centrifugal force has long since ceased to operate while its antagonist remains in undiminished potency the world therefore according to the theory as it originally stood ought in strict propriety to tumble into the sun philosophers were convinced that it would do so and awaited in anxious impatience the fulfillment of their prognostics But the untoward planet pertinaciously continued her course not withstanding that she had reason philosophy and a whole university of learned professors opposed to her conduct The philosophers took this in very ill part and it is thought they would never have pardoned the slight and affront which they conceived put upon them by the world had not a good natured professor kindly officiated as a mediator between the parties and effected a reconciliation Finding the world would not accommodate itself to the theory he wisely determined to accommodate the theory to the world he therefore informed his brother philosophers that the circular motion of the earth round the sun was no sooner engendered by the conflicting impulses above described than it became a regular revolution independent of the cause which gave it origin His learned brethren readily joined in the opinion being heartily glad of any explanation that would decently extricate them from their embarrassment and ever since that memorable era the world has been left to take her own course and to revolve around the sun in such orbit as she thinks proper FOOTNOTES two Faria y Souza Mick Lus note b seven three Sir W Jones Diss Antiq Ind Zod four MSS Bibliot Roi Fr five Plutarch de Plac Philos

the world and given him some idea of its form and situation he will naturally be curious to know from whence it came and how it was created And indeed the clearing up of these points is absolutely essential to my history inasmuch as if this world had not been formed it is more than probable that this renowned island on which is situated the city of New York would never have had an existence The regular course of my history therefore requires that I should proceed to notice the cosmogony or formation of this our globe And now I give my readers fair warning that I am about to plunge for a chapter or two into as complete a labyrinth as ever historian was perplexed withal therefore I advise them to take fast hold of my skirts and keep close at my heels venturing neither to the right hand nor to the left lest they get bemired in a slough of unintelligible learning or have their brains knocked out by some of those hard Greek names which will be flying about in all directions But should any of them be too indolent or chicken hearted to accompany me in this perilous undertaking they had better take a short cut round and wait for me at the beginning of some smoother chapter Of the creation of the world we have a thousand contradictory accounts and though a very satisfactory one is furnished us by divine revelation yet every philosopher feels himself in honor bound to furnish us with a better As an impartial historian I consider it my duty to notice their several theories by which mankind have been so exceedingly edified and instructed Thus it was the opinion of certain ancient sages that the earth and the whole system of the universe was the Deity himself ten a doctrine most strenuously maintained by Zenophanes and the whole tribe of Eleatics as also by Strabo and the sect of peripatetic philosophers Pythagoras likewise inculcated the famous numerical system of the monad dyad and triad and by means of his sacred quaternary elucidated the formation of the world the arcana of nature and the principles both of music and morals eleven Other sages adhered to the mathematical system of squares and triangles the cube the pyramid and the sphere the tetrahedron the octahedron the icosahedron and the dodecahedron twelve While others advocated the great elementary theory which refers the construction of our globe and all that it contains to the combinations of four material elements air earth fire and water with the assistance of a fifth an immaterial and vivifying principle Nor must I omit to mention the great atomic system taught by old Moschus before the siege of Troy revived by Democritus of laughing memory improved by Epicurus that king of good fellows and modernized by the fanciful Descartes But I decline inquiring whether the atoms of which the earth is said to be composed are eternal or recent whether they are animate or inanimate whether agreeably to the opinion of Atheists they were fortuitously aggregated or as the Theists maintain were arranged by a supreme intelligence thirteen Whether in fact the earth be an insensate clod or whether it be animated by a soul fourteen which opinion was strenuously maintained by a host of philosophers at the head of whom stands the great Plato that temperate sage who threw the cold water of philosophy on the form of sexual intercourse and inculcated the doctrine of Platonic love an exquisitely refined intercourse but much better adapted to the ideal inhabitants of his imaginary island of Atlantis than to the sturdy race composed of rebellious flesh and blood which populates the little matter of fact island we inhabit Besides these systems we have moreover the poetical theogony of old Hesiod who generated the whole universe in the regular mode of procreation and the plausible opinion of others that the earth was hatched from the great egg of night which floated in chaos and was cracked by the horns of the celestial bull To illustrate this last doctrine Burnet in his theory of the earth fifteen has favored us with an accurate drawing and description both of the form and texture of this mundane egg which is found to bear a marvelous resemblance to that of a goose Such of my readers as take a proper interest in the origin of this our planet will be pleased to learn that the most profound sages of antiquity among the Egyptians Chaldeans Persians Greeks and Latins have alternately assisted at the hatching of this strange bird and that their cacklings have been caught and continued in different tones and inflections from philosopher to philosopher unto the present day But while briefly noticing long celebrated systems of ancient sages let me not pass over with neglect those of other philosophers which though less universal than renowned have equal claims to attention and equal chance for correctness Thus it is recorded by the Brahmins in the pages of their inspired Shastah that the angel Bistnoo transformed himself into a great boar plunged into the watery abyss and brought up the earth on his tusks Then issued from him a mighty tortoise and a mighty snake and Bistnoo placed the snake erect upon the back of the tortoise and he placed the earth upon the head of the snake sixteen The negro philosophers of Congo affirm that the world was made by the hands of angels excepting their own country which the Supreme Being constructed himself that it might be supremely excellent And he took great pains with the inhabitants and made them very black and beautiful and when he had finished the first man he was well pleased with him and smoothed him over the face and hence his nose and the nose of all his descendants became flat The Mohawk philosophers tell us that a pregnant woman fell down from heaven and that a tortoise took her upon its back because every place was covered with water and that the woman sitting upon the tortoise paddled with her hands in the water and raked up the earth whence it finally happened that the earth became higher than the water seventeen But I forbear to quote a number more of these ancient and outlandish philosophers whose deplorable ignorance in despite of all their erudition compelled them to write in languages which but few of my readers can understand and I shall proceed briefly to notice a few more intelligible and fashionable theories of their modern successors And first I shall mention the great Buffon who conjectures that this globe was originally a globe of liquid fire scintillated from the body of the sun by the percussion of a comet as a spark is generated by the collision of flint and steel That at first it was surrounded by gross vapors which cooling and condensing in process of time constituted according to their densities earth water and air which gradually arranged themselves according to their respective gravities round the burning or vitrified mass that formed their center Hutton on the contrary supposes that the waters at first were universally paramount and he terrifies himself with the idea that the earth must be eventually washed away by the force of rain rivers and mountain torrents until it is confounded with the ocean or in other words absolutely dissolves into itself Sublime idea far surpassing that of the tender hearted damsel of antiquity who wept herself into a fountain or the good dame of Narbonne in France who for a volubility of tongue unusual in her sex was doomed to peel five hundred thousand and thirty nine ropes of onions and actually run out at her eyes before half the hideous task was accomplished Whistorn the same ingenious philosopher who rivaled Ditton in his researches after the longitude for which the mischief loving Swift discharged on their heads a most savory stanza has distinguished himself by a very admirable theory respecting the earth He conjectures that it was originally a chaotic comet which being selected for the abode of man was removed from its eccentric orbit and whirled round the sun in its present regular motion by which change of direction order succeeded to confusion in the arrangement of its component parts The philosopher adds that the deluge was produced by an uncourteous salute from the watery tail of another comet doubtless through sheer envy of its improved condition thus furnishing a melancholy proof that jealousy may prevail even among the heavenly bodies and discord interrupt that celestial harmony of the spheres so melodiously sung by the poets But I pass over a variety of excellent theories among which are those of Burnet and Woodward and Whitehurst regretting extremely that my time will not suffer me to give them the notice they deserve and shall conclude with that of the renowned doctor Darwin This learned Theban who is as much distinguished for rhyme as reason and for good natured credulity as serious research and who has recommended himself wonderfully to the good graces of the ladies by letting them into all the gallantries amours debaucheries and other topics of scandal of the court of Flora has fallen upon a theory worthy of his combustible imagination According to his opinion the huge mass of chaos took a sudden occasion to explode like a barrel of gunpowder and in that act exploded the sun which in its flight by a similar convulsion exploded the earth which in like guise exploded the moon and thus by a concatenation of explosions the whole solar system was produced and set most systematically in motion eighteen By the great variety of theories here alluded to every one of which if thoroughly examined will be found surprisingly consistent in all its parts my unlearned readers will perhaps be led to conclude that the creation of a world is not so difficult a task as they at first imagined I have shown at least a score of ingenious methods in which a world could be constructed and I have no doubt that had any of the philosophers above quoted the use of a good manageable comet and the philosophical warehouse chaos at his command he would engage to manufacture a planet as good or if you would take his word for it better than this we inhabit And here I cannot help noticing the kindness of Providence in creating comets for the great relief of bewildered philosophers By their assistance more sudden evolutions and transitions are effected in the system of nature than are wrought in a pantomimic exhibition by the wonder working sword of harlequin Should one of our modern sages in his theoretical flights among the stars ever find himself lost in the clouds and in danger of tumbling into the abyss of nonsense and absurdity he has but to seize a comet by the beard mount astride of its tail and away he gallops in triumph like an enchanter on his hippogriff or a Connecticut witch on her broomstick to sweep the cobwebs out of the sky It is an old and vulgar saying about a beggar on horseback which I would not for the world have applied to these reverend philosophers but I must confess that some of them when they are mounted on one of those fiery steeds are as wild in their curvettings as was Phaeton of yore when he aspired to manage the chariot of Phoebus One drives his comet at full speed against the sun and knocks the world out of him with the mighty concussion another more moderate makes his comet a kind of beast of burden carrying the sun a regular supply of food and faggots a third of more combustible disposition threatens to throw his comet like a bombshell into the world and blow it up like a powder magazine while a fourth with no great delicacy to this planet and its inhabitants insinuates that some day or other his comet my modest pen blushes while I write it shall absolutely turn tail upon our world and deluge it with water Surely as I have already observed comets were bountifully provided by Providence for the benefit of philosophers to assist them in manufacturing theories And now having adduced several of the most prominent theories that occur to my recollection I leave my judicious readers at full liberty to choose among them They are all serious speculations of learned men all differ essentially from each other and all have the same title to belief It has ever been the task of one race of philosophers to demolish the works of their predecessors and elevate more splendid fantasies in their stead which in their turn are demolished and replaced by the air castles of a succeeding generation Thus it would seem that knowledge and genius of which we make such great parade consist but in detecting the errors and absurdities of those who have gone before and devising new errors and absurdities to be detected by those who are to come after us Theories are the mighty soap bubbles with which the grown up children of science amuse themselves while the honest vulgar stand gazing in stupid admiration and dignify these learned vagaries with the name of wisdom Surely Socrates was right in his opinion that philosophers are but a soberer sort of madmen busying themselves in things totally incomprehensible or which if they could be comprehended would be found not worthy the trouble of discovery For my own part until the learned have come to an agreement among themselves I shall content myself with the account handed down to us by Moses in which I do but follow the example of our ingenious neighbors of Connecticut who at their first settlement proclaimed that the colony should be governed by the laws of God until they had time to make better One thing however appears certain from the unanimous authority of the before quoted philosophers supported by the evidence of our own senses which though very apt to deceive us may be cautiously admitted as additional testimony it appears I say and I make the assertion deliberately without fear of contradiction that this globe really was created and that it is composed of land and water It further appears that it is curiously divided and parceled out into continents and islands among which I boldly declare the renowned island of New York will be found by any one who seeks for it in its proper place FOOTNOTES ten Aristot ap Cic lib i cap three eleven Aristot

other children Thus Berosus makes him father of the gigantic Titans Methodius gives him a son called Jonithus or Jonicus who was the first inventor of Johnny cakes and others have mentioned a son named Thuiscon from whom descended the Teutons or Teutonic or in other words the Dutch nation I regret exceedingly that the nature of my plan will not permit me to gratify the laudable curiosity of my readers by investigating minutely the history of the great Noah Indeed such an undertaking would be attended with more trouble than many people would imagine for the good old patriarch seems to have been a great traveler in his day and to have passed under a different name in every country that he visited The Chaldeans for instance give us his story merely altering his name into Xisuthrus a trivial alteration which to an historian skilled in etymologies will appear wholly unimportant It appears likewise that he had exchanged his tarpaulin and quadrant among the Chaldeans for the gorgeous insignia of royalty and appears as a monarch in their annals The Egyptians celebrate him under the name of Osiris the Indians as Menu the Greek and Roman writers confound him with Ogyges and the Theban with Deucalion and Saturn But the Chinese who deservedly rank among the most extensive and authentic historians inasmuch as they have known the world much longer than any one else declare that Noah was no other than Fohi and what gives this assertion some air of credibility is that it is a fact admitted by the most enlightened literati that Noah traveled into China at the time of the building of the Tower of Babel probably to improve himself in the study of languages and the learned doctor Shuckford gives us the additional information that the ark rested on a mountain on the frontiers of China From this mass of rational conjectures and sage hypotheses many satisfactory deductions might be drawn but I shall content myself with the simple fact stated in the Bible viz that Noah begat three sons Shem Ham and Japhet It is astonishing on what remote and obscure contingencies the great affairs of this world depend and how events the most distant and to the common observer unconnected are inevitably consequent the one to the other It remains to the philosopher to discover these mysterious affinities and it is the proudest triumph of his skill to detect and drag forth some latent chain of causation which at first sight appears a paradox to the inexperienced observer Thus many of my readers will doubtless wonder what connection the family of Noah can possibly have with this history and many will stare when informed that the whole history of this quarter of the world has taken its character and course from the simplest circumstance of the patriarch s having but three sons but to explain Noah we are told by sundry very credible historians becoming sole surviving heir and proprietor of the earth in fee simple after the deluge like a good father portioned out his estate among his children To Shem he gave Asia to Ham Africa and to Japhet Europe Now it is a thousand times to be lamented that he had but three sons for had there been a fourth he would doubtless have inherited America which of course would have been dragged forth from its obscurity on the occasion and thus many a hard working historian and philosopher would have been spared a prodigious mass of weary conjecture respecting the first discovery and population of this country Noah however having provided for his three sons looked in all probability upon our country as mere wild unsettled land and said nothing about it and to this unpardonable taciturnity of the patriarch may we ascribe the misfortune that America did not come into the world as early as the other quarters of the globe It is true some writers have vindicated him from this misconduct towards posterity and asserted that he really did discover America Thus it was the opinion of Mark Lescarbot a French writer possessed of that ponderosity of thought and profoundness of reflection so peculiar to his nation that the immediate descendants of Noah peopled this quarter of the globe and that the old patriarch himself who still retained a passion for the seafaring life superintended the transmigration The pious and enlightened father Charlevoix a French Jesuit remarkable for his aversion to the marvelous common to all great travelers is conclusively of the same opinion nay he goes still farther and decides upon the manner in which the discovery was effected which was by sea and under the immediate direction of the great Noah I have already observed exclaims the good father in a tone of becoming indignation that it is an arbitrary supposition that the grandchildren of Noah were not able to penetrate into the new world or that they never thought of it In effect I can see no reason that can justify such a notion Who can seriously believe that Noah and his immediate descendants knew less than we do and that the builder and pilot of the greatest ship that ever was a ship which was formed to traverse an unbounded ocean and had so many shoals and quicksands to guard against should be ignorant of or should not have communicates to his descendants the art of sailing on the ocean Therefore they did sail on the ocean therefore they sailed to America therefore America was discovered by Noah Now all this exquisite chain of reasoning which is so strikingly characteristic of the good father being addressed to the faith rather than the understanding is flatly opposed by Hans de Laet who declares it a real and most ridiculous paradox to suppose that Noah ever entertained the thought of discovering America and as Hans is a Dutch writer I am inclined to believe he must have been much better acquainted with the worthy crew of the ark than his competitors and of course possessed of more accurate sources of information It is astonishing how intimate historians do daily become with the patriarchs and other great men of antiquity As intimacy improves with time and as the learned are particularly inquisitive and familiar in their acquaintance with the ancients I should not be surprised if some future writers should gravely give us a picture of men and manners as they existed before the flood far more copious and accurate than the Bible and that in the course of another century the log book of the good Noah should be as current among historians as the voyages of Captain Cook or the renowned history of Robinson Crusoe I shall not occupy my time by discussing the huge mass of additional suppositions conjectures and probabilities respecting the first discovery of this country with which unhappy historians overload themselves in their endeavors to satisfy the doubts of an incredulous world It is painful to see these laborious wights panting and toiling and sweating under an enormous burden at the very outset of their works which on being opened turns out to be nothing but a mighty bundle of straw As however by unwearied assiduity they seem to have established the fact to the satisfaction of all the world that this country has been discovered I shall avail myself of their useful labors to be extremely brief upon this point I shall not therefore stop to inquire whether America was first discovered by a wandering vessel of that celebrated Phoenician fleet which according to Herodotus circumnavigated Africa or by that Carthaginian expedition which Pliny the naturalist informs us discovered the Canary Islands or whether it was settled by a temporary colony from Tyre as hinted by Aristotle and Seneca I shall neither inquire whether it was first discovered by the Chinese as Vossius with great shrewdness advances nor by the Norwegians in ten oh two under Biron nor be Behem the German navigator as mister Otto has endeavored to prove to the savants of the learned city of Philadelphia Nor shall I investigate the more modern claims of the Welsh founded on the voyage of Prince Madoc in the eleventh century who having never returned it has since been wisely concluded that he must have gone to America and that for a plain reason if he did not go there where else could he have gone a question which most Socratically shuts out all further dispute Laying aside therefore all the conjectures above mentioned with a multitude of others equally satisfactory I shall take for granted the vulgar opinion that America was discovered on the twelfth of October fourteen ninety two by Christopher Colon a Genoese who has been clumsily nicknamed Columbus but for what reason I cannot discern Of the voyages and adventures of this Colon I shall say nothing seeing that they are already sufficiently known Nor shall I undertake to prove that this country should have been called Colonia after his name that being notoriously self evident Having thus happily got my readers on this side of the Atlantic I picture them to myself all impatience to enter upon the enjoyment of the land of promise and in full expectation that I will immediately deliver it into their possession But if I do may I ever forfeit the reputation of a regular bred historian No no most curious and thrice learned readers for thrice learned ye are if ye have read all that has gone before and nine times learned shall ye be if ye read that which comes after we have yet a world of work before us Think you the first discoverers of this fair quarter of the globe had nothing to do but go on shore and find a country ready laid out and cultivated like a garden wherein they might revel at their ease No such thing They had forests to cut down underwood to grub up marshes to drain and savages to exterminate In like manner I have sundry doubts to clear away questions to resolve and paradoxes to explain before I permit you to range at random but these difficulties once overcome we shall be enabled to jog on right merrily through the rest of our history Thus my work shall in a manner echo the nature of the subject in the same manner as the sound of poetry has been found by certain shrewd critics to echo the sense this being an improvement in history which I claim the merit of having invented CHAPTER IV The next inquiry at which we arrive in the regular course of our history is to ascertain if possible how this country was originally peopled a point fruitful of incredible embarrassments for unless we prove that the aborigines did absolutely come from somewhere it will be immediately asserted in this age of scepticism that they did not come at all and if they did not come at all then was this country never populated a conclusion perfectly agreeable to the rules of logic but wholly irreconcilable to every feeling of humanity inasmuch as it must syllogistically prove fatal to the innumerable aborigines of this populous region To avert so dire a sophism and to rescue from logical annihilation so many millions of fellow creatures how many wings of geese have been plundered what oceans of ink have been benevolently drained and how many capacious heads of learned historians have been addled and for ever confounded I pause with reverential awe when I contemplate the ponderous tomes in different languages with which they have endeavored to solve this question so important to the happiness of society but so involved in clouds of impenetrable obscurity Historian after historian has engaged in the endless circle of hypothetical argument and after leading us a weary chase through octavos quartos and folios has let us out at the end of his work just as wise as we were at the beginning It was doubtless some philosophical wild goose chase of the kind that made the old poet Macrobius rail in such a passion at curiosity which he anathematises most heartily as an irksome agonising care a superstitious industry about unprofitable things an itching humor to see what is not to be seen and to be doing what signifies nothing when it is done But to proceed Of the claims of the children of Noah to the original population of this country I shall say nothing as they have already been touched upon in my last chapter The claimants next in celebrity are the descendants of Abraham Thus Christoval Colon vulgarly called Columbus when he first discovered the gold mines of Hispaniola immediately concluded with a shrewdness that would have done honor to a philosopher that he had found the ancient Ophir from whence Solomon procured the gold for embellishing the temple at Jerusalem nay Colon even imagined that he saw the remains of furnaces of veritable Hebraic construction employed in refining the precious ore So golden a conjecture tinctured with such fascinating extravagance was too tempting not to be immediately snapped at by the gudgeons of learning and accordingly there were divers profound writers ready to swear to its correctness and to bring in their usual load of authorities and wise surmises wherewithal to prop it up Vatablus and Robert Stephens declared nothing could be more clear Arius Montanus without the least hesitation asserts that Mexico was the true Ophir and the Jews the early settlers of the country While Possevin Becan and several other sagacious writers lug in a supposed prophecy of the fourth book of Esdras which being inserted in the mighty hypothesis like the keystone of an arch gives it in their opinion perpetual durability Scarce however have they completed their goodly superstructure when in trudges a phalanx of opposite authors with Hans de Laet the great Dutchman at their head and at one blow tumbles the whole fabric about their ears Hans in fact contradicts outright all the Israelitish claims to the first settlement of this country attributing all those equivocal symptoms and traces of Christianity and Judaism which have been said to be found in divers provinces of the new world to the Devil who has always effected to counterfeit the worship of the true Deity A remark says the knowing old Padre d Acosta made by all good authors who have spoken of the religion of nations newly discovered and founded besides on the authority of the fathers of the church Some writers again among whom it is with much regret I am compelled to mention Lopez de Gomara and Juan de Leri insinuate that the Canaanites being driven from the land of promise by the Jews were seized with such a panic that they fled without looking behind them until stopping to take breath they found themselves safe in America As they brought neither their national language manners nor features with them it is supposed they left them behind in the hurry of their flight I cannot give my faith to this opinion I pass over the supposition of the learned Grotius who being both an ambassador and a Dutchman to boot is entitled to great respect that North America was peopled by a strolling company of Norwegians and that Peru was founded by a colony from China Manco or Mungo Capac the first Incas being himself a Chinese Nor shall I more than barely mention that Father Kircher ascribes the settlement of America to the Egyptians Budbeck to the Scandinavians Charron to the Gauls Juffredus Petri to a skating party from Friesland Milius to the Celtae Marinocus the Sicilian to the Romans Le Comte to the Phoenicians Postel to the Moors Martin d Angleria to the Abyssinians together with the sage surmise of De Laet that England Ireland and the Orcades may contend for that honor Nor will I bestow any more attention or credit to the idea that America is the fairy region of Zipangri described by that dreaming traveler Marco Polo the Venetian or that it comprises the visionary island of Atlantis described by Plato Neither will I stop to investigate the heathenish assertion of Paracelsus that each hemisphere of the globe was originally furnished with an Adam and Eve Or the more flattering opinion of doctor Romayne supported by many nameless authorities that Adam was of the Indian race or the startling conjecture of Buffon Helvetius and Darwin so highly honorable to mankind that the whole human species is accidentally descended foam a remarkable family of monkeys This last conjecture I must own came upon me very suddenly and very ungraciously I have often beheld the clown in a pantomime while gazing in stupid wonder at the extravagant gambols of a harlequin all at once electrified by a sudden stroke of the wooden sword across his shoulders Little did I think at such times that it would ever fall to my lot to be treated with equal discourtesy and that while I was quietly beholding these grave philosophers emulating the eccentric transformations of the hero of pantomime they would on a sudden turn upon me and my readers and with one hypocritical flourish metamorphose us into beasts I determined from that moment not to burn my fingers with any more of their theories but content myself with detailing the different methods by which they transported the descendants of these ancient and respectable monkeys to this great field of theoretical warfare This was done either by migrations by land or transmigrations by water Thus Padre Joseph d Acosta enumerates three passages by land first by the north of Europe secondly by the north of Asia and thirdly by regions southward of the Straits of Magellan The learned Grotius marches his Norwegians by a pleasant route across frozen rivers and arms of the sea through Iceland Greenland Estotiland and Naremberga and various writers among whom are Angleria De Hornn and Buffon anxious for the accommodation of these travelers have fastened the two continents together by a strong chain of deductions by which means they could pass over dry shod But should even this fail Pinkerton that industrious old gentleman who compiles books and manufactures geographies has constructed a natural bridge of ice from continent to continent at the distance of four or five miles from Behring s Straits for which he is entitled to the grateful thanks of all the wandering aborigines who ever did or ever will pass over it It is an evil much to be lamented that none of the worthy writers above quoted could ever commence his work without immediately declaring hostilities against every writer who had treated of the same subject In this particular authors may be compared to a certain sagacious bird which in building its nest is sure to pull to pieces the nests of all the birds in its neighborhood This unhappy propensity tends grievously to impede the progress of sound knowledge Theories are at best but brittle productions and when once committed to the stream they should take care that like the notable pots which were fellow voyagers they do not crack each other My chief surprise is that among the many writers I have noticed no one has attempted to prove that this country was peopled from the moon or that the first inhabitants floated hither on islands of ice as white bears cruise about the northern oceans or that they were conveyed hither by balloons as modern aeronauts pass from Dover to Calais or by witchcraft as Simon Magus posted among the stars or after the manner of the renowned Scythian Abaris who like the New England witches on full blooded broomsticks made most unheard of journeys on the back of a golden arrow given him by the Hyperborean Apollo But there is still one mode left by which this country could have been peopled which I have reserved for the last because I consider it worth all the rest it is by accident Speaking of the islands of Solomon New Guinea and New Holland the profound father Charlevoix observes In fine all these countries are peopled and it is possible some have been so by accident Now if it could have happened in that manner why might it not have been at the same time and by the same means with the other parts of the globe This ingenious mode of deducing certain conclusions from possible premises is an improvement in syllogistic skill and proves the good father superior even to Archimedes for he can turn the world without anything to rest his lever upon It is only surpassed by the dexterity with which the sturdy old Jesuit in another place cuts the gordian knot Nothing says he is more easy The inhabitants of both hemispheres are certainly the descendants of the same father The common father of mankind received an express order from Heaven to people the world and accordingly it has been peopled To bring this about it was necessary to overcome all difficulties in the way and they have also been overcome Pious logician how does he put all the herd of laborious theorists to the blush by explaining in five words what it has cost them volumes to prove they knew nothing about From all the authorities here quoted and a variety of others which I have consulted but which are omitted through fear of fatiguing the unlearned reader I can only draw the following conclusions which luckily however are sufficient for my purpose First that this part of the world has actually been peopled Q E D to support which we have living proofs in the numerous tribes of Indians that inhabit it Secondly that it has been peopled in five hundred different ways as proved by a cloud of authors who from the positiveness of their assertions seem to have been eye witnesses to the fact Thirdly that the people of this country had a variety of fathers which as it may not be thought much to their credit by the common run of readers the less we say on the subject the better The question therefore I trust is for ever at rest CHAPTER V The writer of a history may in some respects be likened unto an adventurous knight who having undertaken a perilous enterprise by way of establishing his fame feels bound in honor and chivalry to turn back for no difficulty nor hardship and never to shrink or quail whatever enemy he may encounter Under this impression I resolutely draw my pen and fall to with might and main at those doughty questions and subtle paradoxes which like fiery dragons and bloody giants beset the entrance to my history and would fain repulse me from the very threshold And at this moment a gigantic question has started up which I must needs take by the beard and utterly subdue before I can advance another step in my historic undertaking but I trust this will be the last adversary I shall have to contend with and that in the next book I shall be enabled to conduct my readers in triumph into the body of my work The question which has thus suddenly arisen is What right had the first discoverers of America to land and take possession of a country without first gaining the consent of its inhabitants or yielding them an adequate compensation for their territory a question which has withstood many fierce assaults and has given much distress of mind to multitudes of kind hearted folk And indeed until it be totally vanquished and put to rest the worthy people of America can by no means enjoy the soil they inhabit with clear right and title and quiet unsullied conscience The first source of right by which property is acquired in a country is discovery For as all mankind have an equal right to anything which has never before been appropriated so any nation that discovers an uninhabited country and takes possession thereof is considered as enjoying full property and absolute unquestionable empire therein nineteen This proposition being admitted it follows clearly that the Europeans who first visited America were the real discoverers of the same nothing being necessary to the establishment of this fact but simply to prove that it was totally uninhabited by man This would at first appear to be a point of some difficulty for it is well known that this quarter of the world abounded with certain animals that walked erect on two feet had something of the human countenance uttered certain unintelligible sounds very much like language in short had a marvelous resemblance to human beings But the zealous and enlightened fathers who accompanied the discoverers for the purpose of promoting the kingdom of heaven by establishing fat monasteries and bishoprics on earth soon cleared up this point greatly to the satisfaction of his holiness the Pope and of all Christian voyagers and discoverers They plainly proved and as there were no Indian writers arose on the other side the fact was considered as fully admitted and established that the two legged race of animals before mentioned were mere cannibals detestable monsters and many of them giants which last description of vagrants have since the time of Gog Magog and Goliath been considered as outlaws and have received no quarter in either history chivalry or song Indeed even the philosophic Bacon declared the Americans to be people proscribed by the laws of nature inasmuch as they had a barbarous custom of sacrificing men and feeding upon man s flesh Nor are these all the proofs of their utter barbarism among many other writers of discernment Ulla tells us their imbecility is so visible that one can hardly form an idea of them different from what one has of the brutes Nothing disturbs the tranquillity of their souls equally insensible to disasters and to prosperity Though half naked they are as contented as a monarch in his most splendid array Fear makes no impression on them and respect as little All this is furthermore supported by the authority of M Boggier It is not easy says he to describe the degree of their indifference for wealth and all its advantages One does not well know what motives to propose to them when one would persuade them to any service It is vain to offer them money they answer they are not hungry And Vane gas confirms the whole assuring us that ambition they have none and are more desirous of being thought strong than valiant The objects of ambition with us honor fame reputation riches posts and distinctions are unknown among them So that this powerful spring of action the cause of so much seeming good and real evil in the world has no power over them In a word these unhappy mortals may be compared to children in whom the development of reason is not completed Now all these peculiarities although in the unenlightened states of Greece they would have entitled their possessors to immortal honor as having reduced to practice those rigid and abstemious maxims the mere talking about which acquired certain old Greeks the reputation of sages and philosophers yet were they clearly proved in the present instance to betoken a most abject and brutified nature totally beneath the human character But the benevolent fathers who had undertaken to turn these unhappy savages into dumb beasts by dint of argument advanced still stronger proofs for as certain divines of the sixteenth century and among the rest Lullus affirm the Americans go naked and have no beards They have nothing says Lullus of the reasonable animal except the mask And even that mask was allowed to avail them but little for it was soon found that they were of a hideous copper complexion and being of a copper complexion it was all the same as if they were negroes and negroes are black and black said the pious fathers devoutly crossing themselves is the color of the devil Therefore so far from being able to own property they had no right even to personal freedom for liberty is too radiant a deity to inhabit such gloomy temples All which circumstances plainly convinced the righteous followers of Cortes and Pizarro that these miscreants had no title to the soil that they infested that they were a perverse illiterate dumb beardless black seed mere wild beasts of the forests and like them should either be subdued or exterminated From the foregoing arguments therefore and a variety of others equally conclusive which I forbear to enumerate it is clearly evident that this fair quarter of the globe when first visited by Europeans was a howling wilderness inhabited by nothing but wild beasts and that the transatlantic visitors acquired an incontrovertible property therein by the right of discovery This right being fully established we now come to the next which is the right acquired by cultivation The cultivation of the soil we are told is an obligation imposed by nature on mankind The whole world is appointed for the nourishment of its inhabitants but it would be incapable of doing it was it uncultivated Every nation is then obliged by the law of nature to cultivate the ground that has fallen to its share Those people like the ancient Germans and modern Tartars who having fertile countries disdain to cultivate the earth and choose to live by rapine are wanting to themselves and deserve to be exterminated as savage and pernicious beasts twenty Now it is notorious that the savages knew nothing of agriculture when first discovered by the Europeans but lived a most vagabond disorderly unrighteous life rambling from place to place and prodigally rioting upon the spontaneous luxuries of nature without tasking her generosity to yield them anything more whereas it has been most unquestionably shown that Heaven intended the earth should be ploughed and sown and manured and laid out into cities and towns and farms and country seats and pleasure grounds and public gardens all which the Indians knew nothing about therefore they did not improve the talents Providence had bestowed on them therefore they were careless stewards therefore they had no right to the soil therefore they deserved to be exterminated It is true the savages might plead that they drew all the benefits from the land which their simple wants required they found plenty of game to hunt which together with the roots and uncultivated fruits of the earth furnished a sufficient variety for their frugal repasts and that as Heaven merely designed the earth to form the abode and satisfy the wants of man so long as those purposes were answered the will of Heaven was accomplished But this only proves how undeserving they were of the blessings around them they were so much the more savages for not having more wants for knowledge is in some degree an increase of desires and it is this superiority both in the number and magnitude of his desires that distinguishes the man from the beast Therefore the Indians in not having more wants were very unreasonable animals and it was but just that they should make way for the Europeans who had a thousand wants to their one and therefore would turn the earth to more account and by cultivating it more truly fulfil the will of Heaven Besides Grotius and Lauterbach and Puffendorf and Titius and many wise men beside who have considered the matter properly have determined that the property of a country cannot be acquired by hunting cutting wood or drawing water in it nothing but precise demarcation of limits and the intention of cultivation can establish the possession Now as the savages probably from never having read the authors above quoted had never complied with any of these necessary forms it plainly follows that they had no right to the soil but that it was completely at the disposal of the first comers who had more knowledge more wants and more elegant that is to say artificial desires than themselves In entering upon a newly discovered uncultivated country therefore the new comers were but taking possession of what according to the aforesaid doctrine was their own property therefore in opposing them the savages were invading their just rights infringing the immutable laws of nature and counteracting the will of Heaven therefore they were guilty of impiety burglary and trespass on the case therefore they were hardened offenders against God and man therefore they ought to be exterminated But a more irresistible right than either that I have mentioned and one which will be the most readily admitted by my reader provided he be blessed with bowels of charity and philanthropy is the right acquired by civilization All the world knows the lamentable state in which these poor savages were found Not only deficient in the comforts of life but what is still worse most piteously and unfortunately blind to the miseries of their situation But no sooner did the benevolent inhabitants of Europe behold their sad condition than they immediately went to work to ameliorate and improve it They introduced among them rum gin brandy and the other comforts of life and it is astonishing to read how soon the poor savages learn to estimate those blessings they likewise made known to them a thousand remedies by which the most inveterate diseases are alleviated and healed and that they might comprehend the benefits and enjoy the comforts of these medicines they previously introduced among them the diseases which they were calculated to cure By these and a variety of other methods was the condition of these poor savages wonderfully improved they acquired a thousand wants of which they had before been ignorant and as he has most sources of happiness who has most wants to be gratified they were doubtlessly rendered a much happier race of beings But the most important branch of civilization and which has most strenuously been extolled by the zealous and pious fathers of the Roman Church is the introduction of the Christian faith It was truly a sight that might well inspire horror to behold these savages tumbling among the dark mountains of paganism and guilty of the most horrible ignorance of religion It is true they neither stole nor defrauded they were sober frugal continent and faithful to their word but though they acted right habitually it was all in vain unless they acted so from precept The new comers therefore used every method to induce them to embrace and practice the true religion except indeed that of setting them the example But not withstanding all these complicated labors for their good such was the unparalleled obstinacy of these stubborn wretches that they ungratefully refused to acknowledge the strangers as their benefactors and persisted in disbelieving the doctrines they endeavored to inculcate most insolently alleging that from their conduct the advocates of Christianity did not seem to believe in it themselves Was not this too much for human patience Would not one suppose that the benign visitants from Europe provoked at their incredulity and discouraged by their stiff necked obstinacy would for ever have abandoned their shores and consigned them to their original ignorance and misery But no so zealous were they to effect the temporal comfort and eternal salvation of these pagan infidels that they even proceeded from the milder means of persuasion to the more painful and troublesome one of persecution let loose among them whole troops of fiery monks and furious bloodhounds purified them by fire and sword by stake and faggot in consequence of which indefatigable measures the cause of Christian love and charity was so rapidly advanced that in a few years not one fifth of the number of unbelievers existed in South America that were found there at the time of its discovery What stronger right need the European settlers advance to the country than this Have not whole nations of uninformed savages been made acquainted with a thousand imperious wants and indispensable comforts of which they were before wholly ignorant Have they not been literally hunted and smoked out of the dens and lurking places of ignorance and infidelity and absolutely scourged into the right path Have not the temporal things the vain baubles and filthy lucre of this world which were too apt to engage their worldly and selfish thoughts been benevolently taken from them and have they not instead thereof been taught to set their affections on things above And finally to use the words of a reverend Spanish father in a letter to his superior in Spain Can any one have the presumption to say that these savage pagans have yielded anything more than an inconsiderable recompense to their benefactors in surrendering to them a little pitiful tract of this dirty sublunary planet in exchange for a glorious inheritance in the kingdom of heaven Here then are three complete and undeniable sources of right established any one of which was more than ample to establish a property in the newly discovered regions of America Now so it has happened in certain parts of this delightful quarter of the globe that the right of discovery has been so strenuously asserted the influence of cultivation so industriously extended and the progress of salvation and civilization so zealously persecuted that what with their attendant wars persecutions oppressions diseases and other partial evils that often hang on the skirts of great benefits the savage aborigines have somehow or other been utterly annihilated and this all at once brings me to a fourth right which is worth all the others put together For the original claimants to the soil being all dead and buried and no one remaining to inherit or dispute the soil the Spaniards as the next immediate occupants entered upon the possession as clearly as the hangman succeeds to the clothes of the malefactor and as they have Blackstone twenty one and all the learned expounders of the law on their side they may set all actions of ejectment at defiance and this last right may be entitled the right by extermination or in other words the right by gunpowder But lest any scruples of conscience should remain on this head and to settle the question of right for ever his holiness Pope Alexander VI issued a mighty Bull by which he generously granted the newly discovered quarter of the globe to the Spaniards and Portuguese who thus having law and gospel on their side and being inflamed with great spiritual zeal showed the pagan savages neither favor nor affection but persecuted the work of discovery colonization civilization and extermination with ten times more fury than ever Thus were the European worthies who first discovered America clearly entitled to the soil and not only entitled to the soil but likewise to the eternal thanks of these infidel savages for having come so far endured so many perils by sea and land and taken such unwearied pains for no other purpose but to improve their forlorn uncivilized and heathenish condition for having made them acquainted with the comforts of life for having introduced among them the light of religion and finally for having hurried them out of the world to enjoy its reward But as argument is never so well understood by us selfish mortals as when it comes home to ourselves and as I am particularly anxious that this question should be put to rest for ever I will suppose a parallel case by way of arousing the candid attention of my readers Let us suppose then that the inhabitants of the moon by astonishing advancement in science and by profound insight into that ineffable lunar philosophy the mere flickerings of which have of late years dazzled the feebled optics and addled the shallow brains of the good people of our globe let us suppose I say that the inhabitants of the moon by these means had arrived at such a command of their energies such an enviable state of perfectibility as to control the elements and navigate the boundless regions of space Let us suppose a roving crew of these soaring philosophers in the course of an aerial voyage of discovery among the stars should chance to alight upon this outlandish planet And here I beg my readers will not have the uncharitableness to smile as is too frequently the fault of volatile readers when perusing the grave speculations of philosophers I am far from indulging in any sportive vein at present nor is the supposition I have been making so wild as many may deem it It has long been a very serious and anxious question with me and many a time and oft in the course of my overwhelming cares and contrivances for the welfare and protection of this my native planet have I lain awake whole nights debating in my mind whether it were most probable we should first discover and civilize the moon or the moon discover and civilize our globe Neither would the prodigy of sailing in the air or cruising among the stars be a whit more astonishing and incomprehensible to us than was the European mystery of navigating floating castles through the world of waters to the simple savages We have already discovered the art of coasting along the aerial shores of our planet by means of balloons as the savages had of venturing along their sea coasts in canoes and the disparity between the former and the aerial vehicles of the philosophers from the moon might not be greater than that between the bark canoes of the savages and the mighty ships of their discoverers I might here pursue an endless chain of similar speculations but as they would be unimportant to my subject I abandon them to my reader particularly if he be a philosopher as matters well worthy of his attentive consideration To return then to my supposition let us suppose that the aerial visitants I have mentioned possessed of vastly superior knowledge to ourselves that is to say possessed of superior knowledge in the art of extermination riding on hippogriffs defended with impenetrable armor armed with concentrated sunbeams and provided with vast engines to hurl enormous moonstones in short let us suppose them if our vanity will permit the supposition as superior to us in knowledge and consequently in power as the Europeans were to the Indians when they first discovered them All this is very possible it is only our self sufficiency that makes us think otherwise and I warrant the poor savages before they had any knowledge of the white men armed in all the terrors of glittering steel and tremendous gunpowder were as perfectly convinced that they themselves were the wisest the most virtuous powerful and perfect of created beings as are at this present moment the lordly inhabitants of old England the volatile populace of France or even the self satisfied citizens of this most enlightened republic Let us suppose moreover that the aerial voyagers finding this planet to be nothing but a howling wilderness inhabited by us poor savages and wild beasts shall take formal possession of it in the name of his most gracious and philosophic excellency the Man in the Moon Finding however that their numbers are incompetent to hold it in complete subjection on account of the ferocious barbarity of its inhabitants they shall take our worthy President the King of England the Emperor of Hayti the mighty Bonaparte and the great King of Bantam and returning to their native planet shall carry them to court as were the Indian chiefs led about as spectacles in the courts of Europe Then making such obeisance as the etiquette of the court requires they shall address the puissant Man in the Moon in as near as I can conjecture the following terms Most serene and mighty Potentate whose dominions extend as far as eye can reach who rideth on the Great Bear useth the sun as a looking glass and maintaineth unrivaled control over tides madmen and sea crabs We thy liege subjects have just returned from a voyage of discovery in the course of which we have landed and taken possession of that obscure little dirty planet which thou beholdest rolling at a distance The five uncouth monsters which we have brought into this august present were once very important chiefs among their fellow savages who are a race of beings totally destitute of the common attributes of humanity and differing in everything from the inhabitants of the moon inasmuch as they carry their heads upon their shoulders instead of under their arms have two eyes instead of one are utterly destitute of tails and of a variety of unseemly complexions particularly of horrible whiteness instead of pea green We have moreover found these miserable savages sunk into a state of the utmost ignorance and depravity every man shamelessly living with his own wife and rearing his own children instead of indulging in that community of wives enjoined by the law of nature as expounded by the philosophers of the moon In a word they have scarcely a gleam of true philosophy among them but are in fact utter heretics ignoramuses and barbarians Taking compassion therefore on the sad condition of these sublunary wretches we have endeavored while we remained on their planet to introduce among them the light of reason and the comforts of the moon We have treated them to mouthfuls of moonshine and draughts of nitrous oxide which they swallowed with incredible voracity particularly the females and we have likewise endeavored to instil into them the precepts of lunar philosophy We have insisted upon their renouncing the contemptible shackles of religion and common sense and adoring the profound omnipotent and all perfect energy and the ecstatic immutable immovable perfection But such was the unparalleled obstinacy of these wretched savages that they persisted in cleaving to their wives and adhering to their religion and absolutely set at nought the sublime doctrines of the moon nay among other abominable heresies they even went so far as blasphemously to declare that this ineffable planet was made of nothing more nor less than green cheese At these words the great Man in the Moon being a very profound philosopher shall fall into a terrible passion and possessing equal authority over things that do not belong to him as did whilome his holiness the Pope shall forthwith issue a formidable Bull specifying That whereas a certain crew of Lunatics have lately discovered and taken possession of a newly discovered planet called the earth and that whereas it is inhabited by none but a race of two legged animals that carry their heads on their shoulders instead of under their arms cannot talk the Lunatic language have two eyes instead of one are destitute of tails and of a horrible whiteness instead of pea green therefore and for a variety of other excellent reasons they are considered incapable of possessing any property in the planet they infest and the right and title to it are confirmed to its original discoverers And furthermore the colonists who are now about to depart to the aforesaid planet are authorised and commanded to use every means to convert these infidel savages from the darkness of Christianity and make them thorough and absolute Lunatics In consequence of this benevolent Bull our philosophic benefactors go to work with hearty zeal They seize upon our fertile territories scourge us from our rightful possessions relieve us from our wives and when we are unreasonable enough to complain they will turn upon us and say Miserable barbarians ungrateful wretches have we not come thousands of miles to improve your worthless planet have we not fed you with moonshine have we not intoxicated you with nitrous oxide does not our moon give you light every night and have you the baseness to murmur when we claim a pitiful return for all these benefits But finding that we not only persist in absolute contempt of their reasoning and disbelief in their philosophy but even go so far as daringly to defend our property their patience shall be exhausted and they shall resort to their superior powers of argument hunt us with hippogriffs transfix us with concentrated sunbeams demolish our cities with moonstones until having by main force converted us to the true faith they shall graciously permit us to exist in the torrid deserts of Arabia or the frozen regions of Lapland there to enjoy the blessings of civilization and the charms of lunar philosophy in much the same manner as the reformed and enlightened savages of this country are kindly suffered to inhabit the inhospitable forests of the north or the impenetrable wilderness of South America Thus I hope I have clearly proved and strikingly illustrated the right of the early colonists to the possession of this country and thus is this gigantic question completely vanquished so having manfully surmounted all obstacles and subdued all opposition what remains but that I should forthwith conduct my readers into the city which we have been so long in a manner besieging But hold before I proceed another step I must pause to take breath and recover from the excessive fatigue I have undergone in preparing to begin this most accurate of histories And in this I do but imitate the example of a renowned Dutch tumbler of antiquity who took a start of three miles for the purpose of jumping over a hill but having run himself out of breath by the time he reached the foot sat himself quietly down for a few moments to blow and then walked over it at his leisure FOOTNOTES nineteen

CHAPTER I My great grandfather by the mother s side Hermanus Van Clattercop when employed to build the large stone church at Rotterdam which stands about three hundred yards to your left after you turn off from the Boomkeys and which is so conveniently constructed that all the zealous Christians of Rotterdam prefer sleeping through a sermon there to any other church in the city my great grandfather I say when employed to build that famous church did in the first place send to Delft for a box of long pipes then having purchased a new spitting box and a hundredweight of the best Virginia he sat himself down and did nothing for the space of three months but smoke most laboriously Then did he spend full three months more in trudging on foot and voyaging in the trekschuit from Rotterdam to Amsterdam to Delft to Haerlem to Leyden to the Hague knocking his head and breaking his pipe against every church in his road Then did he advance gradually nearer and nearer to Rotterdam until he came in full sight of the identical spot whereon the church was to be built Then did he spend three months longer in walking round it and round it contemplating it first from one point of view and then from another now he would be paddled by it on the canal now would he peep at it through a telescope from the other side of the Meuse and now would he take a bird s eye glance at it from the top of one of those gigantic windmills which protect the gates of the city The good folks of the place were on the tiptoe of expectation and impatience notwithstanding all the turmoil of my great grandfather not a symptom of the church was yet to be seen they even began to fear it would never be brought into the world but that its great projector would lie down and die in labor of the mighty plan he had conceived At length having occupied twelve good months in puffing and paddling and talking and walking having traveled over all Holland and even taken a peep into France and Germany having smoked five hundred and ninety nine pipes and three hundredweight of the best Virginia tobacco my great grandfather gathered together all that knowing and industrious class of citizens who prefer attending to anybody s business sooner than their own and having pulled off his coat and five pair of breeches he advanced sturdily up and laid the corner stone of the church in the presence of the whole multitude just at the commencement of the thirteenth month In a similar manner and with the example of my worthy ancestor full before my eyes have I proceeded in writing this most authentic history The honest Rotterdammers no doubt thought my great grandfather was doing nothing at all to the purpose while he was making such a world of prefatory bustle about the building of his church and many of the ingenious inhabitants of this fair city will unquestionably suppose that all the preliminary chapters with the discovery population and final settlement of America were totally irrelevant and superfluous and that the main business the history of New York is not a jot more advanced than if I had never taken up my pen Never were wise people more mistaken in their conjectures In consequence of going to work slowly and deliberately the church came out of my grandfather s hands one of the most sumptuous goodly and glorious edifices in the known world excepting that like our magnificent capitol at Washington it was begun on so grand a scale that the good folk could not afford to finish more than the wing of it So likewise I trust if ever I am able to finish this work on the plan I have commenced of which in simple truth I sometimes have my doubts it will be found that I have pursued the latest rules of my art as exemplified in the writings of all the great American historians and wrought a very large history out of a small subject which nowadays is considered one of the great triumphs of historic skill To proceed then with the thread of my story In the ever memorable year of our Lord sixteen oh nine on a Saturday morning the five and twentieth day of March old style did that worthy and irrecoverable discoverer as he has justly been called Master Henry Hudson set sail from Holland in a stout vessel called the Half Moon being employed by the Dutch East India Company to seek a north west passage to China Henry or as the Dutch historians call him Hendrick Hudson was a seafaring man of renown who had learned to smoke tobacco under Sir Walter Raleigh and is said to have been the first to introduce it into Holland which gained him much popularity in that country and caused him to find great favor in the eyes of their High Mightinesses the Lords States General and also of the Honorable West India Company He was a short square brawny old gentleman with a double chin a mastiff mouth and a broad copper nose which was supposed in those days to have acquired its fiery hue from the constant neighborhood of his tobacco pipe He wore a true Andrea Ferrara tucked in a leathern belt and a commodore s cocked hat on one side of his head He was remarkable for always jerking up his breeches when he gave out his orders and his voice sounded not unlike the brattling of a tin trumpet owing to the number of hard north westers which he had swallowed in the course of his seafaring Such was Hendrick Hudson of whom we have heard so much and know so little and I have been thus particular in his description for the benefit of modern painters and statuaries that they may represent him as he was and not according to their common custom with modern heroes make him look like a Caesar or Marcus Aurelius or the Apollo of Belvidere As chief mate and favorite companion the commodore chose Master Robert Juet of Limehouse in England By some his name has been spelt Chewit and ascribed to the circumstance of his having been the first man that ever chewed tobacco but this I believe to be a mere flippancy more especially as certain of his progeny are living at this day who write their names Juet He was an old comrade and early schoolmate of the great Hudson with whom he had often played truant and sailed chip boats in a neighboring pond when they were little boys from whence it is said the commodore first derived his bias towards a seafaring life Certain it is that the old people about Limehouse declared Robert Juet to be a unlucky urchin prone to mischief that would one day or other come to the gallows He grew up as boys of that kind often grow up a rambling heedless varlet tossed about in all quarters of the world meeting with more perils and wonders than did Sinbad the Sailor without growing a whit more wise prudent or ill natured Under every misfortune he comforted himself with a quid of tobacco and the truly philosophic maxim that it will be all the same thing a hundred years hence He was skilled in the art of carving anchors and true lovers knot on the bulk heads and quarter railings and was considered a great wit on board ship in consequence of his playing pranks on everybody around and now and then even making a wry face at old Hendrick when his back was turned To this universal genius are we indebted for many particulars concerning this voyage of which he wrote a history at the request of the commodore who had an unconquerable aversion to writing himself from having received so many floggings about it when at school To supply the deficiencies of Master Juet s journal which is written with true log book brevity I have availed myself of divers family traditions handed down from my great great grandfather who accompanied the expedition in the capacity of cabin boy From all that I can learn few incidents worthy of remark happened in the voyage and it mortifies me exceedingly that I have to admit so noted an expedition into my work without making any more of it Suffice it to say the voyage was prosperous and tranquil the crew being a patient people much given to slumber and vacuity and but little troubled with the disease of thinking a malady of the mind which is the sure breeder of discontent Hudson had laid in abundance of gin and sour krout and every man was allowed to sleep quietly at his post unless the wind blew True it is some slight dissatisfaction was shown on two or three occasions at certain unreasonable conduct of Commodore Hudson Thus for instance he forbore to shorten sail when the wind was light and the weather serene which was considered among the most experienced Dutch seamen as certain weather breeders or prognostics that the weather would change for the worse He acted moreover in direct contradiction to that ancient and sage rule of the Dutch navigators who always took in sail at night put the helm a port and turned in by which precaution they had a good night s rest were sure of knowing where they were the next morning and stood but little chance of running down a continent in the dark He likewise prohibited the seamen from wearing more than five jackets and six pair of breeches under pretence of rendering them more alert and no man was permitted to go aloft and hand in sails with a pipe in his mouth as is the invariable Dutch custom at the present day All these grievances though they might ruffle for a moment the constitutional tranquillity of the honest Dutch tars made but transient impression they ate hugely drank profusely and slept immeasurably and being under the especial guidance of Providence the ship was safely conducted to the coast of America where after sundry unimportant touchings and standings off and on she at length on the fourth day of September entered that majestic bay which at this day expands its ample bosom before the city of New York and which had never before been visited by any European twenty two It has been traditionary in our family that when the great navigator was first blessed with a view of this enchanting island he was observed for the first and only time in his life to exhibit strong symptoms of astonishment and admiration He is said to have turned to master Juet and uttered these remarkable words while he pointed towards this paradise of the new world See there and thereupon as was always his way when he was uncommonly pleased he did puff out such clouds of dense tobacco smoke that in one minute the vessel was out of sight of land and Master Juet was fain to wait until the winds dispersed this impenetrable fog It was indeed as my great grandfather used to say though in truth I never heard him for he died as might be expected before I was born it was indeed a spot on which the eye might have revelled for ever in ever new and never ending beauties The island of Manna hata spread wide before them like some sweet vision of fancy or some fair creation of industrious magic Its hills of smiling green swelled gently one above another crowned with lofty trees of luxuriant growth some pointing their tapering foliage towards the clouds which were gloriously transparent and others loaded with a verdant burden of clambering vines bowing their branches to the earth that was covered with flowers On the gentle declivities of the hills were scattered in gay profusion the dog wood the sumach and the wild brier whose scarlet berries and white blossoms glowed brightly among the deep green of the surrounding foliage and here and there a curling column of smoke rising from the little glens that opened along the shore seemed to promise the weary voyagers a welcome at the hands of their fellow creatures As they stood gazing with entranced attention on the scene before them a red man crowned with feathers issued from one of these glens and after contemplating in silent wonder the gallant ship as she sat like a stately swan swimming on a silver lake sounded the war whoop and bounded into the woods like a wild deer to the utter astonishment of the phlegmatic Dutchmen who had never heard such a noise or witnessed such a caper in their whole lives Of the transactions of our adventurers with the savages and how the latter smoked copper pipes and ate dried currants how they brought great store of tobacco and oysters how they shot one of the ship s crew and how he was buried I shall say nothing being that I consider them unimportant to my history After tarrying a few days in the bay in order to refresh themselves after their seafaring our voyagers weighed anchor to explore a mighty river which emptied into the bay This river it is said was known among the savages by the name of the Shatemuck though we are assured in an excellent little history published in sixteen seventy four by John Josselyn gent that it was called the Mohegan twenty three and Master Richard Bloome who wrote some time afterwards asserts the same so that I very much incline in favor of the opinion of these two honest gentlemen Be this as it may up this river did the adventurous Hendrick proceed little doubting but it would turn to be the much looked for passage to China The journal goes on to make mention of divers interviews between the crew and the natives in the voyage up the river but as they would be impertinent to my history I shall pass over them in silence except the following dry joke played off by the old commodore and his schoolfellow Robert Juet which does such vast credit to their experimental philosophy that I cannot refrain from inserting it Our master and his mate determined to try some of the chiefe men of the countrey whether they had any treacherie in them So they tooke them downe into the cabin and gave them so much wine and acqua vitae that they were all merrie and one of them had his wife with him which sate so modestly as any of our countrey women would do in a strange place In the end one of them was drunke which had been aboarde of our ship all the time that we had been there and that was strange to them for they could not tell how to take it twenty four Having satisfied himself by this ingenious experiment that the natives were an honest social race of jolly roysterers who had no objection to a drinking bout and were very merry in their cups the old commodore chuckled hugely to himself and thrusting a double quid of tobacco in his cheek directed Master Juet to have it carefully recorded for the satisfaction of all the natural philosophers of the University of Leyden which done he proceeded on his voyage with great self complacency After sailing however above a hundred miles up the river he found the watery world around him began to grow more shallow and confined the current more rapid and perfectly fresh phenomena not uncommon in the ascent of rivers but which puzzled the honest Dutchman prodigiously A consultation was therefore called and having deliberated full six hours they were brought to a determination by the ship s running aground whereupon they unanimously concluded that there was but little chance of getting to China in this direction A boat however was despatched to explore higher up the river which on its return confirmed the opinion upon this the ship was warped off and put about with great difficulty being like most of her sex exceedingly hard to govern and the adventurous Hudson according to the account of my great great grandfather returned down the river with a prodigious flea in his ear Being satisfied that there was little likelihood of getting to China unless like the blind man he returned from whence he set out and took a fresh start he forthwith recrossed the sea to Holland where he was received with great welcome by the Honorable East India Company who were very much rejoiced to see him come back safe with their ship and at a large and respectable meeting of the first merchants and burgomasters of Amsterdam it was unanimously determined that as a munificent reward for the eminent services he had performed and the important discovery he had made the great river Mohegan should be called after his name and it continues to be called Hudson River unto this very day FOOTNOTES twenty two True it is and I am not ignorant of the fact that in a certain apocryphal book of voyages compiled by one Hackluyt is to be found a letter written to Francis the First by one Giovanni or John Verazzani on which some writers are inclined to found a belief that this delightful bay had been visited nearly a century previous to the voyage of the enterprising Hudson Now this albeit it has met with the countenance of certain very judicious and learned men I hold in utter disbelief and that for various good and substantial reasons First because on strict examination it will be found that the description given by this Verazzani applies about as well to the bay of New York as it does to my nightcap Secondly because that this John Verazzani for whom I already begin to feel a most bitter enmity is a native of Florence and everybody knows the crafty wiles of these losel Florentines by which they filched away the laurels from the brows of the immortal Colon vulgarly called Columbus and bestowed them on their officious townsman Amerigo Vespucci and I make no doubt they are equally ready to rob the illustrious Hudson of the credit of discovering this beauteous island adorned by the city of New York and placing it beside their usurped discovery of South America And thirdly I award my decision in favor of the pretensions of Hendrick Hudson inasmuch as his expedition sailed from Holland being truly and absolutely a Dutch enterprise and though all the proofs in the world were introduced on the other side I would set them at nought as undeserving my attention If these three reasons be not sufficient to satisfy every burgher of this ancient city all I can say is they are degenerate descendants from their venerable Dutch ancestors and totally unworthy the trouble of convincing Thus therefore the title of Hendrick Hudson to his renowned discovery is fully vindicated twenty three This river is likewise laid down in Ogilvy s map as Manhattan Noordt Montaigne and Mauritius river twenty four Juet s Journ Purch Pil CHAPTER II The delectable accounts given by the great Hudson and Master Juet of the country they had discovered excited not a little talk and speculation among the good people of Holland Letters patent were granted by Government to an association of merchants called the West India Company for the exclusive trade on Hudson River on which they erected a trading house called Fort Aurania or Orange from whence did spring the great city of Albany But I forbear to dwell on the various commercial and colonizing enterprises which took place among which was that of Mynheer Adrian Block who discovered and gave a name to Block Island since famous for its cheese and shall barely confine myself to that which gave birth to this renowned city It was some three or four years after the return of the immortal Hendrick that a crew of honest Low Dutch colonists set sail from the city of Amsterdam for the shores of America It is an irreparable loss to history and a great proof of the darkness of the age and the lamentable neglect of the noble art of book making since so industriously cultivated by knowing sea captains and learned supercargoes that an expedition so interesting and important in its results should be passed over in utter silence To my great great grandfather am I again indebted for the few facts I am enabled to give concerning it he having once more embarked for this country with a full determination as he said of ending his days here and of begetting a race of Knickerbockers that should rise to be great men in the land The ship in which these illustrious adventurers set sail was called the Goede Vrouw or good woman in compliment to the wife of the president of the West India Company who was allowed by everybody except her husband to be a sweet tempered lady when not in liquor It was in truth a most gallant vessel of the most approved Dutch construction and made by the ablest ship carpenters of Amsterdam who it is well known always model their ships after the fair forms of their countrywomen Accordingly it had one hundred feet in the beam one hundred feet in the keel and one hundred feet from the bottom of the stern post to the taffrail Like the beauteous model who was declared to be the greatest belle in Amsterdam it was full in the bows with a pair of enormous catheads a copper bottom and withal a most prodigious poop The architect who was somewhat of a religious man far from decorating the ship with pagan idols such as Jupiter Neptune or Hercules which heathenish abominations I have no doubt occasion the misfortunes and shipwreck of many a noble vessel he I say on the contrary did laudably erect for a head a goodly image of saint Nicholas equipped with a low broad brimmed hat a huge pair of Flemish trunk hose and a pipe that reached to the end of the bow sprit Thus gallantly furnished the staunch ship floated sideways like a majestic goose out of the harbor of the great city of Amsterdam and all the bells that were not otherwise engaged rung a triple bobmajor on the joyful occasion My great great grandfather remarks that the voyage was uncommonly prosperous for being under the especial care of the ever revered saint Nicholas the Goede Vrouw seemed to be endowed with qualities unknown to common vessels Thus she made as much leeway as headway could get along very nearly as fast with the wind a head as when it was a poop and was particularly great in a calm in consequence of which singular advantage she made out to accomplish her voyage in a very few months and came to anchor at the mouth of the Hudson a little to the east of Gibbet Island Here lifting up their eyes they beheld on what is at present called the Jersey shore a small Indian village pleasantly embowered in a grove of spreading elms and the natives all collected on the beach gazing in stupid admiration at the Goede Vrouw A boat was immediately dispatched to enter into a treaty with them and approaching the shore hailed them through a trumpet in the most friendly terms but so horribly confounded were these poor savages at the tremendous and uncouth sound of the Low Dutch language that they one and all took to their heels and scampered over the Bergen Hills nor did they stop until they had buried themselves head and ears in the marshes on the other side where they all miserably perished to a man and their bones being collected and decently covered by the Tammany Society of that day formed that singular mound called Rattlesnake Hill which rises out of the center of the salt marshes a little to the east of the Newark Causeway Animated by this unlooked for victory our valiant heroes sprang ashore in triumph took possession of the soil as conquerors in the name of their High Mightinesses the Lords States General and marching fearlessly forward carried the village of Communipaw by storm not withstanding that it was vigorously defended by some half a score of old squaws and pappooses On looking about them they were so transported with the excellences of the place that they had very little doubt the blessed saint Nicholas had guided them thither as the very spot whereon to settle their colony The softness of the soil was wonderfully adapted to the driving of piles the swamps and marshes around them afforded ample opportunities for the constructing of dykes and dams the shallowness of the shore was peculiarly favorable to the building of docks in a word this spot abounded with all the requisites for the foundation of a great Dutch City On making a faithful report therefore to the crew of the Goede Vrouw they one and all determined that this was the destined end of their voyage Accordingly they descended from the Goede Vrouw men women and children in goodly groups as did the animals of yore from the ark and formed themselves into a thriving settlement which they called by the Indian name Communipaw As all the world is doubtless perfectly acquainted with Communipaw it may seem somewhat superfluous to treat of it in the present work but my readers will please to recollect that not withstanding it is my chief desire to satisfy the present age yet I write likewise for posterity and have to consult the understanding and curiosity of some half a score of centuries yet to come by which time perhaps were it not for this invaluable history the great Communipaw like Babylon Carthage Nineveh and other great cities might be perfectly extinct sunk and forgotten in its own mud its inhabitants turned into oysters twenty five and even its situation a fertile subject of learned controversy and hard headed investigation among indefatigable historians Let me then piously rescue from oblivion the humble relics of a place which was the egg from whence was hatched the mighty city of New York Communipaw is at present but a small village pleasantly situated among rural scenery on that beauteous part of the Jersey shore which was known in ancient legends by the name of Pavonia twenty six and commands a grand prospect of the superb bay of New York It is within but half an hour s sail of the latter place provided you have a fair wind and may be distinctly seen from the city Nay it is a well known fact which I can testify from my own experience that on a clear still summer evening you may hear from the battery of New York the obstreperous peals of broad mouthed laughter of the Dutch negroes at Communipaw who like most other negroes are famous for their risible powers This is peculiarly the case on Sunday evenings when it is remarked by an ingenious and observant philosopher who has made great discoveries in the neighborhood of this city that they always laugh loudest which he attributes to the circumstance of their having their holiday clothes on These negroes in fact like the monks in the dark ages engross all the knowledge of the place and being infinitely more adventurous and more knowing than their masters carry on all the foreign trade making frequent voyages to town in canoes loaded with oysters buttermilk and cabbages They are great astrologers predicting the different changes of weather almost as accurately as an almanac they are moreover exquisite performers on three stringed fiddles in whistling they almost boast the far famed powers of Orpheus lyre for not a horse nor an ox in the place when at the plough or before the wagon will budge a foot until he hears the well known whistle of his black driver and companion And from their amazing skill at casting up accounts upon their fingers they are regarded with as much veneration as were the disciples of Pythagoras of yore when initiated into the sacred quaternary of numbers As to the honest burghers of Communipaw like wise men and sound philosophers they never look beyond their pipes nor trouble their heads about any affairs out of their immediate neighborhood so that they live in profound and enviable ignorance of all the troubles anxieties and revolutions of this distracted planet I am even told that many among them do verily believe that Holland of which they have heard so much from tradition is situated somewhere on Long Island that Spiking devil and the Narrows are the two ends of the world that the country is still under the dominion of their High Mightinesses and that the city of New York still goes by the name of Nieuw Amsterdam They meet every Saturday afternoon at the only tavern in the place which bears as a sign a square headed likeness of the Prince of Orange where they smoke a silent pipe by way of promoting social conviviality and invariably drink a mug of cider to the success of Admiral Van Tromp whom they imagine is still sweeping the British Channel with a broom at his masthead Communipaw in short is one of the numerous little villages in the vicinity of this most beautiful of cities which are so many strongholds and fastnesses whither the primitive manners of our Dutch forefathers have retreated and where they are cherished with devout and scrupulous strictness The dress of the original settlers is handed down inviolate from father to son the identical broad brimmed hat broad skirted coat and broad bottomed breeches continue from generation to generation and several gigantic knee buckles of massy silver are still in wear that made gallant display in the days of the patriarchs of Communipaw The language likewise continues unadulterated by barbarous innovations and so critically correct is the village schoolmaster in his dialect that his reading of a Low Dutch psalm has much the same effect on the nerves as the filing of a hand saw FOOTNOTES twenty five Men by inaction degenerate into oysters Kaimes twenty six Pavonia in the ancient maps is given to a tract of country extending from about Hoboken to Amboy CHAPTER III Having in the trifling digression which concluded the last chapter discharged the filial duty which the city of New York owed to Communipaw as being the mother settlement and having given a faithful picture of it as it stands at present I return with a soothing sentiment of self approbation to dwell upon its early history The crew of the Goede Vrouw being soon reinforced by fresh importations from Holland the settlement went jollily on increasing in magnitude and prosperity The neighboring Indians in a short time became accustomed to the uncouth sound of the Dutch language and an intercourse gradually took place between them and the new comers The Indians were much given to long talks and the Dutch to long silence in this particular therefore they accommodated each other completely The chiefs would make long speeches about the big bull the wabash and the Great Spirit to which the others would listen very attentively smoke their pipes and grunt yah myn her whereat the poor savages were wondrously delighted They instructed the new settlers in the best art of curing and smoking tobacco while the latter in return made them drunk with true Hollands and then taught them the art of making bargains A brisk trade for furs was soon opened The Dutch traders were scrupulously honest in their dealings and purchased by weight establishing it as an invariable table of avoirdupois that the hand of a Dutchman weighed one pound and his foot two pounds It is true the simple Indians were often puzzled by the great disproportion between bulk and weight for let them place a bundle of furs never so large in one scale and a Dutchman put his hand or foot in the other the bundle was sure to kick the beam never was a package of furs known to weigh more than two pounds in the market of Communipaw This is a singular fact but I have it direct from my great great grandfather who had risen to considerable importance in the colony being promoted to the office of weigh master on account of the uncommon heaviness of his foot The Dutch possessions in this part of the globe began now to assume a very thriving appearance and were comprehended under the general title of Nieuw Nederlandts on account as the sage Vander Donck observes of their great resemblance to the Dutch Netherlands which indeed was truly remarkable excepting that the former was rugged and mountainous and the latter level and marshy About this time the tranquillity of the Dutch colonists was doomed to suffer a temporary interruption In sixteen fourteen Captain Sir Samuel Argal sailing under a commission from Dale Governor of Virginia visited the Dutch settlements on Hudson River and demanded their submission to the English crown and Virginian dominion To this arrogant demand as they were in no condition to resist it they submitted for the time like discreet and reasonable men It does not appear that the valiant Argal molested the settlement of Communipaw on the contrary I am told that when his vessel first hove in sight the worthy burghers were seized with such a panic that they fell to smoking their pipes with astonishing vehemence insomuch that they quickly raised a cloud which combining with the surrounding woods and marshes completely enveloped and concealed their beloved village and overhung the fair regions of Pavonia so that the terrible Captain Argal passed on totally unsuspicious that a sturdy little Dutch settlement lay snugly couched in the mud under cover of all this pestilent vapor In commemoration of this fortunate escape the worthy inhabitants have continued to smoke almost without intermission unto this very day which is said to be the cause of the remarkable fog which often hangs over Communipaw of a clear afternoon Upon the departure of the enemy our magnanimous ancestors took full six months to recover their wind having been exceedingly discomposed by the consternation and hurry of affairs They then called a council of safety to smoke over the state of the provinces At this council presided one Oloffe Van Kortlandt who had originally been one of a set of peripatetic philosophers who passed much of their time sunning themselves on the side of the great canal of Amsterdam in Holland enjoying like Diogenes a free and unencumbered estate in sunshine His name Kortlandt Shortland or Lackland was supposed like that of the illustrious Jean Sansterre to indicate that he had no land but he insisted on the contrary that he had great landed estates somewhere in Terra Incognita and he had come out to the new world to look after them Like all land speculators he was much given to dreaming Never did anything extraordinary happen at Communipaw but he declared that he had previously dreamt it being one of those infallible prophets who predict events after they have come to pass This supernatural gift was as highly valued among the burghers of Pavonia as among the enlightened nations of antiquity The wise Ulysses was more indebted to his sleeping than his waking moments for his most subtle achievements and seldom undertook any great exploit without first soundly sleeping upon it and the same may be said of Oloffe Van Kortlandt who was thence aptly denominated Oloffe the Dreamer As yet his dreams and speculations had turned to little personal profit and he was as much a lackland as ever Still he carried a high head in the community if his sugar loaf hat was rather the worse for wear he set it oft with a taller cock s tail if his shirt was none of the cleanest he puffed it out the more at the bosom and if the tail of it peeped out of a hole in his breeches it at least proved that it really had a tail and was not a mere ruffle The worthy Van Kortlandt in the council in question urged the policy of emerging from the swamps of Communipaw and seeking some more eligible site for the seat of empire Such he said was the advice of the good saint Nicholas who had appeared to him in a dream the night before and whom he had known by his broad hat his long pipe and the resemblance which he bore to the figure on the bow of the Goede Vrouw Many have thought this dream was a mere invention of Oloffe Van Kortlandt who it is said had ever regarded Communipaw with an evil eye because he had arrived there after all the land had been shared out and who was anxious to change the seat of empire to some new place where he might be present at the distribution of town lots But we must not give heed to such insinuations which are too apt to be advanced against those worthy gentlemen engaged in laying out towns and in other land speculations This perilous enterprise was to be conducted by Oloffe himself who chose as lieutenants or coadjutors Mynheers Abraham Harden Broeck Jacobus Van Zandt and Winant Ten Broeck three indubitably great men but of whose history although I have made diligent inquiry I can learn but little previous to their leaving Holland Nor need this occasion much surprise for adventurers like prophets though they make great noise abroad have seldom much celebrity in their own countries but this much is certain that the overflowings and offscourings of a country are invariably composed of the richest parts of the soil And here I cannot help remarking how convenient it would be to many of our great men and great families of doubtful origin could they have the privilege of the heroes of yore who whenever their origin was involved in obscurity modestly announced themselves descended from a god and who never visited a foreign country but what they told some cock and bull stories about their being kings and princes at home This venal trespass on the truth though it has been occasionally played off by some pseudo marquis baronet and other illustrious foreigner in our land of good natured credulity has been completely discountenanced in this sceptical matter of fact age and I even question whether any tender virgin who was accidentally and unaccountably enriched with a bantling would save her character at parlor firesides and evening tea parties by ascribing the phenomenon to a swan a shower of gold or a river god Had I the benefit of mythology and classic fable above alluded to I should have furnished the first of the trio with a pedigree equal to that of the proudest hero of antiquity His name Van Zandt that is to say from the dirt gave reasons to suppose that like Triptolemus Themis the Cyclops and the Titans he had sprung from Dame Terra or the Earth This supposition is strongly corroborated by his size for it is well known that all the progeny of Mother Earth were of a gigantic stature and Van Zandt we are told was a tall raw boned man above six feet high with an astonishingly hard head Nor is this origin of the illustrious Van Zandt a whit more improbable or repugnant to belief than what is related and universally admitted of certain of our greatest or rather richest men who we are told with the utmost gravity did originally spring from a dunghill Of the second of the trio but faint accounts have reached to this time which mention that he was a sturdy obstinate worrying bustling little man and from being usually equipped in an old pair of buckskins was familiarly dubbed Harden Broeck or Tough Breeches Ten Broeck completed this junto of adventurers It is a singular but ludicrous fact which were I not scrupulous in recording the whole truth I should almost be tempted to pass over in silence as incompatible with the gravity and dignity of history that this worthy gentleman should likewise have been nicknamed from what in modern times is considered the most ignoble part of the dress But in truth the small clothes seems to have been a very dignified garment in the eyes of our venerated ancestors in all probability from its covering that part of the body which has been pronounced the seat of honor The name of Ten Broeck or as it was sometimes spelt Tin Broeck has been indifferently translated into Ten Breeches and Tin Breeches The most elegant and ingenious writers on the subject declare in favor of Tin or rather Thin Breeches whence they infer that the original bearer of it was a poor but merry rogue whose galligaskins were none of the soundest and who peradventure may have been the author of that truly philosophical stanza Then why should we quarrel for riches Or any such glittering toys A light heart and thin pair of breeches Will go through the world my brave boys The High Dutch commentators however declare in favor of the other reading and affirm that the worthy in question was a burly bulbous man who in sheer ostentation of his venerable progenitors was the first to introduce into the settlement the ancient Dutch fashion of ten pair of breeches Such was the trio of coadjutors chosen by Oloffe the Dreamer to accompany him in this voyage into unknown realms as to the names of his crews they have not been handed down by history Having as I before observed passed much of his life in the open air among the peripatetic philosophers of Amsterdam Oloffe had become familiar with the aspect of the heavens and could as accurately determine when a storm was brewing or a squall rising as a dutiful husband can foresee from the brow of his spouse when a tempest is gathering about his ears Having pitched upon a time for his voyage when the skies appeared propitious he exhorted all his crews to take a good night s rest wind up their family affairs and make their wills precautions taken by our forefathers even in after times when they became more adventurous and voyaged to Haverstraw or Kaatskill or Groodt Esopus or any other far country beyond the great waters of the Tappen Zee CHAPTER IV And now the rosy blush of morn began to mantle in the east and soon the rising sun emerging from amidst golden and purple clouds shed his blithesome rays on the tin weathercocks of Communipaw It was that delicious season of the year when Nature breaking from the chilling thraldom of old winter like a blooming damsel from the tyranny of a sordid old father threw herself blushing with ten thousand charms into the arms of youthful Spring Every tufted copse and blooming grove resounded with the notes of hymeneal love The very insects as they sipped the dew that gemmed the tender grass of the meadows joined in the joyous epithalamium the virgin bud timidly put forth its blushes the voice of the turtle was heard in the land and the heart of man dissolved away in tenderness Oh sweet Theocritus had I thine oaten reed wherewith thou erst did charm the gay Sicilian plains or oh gentle Bion thy pastoral pipe wherein the happy swains of the Lesbian isle so much delighted then might I attempt to sing in soft Bucolic or negligent Idyllium the rural beauties of the scene but having nothing save this jaded goose quill wherewith to wing my flight I must fain resign all poetic disportings of the fancy and pursue my narrative in humble prose comforting myself with the hope that though it may not steal so sweetly upon the imagination of my reader yet it may commend itself with virgin modesty to his better judgment clothed in the chaste and simple garb of truth No sooner did the first rays of cheerful Phoebus dart into the windows of Communipaw than the little settlement was all in motion Forth issued from his castle the sage Van Kortlandt and seizing a conch shell blew a far resounding blast that soon summoned all his lusty followers Then did they trudge resolutely down to the water side escorted by a multitude of relatives and friends who all went down as the common phrase expresses it to see them off And this shows the antiquity of those long family processions often seen in our city composed of all ages sizes and sexes laden with bundles and bandboxes escorting some bevy of country cousins about to depart for home in a market boat The good Oloffe bestowed his forces in a squadron of three canoes and hoisted his flag on board a little round Dutch boat shaped not unlike a tub which had formerly been the jolly boat of the Goede Vrouw And now all being embarked they bade farewell to the gazing throng upon the beach who continued shouting after them even when out of hearing wishing them a happy voyage advising them to take good care of themselves not to get drowned with an abundance of other of those sage and invaluable cautions generally given by landsmen to such as go down to the sea in ships and adventure upon the deep waters In the meanwhile the voyagers cheerily urged their course across the crystal bosom of the bay and soon left behind them the green shores of ancient Pavonia And first they touched at two small islands which lie nearly opposite Communipaw and which are said to have been brought into existence about the time of the great irruption of the Hudson when it broke through the Highlands and made its way to the ocean twenty seven For in this tremendous uproar of the waters we are told that many huge fragments of rock and land were rent from the mountains and swept down by this runaway river for sixty or seventy miles where some of them ran aground on the shoals just opposite Communipaw and formed the identical islands in question while others drifted out to sea and were never heard of more A sufficient proof of the fact is that the rock which forms the bases of these islands is exactly similar to that of the Highlands and moreover one of our philosophers who has diligently compared the agreement of their respective surfaces has even gone so far as to assure me in confidence that Gibbet Island was originally nothing more nor less than a wart on Anthony s nose twenty eight Leaving these wonderful little isles they next coasted by Governor s Island since terrible from its frowning fortress and grinning batteries They would by no means however land upon this island since they doubted much it might be the abode of demons and spirits which in those days did greatly abound throughout this savage and pagan country Just at this time a shoal of jolly porpoises came rolling and tumbling by turning up their sleek sides to the sun and spouting up the briny element in sparkling showers No sooner did the sage Oloffe mark this than he was greatly rejoiced This exclaimed he if I mistake not augurs well the porpoise is a fat well conditioned fish a burgomaster among fishes his looks betoken ease plenty and prosperity I greatly admire this round fat fish and doubt not but this is a happy omen of the success of our undertaking So saying he directed his squadron to steer in the track of these alderman fishes Turning therefore directly to the left they swept up the strait vulgarly called the East River And here the rapid tide which courses through this strait seizing on the gallant tub in which Commodore Van Kortlandt had embarked hurried it forward with a velocity unparalleled in a Dutch boat navigated by Dutchmen insomuch that the good commodore who had all his life long been accustomed only to the drowsy navigation of canals was more than ever convinced that they were in the hands of some supernatural power and that the jolly porpoises were towing them to some fair haven that was to fulfill all their wishes and expectations Thus borne away by the resistless current they doubled that boisterous point of land since called Corlear s Hook twenty nine and leaving to the right the rich winding cove of the Wallabout they drifted into a magnificent expanse of water surrounded by pleasant shores whose verdure was exceedingly refreshing to the eye While the voyagers were looking around them on what they conceived to be a serene and sunny lake they beheld at a distance a crew of painted savages busily employed in fishing who seemed more like the genii of this romantic region their slender canoe lightly balanced like a feather on the undulating surface of the bay At sight of these the hearts of the heroes of Communipaw were not a little troubled But as good fortune would have it at the bow of the commodore s boat was stationed a valiant man named Hendrick Kip which being interpreted means chicken a name given him in token of his courage No sooner did he behold these varlet heathens than he trembled with excessive valor and although a good half mile distant he seized a musketoon that lay at hand and turning away his head fired it most intrepidly in the face of the blessed sun The blundering weapon recoiled and gave the valiant Kip an ignominious kick which laid him prostrate with uplifted heels in the bottom of the boat But such was the effect of this tremendous fire that the wild men of the woods struck with consternation seized hastily upon their paddles and shot away into one of the deep inlets of the Long Island shore This signal victory gave new spirits to the voyagers and in honor of the achievement they gave the name of the valiant Kip to the surrounding bay and it has continued to be called Kip s Bay from that time to the present The heart of the good Van Kortlandt who having no land of his own was a great admirer of other people s expanded to the full size of a peppercorn at the sumptuous prospect of rich unsettled country around him and falling into a delicious reverie he straightway began to riot in the possession of vast meadows of salt marsh and interminable patches of cabbages From this delectable vision he was all at once awakened by the sudden turning of the tide which would soon have hurried him from this land of promise had not the discreet navigator given signal to steer for shore where they accordingly landed hard by the rocky heights of Bellevue that happy retreat where our jolly aldermen eat for the good of the city and fatten the turtle that are sacrificed on civic solemnities Here seated on the greensward by the side of a small stream that ran sparkling among the grass they refreshed themselves after the toils of the seas by feasting lustily on the ample stores which they had provided for this perilous voyage Thus having well fortified their deliberate powers they fell into an earnest consultation what was further to be done This was the first council dinner ever eaten at Bellevue by Christian burghers and here as tradition relates did originate the great family feud between the Hardenbroecks and the Tenbroecks which afterwards had a singular influence on the building of the city The sturdy Harden Broeck whose eyes had been wondrously delighted with the salt marshes which spread their reeking bosoms along the coast at the bottom of Kip s Bay counseled by all means to return thither and found the intended city This was strenuously opposed by the unbending Ten Broeck and many testy arguments passed between them The particulars of this controversy have not reached us which is ever to be lamented this much is certain that the sage Oloffe put an end to the dispute by determining to explore still farther in the route which the mysterious porpoises had so clearly pointed out whereupon the sturdy Tough Breeches abandoned the expedition took possession of a neighboring hill and in a fit of great wrath peopled all that tract of country which has continued to be inhabited by the Hardenbroecks unto this very day By this time the jolly Phoebus like some wanton urchin sporting on the side of a green hill began to roll down the declivity of the heavens and now the tide having once more turned in their favor the Pavonians again committed themselves to its discretion and coasting along the western shores were borne towards the straits of Blackwell s Island And here the capricious wanderings of the current occasioned not a little marvel and perplexity to these illustrious mariners Now would they be caught by the wanton eddies and sweeping round a jutting point would wind deep into some romantic little cove that indented the fair island of Manna hata now were they hurried narrowly by the very bases of impending rocks mantled with the flaunting grape vine and crowned with groves which threw a broad shade on the waves beneath and anon they were borne away into the mid channel and wafted along with a rapidity that very much discomposed the sage Van Kortlandt who as he saw the land swiftly receding on either side began exceedingly to doubt that terra firma was giving them the slip Wherever the voyagers turned their eyes a new creation seemed to bloom around No signs of human thrift appeared to check the delicious wildness of Nature who here reveled in all her luxuriant variety Those hills now bristled like the fretful porcupine with rows of poplars vain upstart plants minions of wealth and fashion were then adorned with the vigorous natives of the soil the lordly oak the generous chestnut the graceful elm while here and there the tulip tree reared its majestic head the giant of the forest Where now are seen the gay retreats of luxury villas half buried in twilight bowers whence the amorous flute oft breathes the sighings of some city swain there the fish hawk built his solitary nest on some dry tree that overlooked his watery domain The timid deer fed undisturbed along those shores now hallowed by the lover s moonlight walk and printed by the slender foot of beauty and a savage solitude extended over those happy regions where now are reared the stately towers of the Joneses the Schermerhornes and the Rhinelanders Thus gliding in silent wonder through these new and unknown scenes the gallant squadron of Pavonia swept by the foot of a promontory which strutted forth boldly into the waves and seemed to frown upon them as they brawled against its base This is the bluff well known to modern mariners by the name of Gracie s Point from the fair castle which like an elephant it carries upon its back And here broke upon their view a wild and varied prospect where land and water were beauteously intermingled as though they had combined to heighten and set off each other s charms To their right lay the sedgy point of Blackwell s Island dressed in the fresh garniture of living green beyond it stretched the pleasant coast of Sundswick and the small harbor well known by the name of Hallet s Cove a place infamous in latter days by reason of its being the haunt of pirates who infest these seas robbing orchards and water melon patches and insulting gentlemen navigators when voyaging in their pleasure boats To the left a deep bay or rather creek gracefully receded between shores fringed with forests and forming a kind of vista through which were beheld the sylvan regions of Haerlem Morrissania and East Chester Here the eye reposed with delight on a richly weeded country diversified by tufted knolls shadowy intervals and waving lines of upland swelling above each other while over the whole the purple mists of spring diffused a hue of soft voluptuousness Just before them the grand course of the stream making a sudden bend wound among embowered promontories and shores of emerald verdure that seemed to melt into the wave A character of gentleness and mild fertility prevailed around The sun had just descended and the thin haze of twilight like a transparent veil drawn over the bosom of virgin beauty heightened the charms which it half concealed Ah witching scenes of foul delusion Ah hapless voyagers gazing with simple wonder on these Circean shores Such alas are they poor easy souls who listen to the seductions of a wicked world treacherous are its smiles fatal its caresses He who yields to its enticements launches upon a whelming tide and trusts his feeble bark among the dimpling eddies of a whirlpool And thus it fared with the worthies of Pavonia who little mistrusting the guileful sense before them drifted quietly on until they were aroused by an uncommon tossing and agitation of their vessels For now the late dimpling current began to brawl around them and the waves to boil and foam with horrible fury Awakened as if from a dream the astonished Oloffe bawled aloud to put about but his words were lost amid the roaring of the waters And now ensued a scene of direful consternation At one time they were borne with dreadful velocity among tumultuous breakers at another hurried down boisterous rapids Now they were nearly dashed upon the Hen and Chickens infamous rocks more voracious than Scylla and her whelps and anon they seemed sinking into yawning gulfs that threatened to entomb them beneath the waves All the elements combined to produce a hideous confusion The waters raged the winds howled and as they were hurried along several of the astonished mariners beheld the rocks and trees of the neighboring shores driving through the air At length the mighty tub of Commodore Van Kortlandt was drawn into the vortex of that tremendous whirlpool called the Pot where it was whirled about in giddy mazes until the senses of the good commander and his crew were overpowered by the horror of the scene and the strangeness of the revolution How the gallant squadron of Pavonia was snatched from the jaws of this modern Charybdis has never been truly made known for so many survived to tell the tale and what is still more wonderful told it in so many different ways that there has ever prevailed a great variety of opinions on the subject As to the commodore and his crew when they came to their senses they found themselves stranded on the Long Island shore The worthy commodore indeed used to relate many and wonderful stories of his adventures in this time of peril how that he saw specters flying in the air and heard the yelling of hobgoblins and put his hand into the pot when they were whirled round and found the water scalding hot and beheld several uncouth looking beings seated on rocks and skimming it with huge ladles but particularly he declared with great exultation that he saw the losel porpoises which had betrayed them into this peril some broiling on the Gridiron and others hissing on the Frying pan These however were considered by many as mere phantasies of the commodore while he lay in a trance especially as he was known to be given to dreaming and the truth of them has never been clearly ascertained It is certain however that to the accounts of Oloffe and his followers may be traced the various traditions handed down of this marvelous strait as how the devil has been seen there sitting astride of the Hog s Back and playing on the fiddle how he broils fish there before a storm and many other stories in which we must be cautious of putting too much faith In consequence of all these terrific circumstances the Pavonian commander gave this pass the name of Helle gat or as it has been interpreted Hell gate thirty which it continues to bear at the present day FOOTNOTES twenty seven It is a matter long since established by certain of our philosophers that is to say having been often advanced and never contradicted it has grown to be pretty nigh equal to a settled fact that the Hudson was originally a lake dammed up by the mountains of the Highlands In process of time however becoming very mighty and obstreperous and the mountains waxing pursy dropsical and weak in the back by reason of their extreme old age it suddenly rose upon them and after a violent struggle effected its escape This is said to have come to pass in very remote time probably before that rivers had lost the art of running up hill The foregoing is a theory in which I do not pretend to be skilled not withstanding that I do fully give it my belief twenty eight A promontory in the Highlands twenty nine Properly spelt Hoeck i e a point of land thirty This is a narrow strait in the Sound at the distance of six miles above New York It is dangerous to shipping unless under the care of skillful pilots by reason of numerous rocks shelves and whirlpools These have received sundry appellations such as the Gridiron Frying pan Hog s Back Pot et cetera and are very violent and turbulent at certain times of tide Certain mealy mouthed men of squeamish consciences who are loth to give the devil his due have softened the above characteristic name into Hell gate forsooth Let those take care how they venture into the Gate or they may be hurled into the Pot before they are aware of it The name of this strait as given by our author is supported by the map of Vander Donck s history published in sixteen fifty six by Ogilvie s History of America sixteen seventy one as also by a journal still extant written in the sixteenth century and to be found in Hazard s State Papers And an old MS written in French speaking of various alterations in names about this city observes De Hellegat trou d Enfer ils ont fait Hell gate porte d Enfer CHAPTER V The darkness of night had closed upon this disastrous day and a doleful night was it to the shipwrecked Pavonians whose ears were incessantly assailed with the raging of the elements and the howling of the hobgoblins that infested this perfidious strait But when the morning dawned the horrors of the preceding evening had passed away rapids breakers and whirlpools had disappeared the stream again ran smooth and dimpling and having changed its tide rolled gently back towards the quarter where lay their much regretted home The woebegone heroes of Communipaw eyed each other with rueful countenances their squadrons had been totally dispersed by the late disaster Some were cast upon the western shore where headed by one Ruleff Hopper they took possession of all the country lying about the six mile stone which is held by the Hoppers at this present writing The Waldrons were driven by stress of weather to a distant coast where having with them a jug of genuine Hollands they were enabled to conciliate the savages setting up a kind of tavern whence it is said did spring the fair town of Haerlem in which their descendants have ever since continued to be reputable publicans As to the Suydams they were thrown upon the Long Island coast and may still be found in those parts But the most singular luck attended the great Ten Broeck who falling overboard was miraculously preserved from sinking by the multitude of his nether garments Thus buoyed up he floated on the waves like a merman or like an angler s dobber until he landed safely on a rock where he was found the next morning busily drying his many breeches in the sunshine I forbear to treat of the long consultation of Oloffe with his remaining followers in which they determined that it would never do to found a city in so diabolical a neighborhood Suffice it in simple brevity to say that they once more committed themselves with fear and trembling to the briny element and steered their course back again through the scenes of their yesterday s voyage determined no longer to roam in search of distant sites but to settle themselves down in the marshy regions of Pavonia Scarce however had they gained a distant view of Communipaw when they were encountered by an obstinate eddy which opposed their homeward voyage Weary and dispirited as they were they yet tugged a feeble oar against the stream until as if to settle the strife half a score of potent billows rolled the tub of Commodore Van Kortlandt high and dry on the long point of an island which divided the bosom of the bay Some pretend that these billows were sent by old Neptune to strand the expedition on a spot whereon was to be founded his stronghold in this western world others more pious attribute everything to the guardianship of the good saint Nicholas and after events will be found to corroborate this opinion Oloffe Van Kortlandt was a devout trencherman Every repast was a kind of religious rite with him and his first thought on finding him once more on dry ground was how he should contrive to celebrate his wonderful escape from Hell gate and all its horrors by a solemn banquet The stores which had been provided for the voyage by the good housewives of Communipaw were nearly exhausted but in casting his eyes about the commodore beheld that the shore abounded with oysters A great store of these was instantly collected a fire was made at the foot of a tree all hands fell to roasting and broiling and stewing and frying and a sumptuous repast was soon set forth This is thought to be the origin of those civic feasts with which to the present day all our public affairs are celebrated and in which the oyster is ever sure to play an important part On the present occasion the worthy Van Kortlandt was observed to be particularly zealous in his devotions to the trencher for having the cares of the expedition especially committed to his care he deemed it incumbent on him to eat profoundly for the public good In proportion as he filled himself to the very brim with the dainty viands before him did the heart of this excellent burgher rise up towards his throat until he seemed crammed and almost choked with good eating and good nature And at such times it is when a man s heart is in his throat that he may more truly be said to speak from it and his speeches abound with kindness and good fellowship Thus having swallowed the last possible morsel and washed it down with a fervent potation Oloffe felt his heart yearning and his whole frame in a manner dilating with unbounded benevolence Everything around him seemed excellent and delightful and laying his hands on each side of his capacious periphery and rolling his half closed eyes around on the beautiful diversity of land and water before him he exclaimed in a fat half smothered voice What a charming prospect The words died away in his throat he seemed to ponder on the fair scene for a moment his eyelids heavily closed over their orbs his head drooped upon his bosom he slowly sank upon the green turf and a deep sleep stole gradually over him And the sage Oloffe dreamed a dream and lo the good saint Nicholas came riding over the tops of the trees in that self same wagon wherein he brings his yearly presents to children And he descended hard by where the heroes of Communipaw had made their late repast And he lit his pipe by the fire and sat himself down and smoked and as he smoked the smoke from his pipe ascended into the air and spread like a cloud overhead And Oloffe bethought him and he hastened and climbed up to the top of one of the tallest trees and saw that the smoke spread over a great extent of country and as he considered it more attentively he fancied that the great volume of smoke assumed a variety of marvelous forms where in dim obscurity he saw shadowed out palaces and domes and lofty spires all of which lasted but a moment and then faded away until the whole rolled off and nothing but the green woods were left And when saint Nicholas had smoked his pipe he twisted it in his hatband and laying his finger beside his nose gave the astonished Van Kortlandt a very significant look then mounting his wagon he returned over the treetops and disappeared And Van Kortlandt awoke from his sleep greatly instructed and he aroused his companions and related to them his dream and interpreted it that it was the will of saint Nicholas that they should settle down and build the city here and that the smoke of the pipe was a type how vast would be the extent of the city inasmuch as the volumes of its smoke would spread over a wide extent of country And they all with one voice assented to this interpretation excepting Mynheer Ten Broeck who declared the meaning to be that it would be a city wherein a little fire would occasion a great smoke or in other words a very vaporing little city both which interpretations have strangely come to pass The great object of their perilous expedition therefore being thus happily accomplished the voyagers returned merrily to Communipaw where they were received with great rejoicings And here calling a general meeting of all the wise men and the dignitaries of Pavonia they related the whole history of their voyage and of the dream of Oloffe Van Kortlandt And the people lifted up their voices and blessed the good saint Nicholas and from that time forth the sage Van Kortlandt was held in more honor than ever for his great talent at dreaming and was pronounced a most useful citizen and a right good man when he was asleep CHAPTER VI The original name of the island whereon the squadron of Communipaw was thus propitiously thrown is a matter of some dispute and has already undergone considerable vitiation a melancholy proof of the instability of all sublunary things and the vanity of all our hopes of lasting fame for who can expect his name will live to posterity when even the names of mighty islands are thus soon lost in contradiction and uncertainty The name most current at the present day and which is likewise countenanced by the great historian Vander Donck is Manhattan which is said to have originated in a custom among the squaws in the early settlement of wearing men s hats as is still done among many tribes Hence as we are told by an old governor who was somewhat of a wag and flourished almost a century since and had paid a visit to the wits of Philadelphia hence arose the appellation of man hat on first given to the Indians and afterwards to the island a stupid joke but well enough for a governor Among the more venerable sources of information on this subject is that valuable history of the American possessions written by Master Richard Blome in sixteen eighty seven wherein it is called the Manhadaes and Manahanent nor must I forget the excellent little book full of precious matter of that authentic historian John Josselyn gent who expressly calls it Manadaes Another etymology still more ancient and sanctioned by the countenance of our ever to be lamented Dutch ancestors is that found in certain letters still extant thirty one which passed between the early governors and their neighboring powers wherein it is called indifferently Monhattoes Munhatos and Manhattoes which are evidently unimportant variations of the same name for our wise forefathers set little store by those niceties either in orthography or orthoepy which form the sole study and ambition of many learned men and women of this hypercritical age This last name is said to be derived from the great Indian spirit Manetho who was supposed to make this island his favorite abode on account of its uncommon delights For the Indian traditions affirm that the bay was once a translucid lake filled with silver and golden fish in the midst of which lay this beautiful island covered with every variety of fruits and flowers but that the sudden irruption of the Hudson laid waste these blissful scenes and Manetho took his flight beyond the great waters of Ontario These however are very fabulous legends to which very cautious credence must be given and though I am willing to admit the last quoted orthography of the name as very fit for prose yet is there another which I peculiarly delight in as at once poetical melodious and significant and which we have on the authority of Master Juet who in his account of the voyage of the great Hudson calls this Manna hata that is to say the island of manna or in other words a land flowing with milk and honey Still my deference to the learned obliges me to notice the opinion of the worthy Dominie Heckwelder which ascribes the name to a great drunken bout held on the island by the Dutch discoverers whereat they made certain of the natives most ecstatically drunk for the first time in their lives who being delighted with their jovial entertainment gave the place the name of Mannahattanink that is to say the Island of Jolly Topers a name which it continues to merit to the present day thirty two FOOTNOTES thirty one Vide Hazard s colonel Stat Pap thirty two MSS of the reverend John Heckwelder in the archives of the New York Historical Society CHAPTER VII It having been solemnly resolved that the seat of empire should be removed from the green shores of Pavonia to the pleasant island of Manna hata everybody was anxious to embark under the standard of Oloffe the Dreamer and to be among the first sharers of the promised land A day was appointed for the grand migration and on that day little Communipaw as in a buzz and a bustle like a hive in swarming time Houses were turned inside out and stripped of the venerable furniture which had come from Holland all the community great and small black and white man woman and child was in commotion forming lines from the houses to the water side like lines of ants from an ant hill everybody laden with some article of household furniture while busy housewifes plied backwards and forwards along the lines helping everything forward by the nimbleness of their tongues By degrees a fleet of boats and canoes were piled up with all kinds of household articles ponderous tables chests of drawers resplendent with brass ornaments quaint corner cupboards beds and bedsteads with any quantity of pots kettles frying pans and Dutch ovens In each boat embarked a whole family from the robustious burgher down to the cats and dogs and little negroes In this way they set off across the mouth of the Hudson under the guidance of Oloffe the Dreamer who hoisted his standard on the leading boat This memorable migration took place on the first of May and was long cited in tradition as the grand moving The anniversary of it was piously observed among the sons of the pilgrims of Communipaw by turning their houses topsy turvy and carrying all the furniture through the streets in emblem of the swarming of the parent hive and this is the real origin of the universal agitation and moving by which this most restless of cities is literally turned out of doors on every May day As the little squadron from Communipaw drew near to the shores of Manna hata a sachem at the head of a band of warriors appeared to oppose their landing Some of the most zealous of the pilgrims were for chastising this insolence with the powder and ball according to the approved mode of discoverers but the sage Oloffe gave them the significant sign of saint Nicholas laying his finger beside his nose and winking hard with one eye whereupon his followers perceived that there was something sagacious in the wind He now addressed the Indians in the blandest terms and made such tempting display of beads hawks s bells and red blankets that he was soon permitted to land and a great land speculation ensued And here let me give the true story of the original purchase of the site of this renowned city about which so much has been said and written Some affirm that the first cost was but sixty guilders The learned Dominie Heckwelder records a tradition thirty three that the Dutch discoverers bargained for only so much land as the hide of a bullock would cover but that they cut the hide in strips no thicker than a child s finger so as to take in a large portion of land and to take in the Indians into the bargain This however is an old fable which the worthy Dominie may have borrowed from antiquity The true version is that Oloffe Van Kortlandt bargained for just so much land as a man could cover with his nether garments The terms being concluded he produced his friend Mynheer Ten Broeck as the man whose breeches were to be used in measurement The simple savages whose ideas of a man s nether garments had never expanded beyond the dimensions of a breech clout stared with astonishment and dismay as they beheld this bulbous bottomed burgher peeled like an onion and breeches after breeches spread forth over the land until they covered the actual site of this venerable city This is the true history of the adroit bargain by which the Island of Manhattan was bought for sixty guilders and in corroboration of it I will add that Mynheer Ten Breeches for his services on this memorable occasion was elevated to the office of land measurer which he ever afterwards exercised in the colony FOOTNOTES thirty three MSS of the reverend John Heckwelder New York Historical Society CHAPTER VIII The land being thus fairly purchased of the Indians a circumstance very unusual in the history of colonization and strongly illustrative of the honesty of our Dutch progenitors a stockade fort and trading house were forthwith erected on an eminence in front of the place where the good saint Nicholas had appeared in a vision to Oloffe the Dreamer and which as has already been observed was the identical place at present known as the Bowling Green Around this fort a progeny of little Dutch built houses with tiled roofs and weathercocks soon sprang up nestling themselves under its walls for protection as a brood of half fledged chickens nestle under the wings of the mother hen The whole was surrounded by an enclosure of strong palisadoes to guard against any sudden irruption of the savages Outside of these extended the corn fields and cabbage gardens of the community with here and there an attempt at a tobacco plantation all covering those tracts of country at present called Broadway Wall Street William Street and Pearl Street I must not omit to mention that in portioning out the land a goodly bowerie or farm was allotted to the sage Oloffe in consideration of the service he had rendered to the public by his talent at dreaming and the site of his bowerie is known by the name of Kortlandt or Cortland Street to the present day And now the infant settlement having advanced in age and stature it was thought high time it should receive an honest Christian name Hitherto it had gone by the original Indian name of Manna hata or as some will have it The Manhattoes but this was now decried as savage and heathenish and as tending to keep up the memory of the pagan brood that originally possessed it Many were the consultations held upon the subject without coming to a conclusion for though everybody condemned the old name nobody could invent a new one At length when the council was almost in despair a burgher remarkable for the size and squareness of his head proposed that they should call it New Amsterdam The proposition took everybody by surprise it was so striking so apposite so ingenious The name was adopted by acclamation and New Amsterdam the metropolis was thenceforth called Still however the early authors of the province continued to call it by the general appelation of The Manhattoes and the poets fondly clung to the euphonious name of Manna hata but those are a kind of folk whose tastes and notions should go for nothing in matters of this kind Having thus provided the embryo city with a name the next was to give it an armorial bearing or device as some cities have a rampant lion others a soaring eagle emblematical no doubt of the valiant and high flying qualities of the inhabitants so after mature deliberation a sleek beaver was emblazoned on the city standard as indicative of the amphibious origin and patient persevering habits of the New Amsterdamers The thriving state of the settlement and the rapid increase of houses soon made it necessary to arrange some plan upon which the city should be built but at the very first consultation on the subject a violent discussion arose and I mention it with much sorrowing as being the first altercation on record in the councils of New Amsterdam It was in fact a breaking forth of the grudge and heart burning that had existed between those two eminent burghers Mynheers Ten Broeck and Harden Broeck ever since their unhappy dispute on the coast of Bellevue The great Harden Broeck had waxed very wealthy and powerful from his domains which embraced the whole chain of Apulean mountains that stretched along the gulf of Kip s Bay and from part of which his descendants have been expelled in latter ages by the powerful clans of the Joneses and the Schermerhornes An ingenious plan for the city was offered by Mynheer Harden Broeck who proposed that it should be cut up and intersected by canals after the manner of the most admired cities in Holland To this Mynheer Ten Broeck was diametrically opposed suggesting in place thereof that they should run out docks and wharves by means of piles driven into the bottom of the river on which the town should be built By these means said he triumphantly shall we rescue a considerable space of territory from these immense rivers and build a city that shall rival Amsterdam Venice or any amphibious city in Europe To this proposition Harden Broeck or Tough Breeches replied with a look of as much scorn as he could possibly assume He cast the utmost censure upon the plan of his antagonist as being preposterous and against the very order of things as he would leave to every true Hollander For what said he is a town without canals it is like a body without veins and arteries and must perish for want of a free circulation of the vital fluid Ten Breeches on the contrary retorted with a sarcasm upon his antagonist who was somewhat of an arid dry boded habit he remarked that as to the circulation of the blood being necessary to existence Mynheer Tough Breeches was a living contradiction to his own assertion for everybody knew there had not a drop of blood circulated through his wind dried carcase for good ten years and yet there was not a greater busybody in the whole colony Personalities have seldom much effect in making converts in argument nor have I ever seen a man convinced of error by being convicted of deformity At least such was not the case at present If Ten Breeches was very happy in sarcasm Tough Breeches who was a sturdy little man and never gave up the last word rejoined with increasing spirit Ten Breeches had the advantage of the greatest volubility but Tough Breeches had that invaluable coat of mail in argument called obstinacy Ten Breeches had therefore the most mettle but Tough Breeches the best bottom so that though Ten Breeches made a dreadful clattering about his ears and battered and belabored him with hard words and sound arguments yet Tough Breeches hung on most resolutely to the last They parted therefore as is usual in all arguments where both parties are in the right without coming to any conclusion but they hated each other most heartily for ever after and a similar breach with that between the houses of Capulet and Montague did ensue between the families of Ten Breeches and Tough Breeches I would not fatigue my reader with these dull matters of fact but that my duty as a faithful historian requires that I should be particular and in truth as I am now treating of the critical period when our city like a young twig first received the twists and turns which have since contributed to give it its present picturesque irregularity I cannot be too minute in detailing their first causes After the unhappy altercation I have just mentioned I do not find that anything further was said on the subject worthy of being recorded The council consisting of the largest and oldest heads in the community met regularly once a week to ponder on this momentous subject but either they were deterred by the war of words they had witnessed or they were naturally averse to the exercise of the tongue and the consequent exercise of the brains certain it is the most profound silence was maintained the question as usual lay on the table the members quietly smoked their pipes making but few laws without ever enforcing any and in the meantime the affairs of the settlement went on as it pleased God As most of the council were but little skilled in the mystery of combining pot hooks and hangers they determined most judiciously not to puzzle either themselves or posterity with voluminous records The secretary however kept the minutes of the council with tolerable precision in a large vellum folio fastened with massy brass clasps the journal of each meeting consisted but of two lines stating in Dutch that the council sat this day and smoked twelve pipes on the affairs of the colony By which it appears that the first settlers did not regulate their time by hours but pipes in the same manner as they measure distances in Holland at this very time an admirably exact measurement as a pipe in the mouth of a true born Dutchman is never liable to those accidents and irregularities that are continually putting our clocks out of order In this manner did the profound council of New Amsterdam smoke and doze and ponder from week to week month to month and year to year in what manner they should construct their infant settlement meanwhile the town took care of itself and like a sturdy brat which is suffered to run about wild unshackled by clouts and bandages and other abominations by which your notable nurses and sage old women cripple and disfigure the children of men increased so rapidly in strength and magnitude that before the honest burgomasters had determined upon a plan it was too late to put it in execution whereupon they wisely abandoned the subject altogether

none	none	It is only this eternally sounding in his ears that it is his duty to go right which makes him go the very reverse The noble independence of his nature revolts at this intolerable tyranny of law and the perpetual interference of officious morality which are ever besetting his path with finger posts and directions to keep to the right as the law directs and like a spirited urchin he turns directly contrary and gallops through mud and mire over hedges and ditches merely to show that he is a lad of spirit and out of his leading strings And these opinions are amply substantiated by what I have above said of our worthy ancestors who never being be preached and be lectured and guided and governed by statutes and laws and by laws as are their more enlightened descendants did one and all demean themselves honestly and peaceably out of pure ignorance or in other words because they knew no better Nor must I omit to record one of the earliest measures of this infant settlement inasmuch as it shows the piety of our forefathers and that like good Christians they were always ready to serve God after they had first served themselves 
8011_291458_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Thus having quietly settled themselves down and provided for their own comfort they bethought themselves of testifying their gratitude to the great and good saint Nicholas for his protecting care in guiding them to this delectable abode 
8011_291458_000003_000002	train-clean-360	To this end they built a fair and goodly chapel within the fort which they consecrated to his name whereupon he immediately took the town of New Amsterdam under his peculiar patronage and he has even since been and I devoutly hope will ever be the tutelar saint of this excellent city 
8011_291458_000004_000000	train-clean-360	At this early period was instituted that pious ceremony still religiously observed in all our ancient families of the right breed of hanging up a stocking in the chimney on saint Nicholas Eve which stocking is always found in the morning miraculously filled for the good saint Nicholas has ever been a great giver of gifts particularly to children 
none	none	I am moreover told that there is a little legendary book somewhere extant written in Low Dutch which says that the image of this renowned saint which whilom graced the bow sprit of the Goede Vrouw was elevated in front of this chapel in the center of what in modern days is called the Bowling Green on the very spot in fact where he appeared in vision to Oloffe the Dreamer And the legend further treats of divers miracles wrought by the mighty pipe which the saint held in his mouth a whiff of which was a sovereign cure for an indigestion an invaluable relic in this colony of brave trenchermen 
8011_291458_000005_000002	train-clean-360	As however in spite of the most diligent search I cannot lay my hands upon this little book I must confess that I entertain considerable doubt on the subject 
8011_291458_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Thus benignly fostered by the good saint Nicholas the infant city thrived apace 
8011_291458_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Hordes of painted savages it is true still lurked about the unsettled parts of the island 
8011_291458_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The hunter still pitched his bower of skins and bark beside the rills that ran through the cool and shady glens while here and there might be seen on some sunny knoll a group of Indian wigwams whose smoke arose above the neighboring trees and floated in the transparent atmosphere 
8011_291458_000006_000003	train-clean-360	A mutual good will however existed between these wandering beings and the burghers of New Amsterdam 
none	none	Our benevolent forefathers endeavored as much as possible to ameliorate their situation by giving them gin rum and glass beads in exchange for their peltries for it seems the kind hearted Dutchmen had conceived a great friendship for their savage neighbors on account of their being pleasant men to trade with and little skilled in the art of making a bargain Now and then a crew of these half human sons of the forest would make their appearance in the streets of New Amsterdam fantastically painted and decorated with beads and flaunting feathers sauntering about with an air of listless indifference sometimes in the marketplace instructing the little Dutch boys in the use of the bow and arrow at other times inflamed with liquor swaggering and whooping and yelling about the town like so many fiends to the great dismay of all the good wives who would hurry their children into the house fasten the doors and throw water upon the enemy from the garret windows It is worthy of mention here that our forefathers were very particular in holding up these wild men as excellent domestic examples and for reasons that may be gathered from the history of Master Ogilby who tells us that for the least offence the bridegroom soundly beats his wife and turns her out of doors and marries another insomuch that some of them have every year a new wife Whether this awful example had any influence or not history does not mention but it is certain that our grandmothers were miracles of fidelity and obedience True it is that the good understanding between our ancestors and their savage neighbors was liable to occasional interruptions and I have heard my grandmother who was a very wise old woman and well versed in the history of these parts tell a long story of a winter s evening about a battle between the New Amsterdammers and the Indians which was known by the name of the Peach War and which took place near a peach orchard in a dark glen which for a long while went by the name of Murderer s Valley 
8011_291458_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The legend of this sylvan war was long current among the nurses old wives and other ancient chroniclers of the place but time and improvement have almost obliterated both the tradition and the scene of battle for what was once the blood stained valley is now in the center of this populous city and known by the name of Dey Street 
8011_291458_000010_000000	train-clean-360	I know not whether it was to this Peach War and the acquisitions of Indian land which may have grown out of it that we may ascribe the first seeds of the spirit of annexation which now began to manifest themselves 
none	none	Hitherto the ambition of the worthy burghers had been confined to the lovely island of Manna hata and Spiten Devil on the Hudson and Hell gate on the Sound were to them the pillars of Hercules the ne plus ultra of human enterprise 
8011_291458_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Shortly after the Peach War however a restless spirit was observed among the New Amsterdammers who began to cast wistful looks upon the wild lands of their Indian neighbors for somehow or other wild Indian land always looks greener in the eyes of settlers than the land they occupy 
8011_291458_000010_000003	train-clean-360	It is hinted that Oloffe the Dreamer encouraged these notions having as has been shown the inherent spirit of a land speculator which had been wonderfully quickened and expanded since he had become a landholder 
none	none	Many of the common people who had never before owned a foot of land now began to be discontented with the town lots which had fallen to their shares others who had snug farms and tobacco plantations found they had not sufficient elbow room and began to question the rights of the Indians to the vast regions they pretended to hold while the good Oloffe indulged in magnificent dreams of foreign conquest and great patroonships in the wilderness 
8011_291458_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The result of these dreams were certain exploring expeditions sent forth in various directions to sow the seeds of empire as it was said 
none	none	The earliest of these were conducted by Hans Reinier Oothout an old navigator famous for the sharpness of his vision who could see land when it was quite out of sight to ordinary mortals and who had a spy glass covered with a bit of tarpaulin with which he could spy up the crookedest river quite to its head waters 
8011_291458_000011_000002	train-clean-360	He was accompanied by Mynheer Ten Breeches as land measurer in case of any dispute with the Indians

8011_291458_000014_000000	train-clean-360	But as this opens a new era in the fortunes of New Amsterdam I will here put an end to this second book of my history and will treat of the maternal policy of the mother country in my next 
none	none	BOOK III IN WHICH IS RECORDED THE GOLDEN REIGN OF WOUTER VAN TWILLER CHAPTER I Grievous and very much to be commiserated is the task of the feeling historian who writes the history of his native land If it fell to his lot to be the recorder of calamity or crime the mournful page is watered with his tears nor can he recall the most prosperous and blissful era without a melancholy sigh at the reflection that it has passed away for ever I know not whether it be owing to an immoderate love for the simplicity of former times or to that certain tenderness of heart incident to all sentimental historians but I candidly confess that I cannot look back on the happier days of our city which I now describe without great dejection of spirits With faltering hand do I withdraw the curtain of oblivion that veils the modest merit of our venerable ancestors and as their figures rise to my mental vision humble myself before their mighty shades Such are my feelings when I revisit the family mansion of the Knickerbockers and spend a lonely hour in the chamber where hang the portraits of my forefathers shrouded in dust like the forms they represent With pious reverence do I gaze on the countenances of those renowned burghers who have preceded me in the steady march of existence whose sober and temperate blood now meanders through my veins flowing slower and slower in its feeble conduits until its current shall soon be stopped for ever These I say to myself are but frail memorials of the mighty men who flourished in the days of the patriarchs but who alas have long since smouldered in that tomb towards which my steps are insensibly and irresistibly hastening As I pace the darkened chamber and lose myself in melancholy musings the shadowy images around me almost seem to steal once more into existence their countenances to assume the animation of life their eyes to pursue me in every movement Carried away by the delusions of fancy I almost imagine myself surrounded by the shades of the departed and holding sweet converse with the worthies of antiquity Ah hapless Diedrich born in a degenerate age abandoned to the buffetings of fortune a stranger and weary pilgrim in thy native land blest with no weeping wife nor family of helpless children but doomed to wander neglected through those crowded streets and elbowed by foreign upstarts from those fair abodes where once thine ancestors held sovereign empire Let me not however lose the historian in the man nor suffer the doting recollections of age to overcome me while dwelling with fond garrulity on the virtuous days of the patriarchs on those sweet days of simplicity and ease which never more will dawn on the lovely island of Manna hata These melancholy reflections have been forced from me by the growing wealth and importance of New Amsterdam which I plainly perceive are to involve it in all kinds of perils and disasters Already as I observed at the close of my last book they had awakened the attention of the mother country The usual mark of protection shown by mother countries to wealthy colonies was forthwith manifested a governor being sent out to rule over the province and squeeze out of it as much revenue as possible The arrival of a governor of course put an end to the protectorate of Oloffe the Dreamer He appears however to have dreamt to some purpose during his sway as we find him afterwards living as a patroon on a great landed estate on the banks of the Hudson having virtually forfeited all right to his ancient appellation of Kortlandt or Lackland It was in the year of our Lord sixteen twenty nine that Mynheer Wouter Van Twiller was appointed governor of the province of Nieuw Nederlands under the commission and control of their High Mightinesses the Lords States General of the United Netherlands and the privileged West India Company This renowned old gentleman arrived at New Amsterdam in the merry month of June the sweetest month in all the year when Dan Apollo seems to dance up the transparent firmament when the robin the thrush and a thousand other wanton songsters make the woods to resound with amorous ditties and the luxurious little boblicon revels among the clover blossoms of the meadows all which happy coincidence persuaded the old dames of New Amsterdam who were skilled in the art of foretelling events that this was to be a happy and prosperous administration The renowned Wouter or Walter Van Twiller was descended from a long line of Dutch burgomasters who had successively dozed away their lives and grown fat upon the bench of magistracy in Rotterdam and who had empowered themselves with such singular wisdom and propriety that they were never either heard or talked of which next to being universally applauded should be the object of ambition of all magistrates and rulers There are two opposite ways by which some men make a figure in the world one by talking faster than they think and the other by holding their tongues and not thinking at all By the first many a smatterer acquires the reputation of a man of quick parts by the other many a dunderpate like the owl the stupidest of birds comes to be considered the very type of wisdom This by the way is a casual remark which I would not for the universe have it thought I apply to Governor Van Twiller It is true he was a man shut up within himself like an oyster and rarely spoke except in monosyllables but then it was allowed he seldom said a foolish thing So invincible was his gravity that he was never known to laugh or even to smile through the whole course of a long and prosperous life Nay if a joke were uttered in his presence that set light minded hearers in a roar it was observed to throw him into a state of perplexity Sometimes he would deign to inquire into the matter and when after much explanation the joke was made as plain as a pike staff he would continue to smoke his pipe in silence and at length knocking out the ashes would exclaim Well I see nothing in all that to laugh about With all his reflective habits he never made up his mind on a subject His adherents accounted for this by the astonishing magnitude of his ideas He conceived every subject on so grand a scale that he had not room in his head to turn it over and examine both sides of it Certain it is that if any matter were propounded to him on which ordinary mortals would rashly determine at first glance he would put on a vague mysterious look shake his capacious head smoke some time in profound silence and at length observe that he had his doubts about the matter which gained him the reputation of a man slow of belief and not easily imposed upon What is more it gained him a lasting name for to this habit of the mind has been attributed his surname of Twiller which is said to be a corruption of the original Twijfler or in plain English Doubter The person of this illustrious old gentleman was formed and proportioned as though it had been moulded by the hands of some cunning Dutch statuary as a model of majesty and lordly grandeur He was exactly five feet six inches in height and six feet five inches in circumference His head was a perfect sphere and of such stupendous dimensions that Dame Nature with all her sex s ingenuity would have been puzzled to construct a neck capable of supporting it wherefore she wisely declined the attempt and settled it firmly on the top of his backbone just between the shoulders His body was oblong and particularly capacious at bottom which was wisely ordered by Providence seeing that he was a man of sedentary habits and very averse to the idle labor of walking His legs were short but sturdy in proportion to the weight they had to sustain so that when erect he had not a little the appearance of a beer barrel on skids His face that infallible index of the mind presented a vast expanse unfurrowed by any of those lines and angles which disfigure the human countenance with what is termed expression Two small gray eyes twinkled feebly in the midst like two stars of lesser magnitude in a hazy firmament and his full fed cheeks which seemed to have taken toll of everything that went into his mouth were curiously mottled and streaked with dusky red like a Spitzenberg apple His habits were as regular as his person He daily took his four stated meals appropriating exactly an hour to each he smoked and doubted eight hours and he slept the remaining twelve of the four and twenty Such was the renowned Wouter Van Twiller a true philosopher for his mind was either elevated above or tranquilly settled below the cares and perplexities of this world He had lived in it for years without feeling the least curiosity to know whether the sun revolved round it or it round the sun and he had watched for at least half century the smoke curling from his pipe to the ceiling without once troubling his head with any of those numerous theories by which a philosopher would have perplexed his brain in accounting for its rising above the surrounding atmosphere In his council he presided with great state and solemnity He sat in a huge chair of solid oak hewn in the celebrated forest of the Hague fabricated by an experienced timmerman of Amsterdam and curiously carved about the arms and feet into exact imitations of gigantic eagle s claws Instead of a scepter he swayed a long Turkish pipe wrought with jasmin and amber which had been presented to a stadtholder of Holland at the conclusion of a treaty with one of the petty Barbary Powers In this stately chair would he sit and this magnificent pipe would he smoke shaking his right knee with a constant motion and fixing his eye for hours together upon a little print of Amsterdam which hung in a black frame against the opposite wall of the council chamber Nay it has even been said that when any deliberation of extraordinary length and intricacy was on the carpet the renowned Wouter would shut his eyes for full two hours at a time that he might not be disturbed by external objects and at such times the internal commotion of his mind was evinced by certain regular guttural sounds which his admirers declared were merely the noise of conflict made by his contending doubts and opinions It is with infinite difficulty I have been enabled to collect these biographical anecdotes of the great man under consideration The facts respecting him were so scattered and vague and divers of them so questionable in point of authenticity that I have had to give up the search after many and decline the admission of still more which would have tended to heighten the coloring of his portrait I have been the more anxious to delineate fully the person and habits of Wouter Van Twiller from the consideration that he was not only the first but also the best governor that ever presided over this ancient and respectable province and so tranquil and benevolent was his reign that I do not find throughout the whole of it a single instance of any offender being brought to punishment a most indubitable sign of a merciful governor and a case unparalleled excepting in the reign of the illustrious King Log from whom it is hinted the renowned Van Twiller was a lineal descendant The very outset of the career of this excellent magistrate was distinguished by an example of legal acumen that gave flattering presage of a wise and equitable administration The morning after he had been installed in office and at the moment that he was making his breakfast from a prodigious earthen dish filled with milk and Indian pudding he was interrupted by the appearance of Wandle Schoonhoven a very important old burgher of New Amsterdam who complained bitterly of one Barent Bleecker inasmuch as he refused to come to a settlement of accounts seeing that there was a heavy balance in favor of the said Wandle Governor Van Twiller as I have already observed was a man of few words he was likewise a mortal enemy to multiplying writings or being disturbed at his breakfast Having listened attentively to the statement of Wandle Schoonhoven giving an occasional grunt as he shoveled a spoonful of Indian pudding into his mouth either as a sign that he relished the dish or comprehended the story he called unto his constable and pulling out of his breeches proper a huge jack knife dispatched it after the defendant as a summons accompanied by his tobacco box as a warrant This summary process was as effectual in those simple days as was the seal ring of the great Haroun Alraschid among the true believers The two parties being confronted before him each produced a book of accounts written in a language and character that would have puzzled any but a High Dutch commentator or a learned decipherer of Egyptian obelisks The sage Wouter took them one after the other and having poised them in his hands and attentively counted over the number of leaves fell straightway into a very great doubt and smoked for half an hour without saying a word at length laying his finger beside his nose and shutting his eyes for a moment with the air of a man who has just caught a subtle idea by the tail he slowly took his pipe from his mouth puffed forth a column of tobacco smoke and with marvelous gravity and solemnity pronounced that having carefully counted over the leaves and weighed the books it was found that one was just as thick and as heavy as the other therefore it was the final opinion of the court that the accounts were equally balanced therefore Wandle should give Barent a receipt and Barent should give Wandle a receipt and the constable should pay the costs This decision being straightway made known diffused general joy throughout New Amsterdam for the people immediately perceived that they had a very wise and equitable magistrate to rule over them But its happiest effect was that not another lawsuit took place throughout the whole of his administration and the office of constable fell into such decay that there was not one of those losel scouts known in the province for many years I am the more particular in dwelling on this transaction not only because I deem it one of the most sage and righteous judgments on record and well worthy the attention of modern magistrates but because it was a miraculous event in the history of the renowned Wouter being the only time he was ever known to come to a decision in the whole course of his life CHAPTER II In treating of the early governors of the province I must caution my readers against confounding them in point of dignity and power with those worthy gentlemen who are whimsically denominated governors in this enlightened republic a set of unhappy victims of popularity who are in fact the most dependent henpecked beings in the community doomed to bear the secret goadings and corrections of their own party and the sneers and revilings of the whole world beside set up like geese at Christmas holidays to be pelted and shot at by every whipster and vagabond in the land On the contrary the Dutch governors enjoyed that uncontrolled authority vested in all commanders of distant colonies or territories They were in a manner absolute despots in their little domains lording it if so disposed over both law and gospel and accountable to none but the mother country which it is well known is astonishingly deaf to all complaints against its governors provided they discharge the main duty of their station squeezing out a good revenue This hint will be of importance to prevent my readers from being seized with doubt and incredulity whenever in the course of this authentic history they encounter the uncommon circumstance of a governor acting with independence and in opposition to the opinions of the multitude To assist the doubtful Wouter in the arduous business of legislation a board of magistrates was appointed which presided immediately over the police This potent body consisted of a schout or bailiff with powers between those of the present mayor and sheriff five burgermeesters who were equivalent to aldermen and five schepens who officiated as scrubs sub devils or bottle holders to the burgermeesters in the same manner as do assistant aldermen to their principals at the present day it being their duty to fill the pipes of the lordly burgermeesters hunt the markets for delicacies for corporation dinners and to discharge such other little offices of kindness as were occasionally required It was moreover tacitly understood though not specifically enjoined that they should consider themselves as butts for the blunt wits of the burgermeesters and should laugh most heartily at all their jokes but this last was a duty as rarely called in action in those days as it is at present and was shortly remitted in consequence of the tragical death of a fat little schepen who actually died of suffocation in an unsuccessful effort to force a laugh at one of burgermeester Van Zandt s best jokes In return for these humble services they were permitted to say yes and no at the council board and to have that enviable privilege the run of the public kitchen being graciously permitted to eat and drink and smoke at all those snug junketing and public gormandisings for which the ancient magistrates were equally famous with their modern successors The post of schepen therefore like that of assistant alderman was eagerly coveted by all your burghers of a certain description who have a huge relish for good feeding and an humble ambition to be great men in a small way who thirst after a little brief authority that shall render them the terror of the almshouse and the bridewell that shall enable them to lord it over obsequious poverty vagrant vice outcast prostitution and hunger driven dishonesty that shall give to their beck a hound like pack of catshpolls and bumbailiffs tenfold greater rogues than the culprits they hunt down My readers will excuse this sudden warmth which I confess is unbecoming of a grave historian but I have a mortal antipathy to catchpolls bumbailiffs and little great men The ancient magistrates of this city corresponded with those of the present time no less in form magnitude and intellect than in prerogative and privilege The burgomasters like our aldermen were generally chosen by weight and not only the weight of the body but likewise the weight of the head It is a maxim practically observed in all honest plain thinking regular cities that an alderman should be fat and the wisdom of this can be proved to a certainty That the body is in some measure an image of the mind or rather that the mind is moulded to the body like melted lead to the clay in which it is cast has been insisted on by many philosophers who have made human nature their peculiar study for as a learned gentleman of our own city observes there is a constant relation between the moral character of all intelligent creatures and their physical constitution between their habits and the structure of their bodies Thus we see that a lean spare diminutive body is generally accompanied by a petulant restless meddling mind either the mind wears down the body by its continual motion or else the body not affording the mind sufficient house room keeps it continually in a state of fretfulness tossing and worrying about from the uneasiness of its situation Whereas your round sleek fat unwieldly periphery is ever attended by a mind like itself tranquil torpid and at ease and we may alway observe that your well fed robustious burghers are in general very tenacious of their ease and comfort being great enemies to noise discord and disturbance and surely none are more likely to study the public tranquillity than those who are so careful of their own Who ever hears of fat men heading a riot or herding together in turbulent mobs No no it is your lean hungry men who are continually worrying society and setting the whole community by the ears The divine Plato whose doctrines are not sufficiently attended to by philosophers of the present age allows to every man three souls one immortal and rational seated in the brain that it may overlook and regulate the body a second consisting of the surly and irascible passions which like belligerent powers lie encamped around the heart a third mortal and sensual destitute of reason gross and brutal in its propensities and enchained in the belly that it may not disturb the divine soul by its ravenous howlings Now according to this excellent theory what can be more clear than that your fat alderman is most likely to have the most regular and well conditioned mind His head is like a huge spherical chamber containing a prodigious mass of soft brains whereon the rational soul lies softly and snugly couched as on a feather bed and the eyes which are the windows of the bedchamber are usually half closed that its slumberings may not be disturbed by external objects A mind thus comfortably lodged and protected from disturbance is manifestly most like to perform its functions with regularly and ease By dint of good feeding moreover the mortal and malignant soul which is confined in the belly and which by its raging and roaring puts the irritable soul in the neighborhood of the heart in an intolerable passion and thus renders men crusty and quarrelsome when hungry is completely pacified silenced and put to rest whereupon a host of honest good fellow qualities and kind hearted affections which had lain perdue slily peeping out of the loopholes of the heart finding this Cerberus asleep do pluck up their spirits turn out one and all in their holiday suits and gambol up and down the diaphragm disposing their possessor to laughter good humor and a thousand friendly offices towards his fellow mortals As a board of magistrates formed on this principle think but very little they are the less likely to differ and wrangle about favorite opinions and as they generally transact business upon a hearty dinner they are naturally disposed to be lenient and indulgent in the administration of their duties Charlemagne was conscious of this and therefore ordered in his cartularies that no judge should hold a court of justice except in the morning on an empty stomach A pitiful rule which I can never forgive and which I warrant bore hard upon all the poor culprits in the kingdom The more enlightened and humane generation of the present day have taken an opposite course and have so managed that the alderman are the best fed men in the community feasting lustily on the fat things of the land and gorging so heartily on oysters and turtles that in process of time they acquire the activity of the one and the form the waddle and the green fat of the other The consequence is as I have just said these luxurious feastings do produce such a dulcet equanimity and repose of the soul rational and irrational that their transactions are proverbial for unvarying monotony and the profound laws which they enact in their dozing moments amid the labors of digestion are quietly suffered to remain as dead letters and never enforced when awake In a word your fair round bellied burgomaster like a full fed mastiff dozes quietly at the house door always at home and always at hand to watch over its safety but as to electing a lean meddling candidate to the office as has now and then been done I would as lief put a greyhound to watch the house or a racehorse to draw an ox wagon The burgomasters then as I have already mentioned were wisely chosen by weight and the schepens or assistant aldermen were appointed to attend upon them and help them eat but the latter in the course of time when they had been fed and fattened into sufficient bulk of body and drowsiness of brain became very eligible candidates for the burgomasters chairs having fairly eaten themselves into office as a mouse eats his way into a comfortable lodgment in a goodly blue nosed skimmed milk New England cheese Nothing could equal the profound deliberations that took place between the renowned Wouter and these his worthy compeers unless it be the sage divans of some of our modern corporations They would sit for hours smoking and dozing over public affairs without speaking a word to interrupt that perfect stillness so necessary to deep reflection Under the sober sway of Wouter Van Twiller and these his worthy coadjutors the infant settlement waxed vigorous apace gradually emerging from the swamps and forests and exhibiting that mingled appearance of town and country customary in new cities and which at this day may be witnessed in the city of Washington that immense metropolis which makes so glorious an appearance on paper It was a pleasing sight in those times to behold the honest burgher like a patriarch of yore seated on the bench at the door of his whitewashed house under the shade of some gigantic sycamore or overhanging willow Here would he smoke his pipe of a sultry afternoon enjoying the soft southern breeze and listening with silent gratulation to the clucking of his hens the cackling of his geese and the sonorous grunting of his swine that combination of farmyard melody which may truly be said to have a silver sound inasmuch as it conveys a certain assurance of profitable marketing The modern spectator who wanders through the streets of this populous city can scarcely form an idea of the different appearance they presented in the primitive days of the doubter The busy hum of multitudes the shouts of revelry the rumbling equipages of fashion the rattling of accursed carts and all the spirit grieving sounds of brawling commerce were unknown in the settlement of New Amsterdam The grass grew quietly in the highways the bleating sheep and frolicksome calves sported about the verdant ridge where now the Broadway loungers take their morning stroll the cunning fox or ravenous wolf skulked in the woods where now are to be seen the dens of Gomez and his righteous fraternity of money brokers and flocks of vociferous geese cackled about the fields where now the great Tammany wigwam and the patriotic tavern of Martling echo with the wranglings of the mob In these good times did a true and enviable equality of rank and property prevail equally removed from the arrogance of wealth and the servility and heart burnings of repining poverty and what in my mind is still more conducive to tranquillity and harmony among friends a happy equality of intellect was likewise to be seen The minds of the good burghers of New Amsterdam seemed all to have been cast in one mould and to be those honest blunt minds which like certain manufactures are made by the gross and considered as exceedingly good for common use Thus it happens that your true dull minds are generally preferred for public employ and especially promoted to city honors your keen intellects like razors being considered too sharp for common service I know that it is common to rail at the unequal distribution of riches as the great source of jealousies broils and heart breakings whereas for my part I verily believe it is the sad inequality of intellect that prevails that embroils communities more than anything else and I have remarked that your knowing people who are so much wiser than anybody else are eternally keeping society in a ferment Happily for New Amsterdam nothing of the kind was known within its walls the very words of learning education taste and talents were unheard of a bright genius was an animal unknown and a blue stocking lady would have been regarded with as much wonder as a horned frog or a fiery dragon No man in fact seemed to know more than his neighbor nor any man to know more than an honest man ought to know who has nobody s business to mind but his own the parson and the council clerk were the only men that could read in the community and the sage Van Twiller always signed his name with a cross Thrice happy and ever to be envied little burgh existing in all the security of harmless insignificance unnoticed and unenvied by the world without ambition without vain glory without riches without learning and all their train of carking cares and as of yore in the better days of man the deities were wont to visit him on earth and bless his rural habitations so we are told in the sylvan days of New Amsterdam the good saint Nicholas would often make his appearance in his beloved city of a holiday afternoon riding jollily among the treetops or over the roofs of houses now and then drawing forth magnificent presents from his breeches pockets and dropping them down the chimneys of his favorites Whereas in these degenerate days of iron and brass he never shows us the light of his countenance nor ever visits us save one night in the year when he rattles down the chimneys of the descendants of the patriarchs confining his presents merely to the children in token of the degeneracy of the parents Such are the comfortable and thriving effects of a fat government The province of the New Netherlands destitute of wealth possessed a sweet tranquillity that wealth could never purchase There were neither public commotions nor private quarrels neither parties nor sects nor schisms neither persecutions nor trials nor punishments nor were there counsellors attorneys catchpolls or hangmen Every man attended to what little business he was lucky enough to have or neglected it if he pleased without asking the opinion of his neighbor In those days nobody meddled with concerns above his comprehension nor thrust his nose into other people s affairs nor neglected to correct his own conduct and reform his own character in his zeal to pull to pieces the characters of others but in a word every respectable citizen ate when he was not hungry drank when he was not thirsty and went regularly to bed when the sun set and the fowls went to roost whether he were sleepy or not all which tended so remarkably to the population of the settlement that I am told every dutiful wife throughout New Amsterdam made a point of enriching her husband with at least one child a year and very often a brace this superabundance of good things clearly constituting the true luxury of life according to the favorite Dutch maxim that more than enough constitutes a feast Everything therefore went on exactly as it should do and in the usual words employed by historians to express the welfare of a country the profoundest tranquillity and repose reigned throughout the province CHAPTER III Manifold are the tastes and dispositions of the enlightened literati who turn over the pages of history Some there be whose hearts are brimful of the yeast of courage and whose bosoms do work and swell and foam with untried valor like a barrel of new cider or a train band captain fresh from under the hands of his tailor This doughty class of readers can be satisfied with nothing but bloody battles and horrible encounters they must be continually storming forts sacking cities springing mines marching up to the muzzles of cannon charging bayonet through every page and revelling in gunpowder and carnage Others who are of a less martial but equally ardent imagination and who withal are little given to the marvelous will dwell with wondrous satisfaction on descriptions of prodigies unheard of events hair breadth escapes hardy adventures and all those astonishing narrations which just amble along the boundary line of possibility A third class who not to speak slightly of them are of a lighter turn and skim over the records of past times as they do over the edifying pages of a novel merely for relaxation and innocent amusement do singularly delight in treasons executions Sabine rapes Tarquin outrages conflagrations murders and all the other catalogues of hideous crimes which like cayenne in cookery do give a pungency and flavor to the dull detail of history while a fourth class of more philosophic habits do diligently pore over the musty chronicles of time to investigate the operations of the human kind and watch the gradual changes in men and manners effected by the progress of knowledge the vicissitudes of events or the influence of situation If the three first classes find but little wherewithal to solace themselves in the tranquil reign of Wouter Van Twiller I entreat them to exert their patience for a while and bear with the tedious picture of happiness prosperity and peace which my duty as a faithful historian obliges me to draw and I promise them that as soon as I can possibly alight upon anything horrible uncommon or impossible it shall go hard but I will make it afford them entertainment This being premised I turn with great complacency to the fourth class of my readers who are men or if possible women after my own heart grave philosophical and investigating fond of analyzing characters of taking a start from first causes and so haunting a nation down through all the mazes of innovation and improvement Such will naturally be anxious to witness the first development of the newly hatched colony and the primitive manners and customs prevalent among its inhabitants during the halcyon reign of Van Twiller or the Doubter I will not grieve their patience however by describing minutely the increase and improvement of New Amsterdam Their own imaginations will doubtless present to them the good burghers like so many painstaking and persevering beavers slowly and surely pursuing their labors they will behold the prosperous transformation from the rude log hut to the stately Dutch mansion with brick front glazed windows and tiled roof from the tangled thicket to the luxuriant cabbage garden and from the skulking Indian to the ponderous burgomaster In a word they will picture to themselves the steady silent and undeviating march of prosperity incident to a city destitute of pride or ambition cherished by a fat government and whose citizens do nothing in a hurry The sage council as has been mentioned in a preceding chapter not being able to determine upon any plan for the building of their city the cows in a laudable fit of patriotism took it under their peculiar charge and as they went to and from pasture established paths through the bushes on each side of which the good folks built their houses which is one cause of the rambling and picturesque turns and labyrinths which distinguish certain streets of New York at this very day The houses of the higher class were generally constructed of wood excepting the gable end which was of small black and yellow Dutch bricks and always faced on the street as our ancestors like their descendants were very much given to outward show and were noted for putting the best leg foremost The house was always furnished with abundance of large doors and small windows on every floor the date of its erection was curiously designated by iron figures on the front and on the top of the roof was perched a fierce little weathercock to let the family into the important secret which way the wind blew These like the weathercocks on the tops of our steeples pointed so many different ways that every man could have a wind to his mind the most staunch and loyal citizens however always went according to the weathercock on the top of the governor s house which was certainly the most correct as he had a trusty servant employed every morning to climb up and set it to the right quarter In those good days of simplicity and sunshine a passion for cleanliness was the leading principle in domestic economy and the universal test of an able housewife a character which formed the utmost ambition of our unenlightened grandmothers The front door was never opened except on marriages funerals new year s days the festival of saint Nicholas or some such great occasion It was ornamented with a gorgeous brass knocker curiously wrought sometimes in the device of a dog and sometimes of a lion s head and was daily burnished with such religious zeal that it was oft times worn out by the very precautions taken for its preservation The whole house was constantly in a state of inundation under the discipline of mops and brooms and scrubbing brushes and the good housewives of those days were a kind of amphibious animal delighting exceedingly to be dabbling in water insomuch that an historian of the day gravely tells us that many of his townswomen grew to have webbed fingers like unto a duck and some of them he had little doubt could the matter be examined into would be found to have the tails of mermaids but this I look upon to be a mere sport of fancy or what is worse a wilful misrepresentation The grand parlor was the sanctum sanctorum where the passion for cleaning was indulged without control In this sacred apartment no one was permitted to enter excepting the mistress and her confidential maid who visited it once a week for the purpose of giving it a thorough cleaning and putting things to rights always taking the precaution of leaving their shoes at the door and entering devoutly on their stocking feet After scrubbing the floor sprinkling it with fine white sand which was curiously stroked into angles and curves and rhomboids with a broom after washing the windows rubbing and polishing the furniture and putting a bunch of evergreens in the fireplace the window shutters were again closed to keep out the flies and the room carefully locked up until the revolution of time brought round the weekly cleaning day As to the family they always entered in at the gate and most generally lived in the kitchen To have seen a numerous household assembled round the fire one would have imagined that he was transported back to those happy days of primeval simplicity which float before our imaginations like golden visions The fireplaces were of a truly patriarchal magnitude where the whole family old and young master and servant black and white nay even the very cat and dog enjoyed a community of privilege and had each a right to a corner Here the old burgher would sit in perfect silence puffing his pipe looking into the fire with half shut eyes and thinking of nothing for hours together the goede vrouw on the opposite side would employ herself diligently in spinning yarn or knitting stockings The young folks would crowd around the hearth listening with breathless attention to some old crone of a negro who was the oracle of the family and who perched like a raven in the corner of a chimney would croak forth for a long winter afternoon a string of incredible stories about New England witches grisly ghosts horses without heads and hair breadth escapes and bloody encounters among the Indians In those happy days a well regulated family always rose with the dawn dined at eleven and went to bed at sunset Dinner was invariably a private meal and the fat old burghers showed incontestable signs of disapprobation and uneasiness at being surprised by a visit from a neighbor on such occasions But though our worthy ancestors were thus singularly averse to giving dinners yet they kept up the social bands of intimacy by occasional banquettings called tea parties These fashionable parties were generally confined to the higher classes or noblesse that is to say such as kept their own cows and drove their own waggons The company commonly assembled at three o clock and went away about six unless it was in winter time when the fashionable hours were a little earlier that the ladies might get home before dark The tea table was crowned with a huge earthen dish well stored with slices of fat pork fried brown cut up into morsels and swimming in gravy The company being seated round the genial board and each furnished with a fork evinced their dexterity in launching at the fattest pieces in this mighty dish in much the same manner as sailors harpoon porpoises at sea or our Indians spear salmon in the lakes Sometimes the table was graced with immense apple pies or saucers full of preserved peaches and pears but it was always sure to boast an enormous dish of balls of sweetened dough fried in hog s fat and called doughnuts or olykoeks a delicious kind of cake at present scarce known in this city except in genuine Dutch families The tea was served out of a majestic delf teapot ornamented with paintings of fat little Dutch shepherds and shepherdesses tending pigs with boats sailing in the air and houses built in the clouds and sundry other ingenious Dutch fantasies The beaux distinguished themselves by their adroitness in replenishing this pot from a huge copper tea kettle which would have made the pigmy macaronies of these degenerate days sweat merely to look at it To sweeten the beverage a lump of sugar was laid beside each cup and the company alternately nibbled and sipped with great decorum until an improvement was introduced by a shrewd and economic old lady which was to suspend a large lump directly over the tea table by a string from the ceiling so that it could be swung from mouth to mouth an ingenious expedient which is still kept up by some families in Albany but which prevails without exception in Communipaw Bergen Flatbush and all our uncontaminated Dutch villages At these primitive tea parties the utmost propriety and dignity of deportment prevailed No flirting nor coquetting no gambling of old ladies nor hoyden chattering and romping of young ones no self satisfied struttings of wealthy gentlemen with their brains in their pockets nor amusing conceits and monkey divertissements of smart young gentlemen with no brains at all On the contrary the young ladies seated themselves demurely in their rush bottomed chairs and knit their own woollen stockings nor ever opened their lips excepting to say yah Mynheer or yah ya Vrouw to any question that was asked them behaving in all things like decent well educated damsels As to the gentlemen each of them tranquilly smoked his pipe and seemed lost in contemplation of the blue and white tiles with which the fireplaces were decorated wherein sundry passages of Scripture were piously portrayed Tobit and his dog figured to great advantage Haman swung conspicuously on his gibbet and Jonah appeared most manfully bouncing out of the whale like Harlequin through a barrel of fire The parties broke up without noise and without confusion They were carried home by their own carriages that is to say by the vehicles nature had provided them excepting such of the wealthy as could afford to keep a wagon The gentlemen gallantly attended their fair ones to their respective abodes and took leave of them with a hearty smack at the door which as it was an established piece of etiquette done in perfect simplicity and honesty of heart occasioned no scandal at that time nor should it at the present If our great grandfathers approved of the custom it would argue a great want of reverence in their descendants to say a word against it CHAPTER IV In this dulcet period of my history when the beauteous island of Manna hata presented a scene the very counterpart of those glowing pictures drawn of the golden reign of Saturn there was as I have before observed a happy ignorance an honest simplicity prevalent among its inhabitants which were I even able to depict would be but little understood by the degenerate age for which I am doomed to write Even the female sex those arch innovators upon the tranquillity the honesty and grey beard customs of society seemed for a while to conduct themselves with incredible sobriety and comeliness Their hair untortured by the abominations of art was scrupulously pomatomed back from their foreheads with a candle and covered with a little cap of quilted calico which fitted exactly to their heads Their petticoats of linsey woolsey were striped with a variety of gorgeous dyes though I must confess these gallant garments were rather short scarce reaching below the knee but then they made up in the number which generally equalled that of the gentleman s small clothes and what is still more praiseworthy they were all of their own manufacture of which circumstance as may well be supposed they were not a little vain These were the honest days in which every woman stayed at home read the Bible and wore pockets ay and that too of a goodly size fashioned with patchwork into many curious devices and ostentatiously worn on the outside These in fact were convenient receptacles where all good housewives carefully stored away such things as they wished to have at hand by which means they often came to be incredibly crammed and I remember there was a story current when I was a boy that the lady of Wouter Van Twiller once had occasion to empty her right pocket in search of a wooden ladle when the contents filled a couple of corn baskets and the utensil was discovered lying among some rubbish in one corner but we must not give too much faith to all these stories the anecdotes of those remote periods being very subject to exaggeration Besides these notable pockets they likewise wore scissors and pincushions suspended from their girdles by red ribands or among the more opulent and showy classes by brass and even silver chains indubitable tokens of thrifty housewives and industrious spinsters I cannot say much in vindication of the shortness of the petticoats it doubtless was introduced for the purpose of giving the stockings a chance to be seen which were generally of blue worsted with magnificent red clocks or perhaps to display a well turned ankle and a neat though serviceable foot set off by a high heeled leathern shoe with a large and splendid silver buckle Thus we find that the gentle sex in all ages have shown the same disposition to infringe a little upon the laws of decorum in order to betray a lurking beauty or gratify an innocent love of finery From the sketch here given it will be seen that our good grandmothers differed considerably in their ideas of a fine figure from their scantily dressed descendants of the present day A fine lady in those times waddled under more clothes even on a fair summer s day than would have clad the whole bevy of a modern ball room Nor were they the less admired by the gentlemen in consequence thereof On the contrary the greatness of a lover s passion seemed to increase in proportion to the magnitude of its object and a voluminous damsel arrayed in a dozen petticoats was declared by a low Dutch sonneteer of the province to be radiant as a sunflower and luxuriant as a full blown cabbage Certain it is that in those day the heart of a lover could not contain more than one lady at a time whereas the heart of a modern gallant has often room enough to accommodate half a dozen the reason of which I conclude to be that either the hearts of the gentlemen have grown larger or the persons of the ladies smaller this however is a question for physiologists to determine But there was a secret charm in these petticoats which no doubt entered into the consideration of the prudent gallants The wardrobe of a lady was in those days her only fortune and she who had a good stock of petticoats and stockings was as absolutely an heiress as is a Kamschatka damsel with a store of bear skins or a Lapland belle with a plenty of reindeer The ladies therefore were very anxious to display these powerful attractions to the greatest advantage and the best rooms in the house instead of being adorned with caricatures of Dame Nature in water colors and needlework were always hung round with abundance of homespun garments the manufacture and the property of the females a piece of laudable ostentation that still prevails among the heiresses of our Dutch villages The gentlemen in fact who figured in the circles of the gay world in these ancient times corresponded in most particulars with the beauteous damsels whose smiles they were ambitious to deserve True it is their merits would make but a very inconsiderable impression upon the heart of a modern fair they neither drove their curricles nor sported their tandems for as yet those gaudy vehicles were not even dreamt of neither did they distinguish themselves by their brilliancy at the table and their consequent rencontres with watchmen for our forefathers were of too pacific a disposition to need those guardians of the night every soul throughout the town being sound asleep before nine o clock Neither did they establish their claims to gentility at the expense of their tailors for as yet those offenders against the pockets of society and the tranquillity of all aspiring young gentlemen were unknown in New Amsterdam every good housewife made the clothes of her husband and family and even the goede vrouw of Van Twiller himself thought it no disparagement to cut out her husband s linsey woolsey galligaskins Not but what there were some two or three youngsters who manifested the first dawning of what is called fire and spirit who held all labor in contempt skulked about docks and market places loitered in the sunshine squandered what little money they could procure at hustle cap and chuck farthing swore boxed fought cocks and raced their neighbor s horses in short who promised to be the wonder the talk and abomination of the town had not their stylish career been unfortunately cut short by an affair of honor with a whipping post Far other however was the truly fashionable gentleman of those days his dress which served for both morning and evening street and drawing room was a linsey woolsey coat made perhaps by the fair hands of the mistress of his affections and gallantly bedecked with abundance of large brass buttons half a score of breeches heightened the proportions of his figure his shoes were decorated by enormous copper buckles a low crowned broad brimmed hat overshadowed his burly visage and his hair dangled down his back in a prodigious queue of sulskin Thus equipped he would manfully sally forth with pipe in mouth to besiege some fair damsel s obdurate heart not such a pipe good reader as that which Acis did sweetly tune in praise of his Galatea but one of true delf manufacture and furnished with a charge of fragrant tobacco With this would he resolutely set himself down before the fortress and rarely failed in the process of time to smoke the fair enemy into a surrender upon honorable terms Such was the happy reign of Wouter Van Twiller celebrated in many a long forgotten song as the real golden age the rest being nothing but counterfeit copper washed coin In that delightful period a sweet and holy calm reigned over the whole province The burgomaster smoked his pipe in peace the substantial solace of his domestic cares after her daily toils were done sat soberly at the door with her arms crossed over her apron of snowy white without being insulted by ribald street walkers or vagabond boys those unlucky urchins who do so infest our streets displaying under the roses of youth the thorns and briars of iniquity Then it was that the lover with ten breeches and the damsel with petticoats of half a score indulged in all the innocent endearments of virtuous love without fear and without reproach for what had that virtue to fear which was defended by a shield of good linsey woolsey equal at least to the seven bull hides of the invincible Ajax Ah blissful and never to be forgotten age when everything was better than it has ever been since or ever will be again when Buttermilk Channel was quite dry at low water when the shad in the Hudson were all salmon and when the moon shone with a pure and resplendent whiteness instead of that melancholy yellow light which is the consequence of her sickening at the abominations she every night witnesses in this degenerate city Happy would it have been for New Amsterdam could it always have existed in this state of blissful ignorance and lowly simplicity but alas the days of childhood are too sweet to last Cities like men grow out of them in time and are doomed alike to grow into the bustle the cares and miseries of the world Let no man congratulate himself when he beholds the child of his bosom or the city of his birth increasing in magnitude and importance let the history of his own life teach him the dangers of the one and this excellent little history of Manna hata convince him of the calamities of the other CHAPTER V It has already been mentioned that in the early times of Oloffe the Dreamer a frontier post or trading house called Fort Aurania had been established on the upper waters of the Hudson precisely on the site of the present venerable city of Albany which was at time considered at the very end of the habitable world It was indeed a remote possession with which for a long time New Amsterdam held but little intercourse Now and then the Company s Yacht as it was called was sent to the Fort with supplies and to bring away the peltries which had been purchased of the Indians It was like an expedition to the Indias or the North Pole and always made great talk in the settlement Sometimes an adventurous burgher would accompany the expedition to the great uneasiness of his friends but on his return had so many stories to tell of storms and tempests on the Tappan Zee of hobgoblins in the Highlands and at the Devil s Dane Kammer and of all the other wonders and perils with which the river abounded in those early days that he deterred the less adventurous inhabitants from following his xample Matters were in this state when one day as Walter the Doubter and his burgermeesters were smoking and pondering over the affairs of the province they were roused by the report of a cannon Sallying forth they beheld a strange vessel at anchor in the bay it was unquestionably of Dutch build broad brimmed and high pooped and bore the flag of their High Mightinesses at the masthead After a while a boat put off for land and a stranger stepped on shore a lofty lordly kind of man tall and dry with a meager face furnished with hug mustachios He was clad in Flemish doublet and hose and an insufferably tall hat with a cocktail feather Such was the patroon Killian Van Rensellaer who had come out from Holland to found a colony or patroonship on a great tract of wild land granted to him by their Hight Mightinesses the Lords States General in the upper regions of the Hudson Killian Van Rensellaer was a nine day s wonder in New Amsterdam for he carried a high head looked down upon the portly short legged burgomasters and owned no allegiance to the governor himself boasting that he held his patroonship directly from the Lords States General He tarried but a short time in New Amsterdam merely to beat up recruits for his colony Few however ventured to enlist for those remote and savage regions and when they embarked their friends took leave of them as if they should never see them more and stood gazing with tearful eyes as the stout round sterned little vessel ploughed and splashed its way up the Hudson with great noise and little progress taking nearly a day to get out of sight of the city And now from time to time floated down tidings to the Manhattoes of the growing importance of this new colony Every account represented Killian Van Rensellaer as rising in importance and becoming a mighty patroon in the land He had received more recruits from Holland His patroonship of Rensellaerwick lay immediately below Fort Aurania and extended for several miles on each side of the Hudson beside embracing the mountainous region of the Helderberg Over all this he claimed to hold separate jurisdiction independent of the colonial authorities at New Amsterdam All these assumptions of authority were duly reported to Governor Van Twiller and his council by dispatches from Fort Aurania at each new report the governor and his counsellors looked at each other raised their eyebrows gave an extra puff or two of smoke and then relapsed into their usually tranquillity At length tidings came that the patroon of Rensellaerwick had extended his usurpations along the river beyond the limits granted him by their High Mightinesses and that he had even seized upon a rocky island in the Hudson commonly known by the name of Beern or Bear s Island where he was erecting a fortress to be called by the lordly name of Rensellaersteen Wouter Van Twiller was roused by this intelligence After consulting with his burgomasters he dispatched a letter to the patroon of Rensellaerwick demanding by what right he had seized upon this island which lay beyond the bounds of his patroonship The answer of Killian Van Rensellaer was in his own lordly style By wapen recht that is to say by the right of arms or in common parlance by club law This answer plunged the worthy Wouter in one of the deepest doubts he had in the whole course of his administration In the meantime while Wouter doubted the lordly Killian went on to finish his fortress of Rensellaersteen about which I foresee I shall have something to record in a future chapter of this most eventful history CHAPTER VI In the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and four on a fine afternoon in the glowing month of September I took my customary walk upon the battery which is at once the pride and bulwark of this ancient and impregnable city of New York The ground on which is I trod was hallowed by recollections of the past and as I slowly wandered through the long alley of poplars which like so many birch brooms standing on end diffused a melancholy and lugubrious shade my imagination drew a contrast between the surrounding scenery and what it was in the classic days of our forefathers Where the government house by name but the customhouse by occupation proudly reared its brick walls and wooden pillars there whilom stood the low but substantial red tiled mansion of the renowned Wouter Van Twiller Around it the mighty bulwarks of Fort Amsterdam frowned defiance to every absent foe but like many a whiskered warrior and gallant militia captain confined their martial deeds to frowns alone The mud breastworks had long been leveled with the earth and their site converted into the green lawns and leafy alleys of the battery where the gay apprentice sported his Sunday coat and the laborious mechanic relieved from the dirt and drudgery of the week poured his weekly tale of love into the half averted ear of the sentimental chambermaid The capacious bay still presented the same expansive sheet of water studded with islands sprinkled with fishing boats and bounded by shores of picturesque beauty But the dark forests which once clothed those shores had been violated by the savage hand of cultivation and their tangled mazes and impenetrable thickets had degenerated into teeming orchards and waving fields of grain Even Governor s Island once a smiling garden appertaining to the sovereigns of the province was now covered with fortifications inclosing a tremendous block house so that this once peaceful island resembled a fierce little warrior in a big cocked hat breathing gunpowder and defiance to the world For some time did I indulge in a pensive train of thought contrasting in sober sadness the present day with the hallowed years behind the mountains lamenting the melancholy progress of improvement and praising the zeal with which our worthy burghers endeavor to preserve the wrecks of venerable customs prejudices and errors from the overwhelming tide of modern innovation when by degrees my ideas took a different turn and I insensibly awakened to an enjoyment of the beauties around me It was one of those rich autumnal days which heaven particularly bestows upon the beauteous island of Mannahata and its vicinity not a floating cloud obscured the azure firmament the sun rolling in glorious splendor through his ethereal course seemed to expand his honest Dutch countenance into an unusual expression of benevolence as he smiled his evening salutation upon a city which he delights to visit with his most bounteous beams the very winds seemed to hold in their breaths in mute attention lest they should ruffle the tranquillity of the hour and the waveless bosom of the bay presented a polished mirror in which Nature beheld herself and smiled The standard of our city reserved like a choice handkerchief for days of gala hung motionless on the flag staff which forms the handle of a gigantic churn and even the tremulous leaves of the poplar and the aspen ceased to vibrate to the breath of heaven Everything seemed to acquiesce in the profound repose of Nature The formidable eighteen pounders slept in the embrasures of the wooden batteries seemingly gathering fresh strength to fight the battles of their country on the next fourth of July the solitary drum on Governor s Island forgot to call the garrison to the shovels the evening gun had not yet sounded its signal for all the regular well meaning poultry throughout the country to go to roost and the fleet of canoes at anchor between Gibbet Island and Communipaw slumbered on their rakes and suffered the innocent oysters to lie for a while unmolested in the soft mud of their native banks My own feelings sympathized with the contagious tranquillity and I should infallibly have dozed upon one of those fragments of benches which our benevolent magistrates have provided for the benefit of convalescent loungers had not the extraordinary inconvenience of the couch set all repose at defiance In the midst of this slumber of the soul my attention was attracted to a black speck peering above the western horizon just in the rear of Bergen steeple gradually it augments and overhangs the would be cities of Jersey Harsimus and Hoboken which like three jockeys are starting on the course of existence and jostling each other at the commencement of the race Now it skirts the long shore of ancient Pavonia spreading its wide shadows from the high settlements of Weehawk quite to the lazaretto and quarantine erected by the sagacity of our police for the embarrassment of commerce now it climbs the serene vault of heaven cloud rolling over cloud shrouding the orb of day darkening the vast expanse and bearing thunder and hail and tempest in its bosom The earth seems agitated at the confusion of the heavens the late waveless mirror is lashed into furious waves that roll in hollow murmurs to the shore the oyster boats that erst sported in the placid vicinity of Gibbet Island now hurry affrighted to the land the poplar writhes and twists and whistles in the blast torrents of drenching rain and sounding hail deluge the battery walks the gates are thronged by apprentices servant maids and little Frenchmen with pocket handkerchiefs over their hats scampering from the storm the late beauteous prospect presents one scene of anarchy and wild uproar as though old Chaos had resumed his reign and was hurling back into one vast turmoil the conflicting elements of Nature Whether I fled from the fury of the storm or remained bodly at my post as our gallant train band captains who march their soldiers through the rain without flinching are points which I leave to the conjecture of the reader It is possible he may be a little perplexed also to know the reason why I introduced this tremendous tempest to disturb the serenity of my work On this latter point I will gratuitously instruct his ignorance The panorama view of the battery was given to gratify the reader with a correct description of that celebrated place and the parts adjacent secondly the storm was played off partly to give a little bustle and life to this tranquil part of my work and to keep my drowsy readers from falling asleep and partly to serve as an overture to the tempestuous times which are about to assail the pacific province of Nieuw Nederlandts and which overhang the slumbrous administration of the renowned Wouter Van Twiller It is thus the experienced playwright puts all the fiddles the French horns the kettle drums and trumpets of his orchestra in requisition to usher in one of those horrible and brimstone uproars called melodrames and it is thus he discharges his thunder his lightning his rosin and saltpetre preparatory to the rising of a ghost or the murdering of a hero We will now proceed with our history Whatever may be advanced by philosophers to the contrary I am of opinion that as to nations the old maxim that honesty is the best policy is a sheer and ruinous mistake It might have answered well enough in the honest times when it was made but in these degenerate days if a nation pretends to rely merely upon the justice of its dealings it will fare something like the honest man who fell among thieves and found his honesty a poor protection against bad company Such at least was the case with the guileless government of the New Netherlands which like a worthy unsuspicious old burgher quietly settled itself down in the city of New Amsterdam as into a snug elbow chair and fell into a comfortable nap while in the meantime its cunning neighbors stepped in and picked his pockets In a word we may ascribe the commencement of all the woes of this great province and its magnificent metropolis to the tranquil security or to speak more accurately to the unfortunate honesty of its government But as I dislike to begin an important part of my history towards the end of a chapter and as my readers like myself must doubtless be exceedingly fatigued with the long walk we have taken and the tempest we have sustained I hold it meet we shut up the book smoke a pipe and having thus refreshed our spirits take a fair start in a new chapter CHAPTER VII That my readers may the more fully comprehend the extent of the calamity at this very moment impending over the honest unsuspecting province of Nieuw Nederlandts and its dubious governor it is necessary that I should give some account of a horde of strange barbarians bordering upon the eastern frontier Now so it came to pass that many years previous to the time of which we are treating the sage Cabinet of England had adopted a certain national creed a kind of public walk of faith or rather a religious turnpike in which every loyal subject was directed to travel to Zion taking care to pay the toll gatherers by the way Albeit a certain shrewd race of men being very much given to indulge their own opinions on all manner of subjects a propensity exceedingly offensive to your free governments of Europe did most presumptuously dare to think for themselves in matters of religion exercising what they considered a natural and unextinguishable right the liberty of conscience As however they possessed that ingenuous habit of mind which always thinks aloud which rides cock a hoop on the tongue and is for ever galloping into other people s ears it naturally followed that their liberty of conscience likewise implied liberty of speech which being freely indulged soon put the country in a hubbub and aroused the pious indignation of the vigilant fathers of the Church The usual methods were adopted to reclaim them which in those days were considered efficacious in bringing back stray sheep to the fold that is to say they were coaxed they were admonished they were menaced they were buffeted line upon line precept upon precept lash upon lash here a little and there a great deal were exhausted without mercy and without success until worthy pastors of the Church wearied out by their unparalleled stubbornness were driven in the excess of their tender mercy to adopt the Scripture text and literally to heap live embers on their heads Nothing however could subdue that independence of the tongue which has ever distinguished this singular race so that rather than subject that heroic member to further tyranny they one and all embarked for the wilderness of America to enjoy unmolested the inestimable right of talking And in fact no sooner did they land upon the shore of this free spoken country than they all lifted up their voices and made such a clamor of tongues that we are told they frightened every bird and beast out of the neighborhood and struck such mute terror into certain fish that they have been called dumb fish ever since This may appear marvelous but it is nevertheless true in proof of which I would observe that the dumb fish has ever since become an object of superstitious reverence and forms the Saturday s dinner of every true Yankee The simple aborigines of the land for a while contemplated these strange folk in utter astonishment but discovering that they wielded harmless though noisy weapons and were a lively ingenious good humored race of men they became very friendly and sociable and gave them the name of Yanokies which in the Mais Tchusaeg or Massachusett language signifies silent men a waggish appellation since shortened into the familiar epithet of Yankees which they retain unto the present day True it is and my fidelity as an historian will not allow me to pass over the fact that having served a regular apprenticeship in the school of persecution these ingenious people soon showed that they had become masters of the art The great majority were of one particular mode of thinking in matters of religion but to their great surprise and indignation they found that divers Papists Quakers and Anabaptists were springing up among them and all claiming to use the liberty of speech This was at once pronounced a daring abuse of the liberty of conscience which they now insisted was nothing more than the liberty to think as one pleased in matters of religion provided one thought right for otherwise it would be giving a latitude to damnable heresies Now as they the majority were convinced that they alone thought right it consequently followed that whoever thought different from them thought wrong and whoever thought wrong and obstinately persisted in not being convinced and converted was a flagrant violator of the inestimable liberty of conscience and a corrupt and infestious member of the body politic and deserved to be lopped off and cast into the fire The consequence of all which was a fiery persecution of divers sects and especially of Quakers Now I ll warrant there are hosts of my readers ready at once to lift up their hands and eyes with that virtuous indignation with which we contemplate the faults and errors of our neighbors and to exclaim at the preposterous idea of convincing the mind by tormenting the body and establishing the doctrine of charity and forbearance by intolerant persecution But in simple truth what are we doing at this very day and in this very enlightened nation but acting upon the very same principle in our political controversies Have we not within but a few years released ourselves from the shackles of a government which cruelly denied us the privilege of governing ourselves and using in full latitude that invaluable member the tongue and are we not at this very moment striving our best to tyrannize over the opinions tie up the tongues and ruin the fortunes of one another What are our great political societies but mere political inquisitions our pot house committees but little tribunals of denunciation our newspapers but mere whipping posts and pillories where unfortunate individuals are pelted with rotten eggs and our council of appointment but a grand auto da fe where culprits are annually sacrificed for their political heresies Where then is the difference in principle between our measures and those you are so ready to condemn among the people I am treating of There is none the difference is merely circumstantial Thus we denounce instead of banishing we libel instead of scourging we turn out of office instead of hanging and where they burnt an offender in proper person we either tar and feather or burn him in effigy this political persecution being somehow or other the grand palladium of our liberties and an incontrovertible proof that this is a free country But not withstanding the fervent zeal with which this holy war was prosecuted against the whole race of unbelievers we do not find that the population of this new colony was in anywise hindered thereby on the contrary they multiplied to a degree which would be incredible to any man unacquainted with the marvelous fecundity of this growing country This amazing increase may indeed be partly ascribed to a singular custom prevalent among them commonly known by the name of bundling a superstitious rite observed by the young people of both sexes with which they usually terminated their festivities and which was kept up with religious strictness by the more bigoted part of the community This ceremony was likewise in those primitive times considered as an indispensable preliminary to matrimony their courtships commencing where ours usually finish by which means they acquired that intimate acquaintance with each other s good qualities before marriage which has been pronounced by philosophers the sure basis of a happy union Thus early did this cunning and ingenious people display a shrewdness of making a bargain which has ever since distinguished them and a strict adherence to the good old vulgar maxim about buying a pig in a poke To this sagacious custom therefore do I chiefly attribute the unparalleled increase of the Yanokie or Yankee race for it is a certain fact well authenticated by court records and parish registers that wherever the practice of bundling prevailed there was an amazing number of sturdy brats annually born unto the state without the license of the law or the benefit of clergy Neither did the irregularity of their birth operate in the least to their disparagement On the contrary they grew up a long sided raw boned hardy race of whalers wood cutters fishermen and pedlars and strapping corn fed wenches who by their united efforts tended marvelously toward peopling those notable tracts of country called Nantucket Piscataway and Cape Cod CHAPTER VIII In the last chapter I have given a faithful and unprejudiced account of the origin of that singular race of people inhabiting the country eastward of the Nieuw Nederlandts but I have yet to mention certain peculiar habits which rendered them exceedingly annoying to our ever honored Dutch ancestors The most prominent of these was a certain rambling propensity with which like the sons of Ishmael they seem to have been gifted by Heaven and which continually goads them on to shift their residence from place to place so that a Yankee farmer is in a constant state of migration tarrying occasionally here and there clearing lands for other people to enjoy building houses for others to inhabit and in a manner may be considered the wandering Arab of America His first thought on coming to the years of manhood is to settle himself in the world which means nothing more nor less than to begin his rambles To this end he takes unto himself for a wife some buxom country heiress passing rich in red ribbons glass beads and mock tortoiseshell combs with a white gown and morocco shoes for Sunday and deeply skilled in the mystery of making apple sweetmeats long sauce and pumpkin pie Having thus provided himself like a pedlar with a heavy knapsack wherewith to regale his shoulders through the journey of life he literally sets out on the peregrination His whole family household furniture and farming utensils are hoisted into a covered cart his own and his wife s wardrobe packed up in a firkin which done he shoulders his axe takes his staff in hand whistles Yankee doodle and trudges off to the woods as confident of the protection of Providence and relying as cheerfully upon his own resources as did ever a patriarch of yore when he journeyed into a strange country of the Gentiles Having buried himself in the wilderness he builds himself a log hut clears away a corn field and potato patch and Providence smiling upon his labors is soon surrounded by a snug farm and some half a score of flaxen headed urchins who by their size seem to have sprung all at once out of the earth like a crop of toadstools But it is not the nature of this most indefatigable of speculators to rest contented with any state of sublunary enjoyment improvement is his darling passion and having thus improved his lands the next care is to provide a mansion worthy the residence of a landholder A huge palace of pine boards immediately springs up in the midst of the wilderness large enough for a parish church and furnished with windows of all dimensions but so rickety and flimsy withal that every blast gives it a fit of the ague By the time the outside of this mighty air castle is completed either the funds or the zeal of our adventurer are exhausted so that he barely manages to half finish one room within where the whole family burrow together while the rest of the house is devoted to the curing of pumpkins or storing of carrots and potatoes and is decorated with fanciful festoons of dried apples and peaches The outside remaining unpainted grows venerably black with time the family wardrobe is laid under contribution for old hats petticoats and breeches to stuff into the broken windows while the four winds of heaven keep up a whistling and howling about this aerial palace and play as many unruly gambols as they did of yore in the cave of old AEolius The humble log hut which whilom nestled this improving family snugly within its narrow but comfortable walls stands hard by in ignominious contrast degraded into a cow house or pig sty and the whole scene reminds one forcibly of a fable which I am surprised has never been recorded of an aspiring snail who abandoned his humble habitation which he had long filled with great respectability to crawl into the empty shell of a lobster where he would no doubt have resided with great style and splendor the envy and the hate of all the painstaking snails in the neighborhood had he not perished with cold in one corner of his stupendous mansion Being thus completely settled and to use his own words to rights one would imagine that he would begin to enjoy the comforts of his situation to read newspapers talk politics neglect his own business and attend to the affairs of the nation like a useful and patriotic citizen but now it is that his wayward disposition begins again to operate He soon grows tired of a spot where there is no longer any room for improvement sells his farm air castle petticoat windows and all reloads his cart shoulders his axe puts himself at the head of his family and wanders away in search of new lands again to fell trees again to clear corn fields again to build a shingle palace and again to sell off and wander Such were the people of Connecticut who bordered upon the eastern frontier of Nieuw Nederlandts and my readers may easily imagine what uncomfortable neighbors this light hearted but restless tribe must have been to our tranquil progenitors If they cannot I would ask them if they have ever known one of our regular well organized Dutch families whom it hath pleased Heaven to afflict with the neighborhood of a French boarding house The honest old burgher cannot take his afternoon s pipe on the bench before his door but he is persecuted with the scraping of fiddles the chattering of women and the squalling of children he cannot sleep at night for the horrible melodies of some amateur who chooses to serenade the moon and display his terrible proficiency in execution on the clarionet hautboy or some other soft toned instrument nor can he leave the street door open but his house is defiled by the unsavory visits of a troop of pug dogs who even sometimes carry their loathsome ravages into the sanctum sanctorum the parlor If my readers have ever witnessed the sufferings of such a family so situated they may form some idea how our worthy ancestors were distressed by their mercurial neighbors of Connecticut Gangs of these marauders we are told penetrated into the New Netherland settlements and threw whole villages into consternation by their unparalleled volubility and their intolerable inquisitiveness two evil habits hitherto unknown in those parts or only known to be abhorred for our ancestors were noted as being men of truly Spartan taciturnity and who neither knew nor cared aught about anybody s concerns but their own Many enormities were committed on the highways where several unoffending burghers were brought to a stand and tortured with questions and guesses which outrages occasioned as much vexation and heart burning as does the modern right of search on the high seas Great jealousy did they likewise stir up by their intermeddling and successes among the divine sex for being a race of brisk likely pleasant tongued varlets they soon seduced the light affections of the simple damsels from their ponderous Dutch gallants Among other hideous customs they attempted to introduce among them that bundling which the Dutch lasses of the Nederlandts with that eager passion for novelty and foreign fashions natural to their sex seemed very well inclined to follow but that their mothers being more experienced in the world and better acquainted with men and things strenuously discountenanced all such outlandish innovations But what chiefly operated to embroil our ancestors with these strange folk was an unwarrantable liberty which they occasionally took of entering in hordes into the territories of the New Netherlands and settling themselves down without leave or license to improve the land in the manner I have before noticed This unceremonious mode of taking possession of new land was technically termed squatting and hence is derived the appellation of squatters a name odious in the ears of all great landholders and which is given to those enterprising worthies who seize upon land first and take their chance to make good their title to it afterward All these grievances and many others which were constantly accumulating tended to form that dark and portentious cloud which as I observed in a former chapter was slowly gathering over the tranquil province of New Netherlands The pacific cabinet of Van Twiller however as will be perceived in the sequel bore them all with a magnanimity that redounds to their immortal credit becoming by passive endurance inured to this increasing mass of wrongs like that mighty man of old who by dint of carrying about a calf from the time it was born continued to carry it without difficulty when he had grown to be an ox CHAPTER IX By this time my readers must fully perceive what an arduous task I have undertaken exploring a little kind of Herculaneum of history which had lain nearly for ages buried under the rubbish of years and almost totally forgotten raking up the limbs and fragments of disjointed facts and endeavoring to put them scrupulously together so as to restore them to their original form and connection now lugging forth the character of an almost forgotten hero like a mutilated statue now deciphering a half defaced inscription and now lighting upon a mouldering manuscript which after painful study scarce repays the trouble of perusal In such cases how much has the reader to depend upon the honor and probity of his author lest like a cunning antiquarian he either impose upon him some spurious fabrication of his own for a precious relic from antiquity or else dress up the dismembered fragment with such false trappings that it is scarcely possible to distinguish the truth from the fiction with which it is enveloped This is a grievance which I have more than once had to lament in the course of my wearisome researches among the works of my fellow historians who have strangely disguised and distorted the facts respecting this country and particularly respecting the great province of New Netherlands as will be perceived by any who will take the trouble to compare their romantic effusions tricked out in the meretricious gauds of fable with this authentic history I have had more vexations of the kind to encounter in those parts of my history which treat of the transactions on the eastern border than in any other in consequence of the troops of historians who have infested those quarters and have shown the honest people of Nieuw Nederlands no mercy in their works Among the rest mister Benjamin Trumbull arrogantly declares that the Dutch were always mere intruders Now to this I shall make no other reply than to proceed in the steady narration of my history which will contain not only proofs that the Dutch had clear title and possession in the fair valleys of the Connecticut and that they were wrongfully dispossessed thereof but likewise that they have been scandalously maltreated ever since by the misrepresentations of the crafty historians of New England And in this I shall be guided by a spirit of truth and impartiality and a regard to immortal fame for I would not wittingly dishonor my work by a single falsehood misrepresentation or prejudice though it should gain our forefathers the whole country of New England I have already noticed in a former chapter of my history that the territories of the Nieuw Nederlandts extended on the east quite to the Varsche or Fresh or Connecticut River Here at an early period had been established a frontier post on the bank of the river and called Fort Goed Hoop not far from the site of the present fair city of Hartford It was placed under the command of Jacobus Van Curlet or Curlis as some historians will have it a doughty soldier of that stomachful class famous for eating all they kill He was long in the body and short in the limb as though a tall man s body had been mounted on a little man s legs He made up for this turnspit construction by striding to such an extent that you would have sworn he had on the seven leagued boots of Jack the Giant Killer and so high did he tread on parade that his soldiers were sometimes alarmed lest he should trample himself under foot But not withstanding the erection of this fort and the appointment of this ugly little man of war as commander the Yankees continued the interlopings hinted at in my last chapter and at length had the audacity to squat themselves down within the jurisdiction of Fort Goed Hoop The long bodied Van Curlet protested with great spirit against these unwarrantable encroachments couching his protest in Low Dutch by way of inspiring more terror and forthwith dispatched a copy of the protest to the governor at New Amsterdam together with a long and bitter account of the aggressions of the enemy This done he ordered his men one and all to be of good cheer shut the gate of the fort smoked three pipes went to bed and awaited the result with a resolute and intrepid tranquillity that greatly animated his adherents and no doubt struck sore dismay and affright into the hearts of the enemy Now it came to pass that about this time the renowned Wouter Van Twiller full of years and honors and council dinners had reached the period of life and faculty which according to the great Gulliver entitles a man to admission into the ancient order of Struldbruggs He employed his time in smoking his Turkish pipe amid an assemblage of sages equally enlightened and nearly as venerable as himself and who for their silence their gravity their wisdom and their cautious averseness to coming to any conclusion in business are only to be equalled by certain profound corporations which I have known in my time Upon reading the protest of the gallant Jacobus Van Curlet therefore His Excellency fell straightway into one of the deepest doubts that ever he was known to encounter his capacious head gradually drooped on his chest he closed his eyes and inclined his ear to one side as if listening with great attention to the discussion that was going on in his belly and which all who knew him declared to be the huge courthouse or council chamber of his thoughts forming to his head what the House of Representatives does to the Senate An inarticulate sound very much resembling a snore occasionally escaped him but the nature of this internal cogitation was never known as he never opened his lips on the subject to man woman or child In the meantime the protect of Van Curlet lay quietly on the table where it served to light the pipes of the venerable sages assembled in council and in the great smoke which they raised the gallant Jacobus his protest and his mighty fort Goed Hoop were soon as completely beclouded and forgotten as is a question of emergency swallowed up in the speeches and resolutions of a modern session of Congress There are certain emergencies when your profound legislators and sage deliberative councils are mightily in the way of a nation and when an ounce of hair brained decision is worth a pound of sage doubt and cautious discussion Such at least was the case at present for while the renowned Wouter Van Twiller was daily battling with his doubts and his resolution growing weaker and weaker in the contest the enemy pushed farther and farther into his territories and assumed a most formidable appearance in the neighborhood of the Fort Goed Hoop Here they founded the mighty town of Pyquag or as it has since been called Weathersfield a place which if we may credit the assertions of that worthy historian John Josselyn gent hath been infamous by reason of the witches therein And so daring did these men of Pyquag become that they extended those plantations of onions for which their town is illustrious under the very noses of the garrison of Fort Goed Hoop insomuch that the honest Dutchmen could not look toward that quarter without tears in their eyes This crying injustice was regarded with proper indignation by the gallant Jacobus Van Curlet He absolutely trembled with the violence of this choler and the exacerbations of his valor which were the more turbulent in their workings from the length of the body in which they were agitated He forthwith proceeded to strengthen his redoubts heighten his breastworks deepen his fosse and fortify his position with a double row of abattis after which he dispatched a fresh courier with accounts of his perilous situation The courier chosen to bear the dispatches was a fat oily little man as being less liable to be worn out or to lose leather on the journey and to insure his speed he was mounted on the fleetest wagon horse in the garrison remarkable for length of limb largeness of bone and hardness of trot and so tall that the little messenger was obliged to climb on his back by means of his tail and crupper Such extraordinary speed did he make that he arrived at Fort Amsterdam in a little less than a month though the distance was full two hundred pipes or about one hundred and twenty miles With an appearance of great hurry and business and smoking a short traveling pipe he proceeded on a long swing trot through the muddy lanes of the metropolis demolishing whole batches of dirt pies which the little Dutch children were making in the road and for which kind of pastry the children of this city have ever been famous On arriving at the governor s house he climbed down from his steed roused the gray headed doorkeeper old Skaats who like his lineal descendant and faithful representative the venerable crier of our court was nodding at his post rattled at the door of the council chamber and startled the members as they were dozing over a plan for establishing a public market At that very moment a gentle grunt or rather a deep drawn snore was heard from the chair of the governor a whiff of smoke was at the same instant observed to escape from his lips and a light cloud to ascend from the bowl of his pipe The council of course supposed him engaged in deep sleep for the good of the community and according to custom in all such cases established every man bawled out Silence when of a sudden the door flew open and the little courier straddled into the apartment cased to the middle in a pair of Hessian boots which he had got into for the sake of expedition In his right hand he held forth the ominous dispatches and with his left he grasped firmly the waistband of his galligaskins which had unfortunately given way in the exertion of descending from his horse He stumped resolutely up to the governor and with more hurry than perspicuity delivered his message But fortunately his ill tidings came too late to ruffle the tranquillity of this most tranquil of rulers His venerable Excellency had just breathed and smoked his last his lungs and his pipe having been exhausted together and his peaceful soul having escaped in the last whiff that curled from his tobacco pipe In a word the renowned Walter the Doubter who had so often slumbered with his contemporaries now slept with his fathers and Wilhelmus Kieft governed in his stead BOOK IV CONTAINING THE CHRONICLES OF THE REIGN OF WILLIAM THE TESTY CHAPTER I When the lofty Thucydides is about to enter upon his description of the plague that desolated Athens one of his modern commentators assures the reader that the history is now going to be exceedingly solemn serious and pathetic and hints with that air of chuckling gratulation with which a good dame draws forth a choice morsel from a cupboard to regale a favorite that this plague will give his history a most agreeable variety In like manner did my heart leap within me when I came to the dolorous dilemma of Fort Good Hope which I at once perceived to be the forerunner of a series of great events and entertaining disasters Such are the true subjects for the historic pen For what is history in fact but a kind of Newgate Calendar a register of the crimes and miseries that man has inflicted on his fellow men It is a huge libel on human nature to which we industriously add page after page volume after volume as if we were building up a monument to the honor rather than the infamy of our species If we turn over the pages of these chronicles that man has written of himself what are the characters dignified by the appellation of great and held up to the admiration of posterity Tyrants robbers conquerors renowned only for the magnitude of their misdeeds and the stupendous wrongs and miseries they have inflicted on mankind warriors who have hired themselves to the trade of blood not from motives of virtuous patriotism or to protect the injured and defenseless but merely to gain the vaunted glory of being adroit and successful in massacring their fellow beings What are the great events that constitute a glorious era The fall of empires the desolation of happy countries splendid cities smoking in their ruins the proudest works of art tumbled in the dust the shrieks and groans of whole nations ascending unto heaven It is thus the historians may be said to thrive on the miseries of mankind like birds of prey which hover over the field of battle to fatten on the mighty dead It was observed by a great projector of inland lock navigation that rivers lakes and oceans were only formed to feed canals In like manner I am tempted to believe that plots conspiracies wars victories and massacres are ordained by Providence only as food for the historian It is a source of great delight to the philosophers in studying the wonderful economy of nature to trace the mutual dependencies of things how they are created reciprocally for each other and how the most noxious and apparently unnecessary animal has its uses Thus those swarms of flies which are so often execrated as useless vermin are created for the sustenance of spiders and spiders on the other hand are evidently made to devour flies So those heroes who have been such scourges to the world were bounteously provided as themes for the poet and historian while the poet and the historian were destined to record the achievements of heroes These and many similar reflections naturally arose in my mind as I took up my pen to commence the reign of William Kieft for now the stream of our history which hitherto has rolled in a tranquil current is about to depart for ever from its peaceful haunts and brawl through many a turbulent and rugged scene As some sleek ox sunk in the rich repose of a clover field dozing and chewing the cud will bear repeated blows before it raises itself so the province of Nieuw Nederlandts having waxed fat under the drowsy reign of the Doubter needed cuffs and kicks to rouse it into action The reader will now witness the manner in which a peaceful community advances towards a state of war which is apt to be like the approach of a horse to a drum with much prancing and little progress and too often with the wrong end foremost Wilhelmus Kieft who in sixteen thirty four ascended the gubernatorial chair to borrow a favorite though clumsy appellation of modern phraseologists was of a lofty descent his father being inspector of windmills in the ancient town of Saardam and our hero we are told when a boy made very curious investigations into the nature and operation of these machines which was one reason why he afterwards came to be so ingenious a governor His name according to the most authentic etymologists was a corruption of Kyver that is to say a wrangler or scolder and expressed the characteristic of his family which for nearly two centuries had kept the windy town of Saardam in hot water and produced more tartars and brimstones than any ten families in the place and so truly did he inherit this family peculiarity that he had not been a year in the government of the province before he was universally denominated William the Testy His appearance answered to his name He was a brisk wiry waspish little old gentleman such a one as may now and then be seen stumping about our city in a broad skirted coat with huge buttons a cocked hat stuck on the back of his head and a cane as high as his chin His face was broad but his features were sharp his cheeks were scorched into a dusky red by two fiery little gray eyes his nose turned up and the corners of his mouth turned down pretty much like the muzzle of an irritable pug dog I have heard it observed by a profound adept in human physiology that if a woman waxes fat with the progress of years her tenure of life is somewhat precarious but if haply she withers as she grows old she lives for ever Such promised to be the case with William the Testy who grew tough in proportion as he dried He had withered in fact not through the process of years but through the tropical fervor of his soul which burnt like a vehement rushlight in his bosom inciting him to incessant broils and bickerings Ancient traditions speak much of his learning and of the gallant inroads he had made into the dead languages in which he had made captive a host of Greek nouns and Latin verbs and brought off rich booty in ancient saws and apophthegms which he was wont to parade in his public harangues as a triumphant general of yore his spolia opima Of metaphysics he knew enough to confound all hearers and himself into the bargain In logic he knew the whole family of syllogisms and dilemmas and was so proud of his skill that he never suffered even a self evident fact to pass unargued It was observed however that he seldom got into an argument without getting into a perplexity and then into a passion with his adversary for not being convinced gratis He had moreover skirmished smartly on the frontiers of several of the sciences was fond of experimental philosophy and prided himself upon inventions of all kinds His abode which he had fixed at a bowery or country seat at a short distance from the city just at what is now called Dutch Street soon abounded with proofs of his ingenuity patent smoke jacks that required a horse to work them Dutch ovens that roasted meat without fire carts that went before the horses weathercocks that turned against the wind and other wrong headed contrivances that astonished and confounded all beholders The house too was beset with paralytic cats and dogs the subjects of his experimental philosophy and the yelling and yelping of the latter unhappy victims of science while aiding in the pursuit of knowledge soon gained for the place the name of Dog s Misery by which it continues to be known even at the present day It is in knowledge as in swimming he who flounders and splashes on the surface makes more noise and attracts more attention than the pearl diver who quietly dives in quest of treasures to the bottom The vast acquirements of the new governor were the theme of marvel among the simple burghers of New Amsterdam he figured about the place as learned a man as a Bonze at Pekin who has mastered one half of the Chinese alphabet and was unanimously pronounced a universal genius I have known in my time many a genius of this stamp but to speak my mind freely I never knew one who for the ordinary purposes of life was worth his weight in straw In this respect a little sound judgment and plain common sense is worth all the sparkling genius that ever wrote poetry or invented theories Let us see how the universal acquirements of William the Testy aided him in the affairs of government CHAPTER II No sooner had this bustling little potentate been blown by a whiff of fortune into the seat of government than he called his council together to make them a speech on the state of affairs Caius Gracchus it is said when he harangued the Roman populace modulated his tone by an oratorical flute or pitch pipe Wilhelmus Kieft not having such an instrument at hand availed himself of that musical organ or trump which nature has implanted in the midst of a man s face in other words he preluded his address by a sonorous blast of the nose a preliminary flourish much in vogue among public orators He then commenced by expressing his humble sense of his utter unworthiness of the high post to which he had been appointed which made some of the simple burghers wonder why he undertook it not knowing that it is a point of etiquette with a public orator never to enter upon office without declaring himself unworthy to cross the threshold He then proceeded in a manner highly classic and erudite to speak of government generally and of the governments of ancient Greece in particular together with the wars of Rome and Carthage and the rise and fall of sundry outlandish empires which the worthy burghers had never read nor heard of Having thus after the manner of your learned orators treated of things in general he came by a natural roundabout transition to the matter in hand namely the daring aggressions of the Yankees As my readers are well aware of the advantage a potentate has of handling his enemies as he pleases in his speeches and bulletins where he has the talk all on his own side they may rest assured that William the Testy did not let such an opportunity escape of giving the Yankees what is called a taste of his quality In speaking of their inroads into the territories of their High Mightinesses he compared them to the Gauls who desolated Rome the Goths and Vandals who overran the fairest plains of Europe but when he came to speak of the unparalleled audacity with which they at Weathersfield had advanced their patches up to the very walls of Fort Goed Hoop and threatened to smother the garrison in onions tears of rage started into his eyes as though he nosed the very offence in question Having thus wrought up his tale to a climax he assumed a most belligerent look and assured the council that he had devised an instrument potent in its effects and which he trusted would soon drive the Yankees from the land So saying he thrust his hand into one of the deep pockets of his broad skirted coat and drew forth not an infernal machine but an instrument in writing which he laid with great emphasis upon the table The burghers gazed at it for a time in silent awe as a wary housewife does at a gun fearful it may go off half cocked The document in question had a sinister look it is true it was crabbed in text and from a broad red ribbon dangled the great seal of the province about the size of a buckwheat pancake Herein however existed the wonder of the invention The document in question was a proclamation ordering the Yankees to depart instantly from the territories of their High Mightinesses under pain of suffering all the forfeitures and punishments in such case made and provided It was on the moral effect of this formidable instrument that Wilhelmus Kieft calculated pledging his valor as a governor that once fulminated against the Yankees it would in less than two months drive every mother s son of them across the borders The council broke up in perfect wonder and nothing was talked of for some time among the old men and women of New Amsterdam but the vast genius of the governor and his new and cheap mode of fighting by proclamation As to Wilhelmus Kieft having dispatched his proclamation to the frontiers he put on his cocked hat and corduroy small clothes and mounting a tall raw boned charger trotted out to his rural retreat of Dog s Misery Here like the good Numa he reposed from the toils of state taking lessons in government not from the nymph Egeria but from the honored wife of his bosom who was one of that class of females sent upon the earth a little after the flood as a punishment for the sins of mankind and commonly known by the appellation of knowing women In fact my duty as an historian obliges me to make known a circumstance which was a great secret at the time and consequently was not a subject of scandal at more than half the tea tables in New Amsterdam but which like many other great secrets has leaked out in the lapse of years and this was that Wilhelmus the Testy though one of the most potent little men that ever breathed yet submitted at home to a species of government neither laid down in Aristotle or Plato in short it partook of the nature of a pure unmixed tyranny and is familiarly denominated petticoat government An absolute sway which although exceedingly common in these modern days was very rare among the ancients if we may judge from the rout made about the domestic economy of honest Socrates which is the only ancient case on record The great Kieft however warded off all the sneers and sarcasms of his particular friends who are ever ready to joke with a man on sore points of the kind by alleging that it was a government of his own election to which he submitted through choice adding at the same time a profound maxim which he had found in an ancient author that he who would aspire to govern should first learn to obey CHAPTER III Never was a more comprehensive a more expeditious or what is still better a more economical measure devised than this of defeating the Yankees by proclamation an expedient likewise so gentle and humane there were ten chances to one in favor of its succeeding but then there was one chance to ten that it would not succeed As the ill natured Fates would have it that single chance carried the day The proclamation was perfect in all its parts well constructed well written well sealed and well published all that was wanting to insure its effect was that the Yankees should stand in awe of it but provoking to relate they treated it with the most absolute contempt applied it to an unseemly purpose and thus did the first warlike proclamation come to a shameful end a fate which I am credibly informed has befallen but too many of its successors So far from abandoning the country those varlets continued their encroachments squatting along the green banks of the Varsche river and founding Hartford Stamford New Haven and other border towns I have already shown how the onion patches of Pyquag were an eyesore to Jacobus Van Curlet and his garrison but now these moss troopers increased in their atrocities kidnaping hogs impounding horses and sometimes grievously rib roasting their owners Our worthy forefathers could scarcely stir abroad without danger of being outjockeyed in horseflesh or taken in in bargaining while in their absence some daring Yankee pedlar would penetrate to their household and nearly ruin the good housewives with tinware and wooden bowls thirty four I am well aware of the perils which environ me in this part of my history While raking with curious hand but pious heart among the mouldering remains of former days anxious to draw therefrom the honey of wisdom I may fare somewhat like that valiant worthy Samson who in meddling with the carcase of a dead lion drew a swarm of bees about his ears Thus while narrating the many misdeeds of the Yanokie or Yankee race it is ten chances to one but I offend the morbid sensibilities of certain of their unreasonable descendants who may fly out and raise such a buzzing about this unlucky head of mine that I shall need the tough hide of an Achilles or an Orlando Furioso to protect me from their stings Should such be the case I should deeply and sincerely lament not my misfortune in giving offence but the wrong headed perverseness of an ill natured generation in taking offence at anything I say That their ancestors did use my ancestors ill is true and I am very sorry for it I would with all my heart the fact were otherwise but as I am recording the sacred events of history I d not bate one nail s breadth of the honest truth though I were sure the whole edition of my work would be bought up and burnt by the common hangman of Connecticut And in sooth now that these testy gentlemen have drawn me out I will make bold to go farther and observe that this is one of the grand purposes for which we impartial historians are sent into the world to redress wrongs and render justice on the heads of the guilty So that though a powerful nation may wrong its neighbors with temporary impunity yet sooner or later an historian springs up who wreaks ample chastisement on it in return Thus these moss troopers of the east little thought I ll warrant it while they were harassing the inoffensive province of Nieuw Nederlandts and driving its unhappy governor to his wits end that an historian would ever arise and give them their own with interest Since then I am but performing my bounden duty as a historian in avenging the wrongs of our reverend ancestors I shall make no further apology and indeed when it is considered that I have all these ancient borderers of the east in my power and at the mercy of my pen I trust that it will be admitted I conduct myself with great humanity and moderation It was long before William the Testy could be persuaded that his much vaunted war measure was ineffectual on the contrary he flew in a passion whenever it was doubted swearing that though slow in operating yet when it once began to work it would soon purge the land of those invaders When convinced at length of the truth like a shrewd physician he attributed the failure to the quantity not the quality of the medicine and resolved to double the dose He fulminated therefore a second proclamation more vehement than the first forbidding all intercourse with these Yankee intruders ordering the Dutch burghers on the frontiers to buy none of their pacing horses measly pork apple sweetmeats Weathersfield onions or wooden bowls and to furnish them with no supplies of gin gingerbread or sourkrout Another interval elapsed during which the last proclamation was as little regarded as the first and the non intercourse was especially set at nought by the young folks of both sexes At length one day inhabitants of New Amsterdam were aroused by a furious barking of dogs great and small and beheld to their surprise the whole garrison of Fort Good Hope straggling into town all tattered and way worn with Jacobus Van Curlet at their head bringing the melancholy intelligence of the capture of Fort Good Hope by the Yankees The fate of this important fortress is an impressive warning to all military commanders It was neither carried by storm nor famine nor was it undermined nor bombarded nor set on fire by red hot shot but was taken by a stratagem no less singular than effectual and which can never fail of success whenever an opportunity occurs of putting it in practice It seems that the Yankees had received intelligence that the garrison of Jacobus Van Curlet had been reduced nearly one eighth by the death of two of his most corpulent soldiers who had over eaten themselves on fat salmon caught in the Varsche river A secret expedition was immediately set on foot to surprise the fortress The crafty enemy knowing the habits of the garrison to sleep soundly after they had eaten their dinners and smoked their pipes stole upon them at the noonstide of a sultry summer s day and surprised them in the midst of their slumbers In an instant the flag of their High Mightinesses was lowered and the Yankee standard elevated in its stead being a dried codfish by way of a spread eagle A strong garrison was appointed of long sided hard fisted Yankees with Weathersfield onions for cockades and feathers As to Jacobus Van Curlet and his men they were seized by the nape of the neck conducted to the gate and one by one dismissed with a kick in the crupper as Charles XII dismissed the heavy bottomed Russians at the battle of Narva Jacobus Van Curlet receiving two kicks in consideration of his official dignity FOOTNOTES thirty four The following cases in point appear in Hazard s Collection of State Papers In the meantime they of Hartford have not onely usurped and taken in the lands of Connecticott although uprighteously and against the lawes of nations but have hindered our nation in sowing theire own purchased broken up lands but have also sowed them with corne in the night which the Nederlanders had broken up and intended to sowe and have beaten the servants of the high and mighty the honored companie which were labouring upon theire masters lands from theire lands with sticks and plow staves in hostile manner laming and among the rest struck Ever Duckings Evert Duyckink a hole in his head with a stick so that the bloode ran downe very strongly downe upon his body Those of Hartford sold a hogg that belonged to the honored companie under pretence that it had eaten of theire grounde grass when they had not any foot of inheritance They proffered the hogg for fives if the commissioners would have given fives for damage which the commissioners denied because noe man s own hogg as men used to say can trespass upon his owne master s grounde CHAPTER IV Language cannot express the awful ire of William the Testy on hearing of the catastrophe at Fort Goed Hoop For three good hours his rage was too great for words or rather the words were too great for him being a very small man and he was nearly choked by the misshapen nine cornered Dutch oaths and epithets which crowded at one into his gullet At length his words found vent and for three days he kept up a constant discharge anathematising the Yankees man woman and child for a set of dieven schobbejacken deugenieten twist zoekeren blaes kaken loosen schalken kakken bedden and a thousand other names of which unfortunately for posterity history does not make mention Finally he swore that he would have nothing more to do with such a squatting bundling guessing questioning swapping pumpkin eating molasses daubing shingle splitting cider watering horse jockeying notion peddling crew that they might stay at Fort Goed Hoop and rot before he would dirty his hands by attempting to drive them away in proof of which he ordered the new raised troops to be marched forthwith into winter quarters although it was not as yet quite midsummer Great despondency now fell upon the city of New Amsterdam It was feared that the conquerors of Fort Goed Hoop flushed with victory and apple brandy might march on to the capital take it by storm and annex the whole province to Connecticut The name of Yankee became as terrible among the Nieuw Nederlanders as was that of Gaul among the ancient Romans insomuch that the good wives of the Manhattoes used it as a bugbear wherewith to frighten their unruly children Everybody clamored round the governor imploring him to put the city in a complete posture of defence and he listened to their clamors Nobody could accuse William the Testy of being idle in time of danger or at any other time He was never idle but then he was often busy to very little purpose When a youngling he had been impressed with the words of Solomon Go to the ant thou sluggard observe her ways and be wise in conformity to which he had ever been of a restless ant like turn hurrying hither and thither nobody knew why or wherefore busying himself about small matters with an air of great importance and anxiety and toiling at a grain of mustard seed in the full conviction that he was moving a mountain In the present instance he called in all his inventive powers to his aid and was continually pondering over plans making diagrams and worrying about with a troop of workmen and projectors at his heels At length after a world of consultation and contrivance his plans of defence ended in rearing a great flag staff in the center of the fort and perching a windmill on each bastion These warlike preparations in some measure allayed the public alarm especially after an additional means of securing the safety of the city had been suggested by the governor s lady It has already been hinted in this most authentic history that in the domestic establishment of William the Testy the grey mare was the better horse in other words that his wife ruled the roast and in governing the governor governed the province which might thus be said to be under petticoat government Now it came to pass that this time there lived in the Manhattoes a jolly robustious trumpeter named Anthony Van Corlear famous for his long wind and who as the story goes could twang so potently upon his instrument that the effect upon all within hearing was like that ascribed to the Scotch bagpipe when it sings right lustily i the nose This sounder of brass was moreover a lusty bachelor with a pleasant burly visage a long nose and huge whiskers He had his little bowery or retreat in the country where he led a roystering life giving dances to the wives and daughters of the burghers of the Manhattoes insomuch that he became a prodigious favorite with all the women young and old He is said to have been the first to collect that famous toll levied on the fair sex at Kissing Bridge on the highway to Hell gate thirty five To this sturdy bachelor the eyes of all the women were turned in this time of darkness and peril as the very man to second and carry out the plans of defence of the governor A kind of petticoat council was forthwith held at the government house at which the governor s lady presided and this lady as has been hinted being all potent with the governor the result of these councils was the elevation of Anthony the Trumpeter to the post of commandant of windmills and champion of New Amsterdam The city being thus fortified and garrisoned it would have done one s heart good to see the governor snapping his fingers and fidgeting with delight as the trumpeter strutted up and down the ramparts twanging defiance to the whole Yankee race as does a modern editor to all the principalities and powers on the other side of the Atlantic In the hands of Anthony Van Corlear this windy instrument appeared to him as potent as the horn of the paladin Astolpho or even the more classic horn of Alecto nay he had almost the temerity to compare it with the rams horns celebrated in Holy Writ at the very sound of which the walls of Jericho fell down Be all this as it may the apprehensions of hostilities from the east gradually died away The Yankees made no further invasion nay they declared they had only taken possession of Fort Goed Hoop as being erected within their territories So far from manifesting hostility they continued to throng to New Amsterdam with the most innocent countenances imaginable filling the market with their notions being as ready to trade with the Netherlands as ever and not a whit more prone to get to the windward of them in a bargain The old wives of the Manhattoes who took tea with the governor s lady attributed all this affected moderation to the awe inspired by the military preparations of the governor and the windy prowess of Anthony the Trumpeter There were not wanting illiberal minds however who sneered at the governor for thinking to defend his city as he governed it by mere wind but William Kieft was not to be jeered out of his windmills he had seen them perched upon the ramparts of his native city of Saardam and was persuaded they were connected with the great science of defence nay so much piqued was he by having them made a matter of ridicule that he introduced them into the arms of the city where they remain to this day quartered with the ancient beaver of the Manhattoes an emblem and memento of his policy I must not omit to mention that certain wise old burghers of the Manhattoes skilful in expounding signs and mysteries after events have come to pass consider this early intrusion of the windmill into the escutcheon of our city which before had been wholly occupied by the beaver as portentous of its after fortune when the quiet Dutchman would be elbowed aside by the enterprising Yankee and patient industry overtopped by windy speculation FOOTNOTES thirty five The bridge here mentioned by mister Knickerbocker still exists but it is said that the toll is seldom collected nowadays excepting on sleighing parties by the descendants of the patriarchs who still preserve the traditions of the city CHAPTER V Among the wrecks and fragments of exalted wisdom which have floated down the stream of time from venerable antiquity and been picked up by those humble but industrious wights who ply along the shores of literature we find a shrewd ordinance of Charondas the Locrian legislator Anxious to preserve the judicial code of the state from the additions and amendments of country members and seekers of popularity he ordained that whoever proposed a new law should do it with a halter about his neck whereby in case his proposition were rejected they just hung him up and there the matter ended The effect was that for more than two hundred years there was but one trifling alteration in the judicial code and legal matters were so clear and simple that the whole race of lawyers starved to death for want of employment The Locrians too being freed from all incitement to litigation lived very lovingly together and were so happy a people that they make scarce any figure in history it being only your litigatous quarrelsome rantipole nations who make much noise in the world I have been reminded of these historical facts in coming to treat of the internal policy of William the Testy Well would it have been for him had he in the course of his universal acquirements stumbled upon the precaution of the good Charondas or had he looked nearer home at the protectorate of Oloffe the Dreamer when the community was governed without laws Such legislation however was not suited to the busy meddling mind of William the Testy On the contrary he conceived that the true wisdom of legislation consisted in the multiplicity of laws He accordingly had great punishments for great crimes and little punishments for little offences By degrees the whole surface of society was cut up by ditches and fences and quickset hedges of the law and even the sequestered paths of private life so beset by petty rules and ordinances too numerous to be remembered that one could scarce walk at large without the risk of letting off a spring gun or falling into a man trap In a little while the blessings of innumerable laws became apparent a class of men arose to expound and confound them Petty courts were instituted to take cognizance of petty offences pettifoggers began to abound and the community was soon set together by the ears Let me not be thought as intending anything derogatory to the profession of the law or to the distinguished members of that illustrious order Well am I aware that we have in this ancient city innumerable worthy gentlemen the knights errant of modern days who go about redressing wrongs and defending the defenceless not for the love of filthy lucre nor the selfish cravings of renown but merely for the pleasure of doing good Sooner would I throw this trusty pen into the flames and cork up my ink bottle for ever than infringe even for a nail s breadth upon the dignity of these truly benevolent champions of the distressed On the contrary I allude merely to those caitiff scouts who in these latter days of evil infest the skirts of the profession as did the recreant Cornish knights of yore the honorable order of chivalry who under its auspices commit flagrant wrongs who thrive by quibbles by quirks and chicanery and like vermin increase the corruption in which they are engendered Nothing so soon awakens the malevolent passions as the facility of gratification The courts of law would never be so crowded with petty vexatious and disgraceful suits were it not for the herds of pettifoggers These tamper with the passions of the poorer and more ignorant classes who as if poverty were not a sufficient misery in itself are ever ready to embitter it by litigation These like quacks in medicine excite the malady to profit by the cure and retard the cure to augment the fees As the quack exhausts the constitution the pettifogger exhausts the purse and as he who has once been under the hands of a quack is for ever after prone to dabble in drugs and poison himself with infallible prescriptions so the client of the pettifogger is ever after prone to embroil himself with his neighbors and impoverish himself with successful lawsuits My readers will excuse this digression into which I have been unwarily betrayed but I could not avoid giving a cool and unprejudiced account of an abomination too prevalent in this excellent city and with the effects of which I am ruefully acquainted having been nearly ruined by a lawsuit which was decided against me and my ruin having been completed by another which was decided in my favor To return to our theme There was nothing in the whole range of moral offences against which the jurisprudence of William the Testy was more strenuously directed than the crying sin of poverty He pronounced it the root of all evil and determined to cut it up root and branch and extirpate it from the land He had been struck in the course of his travels in the old countries of Europe with the wisdom of those notices posted up in country towns that any vagrant found begging there would be put in the stocks and he had observed that no beggars were to be seen in these neighborhoods having doubtless thrown off their rags and their poverty and become rich under the terror of the law He determined to improve upon this hint In a little while a new machine of his own invention was erected hard by Dog s Misery This was nothing more nor less than a gibbet of a very strange uncouth and unmatchable construction far more efficacious as he boasted than the stocks for the punishment of poverty It was for altitude not a whit inferior to that of Haman so renowned in Bible history but the marvel of the contrivance was that the culprit instead of being suspended by the neck according to venerable custom was hoisted by the waistband and kept dangling and sprawling between heaven and earth for an hour or two at a time to the infinite entertainment and edification of the respectable citizens who usually attend exhibitions of the kind Such was the punishment of all petty delinquents vagrants and beggars and others detected in being guilty of poverty in a small way As to those who had offended on a great scale who had been guilty of flagrant misfortunes and enormous backslidings of the purse and who stood convicted of large debts which they were unable to pay William Kieft had them straightway enclosed within the stone walls of a prison there to remain until they should reform and grow rich This notable expedient however does not appear to have been more efficacious under William the Testy than in more modern days it being found that the longer a poor devil was kept in prison the poorer he grew END OF VOLUME I KNICKERBOCKER S HISTORY OF NEW YORK VOLUME II INTRODUCTION The playful devices by which attention was directed to the coming publication of the History of Diedrich Knickerbocker are represented in the author s opening to the first volume Irving joined afterward in business as a sleeping partner visited England in eighteen fifteen and while cordially welcomed here by Thomas Campbell Walter Scott and others the failure of his brother s business obliged him to make writing his profession The publishers at first refused to take one of the most charming of his works the Sketch Book but John Murray yielded at last to the influence of Walter Scott and paid Ltwo hundred for the copyright of it a sum afterward increased to Lfour hundred Bracebridge Hall and the Tales of a Traveler followed Irving went to Spain with the American Ambassador to translate documents and acquire experience which he used afterward in successive books The Life and Voyages of Columbus appeared in eighteen twenty eight and was followed by Voyages of the Companions of Columbus In eighteen twenty nine Washington Irving came again to England this time as Secretary to the American Legation He published the Conquest of Granada In eighteen thirty one he received the honorary degree of LL D from the University of Oxford Then he returned to America published in eighteen thirty two The Alhambra in eighteen thirty five Legends of the Conquest of Spain In eighteen forty two he went again to Spain this time as American Minister Other works were produced and at the close of his life he achieved his early ambition by writing a Life of Washington after whom he had been named and who had laid his hand upon his head and blessed him when he was a child of five Although the first of the five volumes of the Life of Washington did not appear until he was more than seventy years old he lived to complete his work and died on the twenty eighth of November eighteen fifty nine Washington Irving never married He had loved in his early years a daughter of his friend missus Hoffman had sat by her death bed when she was a girl of seventeen and waited until his own death restored her to him H M HISTORY OF NEW YORK BOOK IV continued CHAPTER VI Next to his projects for the suppression of poverty may be classed those of William the Testy for increasing the wealth of New Amsterdam Solomon of whose character for wisdom the little governor was somewhat emulous had made gold and silver as plenty as the stones in the streets of Jerusalem William Kieft could not pretend to vie with him as to the precious metals but he determined as an equivalent to flood the streets of New Amsterdam with Indian money This was nothing more nor less than strings of beads wrought out of clams periwinkles and other shell fish and called seawant or wampum These had formed a native currency among the simple savages who were content to take them of the Dutchmen in exchange for peltries In an unlucky moment William the Testy seeing this money of easy production conceived the project of making it the current coin of the province It is true it had an intrinsic value among the Indians who used it to ornament their robes and moccasins but among the honest burghers it had no more intrinsic value than those rags which form the paper currency of modern days This consideration however had no weight with William Kieft He began by paying all the servants of the company and all the debts of government in strings of wampum He sent emissaries to sweep the shores of Long Island which was the Ophir of this modern Solomon and abounded in shell fish These were transported in loads to New Amsterdam coined into Indian money and launched into circulation And now for a time affairs went on swimmingly money became as plentiful as in the modern days of paper currency and to use the popular phrase a wonderful impulse was given to public prosperity Yankee traders poured into the province buying everything they could lay their hands on and paying the worthy Dutchmen their own price in Indian money If the latter however attempted to pay the Yankees in the same coin for their tinware and wooden bowls the case was altered nothing would do but Dutch guilders and such like metallic currency What was worse the Yankees introduced an inferior kind of wampum made of oyster shells with which they deluged the province carrying off all the silver and gold the Dutch herrings and Dutch cheeses thus early did the knowing men of the East manifest their skill in bargaining the New Amsterdammers out of the oyster and leaving them the shell thirty six It was a long time before William the Testy was made sensible how completely his grand project of finance was turned against him by his eastern neighbors nor would he probably have ever found it out had not tidings been brought him that the Yankees had made a descent upon Long Island and had established a kind of mint at Oyster Bay where they were coining up all the oyster banks Now this was making a vital attack upon the province in a double sense financial and gastronomical Ever since the council dinner of Oloffe the Dreamer at the founding of New Amsterdam at which banquet the oyster figured so conspicuously this divine shell fish has been held in a kind of superstitious reverence at the Manhattoes as witness the temples erected to its cult in every street and lane and alley In fact it is the standard luxury of the place as is the terrapin at Philadelphia the soft crab at Baltimore or the canvas back at Washington The seizure of Oyster Bay therefore was an outrage not merely on the pockets but on the larders of the New Amsterdammers the whole community was aroused and an oyster crusade was immediately set on foot against the Yankees Every stout trencherman hastened to the standard nay some of the most corpulent burgomasters and schepens joined the expedition as a corps de reserve only to be called into action when the sacking commenced The conduct of the expedition was entrusted to a valiant Dutchman who for size and weight might have matched with Colbrand the Danish champion slain by Guy of Warwick He was famous throughout the province for strength of arm and skill at quarter staff and hence was named Stoffel Brinkerhoff or rather Brinkerhoofd that is to say Stoffel the Head breaker This sturdy commander who was a man of few words but vigorous deeds led his troops resolutely on through Nineveh and Babylon and Jericho and Patch hog and other Long Island towns without encountering any difficulty of note though it is said that some of the burgomasters gave out at Hard scramble Hill and Hungry Hollow and that others lost heart and turned back at Puss panick With the rest he made good his march until he arrived in the neighborhood of Oyster Bay Here he was encountered by a host of Yankee warriors headed by Preserved Fish and Habakkuk Nutter and Return Strong and Zerubbabel Fisk and Determined Cock at the sound of whose names Stoffel Brinkerhoff verily believed the whole parliament of Praise God Barebones had been let loose upon him He soon found however that they were merely the select men of the settlement armed with no weapon but the tongue and disposed only to meet him on the field of argument Stoffel had but one mode of arguing that was with the cudgel but he used it with such effect that he routed his antagonists broke up the settlement and would have driven the inhabitants into the sea if they had not managed to escape across the Sound to the mainland by the Devil s Stepping stones which remain to this day monuments of this great Dutch victory over the Yankees Stoffel Brinkerhoff made great spoil of oysters and clams coined and uncoined and then set out on his return to the Manhattoes A grand triumph after the manner of the ancients was prepared for him by William the Testy He entered New Amsterdam as a conqueror mounted on a Narraganset pacer Five dried codfish on poles standards taken from the enemy were borne before him and an immense store of oysters and clams Weathersfield onions and Yankee notions formed the spolia opima while several coiners of oyster shells were led captive to grace the hero s triumph The procession was accompanied by a full band of boys and negroes performing on the popular instruments of rattle bones and clam shells while Anthony Van Corlear sounded his trumpet from the ramparts A great banquet was served up in the Stadthouse from the clams and oysters taken from the enemy while the governor sent the shells privately to the mint and had them coined into Indian money with which he paid his troops It is moreover said that the governor calling to mind the practice among the ancients to honor their victorious generals with public statues passed a magnanimous decree by which every tavern keeper was permitted to paint the head of Stoffel Brinkerhoff upon his sign FOOTNOTES thirty six In a manuscript record of the province dated sixteen fifty nine Library of the New York Historical Society is the following mention of Indian money Seawant alias wampum Beads manufactured from the Quahang or whelk a shell fish formerly abounding on our coasts but lately of more rare occurrence of two colors black and white the former twice the value of the latter Six beads of the white and three of the black for an English penny The seawant depreciates from time to time The New England people make use of it as a means of barter not only to carry away the best cargoes which we send thither but to accumulate a large quantity of beavers and other furs by which the company is defrauded of her revenues and the merchants disappointed in making returns with that speed with which they might wish to meet their engagements while their commissioners and the inhabitants remain overstocked with seawant a sort of currency of no value except with the New Netherland savages et cetera CHAPTER VII It has been remarked by the observant writer of the Stuyvesant manuscript that under the administration of William Kieft the disposition of the inhabitants of New Amsterdam experienced an essential change so that they became very meddlesome and factious The unfortunate propensity of the little governor to experiment and innovation and the frequent exacerbations of his temper kept his council in a continual worry and the council being to the people at large what yeast or leaven is to a batch they threw the whole community in a ferment and the people at large being to the city what the mind is to the body the unhappy commotions they underwent operated most disastrously upon New Amsterdam insomuch that in certain of their paroxysms of consternation and perplexity they begat several of the most crooked distorted and abominable streets lanes and alleys with which this metropolis is disfigured The fact was that about this time the community like Balaam s ass began to grow more enlightened than its rider and to show a disposition for what is called self government This restive propensity was first evinced in certain popular meetings in which the burghers of New Amsterdam met to talk and smoke over the complicated affairs of the province gradually obfuscating themselves with politics and tobacco smoke Hither resorted those idlers and squires of low degree who hang loose on society and are blown about by every wind of doctrine Cobblers abandoned their stalls to give lessons on political economy blacksmiths suffered their fires to go out while they stirred up the fires of faction and even tailors though said to be the ninth parts of humanity neglected their own measures to criticise the measures of government Strange that the science of government which seems to be so generally understood should invariably be denied to the only one called upon to exercise it Not one of the politicians in question but take his word for it could have administered affairs ten times better than William the Testy Under the instructions of these political oracles the good people of New Amsterdam soon became exceedingly enlightened and as a matter of course exceedingly discontented They gradually found out the fearful error in which they had indulged of thinking themselves the happiest people in creation and were convinced that all circumstances to the contrary not withstanding they were a very unhappy deluded and consequently ruined people We are naturally prone to discontent and avaricious after imaginary causes of lamentation Like lubberly monks we belabor our own shoulders and take a vast satisfaction in the music of our own groans Nor is this said by way of paradox daily experience shows the truth of these observations It is almost impossible to elevate the spirits of a man groaning under ideal calamities but nothing is easier than to render him wretched though on the pinnacle of felicity as it would be an herculean task to hoist a man to the top of a steeple though the merest child could topple him off thence I must not omit to mention that these popular meetings were generally held at some noted tavern these public edifices possessing what in modern times are thought the true fountains of political inspiration The ancient Germans deliberated upon a matter when drunk and reconsidered it when sober Mob politicians in modern times dislike to have two minds upon a subject so they both deliberate and act when drunk by this means a world of delay is spared and as it is universally allowed that a man when drunk sees double it follows conclusively that he sees twice as well as his sober neighbors CHAPTER VIII Wilhelmus Kieft as has already been observed was a great legislator on a small scale and had a microscopic eye in public affairs He had been greatly annoyed by the facetious meetings of the good people of New Amsterdam but observing that on these occasions the pipe was ever in their mouth he began to think that the pipe was at the bottom of the affair and that there was some mysterious affinity between politics and tobacco smoke Determined to strike at the root of the evil he began forthwith to rail at tobacco as a noxious nauseous weed filthy in all its uses and as to smoking he denounced it as a heavy tax upon the public pocket a vast consumer of time a great encourager of idleness and a deadly bane to the prosperity and morals of the people Finally he issued an edict prohibiting the smoking of tobacco throughout the New Netherlands Ill fated Kieft Had he lived in the present age and attempted to check the unbounded license of the press he could not have struck more sorely upon the sensibilities of the million The pipe in fact was the great organ of reflection and deliberation of the New Netherlander It was his constant companion and solace was he gay he smoked was he sad he smoked his pipe was never out of his mouth it was a part of his physiognomy without it his best friends would not know him Take away his pipe You might as well take away his nose The immediate effect of the edict of William the Testy was a popular commotion A vast multitude armed with pipes and tobacco boxes and an immense supply of ammunition sat themselves down before the governor s house and fell to smoking with tremendous violence The testy William issued forth like a wrathful spider demanding the reason of this lawless fumigation The sturdy rioters replied by lolling back in their seats and puffing away with redoubled fury raising such a murky cloud that the governor was fain to take refuge in the interior of his castle A long negotiation ensued through the medium of Anthony the Trumpeter The governor was at first wrathful and unyielding but was gradually smoked into terms He concluded by permitting the smoking of tobacco but he abolished the fair long pipes used in the days of Wouter Van Twiller denoting ease tranquillity and sobriety of deportment these he condemned as incompatible with the despatch of business in place whereof he substituted little captious short pipes two inches in length which he observed could be stuck in one corner of the mouth or twisted in the hatband and would never be in the way Thus ended this alarming insurrection which was long known by the name of the Pipe Plot and which it has been somewhat quaintly observed did end like most plots and seditions in mere smoke But mark O reader the deplorable evils which did afterward result The smoke of these villainous little pipes continually ascending in a cloud about the nose penetrated into and befogged the cerebellum dried up all the kindly moisture of the brain and rendered the people who used them as vaporish and testy as the governor himself Nay what is worse from being goodly burly sleek conditioned men they became like our Dutch yeomanry who smoke short pipes a lantern jawed smoke dried leather hided race Nor was this all From this fatal schism in tobacco pipes we may date the rise of parties in the Nieuw Nederlandts The rich and self important burghers who had made their fortunes and could afford to be lazy adhered to the ancient fashion and formed a kind of aristocracy known as the Long Pipes while the lower order adopting the reform of William Kieft as more convenient in their handicraft employments were branded with the plebeian name of Short Pipes A third party sprang up headed by the descendants of Robert Chewit the companion of the great Hudson These discarded pipes altogether and took up chewing tobacco hence they were called Quids an appellation since given to those political mongrels which sometimes spring up between two great parties as a mule is produced between a horse and an ass And here I would note the great benefit of party distinctions in saving the people at large the trouble of thinking Hesiod divides mankind into three classes those who think for themselves those who think as others think and those who do not think at all The second class comprises the great mass of society for most people require a set creed and a file leader Hence the origin of party which means a large body of people some few of whom think and all the rest talk The former take the lead and discipline the latter prescribing what they must say what they must approve what they must hoot at whom they must support but above all whom they must hate for no one can be a right good partisan who is not a thoroughgoing hater The enlightened inhabitants of the Manhattoes therefore being divided into parties were enabled to hate each other with great accuracy And now the great business of politics went bravely on the Long Pipes and Short Pipes assemblings in separate beer houses and smoking at each other with implacable vehemence to the great support of the state and profit of the tavern keepers Some indeed went so far as to bespatter their adversaries with those odoriferous little words which smell so strong in the Dutch language believing like true politicians that they served their party and glorified themselves in proportion as they bewrayed their neighbors But however they might differ among themselves all parties agreed in abusing the governor seeing that he was not a governor of their choice but appointed by others to rule over them Unhappy William Kieft exclaims the sage writer of the Stuyvesant manuscript doomed to contend with enemies too knowing to be entrapped and to reign over a people too wise to be governed All his foreign expeditions were baffled and set at naught by the all pervading Yankees all his home measures were canvassed and condemned by numerous and respectable meetings of pot house politicians In the multitude of counsellors we are told there is safety but the multitude of counsellors was a continual source of perplexity to William Kieft With a temperament as hot as an old radish and a mind subject to perpetual whirlwinds and tornadoes he never failed to get into a passion with every one who undertook to advise him I have observed however that your passionate little men like small boats with large sails are easily upset or blown out of their course so was it with William the Testy who was prone to be carried away by the last piece of advice blown into his ear The consequence was that though a projector of the first class yet by continually changing his projects he gave none a fair trial and by endeavoring to do everything he in sober truth did nothing In the meantime the sovereign people having got into the saddle showed themselves as usual unmerciful riders spurring on the little governor with harangues and petitions and thwarting him with memorials and reproaches in much the same way as holiday apprentices manage an unlucky devil of a hack horse so that Wilhelmus Kieft was kept at a worry or a gallop throughout the whole of his administration CHAPTER IX If we could but get a peep at the tally of Dame Fortune where like a vigilant landlady she chalks up the debtor and creditor accounts of thoughtless mortals we should find that every good is checked off by an evil and that however we may apparently revel scot free for a season the time will come when we must ruefully pay off the reckoning Fortune in fact is a pestilent shrew and withal an inexorable creditor and though for a time she may be all smiles and courtesies and indulge us in long credits yet sooner or later she brings up her arrears with a vengeance and washes out her scores with our tears Since says good old Boethius no man can retain her at his pleasure what are her favors but sure prognostications of approaching trouble and calamity This is the fundamental maxim of that sage school of philosophers the Croakers who esteem it true wisdom to doubt and despond when other men rejoice well knowing that happiness is at best but transient that the higher one is elevated on the see saw balance of fortune the lower must be his subsequent depression that he who is on the uppermost round of a ladder has most to suffer from a fall while he who is at the bottom runs very little risk of breaking his neck by tumbling to the top Philosophical readers of this stamp must have doubtless indulged in dismal forebodings all through the tranquil reign of Walter the Doubter and considered it what Dutch seamen call a weather breeder They will not be surprised therefore that the foul weather which gathered during his days should now be rattling from all quarters on the head of William the Testy The origin of some of these troubles may be traced quite back to the discoveries and annexations of Hans Reinier Oothout the explorer and Wynant Ten Breeches the land measurer made in the twilight days of Oloffe the Dreamer by which the territories of the Nieuw Nederlandts were carried far to the south to Delaware River and parts beyond The consequence was many disputes and brawls with the Indians which now and then reached the drowsy ears of Walter the Doubter and his council like the muttering of distant thunder from behind the mountains without however disturbing their repose It was not till the time of William the Testy that the thunderbolt reached the Manhattoes While the little governor was diligently protecting his eastern boundaries from the Yankees word was brought him of the irruption of a vagrant colony of Swedes in the South who had landed on the banks of the Delaware and displayed the banner of that redoubtable virago Queen Christina and taken possession of the country in her name These had been guided in their expedition by one Peter Minuits or Minnewits a renegade Dutchman formerly in the service of their High Mightinesses but who now declared himself governor of all the surrounding country to which was given the name of the province of New Sweden It is an old saying that a little pot is soon hot which was the case with William the Testy Being a little man he was soon in a passion and once in a passion he soon boiled over Summoning his council on the receipt of this news he belabored the Swedes in the longest speech that had been heard in the colony since the wordy warfare of Ten Breeches and Tough Breeches Having thus taken off the fire edge of his valor he resorted to his favorite measure of proclamation and despatched a document of the kind ordering the renegade Minnewits and his gang of Swedish vagabonds to leave the country immediately under pain of vengeance of their High Mightinesses the Lords States General and of the potentates of the Manhattoes This strong measure was not a whit more effectual than its predecessors which had been thundered against the Yankees and William Kieft was preparing to follow it up with something still more formidable when he received intelligence of other invaders on his southern frontier who had taken possession of the banks of the Schuylkill and built a fort there They were represented as a gigantic gunpowder race of men exceedingly expert at boxing biting gouging and other branches of the rough and tumble mode of warfare which they had learned from their prototypes and cousins german the Virginians to whom they have ever borne considerable resemblance Like them too they were great roisterers much given to revel on hoe cake and bacon mint julep and apple toddy whence their newly formed colony had already acquired the name of Merryland which with a slight modification it retains to the present day In fact the Merrylanders and their cousins the Virginians were represented to William Kieft as offsets from the same original stock as his bitter enemies the Yanokie or Yankee tribes of the east having both come over to this country for the liberty of conscience or in other words to live as they pleased the Yankees taking to praying and money making and converting Quakers and the Southerners to horse racing and cock fighting and breeding negroes Against these new invaders Wilhelmus Kieft immediately despatched a naval armament of two sloops and thirty men under Jan Jansen Alpendam who was armed to the very teeth with one of the little governor s most powerful speeches written in vigorous Low Dutch Admiral Alpendam arrived without accident in the Schuylkill and came upon the enemy just as they were engaged in a great barbecue a king of festivity or carouse much practised in Merryland Opening upon them with the speech of William the Testy he denounced them as a pack of lazy canting julep tippling cock fighting horse racing slave driving tavern haunting Sabbath breaking mulatto breeding upstarts and concluded by ordering them to evacuate the country immediately to which they laconically replied in plain English They d see him d d first Now this was a reply on which neither Jan Jansen Alpendam nor Wilhelmus Kieft had made any calculation Finding himself therefore totally unprepared to answer so terrible a rebuff with suitable hostility the admiral concluded his wisest course would be to return home and report progress He accordingly steered his course back to New Amsterdam where he arrived safe having accomplished this hazardous enterprise at small expense of treasure and no loss of life His saving policy gained him the universal appellation of the Savior of his Country and his services were suitably rewarded by a shingle monument erected by subscription on the top of Flattenbarrack Hill where it immortalized his name for three whole years when it fell to pieces and was burnt for firewood CHAPTER X About this time the testy little governor of the New Netherlands appears to have had his hands full and with one annoyance and the other to have been kept continually on the bounce He was on the very point of following up the expedition of Jan Jansen Alpendam by some belligerent measures against the marauders of Merryland when his attention was suddenly called away by belligerent troubles springing up in another quarter the seeds of which had been sown in the tranquil days of Walter the Doubter The reader will recollect the deep doubt into which that most pacific governor was thrown on Killian Van Rensellaer s taking possession of Bearn Island by wapen recht While the governor doubted and did nothing the lordly Killian went on to complete his sturdy little castellum of Rensellaersteen and to garrison it with a number of his tenants from the Helderberg a mountain region famous for the hardest heads and hardest fists in the province Nicholas Koorn a faithful squire of the patroon accustomed to strut at his heels wear his cast off clothes and imitate his lofty bearing was established in this post as wacht meester His duty it was to keep an eye on the river and oblige every vessel that passed unless on the service of their High Mightinesses to strike its flag lower its peak and pay toll to the Lord of Rensellaersteen This assumption of sovereign authority within the territories of the Lords States General however it might have been tolerated by Walter the Doubter had been sharply contested by William the Testy on coming into office and many written remonstrances had been addressed by him to Killian Van Rensellaer to which the latter never deigned a reply Thus by degrees a sore place or in Hibernian parlance a raw had been established in the irritable soul of the little governor insomuch that he winced at the very name of Rensellaersteen Now it came to pass that on a fine sunny day the company s yacht the Half Moon having been on one of its stated visits to Fort Aurania was quietly tiding it down the Hudson the commander Govert Lockerman a veteran Dutch skipper of few words but great bottom was seated on the high poop quietly smoking his pipe under the shadow of the proud flag of Orange when on arriving abreast of Bearn Island he was saluted by a stentorian voice from the shore Lower thy flag and be d d to thee Govert Lockerman without taking his pipe out of his mouth turned up his eye from under his broad brimmed hat to see who hailed him thus discourteously There on the ramparts of the forts stood Nicholas Koorn armed to the teeth flourishing a brass hilted sword while a steeple crowned hat and cock s tail feather formerly worn by Killian Van Rensellaer himself gave an inexpressible loftiness to his demeanor Govert Lockerman eyed the warrior from top to toe but was not to be dismayed Taking the pipe slowly out of his mouth To whom should I lower my flag demanded he To the high and mighty Killian Van Rensellaer the lord of Rensellaersteen was the reply I lower it to none but the Prince Orange and my masters the Lords States General So saying he resumed his pipe and smoked with an air of dogged determination Bang went a gun from the fortress the ball cut both sail and rigging Govert Lockerman said nothing but smoked the more doggedly Bang went another gun the shot whistling close astern Fire and be d d cried Govert Lockerman cramming a new charge of tobacco into his pipe and smoking with still increasing vehemence Bang went a third gun The shot passed over his head tearing a hole in the princely flag of Orange This was the hardest trial of all for the pride and patience of Govert Lockerman he maintained a stubborn though swelling silence but his smothered rage might be perceived by the short vehement puffs of smoke emitted from his pipe by which he might be tracked for miles as he slowly floated out of shot and out of sight of Bearn Island In fact he never gave vent to his passion until he got fairly among the Highlands of the Hudson when he let fly whole volleys of Dutch oaths which are said to linger to this very day among the echoes of the Dunderberg and to give particular effect to the thunder storms in that neighborhood It was the sudden apparition of Govert Lockerman at Dog s Misery bearing in his hand the tattered flag of Orange that arrested the attention of William the Testy just as he was devising a new expedition against the marauders of Merryland I will not pretend to describe the passion of the little man when he heard of the outrage of Rensellaersteen Suffice it to say in the first transports of his fury he turned Dog s Misery topsy turvy kicked every cur out of doors and threw the cats out of the window after which his spleen being in some measure relieved he went into a council of war with Govert Lockerman the skipper assisted by Anthony Van Corlear the trumpeter CHAPTER XI The eyes of all New Amsterdam were now turned to see what would be the end of this direful feud between William the Testy and the patron of Rensellaerwick and some observing the consultations of the governor with the skipper and the trumpeter predicted warlike measures by sea and land The wrath of William Kieft however though quick to rise was quick to evaporate He was a perfect brush heap in a blaze snapping and crackling for a time and then ending in smoke Like many other valiant potentates his first thoughts were all for war his sober second thoughts for diplomacy Accordingly Govert Lockerman was once more despatched up the river in the company s yacht the Goed Hoop bearing Anthony the Trumpeter as ambassador to treat with the belligerent powers of Rensellaersteen In the fulness of time the yacht arrived before Bearn Island and Anthony the Trumpeter mounting the poop sounded a parly to the forces In a little while the steeple crowned hat of Nicholas Koorn the wacht meester rose above the battlements followed by his iron visage and ultimately his whole person armed as before to the very teeth while one by one a whole row of Helderbergers reared their round burly heads above the wall and beside each pumpkin head peered the end of a rusty musket Nothing daunted by this formidable array Anthony Van Corlear drew forth and read with audible voice a missive from William the Testy protesting against the usurpation of Bearn Island and ordering the garrison to quit the premises bag and baggage on pain of the vengeance of the potentate of the Manhattoes In reply the wacht meester applied the thumb of his right hand to the end of his nose and the thumb of the left hand to the little finger of the right and spreading each hand like a fan made an aerial flourish with his fingers Anthony Van Corlear was sorely perplexed to understand this sign which seemed to him something mysterious and masonic Not liking to betray his ignorance he again read with a loud voice the missive of William the Testy and again Nicholas Koorn applied the thumb of his right hand to the end of his nose and the thumb of his left hand to the little finger of the right and repeated this kind of nasal weathercock Anthony Van Corlear now persuaded himself that this was some short hand sign or symbol current in diplomacy which though unintelligible to a new diplomat like himself would speak volumes to the experienced intellect of William the Testy Considering his embassy therefore at an end he sounded his trumpet with great complacency and set sail on his return down the river every now and then practising this mysterious sign of the wacht meester to keep it accurately in mind Arrived at New Amsterdam he made a faithful report of his embassy to the governor accompanied by a manual exhibition of the response of Nicholas Koorn The governor was equally perplexed with his ambassador He was deeply versed in the mysteries of freemasonry but they threw no light on the matter He knew ever variety of windmill and weathercock but was not a whit the wiser as to the aerial sign in question He had even dabbled in Egyptian hieroglyphics and the mystic symbols of the obelisk but none furnished a key to the reply of Nicholas Koorn He called a meeting of his council Anthony Van Corlear stood forth in the midst and putting the thumb of his right hand to his nose and the thumb of his left hand to the finger of the right he gave a faithful fac simile of the portentous sign Having a nose of unusual dimensions it was as if the reply had been put in capitals but all in vain the worthy burgomasters were equally perplexed with the governor Each one put his thumb to the end of his nose spread his fingers like a fan imitated the motion of Anthony Van Corlear then smoked on in dubious silence Several times was Anthony obliged to stand forth like a fugleman and repeat the sign and each time a circle of nasal weathercocks might be seen in the council chamber Perplexed in the extreme William the Testy sent for all the soothsayers and fortune tellers and wise men of the Manhattoes but none could interpret the mysterious reply of Nicholas Koorn The council broke up in sore perplexity The matter got abroad Anthony Van Corlear was stopped at every corner to repeat the signal to a knot of anxious newsmongers each of whom departed with his thumb to his nose and his fingers in the air to carry the story home of his family For several days all business was neglected in New Amsterdam nothing was talked of but the diplomatic mission of Anthony the Trumpeter nothing was to be seen but knots of politicians with their thumbs to their noses In the meantime the fierce feud between William the Testy and Killian Van Rensellaer which at first had menaced deadly warfare gradually cooled off like many other war questions in the prolonged delays of diplomacy Still to this early affair of Rensellaersteen may be traced the remote origin of those windy wars in modern days which rage in the bowels of the Helderberg and have well nigh shaken the great patroonship of the Van Rensellaers to its foundation for we are told that the bully boys of the Helderberg who served under Nicholas Koorn the wacht meester carried back to their mountains the hieroglyphic sign which had so sorely puzzled Anthony Van Corlear and the sages of the Manhattoes so that to the present day the thumb to the nose and the fingers in the air is apt to be the reply of the Helderbergers whenever called upon for any long arrears of rent CHAPTER XII It was asserted by the wise men of ancient times who had a nearer opportunity of ascertaining the fact that at the gate of Jupiter s palace lay two huge tuns one filled with blessings the other with misfortunes and it would verily seem as if the latter had been completely overturned and left to deluge the unlucky province of Nieuw Nederlandts for about this time while harassed and annoyed from the south and the north incessant forays were made by the border chivalry of Connecticut upon the pig sties and hen roosts of the Nederlanders Every day or two some broad bottomed express rider covered with mud and mire would come floundering into the gate of New Amsterdam freighted with some new tale of aggression from the frontier whereupon Anthony Van Corlear seizing his trumpet the only substitute for a newspaper in those primitive days would sound the tidings from the ramparts with such doleful notes and disastrous cadence as to throw half the old women in the city into hysterics all which tended greatly to increase his popularity there being nothing for which the public are more grateful than being frequently treated to a panic a secret well known to modern editors But oh ye powers into what a paroxysm of passion did each new outrage of the Yankees throw the choleric little governor Letter after letter protest after protest bad Latin worse English and hideous Low Dutch were incessantly fulminated upon them and the four and twenty letters of the alphabet which formed his standing army were worn out by constant campaigning All however was ineffectual even the recent victory at Oyster Bay which had shed such a gleam of sunshine between the clouds of his foul weather reign was soon followed by a more fearful gathering up of those clouds and indications of more portentous tempests for the Yankee tribe on the banks of the Connecticut finding on this memorable occasion their incompetency to cope in fair fight with the sturdy chivalry of the Manhattoes had called to their aid all the ten tribes of their brethren who inhabit the east country which from them has derived the name of Yankee land This call was promptly responded to The consequence was a great confederacy of the tribes of Massachusetts Connecticut New Plymouth and New Haven under the title of the United Colonies of New England the pretended object of which was mutual defense against the savages but the real object the subjugation of the Nieuw Nederlandts For to let the reader into one of the greatest secrets of history the Nieuw Nederlandts had long been regarded by the whole Yankee race as the modern land of promise and themselves as the chosen and peculiar people destined one day or other by hook or by crook to get possession of it In truth they are a wonderful and all prevalent people of that class who only require an inch to gain an ell or a halter to gain a horse From the time they first gained a foothold on Plymouth Rock they began to migrate progressing and progressing from place to place and land to land making a little here and a little there and controverting the old proverb that a rolling stone gathers no moss Hence they have facetiously received the nickname of The Pilgrims that is to say a people who are always seeking a better country than their own The tidings of this great Yankee league struck William Kieft with dismay and for once in his life he forgot to bounce on receiving a disagreeable piece of intelligence In fact on turning over in his mind all that he had read at the Hague about leagues and combinations he found that this was a counterpart of the Amphictyonic League by which the states of Greece attained such power and supremacy and the very idea made his heart quake for the safety of his empire at the Manhattoes The affairs of the confederacy were managed by an annual council of delegates held at Boston which Kieft denominated the Delphos of this truly classic league The very first meeting gave evidence of hostility to the New Nederlanders who were charged in their dealings with the Indians with carrying on a traffic in guns powther and shott a trade damnable and injurious to the colonists It is true the Connecticut traders were fain to dabble a little in this damnable traffic but then they always dealt in what were termed Yankee guns ingeniously calculated to burst in the pagan hands which used them The rise of this potent confederacy was a death blow to the glory of William the Testy for from that day forward he never held up his head but appeared quite crestfallen It is true as the grand council augmented in power and the league rolling onward gathered about the red hills of New Haven threatening to overwhelm the Nieuw Nederlandts he continued occasionally to fulminate proclamations and protests as a shrewd sea captain fires his guns into a water spout but alas they had no more effect than so many blank cartridges Thus end the authenticated chronicles of the reign of William the Testy for henceforth in the troubles perplexities and confusion of the times he seems to have been totally overlooked and to have slipped for ever through the fingers of scrupulous history It is a matter of deep concern that such obscurity should hang over his latter days for he was in truth a mighty and great little man and worthy of being utterly renowned seeing that he was the first potentate that introduced into this land the art of fighting by proclamation and defending a country by trumpeters and windmills It is true that certain of the early provincial poets of whom there were great numbers in the Nieuw Nederlandts taking advantage of his mysterious exit have fabled that like Romulus he was translated to the skies and forms a very fiery little star somewhere on the left claw of the crab while others equally fanciful declare that he had experienced a fate similar to that of the good King Arthur who we are assured by ancient bards was carried away to the delicious abodes of fairyland where he still exists in pristine worth and vigor and will one day or another return to restore the gallantry the honor and the immaculate probity which prevailed in the glorious days of the Round Table thirty seven All these however are but pleasing fantasies the cobweb visions of those dreaming varlets the poets to which I would not have my judicious reader attach any credibility Neither am I disposed to credit an ancient and rather apocryphal historian who asserts that the ingenious Wilhelmus was annihilated by the blowing down of one of his windmills nor a writer of later times who affirms that he fell a victim to an experiment in natural history having the misfortune to break his neck from a garret window of the stadthouse in attempting to catch swallows by sprinkling salt upon their tails Still less do I put my faith in the tradition that he perished at sea in conveying home to Holland a treasure of golden ore discovered somewhere among the haunted regions of the Catskill mountains thirty eight The most probable account declares that what with the constant troubles on his frontiers the incessant schemings and projects going on in his own pericranium the memorials petitions remonstrances and sage pieces of advice of respectable meetings of the sovereign people and the refractory disposition of his councillors who were sure to differ from him on every point and uniformly to be in the wrong his mind was kept in a furnace heat until he became as completely burnt out as a Dutch family pipe which has passed through three generations of hard smokers In this manner did he undergo a kind of animal combustion consuming away like a farthing rushlight so that when grim Death finally snuffed him out there was scarcely left enough of him to bury FOOTNOTES thirty seven The old Welsh bards believed that King Arthur was not dead but carried awaie by the fairies into some pleasant place where he sholde remaine for a time and then returne againe and reigne in as great authority as ever Holinshed The Britons suppose that he shall come yet and conquere all Britaigne for certes this is the prophicye of Merlyn He say d that his deth shall be doubteous and said soth for men thereof yet have doubte and shullen for evermore for men wyt not whether that he lyveth or is dede De Leew Chron thirty eight Diedrich Knickerbocker in his scrupulous search after truth is sometimes too fastidious in regard to facts which border a little on the marvelous The story of the golden ore rests on something better than mere tradition The venerable Adrian Van der Donck Doctor of Laws in his description of the New Netherlands asserts it from his own observation as an eye witness He was present he says in sixteen forty five at a treaty between Governor Kieft and the Mohawk Indians in which one of the latter in painting himself for the ceremony used a pigment the weight and shining appearance of which excited the curiosity of the governor and Mynheer Van der Donck They obtained a lump and gave it to be proved by a skillful doctor of medicine Johannes de la Montagne one of the councillors of the New Netherlands It was put into a crucible and yielded two pieces of gold worth about three guilders All this continues Adrian Van der Donck was kept secret As soon as peace was made with the Mohawks an officer and a few men were sent to the mountain in the region of the Kaatskill under the guidance of an Indian to search for the precious mineral They brought back a bucketful of ore which being submitted to the crucible proved as productive as the first William Kieft now thought the discovery certain He sent a confidential person Arent Corsen with a bagful of the mineral to New Haven to take passage in an English ship for England thence to proceed to Holland The vessel sailed at Christmas but never reached her port All on board perished A In the year sixteen forty seven Wilhelmus Kieft himself embarked on board the Princess taking with him specimens of the supposed mineral The ship was never heard of more Some have supposed that the mineral in question was not gold but pyrites but we have the assertion of Adrian Van der Donck an eye witness and the experiment of Johannes de la Montagne a learned doctor of medicine on the golden side of the question Cornelius Van Tienhooven also at that time secretary of the New Netherlands declared in Holland that he had tested several specimens of the mineral which proved satisfactory It would appear however that these golden treasures of the Kaatskill always brought ill luck as is evidenced in the fate of Arent Corsen and Wilhelmus Kieft and the wreck of the ships in which they attempted to convey the treasure across the ocean The golden mines have never since been explored but remain among the mysteries of the Kaatskill mountains and under the protection of the goblins which haunt them A See Van der Donck s description of the New Netherlands Collect New York Hist Society vol i p one hundred sixty one BOOK V CONTAINING THE FIRST PART OF THE REIGN OF PETER STUYVESANT AND HIS TROUBLES WITH THE AMPHICTYONIC COUNCIL CHAPTER I To a profound philosopher like myself who am apt to see clear through a subject where the penetration of ordinary people extends but half way there is no fact more simple and manifest than that the death of a great man is a matter of very little importance Much as we may think of ourselves and much as we may excite the empty plaudits of the million it is certain that the greatest among us do actually fill but an exceedingly small space in the world and it is equally certain that even that small space is quickly supplied when we leave it vacant Of what consequence is it said Pliny that individuals appear or make their exit the world is a theater whose scenes and actors are continually changing Never did philosopher speak more correctly and I only wonder that so wise a remark could have existed so many ages and mankind not have laid it more to heart Sage follows on in the footsteps of sage one hero just steps out of his triumphal car to make way for the hero who comes after him and of the proudest monarch it is merely said that he slept with his fathers and his successor reigned in his stead The world to tell the private truth cares but little for their loss and if left to itself would soon forget to grieve and though a nation has often been figuratively drowned in tears on the death of a great man yet it is ten to one if an individual tear has been shed on the occasion excepting from the forlorn pen of some hungry author It is the historian the biographer and the poet who have the whole burden of grief to sustain who kind souls like undertakers in England act the part of chief mourners who inflate a nation with sighs it never heaved and deluge it with tears it never dreamt of shedding Thus while the patriotic author is weeping and howling in prose in blank verse and in rhyme and collecting the drops of public sorrow into his volume as into a lachrymal vase it is more than probable his fellow citizens are eating and drinking fiddling and dancing as utterly ignorant of the bitter lamentations made in their name as are those men of straw John Doe and Richard Roe of the plaintiffs for whom they are generously pleased to become sureties The most glorious hero that ever desolated nations might have mouldered into oblivion among the rubbish of his own monument did not some historian take him into favor and benevolently transmit his name to posterity and much as the valiant William Kieft worried and bustled and turmoiled while he had the destinies of a whole colony in his hand I question seriously whether he will not be obliged to this authentic history for all his future celebrity His exit occasioned no convulsion in the city of New Amsterdam nor its vicinity the earth trembled not neither did any stars shoot from their spheres the heavens were not shrouded in black as poets would fain persuade us they have been on the death of a hero the rocks hard hearted varlets melted not into tears nor did the trees hang their heads in silent sorrow and as to the sun he lay abed the next night just as long and showed as jolly a face when he rose as he ever did on the same day of the month in any year either before or since The good people of New Amsterdam one and all declared that he had been a very busy active bustling little governor that he was the father of his country that he was the noblest work of God that he was a man take him for all in all they ne er should look upon his like again together with sundry other civil and affectionate speeches regularly said on the death of all great men after which they smoked their pipes thought no more about him and Peter Stuyvesant succeeded to his station Peter Stuyvesant was the last and like the renowned Wouter Van Twiller the best of our ancient Dutch governors Wouter having surpassed all who preceded him and Pieter or Piet as he was sociably called by the old Dutch burghers who were ever prone to familiarize names having never been equalled by any successor He was in fact the very man fitted by Nature to retrieve the desperate fortunes of her beloved province had not the Fates those most potent and unrelenting of all ancient spinsters destined them to inextricable confusion To say merely that he was a hero would be doing him great injustice he was in truth a combination of heroes for he was of a sturdy raw boned make like Ajax Telamon with a pair of round shoulders that Hercules would have given his hide for meaning his lion s hide when he undertook to ease old Atlas of his load He was moreover as Plutarch describes Coriolanus not only terrible for the force of his arm but likewise for his voice which sounded as though it came out of a barrel and like the self same warrior he possessed a sovereign contempt for the sovereign people and an iron aspect which was enough of itself to make the very bowels of his adversaries quake with terror and dismay All this martial excellency of appearance was inexpressibly heightened by an accidental advantage with which I am surprised that neither Homer nor Virgil have graced any of their heroes This was nothing less than a wooden leg which was the only prize he had gained in bravely fighting the battles of his country but of which he was so proud that he was often heard to declare he valued it more than all his other limbs put together indeed so highly did he esteem it that he had it gallantly enchased and relieved with silver devices which caused it to be related in divers histories and legends that he wore a silver leg thirty nine Like that choleric warrior Achilles he was somewhat subject to extempore bursts of passion which were rather unpleasant to his favorites and attendants whose perceptions he was apt to quicken after the manner of his illustrious imitator Peter the Great by anointing their shoulders with his walking staff Though I cannot find that he had read Plato or Aristotle or Hobbes or Bacon or Algernon Sydney or Tom Paine yet did he sometimes manifest a shrewdness and sagacity in his measures that one would hardly expect from a man who did not know Greek and had never studied the ancients True it is and I confess it with sorrow that he had an unreasonable aversion to experiments and was fond of governing his province after the simplest manner but then he contrived to keep it in better order than did the erudite Kieft though he had all the philosophers ancient and modern to assist and perplex him I must likewise own that he made but very few laws but then again he took care that those few were rigidly and impartially enforced and I do not know but justice on the whole was as well administered as if there had been volumes of sage acts and statutes yearly made and daily neglected and forgotten He was in fact the very reverse of his predecessors being neither tranquil and inert like Walter the Doubter nor restless and fidgeting like William the Testy but a man or rather a governor of such uncommon activity and decision of mind that he never sought nor accepted the advice of others depending bravely upon his single head as would a hero of yore upon his single arm to carry him through all difficulties and dangers To tell the simple truth he wanted nothing more to complete him as a statesman than to think always right for no one can say but that he always acted as he thought He was never a man to flinch when he found himself in a scrape but to dash forward through thick and thin trusting by hook or by crook to make all things straight in the end In a word he possessed in an eminent degree that great quality in a statesman called perseverance by the polite but nicknamed obstinacy by the vulgar A wonderful salve for official blunders since he who perseveres in error without flinching gets the credit of boldness and consistency while he who wavers in seeking to do what is right gets stigmatised as a trimmer This much is certain and it is a maxim well worthy the attention of all legislators great and small who stand shaking in the wind irresolute which way to steer that a ruler who follows his own will pleases himself while he who seeks to satisfy the wishes and whims of others runs great risk of pleasing nobody There is nothing too like putting down one s foot resolutely when in doubt and letting things take their course The clock that stands still points right twice in the four and twenty hours while others may keep going continually and be continually going wrong Nor did this magnanimous quality escape the discernment of the good people of Nieuw Nederlandts on the contrary so much were they struck with the independent will and vigorous resolution displayed on all occasions by their new governor that they universally called him Hard Koppig Piet or Peter the Headstrong a great compliment to the strength of his understanding If from all that I have said thou dost not gather worthy reader that Peter Stuyvesant was a tough sturdy valiant weather beaten mettlesome obstinate leathern sided lion hearted generous spirited old governor either I have written to but little purpose or thou art very dull at drawing conclusions This most excellent governor commenced his administration on the twenty ninth of May sixteen forty seven a remarkably stormy day distinguished in all the almanacks of the time which have come down to us by the name of Windy Friday As he was very jealous of his personal and official dignity he was inaugurated into office with great ceremony the goodly oaken chair of the renowned Wouter Van Twiller being carefully preserved for such occasions in like manner as the chair and stone were reverentially preserved at Scone in Scotland for the coronation of the Caledonian monarchs I must not omit to mention that the tempestuous state of the elements together with its being that unlucky day of the week termed hanging day did not fail to excite much grave speculation and divers very reasonable apprehensions among the more ancient and enlightened inhabitants and several of the sager sex who were reputed to be not a little skilled in the mysteries of astrology and fortune telling did declare outright that they were omens of a disastrous administration an event that came to be lamentably verified and which proves beyond dispute the wisdom of attending to those preternatural intimations furnished by dreams and visions the flying of birds falling of stones and cackling of geese on which the sages and rulers of ancient times placed such reliance or to those shootings of stars eclipses of the moon howlings of dogs and flarings of candles carefully noted and interpreted by the oracular Sibyls of our day who in my humble opinion are the legitimate inheritors and preservers of the ancient science of divination This much is certain that Governor Stuyvesant succeeded to the chair of state at a turbulent period when foes thronged and threatened from without when anarchy and stiff necked opposition reigned rampant within when the authority of their High Mightinesses the Lords States General though supported by economy and defended by speeches protests and proclamations yet tottered to its very center and when the great city of New Amsterdam though fortified by flag staffs trumpeters and windmills seemed like some fair lady of easy virtue to lie open to attack and ready to yield to the first invader FOOTNOTES thirty nine See the histories of Masters Josselyn and Blome CHAPTER II The very first movements of the great Peter on taking the reins of government displayed his magnanimity though they occasioned not a little marvel and uneasiness among the people of the Manhattoes Finding himself constantly interrupted by the opposition and annoyed by the advice of his privy council the members of which had acquired the unreasonable habit of thinking and speaking to themselves during the preceding reign he determined at once to put a stop to such grievous abominations Scarcely therefore had he entered upon his authority than he turned out of office all the meddlesome spirits of the factious cabinet of William the Testy in place of whom he chose unto himself councillors from those fat somniferous respectable burghers who had flourished and slumbered under the easy reign of Walter the Doubter All these he caused to be furnished with abundance of fair long pipes and to be regaled with frequent corporation dinners admonishing them to smoke and eat and sleep for the good of the nation while he took the burden of government upon his own shoulders an arrangement to which they all gave hearty acquiescence Nor did he stop here but made a hideous rout among the inventions and expedients of his learned predecessor rooting up his patent gallows where caitiff vagabonds were suspended by the waistband demolishing his flag staffs and windmills which like mighty giants guarded the ramparts of New Amsterdam pitching to the Duyvel whole batteries of Quaker guns and in a word turning topsy turvy the whole philosophic economic and windmill system of the immortal sage of Saardam The honest folk of New Amsterdam began to quake now for the fate of their matchless champion Antony the Trumpeter who had acquired prodigious favor in the eyes of the women by means of his whiskers and his trumpet Him did Peter the Headstrong cause to be brought into his presence and eyeing him for a moment from head to foot with a countenance that would have appalled anything else than a sounder of brass Pr ythee who and what art thou said he Sire replied the other in no wise dismayed for my name it is Antony Van Corlear for my parentage I am the son of my mother for my profession I am champion and garrison of this great city of New Amsterdam I doubt me much said Peter Stuyvesant that thou art some scurvy costard monger knave how didst thou acquire this paramount honor and dignity Marry sir replied the other like many a great man before me simply by sounding my own trumpet Ay is it so quoth the governor why then let us have a relish of thy art Whereupon the good Antony put his instrument to his lips and sounded a charge with such tremendous outset such a delectable quaver and such a triumphant cadence that it was enough to make one s heart leap out of one s mouth only to be within a mile of it Like as a war worn charger grazing in peaceful plains starts at a strain of martial music pricks up his ears and snorts and paws and kindles at the noise so did the heroic Peter joy to hear the clangor of the trumpet for of him might truly be said what was recorded of the renowned saint George of England there was nothing in all the world that more rejoiced his heart than to hear the pleasant sound of war and see the soldiers brandish forth their steeled weapons Casting his eye more kindly therefore upon the sturdy Van Corlear and finding him to be a jovial varlet shrewd in his discourse yet of great discretion and immeasurable wind he straightway conceived a vast kindness for him and discharging him from the troublesome duty of garrisoning defending and alarming the city ever after retained him about his person as his chief favorite confidential envoy and trusty squire Instead of disturbing the city with disastrous notes he was instructed to play so as to delight the governor while at his repasts as did the minstrels of yore in the days of glorious chivalry and on all public occasions to rejoice the ears of the people with warlike melody thereby keeping alive a noble and martial spirit But the measure of the valiant Peter which produced the greatest agitation in the community was his laying his hand upon the currency He had old fashioned notions in favor of gold and silver which he considered the true standards of wealth and mediums of commerce and one of his first edicts was that all duties to government should be paid in those precious metals and that seawant or wampum should no longer be a legal tender Here was a blow at public prosperity All those who speculated on the rise and fall of this fluctuating currency found their calling at an end those too who had hoarded Indian money by barrels full found their capital shrunk in amount but above all the Yankee traders who were accustomed to flood the market with newly coined oyster shells and to abstract Dutch merchandise in exchange were loud mouthed in decrying this tampering with the currency It was clipping the wings of commerce it was checking the development of public prosperity trade would be at an end goods would moulder on the shelves grain would rot in the granaries grass would grow in the marketplace In a word no one who has not heard the outcries and howlings of a modern Tarshish at any check upon paper money can have any idea of the clamor against Peter the Headstrong for checking the circulation of oyster shells In fact trade did shrink into narrower channels but then the stream was deep as it was broad The honest Dutchman sold less goods but then they got the worth of them either in silver and gold or in codfish tinware apple brandy Weathersfield onions wooden bowls and other articles of Yankee barter The ingenious people of the east however indemnified themselves in another way for having to abandon the coinage of oyster shells for about this time we are told that wooden nutmegs made their first appearance in New Amsterdam to the great annoyance of the Dutch housewives NOTE From a manuscript record of the province Lib N Y Hist Soc We have been unable to render your inhabitants wiser and prevent their being further imposed upon than to declare absolutely and peremptorily that henceforward seawant shall be bullion not longer admissable in trade without any value as it is indeed So that every one may be upon his guard to barter no longer away his wares and merchandise for these baubles at least not to accept them at a higher rate or in a larger quantity than as they may want them in their trade with the savages In this way your English Yankee neighbors shall no longer be enabled to draw the best wares and merchandise from our country for nothing the beavers and furs not excepted This has indeed long since been insufferable although it ought chiefly to be imputed to the imprudent penuriousness of our own merchants and inhabitants who it is to be hoped shall through the abolition of this seawant become wiser and more prudent twenty seventh January sixteen sixty two Seawant falls into disrepute duties to be paid in silver coin CHAPTER III Now it came to pass that while Peter Stuyvesant was busy regulating the internal affairs of his domain the great Yankee league which had caused such tribulation to William the Testy continued to increase in extent and power The grand Amphictyonic council of the league was held at Boston where it spun a web which threatened to link within it all the mighty principalities and powers of the east The object proposed by this formidable combination was mutual protection and defence against their savage neighbors but all the world knows the real aim was to form a grand crusade against the Nieuw Nederlandts and to get possession of the city of the Manhattoes as devout an object of enterprise and ambition to the Yankees as was ever the capture of Jerusalem to ancient Crusaders In the very year following the inauguration of Governor Stuyvesant a grand deputation departed from the city of Providence famous for its dusty streets and beauteous women in behalf of the plantation of Rhode Island praying to be admitted into the league The following minute of this deputation appears in the ancient records of the council forty mister Will Cottington and Captain Partridg of Rhoode Island presented this insewing request to the commissioners in wrighting Our request and motion is in behalfe of Rhoode Iland that wee the ilanders of Rhoode Iland may be rescauied into combination with all the united colonyes of New England in a firme and perpetual league of friendship and amity of ofence and defence mutuall advice and succor upon all just occasions for our mutuall safety and wellfaire et cetera WILL COTTINGTON ALICXSANDER PARTRIDG There was certainly something in the very physiognomy of this document that might well inspire apprehension The name of Alexander however mis spelt has been warlike in every age and though its fierceness is in some measure softened by being coupled with the gentle cognomen of Partridge still like the color of scarlet it bears an exceeding great resemblance to the sound of a trumpet From the style of the letter moreover and the soldier like ignorance of orthography displayed by the noble Captain Alicxsander Partridg in spelling his own name we may picture to ourselves this mighty man of Rhodes strong in arms potent in the field and as great a scholar as though he had been educated among that learned people of Thrace who Aristotle assures us could not count beyond the number four The result of this great Yankee league was augmented audacity on the part of the moss troopers of Connecticut pushing their encroachments farther and farther into the territories of their High Mightinesses so that even the inhabitants of New Amsterdam began to draw short breath and to find themselves exceedingly cramped for elbow room Peter Stuyvesant was not a man to submit quietly to such intrusions his first impulse was to march at once to the frontier and kick these squatting Yankees out of the country but bethinking himself in time that he was now a governor and legislator the policy of the statesman for once cooled the fire of the old soldier and he determined to try his hand at negotiation A correspondence accordingly ensued between him and the great council of the league and it was agreed that commissioners from either side should meet at Hartford to settle boundaries adjust grievances and establish a perpetual and happy peace The commissioners on the part of the Manhattoes were chosen according to immemorial usage of that venerable metropolis from among the wisest and weightiest men of the community that is to say men with the oldest heads and heaviest pockets Among these sages the veteran navigator Hans Reinier Oothout who had made such extensive discoveries during the time of Oloffe the Dreamer was looked up to as an oracle in all matters of the kind and he was ready to produce the very spy glass with which he first spied the mouth of the Connecticut river from his masthead and all the world knows that the discovery of the mouth of the river gives prior right to all the lands drained by its waters It was with feelings of pride and exultation that the good people of the Manhattoes saw two of the richest and most ponderous burghers departing on this embassy men whose word on Change was oracular and in whose presence no poor man ventured to appear without taking off his hat when it was seen too that the veteran Reinier Oothout accompanied them with his spy glass under his arm all the old men and old women predicted that men of such weight with such evidence would leave the Yankees no alternative but to pack up their tin kettles and wooden wares put wife and children in a cart and abandon all the lands of their High Mightinesses on which they had squatted In truth the commissioners sent to Hartford by the league seemed in no wise calculated to compete with men of such capacity They were two lean Yankee lawyers litigious looking varlets and evidently men of no substance since they had no rotundity in the belt and there was no jingling of money in their pockets it is true they had longer heads than the Dutchmen but if the heads of the latter were flat at top they were broad at bottom and what was wanting in height of forehead was made up by a double chin The negotiation turned as usual upon the good old corner stone of original discovery according to the principle that he who first sees a new country has an unquestionable right to it This being admitted the veteran Oothout at a concerted signal stepped forth in the assembly with the identical tarpaulin spy glass in his hand with which he had discovered the mouth of the Connecticut while the worthy Dutch commissioners lolled back in their chairs secretly chuckling at the idea of having for once got the weather gauge of the Yankees but what was their dismay when the latter produced a Nantucket whaler with a spy glass twice as long with which he discovered the whole coast quite down to the Manhattoes and so crooked that he had spied with it up the whole course of the Connecticut river This principle pushed home therefore the Yankees had a right to the whole country bordering on the Sound nay the city of New Amsterdam was a mere Dutch squatting place on their territories I forbear to dwell upon the confusion of the worthy Dutch commissioners at finding their main pillar of proof thus knocked from under them neither will I pretend to describe the consternation of the wise men at the Manhattoes when they learnt how their commissioner had been out trumped by the Yankees and how the latter pretended to claim to the very gates of New Amsterdam Long was the negotiation protracted and long was the public mind kept in a state of anxiety There are two modes of settling boundary questions when the claims of the opposite parties are irreconcilable One is by an appeal to arms in which case the weakest party is apt to lose its right and get a broken head into the bargain the other mode is by compromise or mutual concession that is to say one party cedes half of its claims and the other party half of its rights he who grasps most gets most and the whole is pronounced an equitable division perfectly honorable to both parties The latter mode was adopted in the present instance The Yankees gave up claims to vast tracts of the Nieuw Nederlandts which they had never seen and all right to the island of Manna hata and the city of New Amsterdam to which they had no right at all while the Dutch in return agreed that the Yankees should retain possession of the frontier places where they had squatted and of both sides of the Connecticut river When the news of this treaty arrived at New Amsterdam the whole city was in an uproar of exultation The old women rejoiced that there was to be no war the old men that their cabbage gardens were safe from invasion while the political sages pronounced the treaty a great triumph over the Yankees considering how much they had claimed and how little they had been fobbed off with And now my worthy reader is doubtless like the great and good Peter congratulating himself with the idea that his feelings will no longer be harassed by afflicting details of stolen horses broken heads impounded hogs and all the other catalogue of heart rending cruelties that disgraced these border wars But if he should indulge in such expectations it is a proof that he is but little versed in the paradoxical ways of cabinets to convince him of which I solicit his serious attention to my next chapter wherein I will show that Peter Stuyvesant has already committed a great error in politics and by effecting a peace has materially hazarded the tranquillity of the province FOOTNOTES forty Haz Coll Stat Pap CHAPTER IV It was the opinion of that poetical philosopher Lucretius that war was the original state of man whom he described as being primitively a savage beast of prey engaged in a constant state of hostility with his own species and that this ferocious spirit was tamed and ameliorated by society The same opinion has been advocated by Hobbes forty one nor have there been wanting many other philosophers to admit and defend it For my part though prodigiously fond of these valuable speculations so complimentary to human nature yet in this instance I am inclined to take the proposition by halves believing with Horace forty two that though war may have been originally the favorite amusement and industrious employment of our progenitors yet like many other excellent habits so far from being ameliorated it has been cultivated and confirmed by refinement and civilization and increases in exact proportion as we approach towards that state of perfection which is the ne plus ultra of modern philosophy The first conflict between man and man was the mere exertion of physical force unaided by auxiliary weapons his arm was his buckler his fist was his mace and a broken head the catastrophe of his encounters The battle of unassisted strength was succeeded by the more rugged one of stones and clubs and war assumed a sanguinary aspect As man advanced in refinement as his faculties expanded and as his sensibilities became more exquisite he grew rapidly more ingenious and experienced in the art of murdering his fellow beings He invented a thousand devices to defend and to assault the helmet the cuirass and the buckler the sword the dart and the javelin prepared him to elude the wound as well as to launch the blow Still urging on in the career of philanthropic invention he enlarges and heightens his powers of defense and injury The aries the scorpio the balista and the catapulta give a horror and sublimity to war and magnify its glory by increasing its desolation Still insatiable though armed with machinery that seemed to reach the limits of destructive invention and to yield a power of injury commensurate even with the desires of revenge still deeper researches must be made in the diabolical arcana With furious zeal he dives into the bowels of the earth he toils midst poisonous minerals and deadly salts the sublime discovery of gunpowder blazes upon the world and finally the dreadful art of fighting by proclamation seems to endow the demon of war with ubiquity and omnipotence This indeed is grand this indeed marks the powers of mind and bespeaks that divine endowment of reason which distinguishes us from the animals our inferiors The unenlightened brutes content themselves with the native force which Providence has assigned them The angry bull butts with his horns as did his progenitors before him the lion the leopard and the tiger seek only with their talons and their fangs to gratify their sanguinary fury and even the subtle serpent darts the same venom and uses the same wiles as did his sire before the flood Man alone blessed with the inventive mind goes on from discovery to discovery enlarges and multiplies his powers of destruction arrogates the tremendous weapons of Deity itself and tasks creation to assist him in murdering his brother worm In proportion as the art of war has increased in improvement has the art of preserving peace advanced in equal ratio and as we have discovered in this age of wonders and inventions that proclamation is the most formidable engine of war so have we discovered the no less ingenious mode of maintaining peace by perpetual negotiations A treaty or to speak more correctly a negotiation therefore according to the acceptation of experienced statesmen learned in these matters is no longer an attempt to accommodate differences to ascertain rights and to establish an equitable exchange of kind offices but a contest of skill between two powers which shall overreach and take in the other it is a cunning endeavor to obtain by peaceful manoeuvre and the chicanery of cabinets those advantages which a nation would otherwise have wrested by force of arms in the same manner as a conscientious highwayman reforms and becomes a quiet and praiseworthy citizen contenting himself with cheating his neighbor out of that property he would formerly have seized with open violence In fact the only time when two nations can be said to be in a state of perfect amity is when a negotiation is open and a treaty pending Then when there are no stipulations entered into no bonds to restrain the will no specific limits to awaken the captious jealousy of right implanted in our nature when each party has some advantage to hope and expect from the other then it is that the two nations are wonderfully gracious and friendly their ministers professing the highest mutual regard exchanging billets doux making fine speeches and indulging in all those little diplomatic flirtations coquetries and fondlings that do so marvelously tickle the good humor of the respective nations Thus it may paradoxically be said that there is never so good an understanding between two nations as when there is a little misunderstanding and that so long as they are on terms at all they are on the best terms in the world I do not by any means pretend to claim the merit of having made the above discovery It has in fact long been secretly acted upon by certain enlightened cabinets and is together with divers other notable theories privately copied out of the commonplace book of an illustrious gentleman who has been member of congress and enjoyed the unlimited confidence of heads of departments To this principle may be ascribed the wonderful ingenuity shown of late years in protracting and interrupting negotiations Hence the cunning measure of appointing as ambassador some political pettifogger skilled in delays sophisms and misapprehensions and dexterous in the art of baffling argument or some blundering statesman whose errors and misconstructions may be a plea for refusing to ratify his engagements And hence too that most notable expedient so popular with our government of sending out a brace of ambassadors between whom having each an individual will to consult character to establish and interest to promote you may as well look for unanimity and concord as between two lovers with one mistress two dogs with one bone or two naked rogues with one pair of breeches This disagreement therefore is continually breeding delays and impediments in consequence of which the negotiation goes on swimmingly inasmuch as there is no prospect of its ever coming to a close Nothing is lost by these delays and obstacles but time and in a negotiation according to the theory I have exposed all time lost is in reality so much time gained with what delightful paradoxes does modern political economy abound Now all that I have here advanced is so notoriously true that I almost blush to take up the time of my readers with treating of matters which must many a time have stared them in the face But the proposition to which I would most earnestly call their attention is this that though a negotiation be the most harmonizing of all national transactions yet a treaty of peace is a great political evil and one of the most fruitful sources of war I have rarely seen an instance of any special contract between individuals that did not produce jealousies bickerings and often downright ruptures between them nor did I ever know of a treaty between two nations that did not occasion continual misunderstandings How many worthy country neighbors have I known who after living in peace and good fellowship for years have been thrown into a state of distrust caviling and animosity by some ill starred agreement about fences runs of water and stray cattle and how many well meaning nations who would otherwise have remained in the most amicable disposition towards each other have been brought to swords points about the infringement or misconstruction of some treaty which in an evil hour they had concluded by way of making their amity more sure Treaties at best are but complied with so long as interest requires their fulfilment consequently they are virtually binding on the weaker party only or in plain truth they are not binding at all No nation will wantonly go to war with another if it has nothing to gain thereby and therefore needs no treaty to restrain it from violence and if it have anything to gain I much question from what I have witnessed of the righteous conduct of nations whether any treaty could be made so strong that it could not thrust the sword through nay I would hold ten to one the treaty itself would be the very source to which resort would be had to find a pretext for hostilities Thus therefore I conclude that though it is the best of all policies for a nation to keep up a constant negotiation with its neighbors yet it is the summit of folly for it ever to be beguiled into a treaty for then comes on non fulfillment and infraction then remonstrance then altercation then retaliation then recrimination and finally open war In a word negotiation is like courtship a time of sweet words gallant speeches soft looks and endearing caresses but the marriage ceremony is the signal for hostilities If my painstaking reader be not somewhat perplexed by the ratiocination of the foregoing passage he will perceive at a glance that the great Peter in concluding a treaty with his eastern neighbors was guilty of lamentable error in policy In fact to this unlucky agreement may be traced a world of bickerings and heart burnings between the parties about fancied or pretended infringements of treaty stipulations in all which the Yankees were prone to indemnify themselves by a dig into the sides of the New Netherlands But in sooth these border feuds albeit they gave great annoyance to the good burghers of Mannahata were so pitiful in their nature that a grave historian like myself who grudges the time spent in anything less than the revolutions of states and fall of empires would deem them unworthy of being inscribed on his page The reader is therefore to take it for granted though I scorn to waste in the detail that time which my furrowed brow and trembling hand inform me is invaluable that all the while the great Peter was occupied in those tremendous and bloody contests which I shall shortly rehearse there was a continued series of little dirty sniveling scourings broils and maraudings kept up on the eastern frontiers by the moss troopers of Connecticut But like that mirror of chivalry the sage and valorous Don Quixote I leave these petty contests for some future Sancho Panza of an historian while I reserve my prowess and my pen for achievements of higher dignity for at this moment I hear a direful and portentous note issuing from the bosom of the great council of the league and resounding throughout the regions of the east menacing the fame and fortunes of Peter Stuyvesant I call therefore upon the reader to leave behind him all the paltry brawls of the Connecticut borders and to press forward with me to the relief of our favorite hero who I foresee will be wofully beset by the implacable Yankees in the next chapter FOOTNOTES forty one Hobbes Leviathan part i ch thirteen forty two Cum prorepserunt primis animalia terris Mutum et turpe pecus glandem atque cubilia propter Unguibus et pugnis dein fustibus atque its porro Pugnabaut armis quae post fabricaverat usus Hor Sat lib i s three CHAPTER V That the reader may be aware of the peril at this moment menacing Peter Stuyvesant and his capital I must remind him of the old charge advanced in the council of the league in the time of William the Testy that the Nederlanders were carrying on a trade damnable and injurious to the colonists in furnishing the savages with guns powther and shott This as I then suggested was a crafty device of the Yankee confederacy to have a snug cause of war in petto in case any favorable opportunity should present of attempting the conquest of the New Nederlands the great object of Yankee ambition Accordingly we now find when every other ground of complaint had apparently been removed by treaty this nefarious charge revived with tenfold virulence and hurled like a thunderbolt at the very head of Peter Stuyvesant happily his head like that of the great bull of the Wabash was proof against such missiles To be explicit we are told that in the years sixteen fifty one the great confederacy of the east accused the immaculate Peter the soul of honor and heart of steel of secretly endeavoring by gifts and promises to instigate the Narroheganset Mohaque and Pequot Indians to surprise and massacre the Yankee settlements For as the grand council observed the Indians round about for divers hundred miles cercute seeme to have drunk deepe of an intoxicating cupp att or from the Manhattoes against the English whoe have sought their good both in bodily and spirituall respects This charge they pretended to support by the evidence of divers Indians who were probably moved by that spirit of truth which is said to reside in the bottle and who swore to the fact as sturdily as though they had been so many Christian troopers Though descended from a family which suffered much injury from the losel Yankees of those times my great grandfather having had a yoke of oxen and his best pacer stolen and having received a pair of black eyes and a bloody nose in one of these border wars and my grandfather when a very little boy tending pigs having been kidnaped and severely flogged by a long sided Connecticut schoolmaster yet I should have passed over all these wrongs with forgiveness and oblivion I could even have suffered them to have broken Everett Ducking s head to have kicked the doughty Jacobus Van Curlet and his ragged regiment out of doors to have carried every hog into captivity and depopulated every hen roost on the face of the earth with perfect impunity but this wanton attack upon one of the most gallant and irreproachable heroes of modern times is too much even for me to digest and has overset with a single puff the patience of the historian and the forbearance of the Dutchman Oh reader it was false I swear to thee it was false If thou hast any respect to my word if the undeviating character for veracity which I have endeavored to maintain throughout this work has its due weight with thee thou wilt not give thy faith to this tale of slander for I pledge my honor and my immortal fame to thee that the gallant Peter Stuyvesant was not only innocent of this foul conspiracy but would have suffered his right arm or even his wooden leg to consume with slow and everlasting flames rather than attempt to destroy his enemies in any other way than open generous warfare Beshrew those caitiff scouts that conspired to sully his honest name by such an imputation Peter Stuyvesant though haply he may never have heard of a knight errant had as true a heart of chivalry as ever beat at the round table of King Arthur In the honest bosom of this heroic Dutchman dwelt the seven noble virtues of knighthood flourishing among his hardy qualities like wild flowers among rocks He was in truth a hero of chivalry struck off by Nature at a single heat and though little care may have been taken to refine her workmanship he stood forth a miracle of her skill In all his dealings he was headstrong perhaps but open and above board if there was anything in the whole world he most loathed and despised it was cunning and secret wile straight forward was his motto and he at any time rather run his hard head against a stone wall than attempt to get round it Such was Peter Stuyvesant and if my admiration of him has on this occasion transported my style beyond the sober gravity which becomes the philosophic recorder of historic events I must plead as an apology that though a little grey headed Dutchman arrived almost at the down hill of life I still retain a lingering spark of that fire which kindles in the eye of youth when contemplating the virtues of ancient worthies Blessed thrice and nine times blessed be the good saint Nicholas if I have indeed escaped that apathy which chills the sympathies of age and paralyses every glow of enthusiasm The first measure of Peter Stuyvesant on hearing of this slanderous charge would have been worthy of a man who had studied for years in the chivalrous library of Don Quixote Drawing his sword and laying it across the table to put him in proper tune he took pen in hand and indited a proud and lofty letter to the council of the league reproaching them with giving ear to the slanders of heathen savages against a Christian a soldier and a cavalier declaring that whoever charged him with the plot in question lied in his throat to prove which he offered to meet the president of the council or any of his compeers or their champion Captain Alexander Partridge that mighty man of Rhodes in single combat wherein he trusted to vindicate his honor by the prowess of his arm This missive was intrusted to his trumpeter and squire Anthony Van Corlear that man of emergencies with orders to travel night and day sparing neither whip nor spur seeing that he carried the vindication of his patron s fame in his saddle bags The loyal Anthony accomplished his mission with great speed and considerable loss of leather He delivered his missive with becoming ceremony accompanying it with a flourish of defiance on his trumpet to the whole council ending with a significant and nasal twang full in the face of Captain Partridge who nearly jumped out of his skin in an ecstasy of astonishment The grand council was composed of men too cool and practical to be put readily in a heat or to indulge in knight errantry and above all to run a tilt with such a fiery hero as Peter the Headstrong They knew the advantage however to have always a snug justifiable cause of war in reserve with a neighbor who had territories worth invading so they devised a reply to Peter Stuyvesant calculated to keep up the raw which they had established On receiving this answer Anthony Van Corlear remounted the Flanders mare which he always rode and trotted merrily back to the Manhattoes solacing himself by the way according to his wont twanging his trumpet like a very devil so that the sweet valleys and banks of the Connecticut resounded with the warlike melody bringing all the folks to the windows as he passed through Hartford and Pyquag and Middletown and all the other border towns ogling and winking at the women and making aerial windmills from the end of his nose at their husbands and stopping occasionally in the villages to eat pumpkin pies dance at country frolics and bundle with the Yankee lasses whom he rejoiced exceedingly with his soul stirring instrument CHAPTER VI The reply of the grand council to Peter Stuyvesant was couched in the coolest and most diplomatic language They assured him that his confident denials of the barbarous plot alleged against him would weigh little against the testimony of divers sober and respectable Indians that his guilt was proved to their perfect satisfaction so that they must still require and seek due satisfaction and security ending with so we rest sir Yours in ways of righteousness I forbear to say how the lion hearted Peter roared and ramped at finding himself more and more entangled in the meshes thus artfully drawn round him by the knowing Yankees Impatient however of suffering so gross an aspersion to rest upon his honest name he sent a second messenger to the council reiterating his denial of the treachery imputed to him and offering to submit his conduct to the scrutiny of a court of honor His offer was readily accepted and now he looked forward with confidence to an august tribunal to be assembled at the Manhattoes formed of high minded cavaliers peradventure governors and commanders of the confederate plantations where the matter might be investigated by his peers in a manner befitting his rank and dignity While he was awaiting the arrival of such high functionaries behold one sunshiny afternoon there rode into the great gate of the Manhattoes two lean hungry looking Yankees mounted on Narraganset pacers with saddle bags under their bottoms and green satchels under their arms who looked marvelously like two pettifogging attorneys beating the hoof from one county court to another in quest of lawsuits and in sooth though they may have passed under different names at the time I have reason to suspect they were the identical varlets who had negotiated the worthy Dutch commissioners out of the Connecticut river It was a rule with these indefatigable missionaries never to let the grass grow under their feet Scarce had they therefore alighted at the inn and deposited their saddle bags than they made their way to the residence of the governor They found him according to custom smoking his afternoon pipe on the stoop or bench at the porch of his house and announced themselves at once as commissioners sent by the grand council of the east to investigate the truth of certain charges advanced against him The good Peter took his pipe from his mouth and gazed at them for a moment in mute astonishment By way of expediting business they were proceeding on the spot to put some preliminary questions asking him peradventure whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty considering him something in the light of a culprit at the bar when they were brought to a pause by seeing him lay down his pipe and begin to fumble with his walking staff For a moment those present would not have given half a crown for both the crowns of the commissioners but Peter Stuyvesant repressed his mighty wrath and stayed his hand he scanned the varlets from head to foot satchels and all with a look of ineffable scorn then strode into the house slammed the door after him and commanded that they should never again be admitted to his presence The knowing commissioners winked to each other and made a certificate on the spot that the governor had refused to answer their interrogatories or to submit to their examination They then proceeded to rummage about the city for two or three days in quest of what they called evidence perplexing Indians and old women with their cross questioning until they had stuffed their satchels and saddle bags with all kinds of apocryphal tales rumors and calumnies with these they mounted their Narraganset pacers and travelled back to the grand council Neither did the proud hearted Peter trouble himself to hinder their researches nor impede their departure he was too mindful of their sacred character as envoys but I warrant me had they played the same tricks with William the Testy he would have had them tucked up by the waistband and treated to an aerial gambol on his patent gallows CHAPTER VII The grand council of the east held a solemn meeting on the return of their envoys As no advocate appeared in behalf of Peter Stuyvesant everything went against him His haughty refusal to submit to the questioning of the commissioners was construed into a consciousness of guilt The contents of the satchels and saddle bags were poured forth before the council and appeared a mountain of evidence A pale bilious orator took the floor and declaimed for hours and in belligerent terms He was one of those furious zealots who blow the bellows of faction until the whole furnace of politics is red hot with sparks and cinders What was it to him if he should set the house on fire so that he might boil his pot by the blaze He was from the borders of Connecticut his constituents lived by marauding their Dutch neighbors and were the greatest poachers in Christendom excepting the Scotch border nobles His eloquence had its effect and it was determined to set on foot an expedition against the Nieuw Nederlandts It was necessary however to prepare the public mind for this measure Accordingly the arguments of the orator were echoed from the pulpit for several succeeding Sundays and a crusade was preached up against Peter Stuyvesant and his devoted city This is the first we hear of the drum ecclesiastic beating up for recruits in worldly warfare in our country It has since been called into frequent use A cunning politician often lurks under the clerical robe things spiritual and things temporal are strangely jumbled together like drugs on an apothecary s shelf and instead of a peaceful sermon the simple seeker after righteousness has often a political pamphlet thrust down his throat labeled with a pious text from Scripture And now nothing was talked of but an expedition against the Manhattoes It pleased the populace who had a vehement prejudice against the Dutch considering them a vastly inferior race who had sought the new world for the lucre of gain not the liberty of conscience who were mere heretics and infidels inasmuch as the refused to believe in witches and sea serpents and had faith in the virtues of horse shoes nailed to the door ate pork without molasses held pumpkins in contempt and were in perpetual breach of the eleventh commandment of all true Yankees Thou shalt have codfish dinners on Saturdays No sooner did Peter Stuyvesant get wind of the storm that was brewing in the east than he set to work to prepare for it He was not one of those economical rulers who postpone the expense of fortifying until the enemy is at the door There is nothing he would say that keeps off enemies and crows more than the smell of gunpowder He proceeded therefore with all diligence to put the province and its metropolis in a posture of defence Among the remnants which remained from the days of William the Testy were the militia laws by which the inhabitants were obliged to turn out twice a year with such military equipments as it pleased God and were put under the command of tailors and man milliners who though on ordinary occasions they might have been the meekest most pippin hearted little men in the world were very devils at parades when they had cocked hats on their heads and swords by their sides Under the instructions of these periodical warriors the peaceful burghers of the Manhattoes were schooled in iron war and became so hardy in the process of time that they could march through sun and rain from one end of the town to the other without flinching and so intrepid and adroit that they could face to the right wheel to the left and fare without winking or blinking Peter Stuyvesant like all old soldiers who have seen service and smelt gunpowder had no great respect for militia troops however he determined to give them a trial and accordingly called for a general muster inspection and review But O Mars and Bellona what a turning out was here Here came old Roelant Cuckaburt with a short blunderbuss on his shoulder and a long horseman s sword trailing by his side and Barent Dirkson with something that looked like a copper kettle turned upside down on his head and a couple of old horse pistols in his belt and Dirk Volkertson with a long duck fowling piece without any ramrod and a host more armed higgledy piggledy with swords hatchets snickersnees crowbars broomsticks and what not the officers distinguished from the rest by having their slouched hats cocked up with pins and surmounted with cocktail feathers The sturdy Peter eyed this nondescript host with some such rueful aspect as a man would eye the devil and determined to give his feather bed soldiers a seasoning He accordingly put them through their manual exercise over and over again trudged them backwards and forwards about the streets of New Amsterdam until their short legs ached and their fat sides sweated again and finally encamped them in the evening on the summit of a hill without the city to give them a taste of camp life intending the next day to renew the toils and perils of the field But so it came to pass that in the night there fell a great and heavy rain and melted away the army so that in the morning when Gaffer Phoebus shed his first beams upon the camp scarce a warrior remained excepting Peter Stuyvesant and his trumpeter Van Corlear This awful desolation of a whole army would have appalled a commander of less nerve but it served to confirm Peter s want of confidence in the militia system which he thenceforward used to call in joke for he sometimes indulged in a joke William the Testy s broken reed He now took into his service a goodly number of burly broad shouldered broad bottomed Dutchmen whom he paid in good silver and gold and of whom he boasted that whether they could stand fire or not they were at least water proof He fortified the city too with pickets and palisadoes extending across the island from river to river and above all cast up mud batteries or redoubts on the point of the island where it divided the beautiful bosom of the bay These latter redoubts in process of time came to be pleasantly overrun by a carpet of grass and clover and overshadowed by wide spreading elms and sycamores among the branches of which the birds would build their nests and rejoice the ear with their melodious notes Under these trees too the old burghers would smoke their afternoon pipe contemplating the golden sun as he sank in the west an emblem of the tranquil end toward which they were declining Here too would the young men and maidens of the town take their evening stroll watching the silver moon beams as they trembled along the calm bosom of the bay or lit up the sail of some gliding bark and peradventure interchanging the soft vows of honest affection for to evening strolls in this favored spot were traced most of the marriages in New Amsterdam Such was the origin of that renowned promenade The Battery which though ostensibly devoted to the stern purposes of war has ever been consecrated to the sweet delights of peace The scene of many a gambol in happy childhood of many a tender assignation in riper years of many a soothing walk in declining age the healthful resort of the feeble invalid the Sunday refreshment of the dusty tradesman in fine the ornament and delight of New York and the pride of the lovely island of Manna hata CHAPTER VIII Having thus provided for the temporary security of New Amsterdam and guarded it against any sudden surprise the gallant Peter took a hearty pinch of snuff and snapping his fingers set the great council of Amphictyons and their champion the redoubtable Alicxsander Partridg at defiance In the meantime the moss troopers of Connecticut the warriors of New Haven and Hartford and Pyquag otherwise called Weathersfield famous for its onions and its witches and of all the other border towns were in a prodigious turmoil furbishing up their rusty weapons shouting aloud for war and anticipating easy conquests and glorious rummaging of the fat little Dutch villages In the midst of these warlike preparations however they received the chilling news that the colony of Massachusetts refused to back them in this righteous war It seems that the gallant conduct of Peter Stuyvesant the generous warmth of his vindication and the chivalrous spirit of his defiance though lost upon the grand council of the league had carried conviction to the general court of Massachusetts which nobly refused to believe him guilty of the villainous plot laid at his door forty three The defection of so important a colony paralysed the councils of the league Some such dissension arose among its members as prevailed of yore in the camp of the brawling warriors of Greece and in the end the crusade against the Manhattoes was abandoned It is said that the moss troopers of Connecticut were sorely disappointed well for them that their belligerent cravings were not gratified for by my faith whatever might have been the ultimate result of a conflict with all the powers of the east in the interim the stomachful heroes of Pyquag would have been choked with their own onions and all the border towns of Connecticut would have had such a scouring from the lion hearted Peter and his robustious myrmidons that I warrant me they would not have had the stomach to squat on the land or invade the hen roost of a Nederlander for a century to come But it was not merely the refusal of Massachusetts to join in their unholy crusade that confounded the councils of the league for about this time broke out in the New England provinces the awful plague of witchcraft which spread like pestilence through the land Such a howling abomination could not be suffered to remain long unnoticed it soon excited the fiery indignation of those guardians of the commonwealth who whilom had evinced such active benevolence in the conversion of Quakers and Anabaptists The grand council of the league publicly set their faces against the crime and bloody laws were enacted against all solem conversing or compacting with the devil by the way of conjuracion or the like forty four Strict search too was made after witches who were easily detected by devil s pinches by being able to weep but three tears and those out of the left eye and by having a most suspicious predilection for black cats and broomsticks What is particularly worthy of admiration is that this terrible art which has baffled the studies and researches of philosophers astrologers theurgists and other sages was chiefly confined to the most ignorant decrepid and ugly old women in the community with scarce more brains than the broomsticks they rode upon When once an alarm is sounded the public who dearly love to be in a panic are always ready to keep it up Raise but the cry of yellow fever and immediately every headache indigestion and overflowing of the bile is pronounced the terrible epidemic cry out mad dog and every unlucky cur in the street is in jeopardy so in the present instance whoever was troubled with colic or lumbago was sure to be bewitched and woe to any unlucky old woman living in the neighborhood It is incredible the number of offences that were detected for every one of which says the Reverend Cotton Mather in that excellent work the History of New England we have such a sufficient evidence that no reasonable man in this whole country ever did question them and it will be unreasonable to do it in any other forty five Indeed that authentic and judicious historian John Josselyn gent furnishes us with unquestionable facts on this subject There are none observes he that beg in this country but there be witches too many bottle bellied witches and others that produce many strange apparitions if you will believe report of a shallop at sea manned with women and of a ship and great red horse standing by the mainmast the ship being in a small cove to the eastward vanished of a sudden et cetera The number of delinquents however and their magical devices were not more remarkable than their diabolical obstinacy Though exhorted in the most solemn persuasive and affectionate manner to confess themselves guilty and be burnt for the good of religion and the entertainment of the public yet did they most pertinaciously persist in asserting their innocence Such incredible obstinacy was in itself deserving of immediate punishment and was sufficient proof if proof were necessary that they were in league with the devil who is perverseness itself But their judges were just and merciful and were determined to punish none that were not convicted on the best of testimony not that they needed any evidence to satisfy their own minds for like true and experienced judges their minds were perfectly made up and they were thoroughly satisfied of the guilt of the prisoners before they proceeded to try them but still something was necessary to convince the community at large to quiet those praying quidnuncs who should come after them in short the world must be satisfied Oh the world the world all the world knows the world of trouble the world is eternally occasioning The worthy judges therefore were driven to the necessity of sifting detecting and making evident as noonday matters which were at the commencement all clearly understood and firmly decided upon in their own pericraniums so that it may truly be said that the witches were burnt to gratify the populace of the day but were tried for the satisfaction of the whole world that should come after them Finding therefore that neither exhortation sound reason nor friendly entreaty had any avail on these hardened offenders they resorted to the more urgent arguments of torture and having thus absolutely wrung the truth from their stubborn lips they condemned them to undergo the roasting due unto the heinous crimes they had confessed Some even carried their perverseness so far as to expire under the torture protesting their innocence to the last but these were looked upon as thoroughly and absolutely possessed by the devil and the pious bystanders only lamented that they had not lived a little longer to have perished in the flames In the city of Ephesus we are told that the plague was expelled by stoning a ragged old beggar to death whom Apollonius pointed out as being the evil spirit that caused it and who actually showed himself to be a demon by changing into a shagged dog In like manner and by measures equally sagacious a salutary check was given to this growing evil The witches were all burnt banished or panic stuck and in a little while there was not an ugly old woman to be found throughout New England which is doubtless one reason why all the young women there are so handsome Those honest folk who had suffered from their incantations gradually recovered excepting such as had been afflicted with twitches and aches which however assumed the less alarming aspects of rheumatism ciatics and lumbagos and the good people of New England abandoning the study of the occult sciences turned their attention to the more profitable hocus pocus of trade and soon became expert in the legerdemain art of turning a penny Still however a tinge of the old leaven is discernible even unto this day in their characters witches occasionally start up among them in different disguises as physicians civilians and divines The people at large show a keenness a cleverness and a profundity of wisdom that savors strongly of witchcraft and it has been remarked that whenever any stones fall from the moon the greater part of them is sure to tumble into New England FOOTNOTES forty three Hazard s State Papers forty four New Plymouth Record forty five Mather s Hist New Eng b vi ch seven CHAPTER IX When treating of these tempestuous times the unknown writer of the Stuyvesant manuscript breaks out into an apostrophe in praise of the good saint Nicholas to whose protecting care he ascribes the dissensions which broke out in the council of the league and the direful witchcraft which filled all Yankee land as with Egyptian darkness A portentous gloom says he hung lowering over the fair valleys of the east the pleasant banks of the Connecticut no longer echoed to the sounds of rustic gayety grisly phantoms glided about each wild brook and silent glen fearful apparitions were seen in the air strange voices were heard in solitary places and the border towns were so occupied in detecting and punishing losel witches that for a time all talk of war was suspended and New Amsterdam and its inhabitants seemed to be totally forgotten I must not conceal the fact that at one time there was some danger of this plague of witchcraft extending into the New Netherlands and certain witches mounted on broomsticks are said to have been seen whisking in the air over some of the Dutch villages near the borders but the worthy Nederlanders took the precaution to nail horse shoes to their doors which it is well known are effectual barriers against all diabolical vermin of the kind Many of those horse shoes may be seen at this very day on ancient mansions and barns remaining from the days of the patriarchs nay the custom is still kept up among some of our legitimate Dutch yeomanry who inherit from their forefathers a desire to keep witches and Yankees out of the country And now the great Peter having no immediate hostility to apprehend from the east turned his face with characteristic vigilance to his southern frontiers The attentive reader will recollect that certain freebooting Swedes had become very troublesome in this quarter in the latter part of the reign of William the Testy setting at naught the proclamations of that veritable potentate and putting his admiral the intrepid Jan Jensen Alpendam to a perfect nonplus To check the incursions of these Swedes Peter Stuyvesant now ordered a force to that frontier giving the command of it to General Jacobus Van Poffenburgh an officer who had risen to great importance during the reign of Wilhelmus Kieft He had if histories speak true been second in command to the doughty Van Curlet when he and his warriors were inhumanly kicked out of Fort Goed Hoop by the Yankees In that memorable affair Van Poffenburgh is said to have received more kicks in a certain honorable part than any of his comrades in consequence of which on the resignation of Van Curlet he had been promoted to his place being considered a hero who had seen service and suffered in his country s cause It is tropically observed by honest old Socrates that heaven infuses into some men at their birth a portion of intellectual gold into others of intellectual silver while others are intellectually furnished with iron and brass Of the last class was General Van Poffenburgh and it would seem as if Dame Nature who will sometimes be partial had given him brass enough for a dozen ordinary braziers All this he had contrived to pass off upon William the Testy for genuine gold and the little governor would sit for hours and listen to his gunpowder stories of exploits which left those of Tirante the White Don Belianis of Greece or saint George and the Dragon quite in the background Having been promoted by William Kieft to the command of his whole disposable forces he gave importance to his station by the grandiloquence of his bulletins always styling himself Commander in Chief of the Armies of the New Netherlands though in sober truth these Armies were nothing more than a handful of hen stealing bottle bruising ragamuffins In person he was not very tall but exceedingly round neither did his bulk proceed from his being fat but windy being blown up by a prodigious conviction of his own importance until he resembled one of those bags of wind given by AEolus in an incredible fit of generosity to that vagabond warrior Ulysses His windy endowments had long excited the admiration of Antony Van Corlear who is said to have hinted more than once to William the Testy that in making Van Poffenburgh a general he had spoiled an admirable trumpeter As it is the practice in ancient story to give the reader a description of the arms and equipments of every noted warrior I will bestow a word upon the dress of this redoubtable commander It comported with his character being so crossed and slashed and embroidered with lace and tinsel that he seemed to have as much brass without as nature had stored away within He was swathed too in a crimson sash of the size and texture of a fishing net doubtless to keep his swelling heart from bursting through his ribs His face glowed with furnace heat from between a huge pair of well powdered whiskers and his valorous soul seemed ready to bounce out of a pair of large glassy blinking eyes projecting like those of a lobster I swear to thee worthy reader if history and tradition belie not this warrior I would give all the money in my pocket to have seen him accoutred cap a pie booted to the middle sashed to the chin collared to the ears whiskered to the teeth crowned with an overshadowing cocked hat and girded with a leathern belt ten inches broad from which trailed a falchion of a length that I dare not mention Thus equipped he strutted about as bitter looking a man of war as the far famed More of More Hall when he sallied forth to slay the Dragon of Wantley For what says the ballad Had you but seen him in this dress How fierce he looked and how big You would have thought him for to be Some Egyptian porcupig He frighted all cats dogs and all Each cow each horse and each hog For fear did flee for they took him to be Some strange outlandish hedgehog forty six I must confess this general with all his outward valor and ventosity was not exactly an officer to Peter Stuyvesant s taste but he stood foremost in the army list of William the Testy and it is probable the good Peter who was conscientious in his dealings with all men and had his military notions of precedence thought it but fair to give him a chance of proving his right to his dignities To this copper captain therefore was confided the command of the troops destined to protect the southern frontier and scarce had he departed from his station than bulletins began to arrive from him describing his undaunted march through savage deserts over insurmountable mountains across impassable rivers and through impenetrable forests conquering vast tracts of uninhabited country and encountering more perils than did Xenophon in his far famed retreat with his ten thousand Grecians Peter Stuyvesant read all these grandiloquent dispatches with a dubious screwing of the mouth and shaking of the head but Antony Van Corlear repeated these contents in the streets and market places with an appropriate flourish upon his trumpet and the windy victories of the general resounded through the streets of New Amsterdam On arriving at the southern frontier Van Poffenburgh proceeded to erect a fortress or stronghold on the South of Delaware river At first he bethought him to call it Fort Stuyvesant in honor of the governor a lowly kind of homage prevalent in our country among speculators military commanders and office seekers of all kinds by which our maps come to be studded with the names of political patrons and temporary great men in the present instance Van Poffenburgh carried his homage to the most lowly degree giving his fortress the name of Fort Casimir in honor it is said of a favorite pair of brimstone trunk breeches of his excellency As this fort will be found to give rise to important events it may be worth while to notice that it was afterwards called Nieuw Amstel and was the germ of the present flourishing town of Newcastle or more properly speaking No Castle there being nothing of the kind on the premises His fortress being finished it would have done any man s heart good to behold the swelling dignity with which the general would stride in and out a dozen times a day surveying it in front and in rear on this side and on that how he would strut backwards and forwards in full regimentals on the top of the ramparts like a vain glorious cock pigeon swelling and vaporing on the top of a dovecote There is a kind of valorous spleen which like wind is apt to grow unruly in the stomachs of newly made soldiers compelling them to box lobby brawls and brokenheaded quarrels unless there can be found some more harmless way to give it vent It is recorded in the delectable romance of Pierce Forest that a young knight being dubbed by King Alexander did incontinently gallop into an adjacent forest and belabor the trees with such might and main that he not merely eased off the sudden effervescence of his valor but convinced the whole court that he was the most potent and courageous cavalier on the face of the earth In like manner the commander of Fort Casimir when he found his martial spirit waxing too hot within him would sally forth into the fields and lay about him most lustily with his sabre decapitating cabbages by platoons hewing down lofty sunflowers which he termed gigantic Swedes and if perchance he espied a colony of big bellied pumpkins quietly basking in the sun Ah caitiff Yankees would he roar have I caught ye at last So saying with one sweep of his sword he would cleave the unhappy vegetables from their chins to their waist bands by which warlike havoc his choler being in some sort allayed he would return into the fortress with the full conviction that he was a very miracle of military prowess He was a disciplinarian too of the first order Woe to any unlucky soldier who did not hold up his head and turn out his toes when on parade or who did not salute the general in proper style as he passed Having one day in his Bible researches encountered the history of Absalom and his melancholy end the general bethought him that in a country abounding with forests his soldiers were in constant risk of a like catastrophe he therefore in an evil hour issued orders for cropping the hair of both officers and men throughout the garrison Now so it happened that among his officers was a sturdy veteran named Keldermeester who had cherished through a long life a mop of hair not a little resembling the shag of a Newfoundland dog terminating in a queue like the handle of a frying pan and queued so tightly to his head that his eyes and mouth generally stood ajar and his eyebrows were drawn up to the top of his forehead It may naturally be supposed that the possessor of so goodly an appendage would resist with abhorrence an order condemning it to the shears On hearing the general orders he discharged a tempest of veteran soldier like oaths and dunder and blixums swore he would break any man s head who attempted to meddle with his tail queued it stiffer than ever and whisked it about the garrison as fiercely as the tail of a crocodile The eelskin queue of old Keldermeester became instantly an affair of the utmost importance The commander in chief was too enlightened an officer not to perceive that the discipline of the garrison the subordination and good order of the armies of the Nieuw Nederlands the consequent safety of the whole province and ultimately the dignity and prosperity of their High Mightinesses the Lords States General imperiously demanded the docking of that stubborn queue He decreed therefore that old Keldermeester should be publicly shorn of his glories in presence of the whole garrison the old man as resolutely stood on the defensive whereupon he was arrested and tried by a court martial for mutiny desertion and all the other list of offences noticed in the articles of war ending with a videlicet in wearing an eelskin queue three feet long contrary to orders Then came on arraignments and trials and pleadings and the whole garrison was in a ferment about this unfortunate queue As it is well known that the commander of a frontier post has the power of acting pretty much after his own will there is little doubt but that the veteran would have been hanged or shot at least had he not luckily fallen ill of a fever through mere chagrin and mortification and deserted from all earthly command with his beloved locks unviolated His obstinacy remained unshaken to the very last moment when he directed that he should be carried to his grave with his eelskin queue sticking out of a hole in his coffin This magnanimous affair obtained the general great credit as a disciplinarian but it is hinted that he was ever afterwards subject to bad dreams and fearful visitations in the night when the grizzly spectrum of old Keldermeester would stand sentinel by his bedside erect as a pump his enormous queue strutting out like the handle FOOTNOTES forty six Ballad of Dragon of Wantley BOOK VI

none	none	CHAPTER I Hitherto most venerable and courteous reader have I shown thee the administration of the valorous Stuyvesant under the mild moonshine of peace or rather the grim tranquillity of awful expectation but now the war drum rumbles from afar the brazen trumpet brays its thrilling note and the rude clash of hostile arms speaks fearful prophecies of coming troubles 
8051_295385_000006_000001	train-clean-100	The gallant warrior starts from soft repose from golden visions and voluptuous ease where in the dulcet piping time of peace he sought sweet solace after all his toils 
none	none	No more in Beauty s siren lap reclined he weaves fair garlands for his lady s brows no more entwines with flowers his shining sword nor through the livelong lazy summer s day chants forth his love sick soul in madrigals 
8051_295385_000006_000003	train-clean-100	To manhood roused he spurns the amorous flute doffs from his brawny back the robe of peace and clothes his pampered limbs in panoply of steel 
8051_295385_000006_000004	train-clean-100	O er his dark brow where late the myrtle waved where wanton roses breathed enervate love he rears the beaming casque and nodding plume grasps the bright shield and shakes the ponderous lance or mounts with eager pride his fiery steed and burns for deeds of glorious chivalry 
8051_295385_000007_000000	train-clean-100	But soft worthy reader 
none	none	I would not have you imagine that any preux chevalier thus hideously begirt with iron existed in the city of New Amsterdam This is but a lofty and gigantic mode in which we heroic writers always talk of war thereby to give it a noble and imposing aspect equipping our warriors with bucklers helms and lances and such like outlandish and obsolete weapons the like of which perchance they had never seen or heard of in the same manner that a cunning statuary arrays a modern general or an admiral in the accoutrements of a Caesar or an Alexander The simple truth then of all this oratorical flourish is this that the valiant Peter Stuyvesant all of a sudden found it necessary to scour his rusty blade which too long had rusted in its scabbard and prepare himself to undergo those hardy toils of war in which his mighty soul so much delighted 
8051_295385_000008_000000	train-clean-100	Methinks I at this moment behold him in my imagination or rather I behold his goodly portrait which still hangs in the family mansion of the Stuyvesants arrayed in all the terrors of a true Dutch general 
none	none	His regimental coat of German blue gorgeously decorated with a goodly show of large brass buttons reaching from his waistband to his chin the voluminous skirts turned up at the corners and separating gallantly behind so as to display the seat of a sumptuous pair of brimstone colored trunk breeches a graceful style still prevalent among the warriors of our day and which is in conformity to the custom of ancient heroes who scorned to defend themselves in rear His face rendered exceeding terrible and warlike by a pair of black mustachios his hair strutting out on each side in stiffly pomatumed ear locks and descending in a rat tail queue below his waist a shining stock of black leather supporting his chin and a little but fierce cocked hat stuck with a gallant and fiery air over his left eye Such was the chivalric port of Peter the Headstrong and when he made a sudden halt planted himself firmly on his solid supporter with his wooden leg inlaid with silver a little in advance in order to strengthen his position his right hand grasping a gold headed cane his left resting upon the pummel of his sword his head dressing spiritedly to the right with a most appalling and hard favored frown upon his brow he presented altogether one of the most commanding bitter looking and soldier like figures that ever strutted upon canvas Proceed we now to inquire the cause of this warlike preparation 
8051_295385_000009_000000	train-clean-100	In the preceding chapter we have spoken of the founding of Fort Casimir and of the merciless warfare waged by its commander upon cabbages sunflowers and pumpkins for want of better occasion to flesh his sword Now it came to pass that higher up the Delaware at his stronghold of Tinnekonk resided one Jan Printz who styled himself Governor of New Sweden 
none	none	If history belie not this redoubtable Swede he was a rival worthy of the windy and inflated commander of Fort Casimir for Master David Pieterzen de Vrie in his excellent book of voyages describes him as weighing upwards of four hundred pounds a huge feeder and bouser in proportion taking three potations pottle deep at every meal 
8051_295385_000009_000002	train-clean-100	He had a garrison after his own heart at Tinnekonk guzzling deep drinking swashbucklers who made the wild woods ring with their carousals 
8051_295385_000010_000000	train-clean-100	No sooner did this robustious commander hear of the erection of Fort Casimir than he sent a message to Van Poffenburgh warning him off the land as being within the bounds of his jurisdiction 
8051_295385_000011_000000	train-clean-100	To this General Van Poffenburgh replied that the land belonged to their High Mightinesses having been regularly purchased of the natives as discoverers from the Manhattoes as witness the breeches of their land measurer Ten Broeck 
8051_295385_000012_000000	train-clean-100	To this the governor rejoined that the land had previously been sold by the Indians to the Swedes and consequently was under the petticoat government of her Swedish majesty Christina and woe be to any mortal that wore a breeches who should dare to meddle even with the hem of her sacred garment 
8051_295385_000013_000000	train-clean-100	I forbear to dilate upon the war of words which was kept up for some time by these windy commanders Van Poffenburgh however had served under William the Testy and was a veteran in this kind of warfare 
8051_295385_000013_000001	train-clean-100	Governor Printz finding he was not to be dislodged by these long shots now determined upon coming to closer quarters 
8051_295385_000013_000002	train-clean-100	Accordingly he descended the river in great force and fume and erected a rival fortress just one Swedish mile below Fort Casimir to which he gave the name of Helsenburg 
8051_295385_000014_000000	train-clean-100	And now commenced a tremendous rivalry between these two doughty commanders striving to outstrut and outswell each other like a couple of belligerent turkey cocks 
8051_295385_000014_000001	train-clean-100	There was a contest who should run up the tallest flag staff and display the broadest flag all day long there was a furious rolling of drums and twanging of trumpets in either fortress and whichever had the wind in its favor would keep up a continual firing of cannon to taunt its antagonist with the smell of gunpowder 
8051_295385_000015_000000	train-clean-100	On all these points of windy warfare the antagonists were well matched but so it happened that the Swedish fortress being lower down the river all the Dutch vessels bound to Fort Casimir with supplies had to pass it 
8051_295385_000015_000001	train-clean-100	Governor Printz at once took advantage of this circumstance and compelled them to lower their flags as they passed under the guns of his battery 
none	none	This was a deadly wound to the Dutch pride of General Van Poffenburgh and sorely would he swell when from the ramparts of Fort Casimir he beheld the flag of their High Mightinesses struck to the rival fortress 
8051_295385_000016_000001	train-clean-100	To heighten his vexation Governor Printz who as has been shown was a huge trencherman took the liberty of having the first rummage of every Dutch merchant ship and securing to himself and his guzzling garrison all the little round Dutch cheeses all the Dutch herrings the gingerbread the sweetmeats the curious stone jugs of gin and all the other Dutch luxuries on their way for the solace of Fort Casimir 
8051_295385_000016_000002	train-clean-100	It is possible he may have paid to the Dutch skippers the full value of their commodities but what consolation was this to Jacobus Van Poffenburgh and his garrison who thus found their favorite supplies cut off and diverted into the larders of the hostile camps 
8051_295385_000016_000003	train-clean-100	For some time this war of the cupboard was carried on to the great festivity and jollification of the Swedes while the warriors of Fort Casimir found their hearts or rather their stomachs daily failing them 
none	none	At length the summer heats and summer showers set in and now lo and behold a great miracle was wrought for the relief of the Nederlands not a little resembling one of the plagues of Egypt for it came to pass that a great cloud of mosquitos arose out of the marshy borders of the river and settled upon the fortress of Helsenburg being doubtless attracted by the scent of the fresh blood of the Swedish gormandisers Nay it is said that the body of Jan Printz alone which was as big and as full of blood as that of a prize ox was sufficient to attract the mosquito from every part of the country For some time the garrison endeavored to hold out but it was all in vain the mosquitos penetrated into every chink and crevice and gave them no rest day nor night and as to Governor Jan Printz he moved about as in a cloud with mosquito music in his ears and mosquito stings to the very end of his nose Finally the garrison was fairly driven out of the fortress and obliged to retreat to Tinnekonk nay it is said that the mosquitos followed Jan Printz even thither and absolutely drove him out of the country certain it is he embarked for Sweden shortly afterward and Jan Claudius Risingh was sent to govern New Sweden in his stead Such was the famous mosquito war on the Delaware of which General Van Poffenburgh would fain have been the hero but the devout people of the Nieuw Nederlands always ascribed the discomfiture of the Swedes to the miraculous intervention of saint Nicholas As to the fortress of Helsenburg it fell to ruin but the story of its strange destruction was perpetuated by the Swedish name of Myggen borg that is to say Mosquito Castle forty seven FOOTNOTES forty seven Acrelius History N Sweden For some notices of this miraculous discomfiture of the Swedes see N Y Hist colonel new series vol i p four hundred twelve CHAPTER II Jan Claudius Risingh who succeeded to the command of New Sweden looms largely in ancient records as a gigantic Swede who had he not been rather knock kneed and splay footed might have served for the model of a Samson or a Hercules He was no less rapacious than mighty and withal as crafty as he was rapacious so that there is very little doubt that had he lived some four or five centuries since he would have figured as one of those wicked giants who took a cruel pleasure in pocketing beautiful princesses and distressed damsels when gadding about the world and locking them up in enchanted castles without a toilet a change of linen or any other convenience In consequence of which enormities they fell under the high displeasure of chivalry and all true loyal and gallant knights were instructed to attack and slay outright any miscreant they might happen to find above six feet high which is doubtless one reason why the race of large men is nearly extinct and the generations of latter ages are so exceedingly small Governor Risingh not withstanding his giantly condition was as I have hinted a man of craft He was not a man to ruffle the vanity of General Van Poffenburgh or to rub his self conceit against the grain On the contrary as he sailed up the Delaware he paused before Fort Casimir displayed his flag and fired a royal salute before dropping anchor The salute would doubtless have been returned had not the guns been dismounted as it was a veteran sentinel who had been napping at his post and had suffered his match to go out returned the compliment by discharging his musket with the spark of a pipe borrowed from a comrade Governor Risingh accepted this as a courteous reply and treated the fortress to a second salute well knowing its commander was apt to be marvelously delighted with these little ceremonials considering them so many acts of homage paid to his greatness He then prepared to land with a military retinue of thirty men a prodigious pageant in the wilderness And now took place a terrible rummage and racket in Fort Casimir to receive such a visitor in proper style and to make an imposing appearance The main guard was turned out as soon as possible equipped to the best advantage in the few suits of regimentals which had to do duty by turns with the whole garrison One tall lank fellow appeared in a little man s coat with the buttons between his shoulders the skirts scarce covering his bottom his hands hanging like spades out of the sleeves and the coat linked in front by worsted loops made out of a pair of red garters Another had a cocked hat stuck on the back of his head and decorated with a bunch of cocks tails a third had a pair of rusty gaiters hanging about his heels while a fourth a little duck legged fellow was equipped in a pair of the general s cast off breeches which he held up with one hand while he grasped his firelock with the other The rest were accoutred in similar style excepting three ragamuffins without shirts and with but a pair and a half of breeches between them wherefore they were sent to the black hole to keep them out of sight that they might not disgrace the fortress His men being thus gallantly arrayed those who lacked muskets shouldering spades and pickaxes and every man being ordered to tuck in his shirttail and pull up his brogues General Van Poffenburgh first took a sturdy draught of foaming ale which like the magnanimous More of More Hall forty eight was his invariable practice on all great occasions this done he put himself at their head and issued forth from his castle like a mighty giant just refreshed with wine But when the two heroes met then began a scene of warlike parade that beggars all description The shrewd Risingh who had grown grey much before his time in consequence of his craftiness saw at one glance the ruling passion of the great Van Poffenburgh and humored him in all his valorous fantasies Their detachments were accordingly drawn up in front of each other they carried arms and they presented arms they gave the standing salute and the passing salute they rolled their drums they flourished their fifes and they waved their colors they faced to the left and they faced to the right and they faced to the right about they wheeled forward and they wheeled backward and they wheeled into echelon they marched and they countermarched by grand divisions by single divisions and by subdivisions by platoons by sections and by files in quick time in slow time and in no time at all for having gone through all the evolutions of two great armies including the eighteen manoeuvres of Dundas having exhausted all that they could recollect or image of military tactics including sundry strange and irregular evolutions the like of which were never seen before or since excepting among certain of our newly raised militia the two commanders and their respective troops came at length to a dead halt completely exhausted by the toils of war Never did two valiant train band captains or two buskined theatric heroes in the renowned tragedies of Pizarro Tom Thumb or any other heroical and fighting tragedy marshal their gallows looking duck legged heavy heeled myrmidons with more glory and self admiration These military compliments being finished General Van Poffenburgh escorted his illustrious visitor with great ceremony into the fort attended him throughout the fortifications showed him the horn works crown works half moons and various other outworks or rather the places where they ought to be erected and where they might be erected if he pleased plainly demonstrating that it was a place of great capability and though at present but a little redoubt yet that it was evidently a formidable fortress in embryo This survey over he next had the whole garrison put under arms exercised and reviewed and concluded by ordering the three Bridewell birds to be hauled out of the black hole brought up to the halberds and soundly flogged for the amusement of his visitors and to convince him that he was a great disciplinarian The cunning Risingh while he pretended to be struck dumb outright with the puissance of the great Van Poffenburgh took silent note of the incompetency of his garrison of which he gave a wink to his trusty followers who tipped each other the wink and laughed most obstreperously in their sleeves The inspection review and flogging being concluded the party adjourned to the table for among his other great qualities the general was remarkably addicted to huge carousals and in one afternoon s campaign would leave more dead men on the field than he ever did in the whole course of his military career Many bulletins of these bloodless victories do still remain on record and the whole province was once thrown in amaze by the return of one of his campaigns wherein it was stated that though like Captain Bobadil he had only twenty men to back him yet in the short space of six months he had conquered and utterly annihilated sixty oxen ninety hogs one hundred sheep ten thousand cabbages one thousand bushels of potatoes one hundred and fifty kilderkins of small beer two thousand seven hundred and thirty five pipes seventy eight pounds of sugar plums and forty bars of iron besides sundry small meats game poultry and garden stuff an achievement unparalleled since the days of Pantagruel and his all devouring army and which showed that it was only necessary to let Van Poffenburgh and his garrison loose in an enemy s country and in a little while they would breed a famine and starve all the inhabitants No sooner therefore had the general received intimation of the visit of Governor Risingh than he ordered a great dinner to be prepared and privately sent out a detachment of his most experienced veterans to rob all the hen roosts in the neighborhood and lay the pigstyes under contribution a service which they discharged with such zeal and promptitude that the garrison table groaned under the weight of their spoils I wish with all my heart my readers could see the valiant Van Poffenburgh as he presided at the head of the banquet it was a sight worth beholding there he sat in his greatest glory surrounded by his soldiers like that famous wine bibber Alexander whose thirsty virtues he did most ably imitate telling astounding stories of his hair breadth adventures and heroic exploits at which though all his auditors knew them to be incontinent lies and outrageous gasconades yet did they cast up their eyes in admiration and utter many interjections of astonishment Nor could the general pronounce anything that bore the remotest resemblance to a joke but the stout Risingh would strike his brawny fist upon the table till every glass rattled again throw himself back in the chair utter gigantic peals of laughter and swear most horribly it was the best joke he ever heard in his life Thus all was rout and revelry and hideous carousal within Fort Casimir and so lustily did Van Poffenburgh ply the bottle that in less than four short hours he made himself and his whole garrison who all sedulously emulated the deeds of their chieftain dead drunk with singing songs quaffing bumpers and drinking patriotic toasts none of which but was as long as a Welsh pedigree or a plea in Chancery No sooner did things come to this pass than Risingh and his Swedes who had cunningly kept themselves sober rose on their entertainers tied them neck and heels and took formal possession of the fort and all its dependencies in the name of Queen Christina of Sweden administering at the same time an oath of allegiance to all the Dutch soldiers who could be made sober enough to swallow it Risingh then put the fortifications in order appointed his discreet and vigilant friend Suen Schute otherwise called Skytte a tall wind dried water drinking Swede to the command and departed bearing with him this truly amiable garrison and its puissant commander who when brought to himself by a sound drubbing bore no little resemblance to a deboshed fish or bloated sea monster caught upon dry land The transportation of the garrison was done to prevent the transmission of intelligence to New Amsterdam for much as the cunning Risingh exulted in his stratagem yet did he dread the vengeance of the sturdy Peter Stuyvesant whose name spread as much terror in the neighborhood as did whilom that of the unconquerable Scanderbeg among his scurvy enemies the Turks FOOTNOTES forty eight As soon as he rose To make him strong and mighty He drank by the tale six pots of ale And a quart of aqua vitae Dragon of Wantley CHAPTER III Whoever first described common fame or rumor as belonging to the sager sex was a very owl for shrewdness She has in truth certain feminine qualities to an astonishing degree particularly that benevolent anxiety to take care of the affairs of others which keeps her continually hunting after secrets and gadding about proclaiming them Whatever is done openly and in the face of the world she takes but transient notice of but whenever a transaction is done in a corner and attempted to be shrouded in mystery then her goddess ship is at her wits end to find it out and takes a most mischievous and lady like pleasure in publishing it to the world It is this truly feminine propensity which induces her continually to be prying into the cabinets of princes listening at the key holes of senate chambers and peering through chinks and crannies when our worthy congress are sitting with closed doors deliberating between a dozen excellent modes of ruining the nation It is this which makes her so baneful to all wary statesmen and intriguing commanders such a stumbling block to private negotiations and secret expeditions betraying them by means and instruments which never would have been thought of by any but a female head Thus it was in the case of the affair of Fort Casimir No doubt the cunning Risingh imagined that by securing the garrison he should for a long time prevent the history of its fate from reaching the ears of the gallant Stuyvesant but his exploit was blown to the world when he least expected and by one of the last beings he would ever have suspected of enlisting as trumpeter to the wide mouthed deity This was one Dirk Schuiler or Skulker a kind of hanger on to the garrison who seemed to belong to nobody and in a manner to be self outlawed He was one of those vagabond cosmopolites who shark about the world as if they had no right or business in it and who infest the skirts of society like poachers and interlopers Every garrison and country village has one or more scapegoats of this kind whose life is a kind of enigma whose existence is without motive who comes from the Lord knows where who lives the Lord knows how and who seems created for no other earthly purpose but to keep up the ancient and honorable order of idleness This vagrant philosopher was supposed to have some Indian blood in his veins which was manifested by a certain Indian complexion and cast of countenance but more especially by his propensities and habits He was a tall lank fellow swift of foot and long winded He was generally equipped in a half Indian dress with belt leggings and moccasins His hair hung in straight gallows locks about his ears and added not a little to his sharking demeanor It is an old remark that persons of Indian mixture are half civilized half savage and half devil a third half being provided for their particular convenience It is for similar reasons and probably with equal truth that the backwoodsmen of Kentucky are styled half man half horse and half alligator by the settlers on the Mississippi and held accordingly in great respect and abhorrence The above character may have presented itself to the garrison as applicable to Dirk Schuiler whom they familiarly dubbed Gallows Dirk Certain it is he acknowledged allegiance to no one was an utter enemy to work holding it in no manner of estimation but lounging about the fort depending upon chance for a subsistence getting drunk whenever he could get liquor and stealing whatever he could lay his hands on Every day or two he was sure to get a sound rib roasting for some of his misdemeanors which however as it broke no bones he made very light of and scrupled not to repeat the offence whenever another opportunity presented Sometimes in consequence of some flagrant villainy he would abscond from the garrison and be absent for a month at a time skulking about the woods and swamps with a long fowling piece on his shoulder lying in ambush for game or squatting himself down on the edge of a pond catching fish for hours together and bearing no little resemblance to that notable bird of the crane family yclept the mudpoke When he thought his crimes had been forgotten or forgiven he would sneak back to the fort with a bundle of skins or a load of poultry which perchance he had stolen and would exchange them for liquor with which having well soaked his carcase he would lie in the sun and enjoy all the luxurious indolence of that swinish philosopher Diogenes He was the terror of all the farmyards in the country into which he made fearful inroads and sometimes he would make his sudden appearance in the garrison at daybreak with the whole neighborhood at his heels like the scoundrel thief of a fox detected in his maraudings and hunted to his hole Such was this Dirk Schuiler and from the total indifference he showed to the world and its concerns and from his truly Indian stoicism and taciturnity no one would ever have dreamt that he would have been the publisher of the treachery of Risingh When the carousal was going on which proved so fatal to the brave Poffenburgh and his watchful garrison Dirk skulked about from room to room being a kind of privileged vagrant or useless hound whom nobody noticed But though a fellow of few words yet like your taciturn people his eyes and ears were always open and in the course of his prowlings he overheard the whole plot of the Swedes Dirk immediately settled in his own mind how he should turn the matter to his own advantage He played the perfect jack of both sides that is to say he made a prize of everything that came in his reach robbed both parties stuck the copper bound cocked hat of the puissant Van Poffenburgh on his head whipped a huge pair of Risingh s jack boots under his arms and took to his heels just before the catastrophe and confusion at the garrison Finding himself completely dislodged from his haunt in this quarter he directed his flight towards his native place New Amsterdam whence he had formerly been obliged to abscond precipitately in consequence of misfortune in business that is to say having been detected in the act of sheep stealing After wandering many days in the woods toiling through swamps fording brooks swimming various rivers and encountering a world of hardships that would have killed any other being but an Indian a backwoodsman or the devil he at length arrived half famished and lank as a starved weasel at Communipaw where he stole a canoe and paddled over to New Amsterdam Immediately on landing he repaired to Governor Stuyvesant and in more words than he had ever spoken before in the whole course of his life gave an account of the disastrous affair On receiving these direful tidings the valiant Peter started from his seat dashed the pipe he was smoking against the back of the chimney thrust a prodigious quid of tobacco into his left cheek pulled up his galligaskins and strode up and down the room humming as was customary with him when in a passion a hideous north west ditty But as I have before shown he was not a man to vent his spleen in idle vaporing His first measure after the paroxysm of wrath had subsided was to stump upstairs to a huge wooden chest which served as his armory from whence he drew forth that identical suit of regimentals described in the preceding chapter In these portentous habiliment she arrayed himself like Achilles in the armor of Vulcan maintaining all the while an appalling silence knitting his brows and drawing his breath through his clenched teeth Being hastily equipped he strode down into the parlor and jerked down his trusty sword from over the fireplace where it was usually suspended but before he girded it on his thigh he drew it from its scabbard and as his eye coursed along the rusty blade a grim smile stole over his iron visage it was the first smile that had visited his countenance for five long weeks but every one who beheld it prophesied that there would soon be warm work in the province Thus armed at all points with grisly war depicted in each feature his very cocked hat assuming an air of uncommon defiance he instantly put himself upon the alert and dispatched Antony Van Corlear hither and thither this way and that way through all the muddy streets and crooked lanes of the city summoning by sound of trumpet his trusty peers to assemble in instant council This done by way of expediting matters according to the custom of people in a hurry he kept in continual bustle shifting from chair to chair popping his head out of every window and stumping up and downstairs with his wooden leg in such brisk and incessant motion that as we are informed by an authentic historian of the times the continual clatter bore no small resemblance to the music of a cooper hooping a flour barrel A summons so peremptory and from a man of the governor s mettle was not to be trifled with the sages forthwith repaired to the council chamber seated themselves with the utmost tranquillity and lighting their long pipes gazed with unruffled composure on his excellency and his regimentals being as all counsellors should be not easily flustered nor taken by surprise The governor looking around for a moment with a lofty and soldier like air and resting one hand on the pommel of his sword and flinging the other forth in a free and spirited manner addressed them in a short but soul stirring harangue I am extremely sorry that I have not the advantages of Livy Thucydides Plutarch and others of my predecessors who were furnished as I am told with the speeches of all their heroes taken down in short hand by the most accurate stenographers of the time whereby they were enabled wonderfully to enrich their histories and delight their readers with sublime strains of eloquence Not having such important auxiliaries I cannot possibly pronounce what was the tenor of Governor Stuyvesant s speech I am bold however to say from the tenor of his character that he did not wrap his rugged subject in silks and ermines and other sickly trickeries of phrase but spoke forth like a man of nerve and vigor who scorned to shrink in words from those dangers which he stood ready to encounter in very deed This much is certain that he concluded by announcing his determination to lead on his troops in person and rout these costard monger Swedes from their usurped quarters at Fort Casimir To this hardy resolution such of his council as were awake gave their usual signal of concurrence and as to the rest who had fallen asleep about the middle of the harangue their usual custom in the afternoon they made not the least objection And now was seen in the fair city of New Amsterdam a prodigious bustle and preparation for iron war Recruiting parties marched hither and thither calling lustily upon all the scrubs the runagates and tatterdemalions of the Manhattoes and its vicinity who had any ambition of sixpence a day and immortal fame into the bargain to enlist in the cause of glory for I would have you note that you warlike heroes who trudge in the rear of conquerors are generally of that illustrious class of gentlemen who are equal candidates for the army or the bridewell the halberds or the whipping post for whom Dame Fortune has cast an even die whether they shall make their exit by the sword or the halter and whose deaths shall at all events be a lofty example to their countrymen But not withstanding all this martial rout and invitation the ranks of honor were but scantily supplied so averse were the peaceful burghers of New Amsterdam from enlisting in foreign broils or stirring beyond that home which rounded all their earthly ideas Upon beholding this the great Peter whose noble heart was all on fire with war and sweet revenge determined to wait no longer for the tardy assistance of these oily citizens but to muster up his merry men of the Hudson who brought up among woods and wilds and savage beasts like our yeomen of Kentucky delighted in nothing so much as desperate adventures and perilous expeditions through the wilderness Thus resolving he ordered his trusty squire Antony Van Corlear to have his state galley prepared and duly victualed which being performed he attended public service at the great church of saint Nicholas like a true and pious governor and then leaving peremptory orders with his council to have the chivalry of the Manhattoes marshaled out and appointed against his return departed upon his recruiting voyage up the waters of the Hudson CHAPTER IV Now did the soft breezes of the south steal sweetly over the face of nature tempering the panting heats of summer into genial and prolific warmth when that miracle of hardihood and chivalric virtue the dauntless Peter Stuyvesant spread his canvas to the wind and departed from the fair island of Manna hata The galley in which he embarked was sumptuously adorned with pendants and streamers of gorgeous dyes which fluttered gayly in the wind or drooped their ends into the bosom of the stream The bow and poop of this majestic vessel were gallantly bedight after the rarest Dutch fashion with figures of little pursy Cupids with periwigs on their heads and bearing in their hands garlands of flowers the like of which are not to be found in any book of botany being the matchless flowers which flourished in the golden age and exist no longer unless it be in the imaginations of ingenious carvers of wood and discolorers of canvas Thus rarely decorated in style befitting the puissant potentate of the Manhattoes did the galley of Peter Stuyvesant launch forth upon the bosom of the lordly Hudson which as it rolled its broad waves to the ocean seemed to pause for a while and swell with pride as if conscious of the illustrious burden it sustained But trust me gentlefolk far other was the scene presented to the contemplation of the crew from that which may be witnessed at this degenerate day Wildness and savage majesty reigned on the borders of this mighty river the hand of cultivation had not as yet laid low the dark forest and tamed the features of the landscape nor had the frequent sail of commerce broken in upon the profound and awful solitude of ages Here and there might be seen a rude wigwam perched among the cliffs of the mountains with its curling column of smoke mounting in the transparent atmosphere but so loftily situated that the whoopings of the savage children gamboling on the margin of the dizzy heights fell almost as faintly on the ear as do the notes of the lark when lost in the azure vault of heaven Now and then from the beetling brow of some precipice the wild deer would look timidly down upon the splendid pageant as it passed below and then tossing his antlers in the air would bound away into the thickets of the forest Through such scenes did the stately vessel of Peter Stuyvesant pass Now did they skirt the bases of the rocky heights of Jersey which sprang up like everlasting walls reaching from the waves unto the heavens and were fashioned if tradition may be believed in times long past by the mighty spirit of Manetho to protect his favorite abodes from the unhallowed eyes of mortals Now did they career it gayly across the vast expanse of Tappan Bay whose wide extended shores present a variety of delectable scenery here the bold promontory crowned with embowering trees advancing into the bay there the long woodland slope sweeping up from the shore in rich luxuriance and terminating in the upland precipice while at a distance a long waving line of rocky heights threw their gigantic shades across the water Now would they pass where some modest little interval opening among these stupendous scenes yet retreating as it were for protection into the embraces of the neighboring mountains displayed a rural paradise fraught with sweet and pastoral beauties the velvet tufted lawn the bushy copse the tinkling rivulet stealing through the fresh and vivid verdure on whose banks was situated some little Indian village or peradventure the rude cabin of some solitary hunter The different periods of the revolving day seemed each with cunning magic to diffuse a different charm over the scene Now would the jovial sun break gloriously from the east blazing from the summits of the hills and sparkling the landscape with a thousand dewy gems while along the borders of the river were seen heavy masses of mist which like midnight caitiffs disturbed at his reproach made a sluggish retreat rolling in sullen reluctance upon the mountains As such times all was brightness and life and gayety the atmosphere was of an indescribable pureness and transparency the birds broke forth in wanton madrigals and the freshening breezes wafted the vessel merrily on her course But when the sun sunk amid a flood of glory in the west mantling the heavens and the earth with a thousand gorgeous dyes then all was calm and silent and magnificent The late swelling sail hung lifelessly against the mast the seamen with folded arms leaned against the shrouds lost in that involuntary musing which the sober grandeur of nature commands in the rudest of her children The vast bosom of the Hudson was like an unruffled mirror reflecting the golden splendor of the heavens excepting that now and then a bark canoe would steal across its surface filled with painted savages whose gay feathers glared brightly as perchance a lingering ray of the setting sun gleamed upon them from the western mountains But when the hour of twilight spread its majestic mists around then did the face of nature assume a thousand fugitive charms which to the worthy heart that seeks enjoyment in the glorious works of its Maker are inexpressibly captivating The mellow dubious light that prevailed just served to tinge with illusive colors the softened features of the scenery The deceived but delighted eye sought vainly to discern in the broad masses of shade the separating line between the land and water or to distinguish the fading objects that seemed sinking into chaos Now did the busy fancy supply the feebleness of vision producing with industrious craft a fairy creation of her own Under her plastic wand the barren rocks frowned upon the watery waste in the semblance of lofty towers and high embattled castles trees assumed the direful forms of mighty giants and the inaccessible summits of the mountains seemed peopled with a thousand shadowy beings Now broke forth from the shores the notes of an innumerable variety of insects which filled the air with a strange but not inharmonious concert while ever and anon was heard the melancholy plaint of the whip poor will who perched on some lone tree wearied the ear of night with his incessant moanings The mind soothed into a hallowed melancholy listened with pensive stillness to catch and distinguish each sound that vaguely echoed from the shore now and then startled perchance by the whoop of some straggling savage or by the dreary howl of a wolf stealing forth upon his nightly prowlings Thus happily did they pursue their course until they entered upon those awful defiles denominated the Highlands where it would seem that the gigantic Titans had erst waged their impious war with heaven piling up cliffs on cliffs and hurling vast masses of rock in wild confusion But in sooth very different is the history of these cloud capped mountains These in ancient days before the Hudson poured its waters from the lakes formed one vast prison within whose rocky bosom the omnipotent Manetho confined the rebellious spirits who repined at his control Here bound in adamantine chains or jammed in rifted pines or crushed by ponderous rocks they groaned for many an age At length the conquering Hudson in its career toward the ocean burst open their prison house rolling its tide triumphantly through the stupendous ruins Still however do many of them lurk about their old abodes and these it is according to venerable legends that cause the echoes which resound throughout these awful solitudes which are nothing but their angry clamors when any noise disturbs the profoundness of their repose For when the elements are agitated by tempest when the winds are up and the thunder rolls then horrible is the yelling and howling of these troubled spirits making the mountains to re bellow with their hideous uproar for at such times it is said that they think the great Manetho is returning once more to plunge them in gloomy caverns and renew their intolerable captivity But all these fair and glorious scenes were lost upon the gallant Stuyvesant nought occupied his mind but thoughts of iron war and proud anticipations of hardy deeds of arms Neither did his honest crew trouble their heads with any romantic speculations of the kind The pilot at the helm quietly smoked his pipe thinking of nothing either past present or to come those of his comrades who were not industriously smoking under the hatches were listening with open mouths to Antony Van Corlear who seated on the windlass was relating to them the marvelous history of those myriads of fireflies that sparkled like gems and spangles upon the dusky robe of night These according to tradition were originally a race of pestilent sempiternous beldames who peopled these parts long before the memory of man being of that abominated race emphatically called brimstones and who for their innumerable sins against the children of men and to furnish an awful warning to the beauteous sex were doomed to infest the earth in the shade of these threatening and terrible little bugs enduring the internal torments of that fire which they formerly carried in their hearts and breathed forth in their words but now are sentenced to bear about for ever in their tails And now I am going to tell a fact which I doubt much my readers will hesitate to believe but if they do they are welcome not to believe a word in this whole history for nothing which it contains is more true It must be known then that the nose of Antony the Trumpeter was of a very lusty size strutting boldly from his countenance like a mountain of Golconda being sumptuously bedecked with rubies and other precious stones the true regalia of a king of good fellows which jolly Bacchus grants to all who bouse it heartily at the flagon Now thus it happened that bright and early in the morning the good Antony having washed his burly visage was leaning over the quarter railing of the galley contemplating it in the glassy wave below Just at this moment the illustrious sun breaking in all his splendor from behind a high bluff of the Highlands did dart one of his most potent beams full upon the refulgent nose of the sounder of brass the reflection of which shot straightway down hissing hot into the water and killed a mighty sturgeon that was sporting beside the vessel This huge monster being with infinite labor hoisted on board furnished a luxurious repast to all the crew being accounted of excellent flavor excepting about the wound where it smacked a little of brimstone and this on my veracity was the first time that ever sturgeon was eaten in those parts by Christian people forty nine When this astonishing miracle came to be made known to Peter Stuyvesant and that he tasted of the unknown fish he as may well be supposed marveled exceedingly and as a monument thereof he gave the name of Antony s Nose to a stout promontory in the neighborhood and it has continued to be called Antony s Nose ever since that time But hold whither am I wandering By the mass if I attempt to accompany the good Peter Stuyvesant on this voyage I shall never make an end for never was there a voyage so fraught with marvelous incidents nor a river so abounding with transcendent beauties worthy of being severally recorded Even now I have it on the point of my pen to relate how his crew were most horribly frightened on going on shore above the Highlands by a gang of merry roistering devils frisking and curveting on a flat rock which projected into the river and which is called the Duyvel s Dans Kamer to this very day But no Diedrich Knickerbocker it becomes thee not to idle thus in thy historic wayfaring Recollect that while dwelling with the fond garrulity of age over these fairy scenes endeared to thee by the recollections of thy youth and the charms of a thousand legendary tales which beguiled the simple ear of thy childhood recollect that thou art trifling with those fleeting moments which should be devoted to loftier themes Is not Time relentless Time shaking with palsied hand his almost exhausted hour glass before thee hasten then to pursue thy weary task lest the last sands be run ere thou hast finished thy history of the Manhattoes Let us then commit the dauntless Peter his brave galley and his loyal crew to the protection of the blessed saint Nicholas who I have no doubt will prosper him in his voyage while we await his return at the great city of New Amsterdam FOOTNOTES forty nine The learned Hans Megapolonsis treating of the country about Albany in a letter which was written some time after the settlement thereof says There is in the river great plenty of sturgeon which we Christians do not make use of but the Indians eat them greedily CHAPTER V While thus the enterprising Peter was coasting with flowing sail up the shores of the lordly Hudson and arousing all the phlegmatic little Dutch settlements upon its borders a great and puissant concourse of warriors was assembling at the city of New Amsterdam And here that invaluable fragment of antiquity the Stuyvesant manuscript is more than commonly particular by which means I am enabled to record the illustrious host that encamped itself in the public square in front of the fort at present denominated the Bowling Green In the center then was pitched the tent of the men of battle of the manhattoes who being the inmates of the metropolis composed the lifeguards of the governor These were commanded by the valiant Stoffel Brinkerhoff who whilom had acquired such immortal fame at Oyster Bay they displayed as a standard a beaver rampant on a field of orange being the arms of the province and denoting the persevering industry and the amphibious origin of the Nederlanders fifty On their right hand might be seen the vassals of that renowned Mynheer Michael Paw fifty one who lorded it over the fair regions of ancient Pavonia and the lands away south even unto the Navesink Mountains fifty two and was moreover patroon of Gibbet Island His standard was borne by his trusty squire Cornelius Van Vorst consisting of a huge oyster recumbent upon a sea green field being the armorial bearings of his favorite metropolis Communipaw He brought to the camp a stout force of warriors heavily armed being each clad in ten pair of linsey woolsey breeches and overshadowed by broad brimmed beavers with short pipes twisted in their hat bands These were the men who vegetated in the mud along the shores of Pavonia being of the race of genuine copper heads and were fabled to have sprung from oysters At a little distance was encamped the tribe of warriors who came from the neighborhood of Hell gate These were commanded by the Suy Dams and the Van Dams incontinent hard swearers as their names betoken they were terrible looking fellows clad in broad skirted gaberdines of that curious colored cloth called thunder and lightning and bore as a standard three devil s darning needles volant in a flame colored field Hard by was the tent of the men of battle from the marshy borders of the Waale Boght fifty three and the country thereabouts these were of a sour aspect by reason that they lived on crabs which abound in these parts They were the first institutors of that honorable order of knighthood called Flymarket shirks and if tradition speak true did likewise introduce the far famed step in dancing called double trouble They were commanded by the fearless Jacobus Varra Vanger and had moreover a jolly band of Breuckelen fifty four ferry men who performed a brave concerto on conch shells But I refrain from pursuing this minute description which goes on to describe the warriors of Bloemen dael and Weehawk and Hoboken and sundry other places well known in history and song for now do the notes of martial music alarm the people of New Amsterdam sounding afar from beyond the walls of the city But this alarm was in a little while relieved for lo from the midst of a vast cloud of dust they recognized the brimstone colored breeches and splendid silver leg of Peter Stuyvesant glaring in the sunbeams and beheld him approaching at the head of a formidable army which he had mustered along the banks of the Hudson And here the excellent but anonymous writer of the Stuyvesant manuscript breaks out into a brave and glorious description of the forces as they defiled through the principal gate of the city that stood by the head of Wall Street First of all came the Van Brummels who inhabit the pleasant borders of the Bronx these were short fat men wearing exceeding large trunk breeches and were renowned for feats of the trencher they were the first inventors of suppawn or mush and milk Close in their rear marched the Van Vlotens or Kaats kill horrible quavers of new cider and arrant braggarts in their liquor After them came the Van Pelts of Groodt Esopus dexterous horsemen mounted upon goodly switch tailed steeds of the Esopus breed these were mighty hunters of minks and musk rats whence came the word Peltry Then the Van Nests of Kinderhoeck valiant robbers of birds nests as their name denotes to these if report may be believed are we indebted for the invention of slap jacks or buckwheat cakes Then the Van Higginbottoms of Wapping s Creek these came armed with ferrules and birchen rods being a race of schoolmasters who first discovered the marvelous sympathy between the seat of honor and the seat of intellect Then the Van Grolls of Antony s Nose who carried their liquor in fair round little pottles by reason they could not bouse it out of their canteens having such rare long noses Then the Gardeniers of Hudson and thereabouts distinguished by many triumphant feats such as robbing water melon patches smoking rabbits out of their holes and the like and by being great lovers of roasted pigs tails these were the ancestors of the renowned congressman of that name Then the Van Hoesens of Sing Sing great choristers and players upon the jewsharp these marched two and two singing the great song of saint Nicholas Then the Couenhovens of Sleepy Hollow these gave birth to a jolly race of publicans who first discovered the magic artifice of conjuring a quart of wine into a pint bottle Then the Van Kortlandts who lived on the wild banks of the Croton and were great killers of wild ducks being much spoken of for their skill in shooting with the long bow Then the Van Bunschotens of Nyack and Kakiat who were the first that did ever kick with the left foot they were gallant bush whackers and hunters of raccoons by moonlight Then the Van Winkles of Haerlem potent suckers of eggs and noted for running of horses and running up of scores at taverns they were the first that ever winked with both eyes at once Lastly came the Knickerbockers of the great town of Schaghtikoke where the folk lay stones upon the houses in windy weather lest they should be blown away These derive their name as some say from Knicker to shake and Beker a goblet indicating thereby that they were sturdy toss pots of yore but in truth it was derived from Knicker to nod and Boeken books plainly meaning that they were great nodders or dozers over books from them did descend the writer of this history Such was the legion of sturdy bush beaters that poured in at the grand gate of New Amsterdam the Stuyvesant manuscript indeed speaks of many more whose names I omit to mention seeing that it behooves me to hasten to matters of greater moment Nothing could surpass the joy and martial pride of the lion hearted Peter as he reviewed this mighty host of warriors and he determined no longer to defer the gratification of his much wished for revenge upon the scoundrel Swedes at Fort Casimir But before I hasten to record those unmatchable events which will be found in the sequel of this faithful history let us pause to notice the fate of Jacobus Van Poffenburgh the discomfited commander in chief of the armies of the New Netherlands Such is the inherent uncharitableness of human nature that scarcely did the news become public of his deplorable discomfiture at Fort Casimir than a thousand scurvy rumors were set afloat in New Amsterdam wherein it was insinuated that he had in reality a treacherous understanding with the Swedish commander that he had long been in the practice of privately communicating with the Swedes together with divers hints about secret service money To all which deadly charges I do not give a jot more credit than I think they deserve Certain it is that the general vindicated his character by the most vehement oaths and protestations and put every man out of the ranks of honor who dared to doubt his integrity Moreover on returning to New Amsterdam he paraded up and down the streets with a crew of hard swearers at his heels sturdy bottle companions whom he gorged and fattened and who were ready to bolster him through all the courts of justice heroes of his own kidney fierce whiskered broad shouldered colbrand looking swaggerers not one of whom but looked as though he could eat up an ox and pick his teeth with the horns These lifeguard men quarreled all his quarrels were ready to fight all his battles and scowled at every man that turned up his nose at the general as though they would devour him alive Their conversation was interspersed with oaths like minute guns and every bombastic rhodomontade was rounded off by a thundering execration like a patriotic toast honored with a discharge of artillery All these valorous vaporings had a considerable effect in convincing certain profound sages who began to think the general a hero of unmatchable loftiness and magnanimity of soul particularly as he was continually protesting on the honor of a soldier a marvelously high sounding asseveration Nay one of the members of the council went so far as to propose they should immortalise him by an imperishable statue of plaster of Paris But the vigilant Peter the Headstrong was not thus to be deceived Sending privately for the commander in chief of all the armies and having heard all his story garnished with the customary pious oaths protestations and ejaculations Harkee comrade cried he though by your own account you are the most brave upright and honorable man in the whole province yet do you lie under the misfortune of being damnably traduced and immeasurably despised Now though it is certainly hard to punish a man for his misfortunes and though it is very possible you are totally innocent of the crimes laid to your charge yet as heaven doubtless for some wise purpose sees fit at present to withhold all proofs of your innocence far be it from me to counteract its sovereign will Besides I cannot consent to venture my armies with a commander whom they despise nor to trust the welfare of my people to a champion whom they distrust Retire therefore my friend from the irksome toils and cares of public life with this comforting reflection that if guilty you are but enjoying your just reward and if innocent you are not the first great and good man who has most wrongfully been slandered and maltreated in this wicked world doubtless to be better treated in a better world where there shall be neither error calumny nor persecution In the meantime let me never see your face again for I have a horrible antipathy to the countenances of unfortunate great men like yourself FOOTNOTES fifty This was likewise a great seal of the New Netherlands as may still be seen in ancient records fifty one Besides what is related in the Stuyvesant MS I have found mention made of this illustrious patroon in another manuscript which says De Heer or the squire Michael Paw a Dutch subject about tenth Aug sixteen thirty by deed purchased Staten Island N B The same Michael Paw had what the Dutch call a colonie at Pavonia on the Jersey shore opposite New York and his overseer in sixteen thirty six was named Corns Van Vorst a person of the same name in seventeen sixty nine owned Pawles Hook and a large farm at Pavonia and is a lineal descendant from Van Vorst fifty two So called from the Navesink tribe of Indians that inhabited these parts At present they are erroneously denominated the Neversink or Neversunk mountains fifty three Since corrupted into the Wallabout the bay where the navy yard is situated fifty four Now spelt Brooklyn CHAPTER VI As my readers and myself are about entering on as many perils as ever a confederacy of meddlesome knights errant wilfully ran their heads into it is meet that like those hardy adventurers we should join hands bury all differences and swear to stand by one another in weal or woe to the end of the enterprise My readers must doubtless perceive how completely I have altered my tone and deportment since we first set out together I warrant they then thought me a crabbed cynical impertinent little son of a Dutchman for I scarcely ever gave them a civil word nor so much as touched my beaver when I had occasion to address them But as we jogged along together on the high road of my history I gradually began to relax to grow more courteous and occasionally to enter into familiar discourse until at length I came to conceive a most social companionable kind of regard for them This is just my way I am always a little cold and reserved at first particularly to people whom I neither know nor care for and am only to be completely won by long intimacy Besides why should I have been sociable to the crowd of how d ye do acquaintances that flocked around me at my first appearance Many were merely attracted by a new face and having stared me full in the title page walked off without saying a word while others lingered yawningly through the preface and having gratified their short lived curiosity soon dropped off one by one but more especially to try their mettle I had recourse to an expedient similar to one which we are told was used by that peerless flower of chivalry King Arthur who before he admitted any knight to his intimacy first required that he should show himself superior to danger or hardships by encountering unheard of mishaps slaying some dozen giants vanquishing wicked enchanters not to say a word of dwarfs hippogriffs and fiery dragons On a similar principle did I cunningly lead my readers at the first sally into two or three knotty chapters where they were most woefully belabored and buffeted by a host of pagan philosophers and infidel writers Though naturally a very grave man yet could I scarce refrain from smiling outright at seeing the utter confusion and dismay of my valiant cavaliers Some dropped down dead asleep on the field others threw down my book in the middle of the first chapter took to their heels and never ceased scampering until they had fairly run it out of sight when they stopped to take breath to tell their friends what troubles they had undergone and to warn all others from venturing on so thankless an expedition Every page thinned my ranks more and more and of the vast multitude that first set out but a comparatively few made shift to survive in exceedingly battered condition through the five introductory chapters What then would you have had me take such sunshine faint hearted recreants to my bosom at our first acquaintance No no I reserved my friendship for those who deserved it for those who undauntedly bore me company in despite of difficulties dangers and fatigues And now as to those who adhere to me at present I take them affectionately by the hand Worthy and thrice beloved readers brave and well tried comrades who have faithfully followed my footsteps through all my wanderings I salute you from my heart I pledge myself to stand by you to the last and to conduct you so Heaven speed this trusty weapon which I now hold between my fingers triumphantly to the end of this our stupendous undertaking But hark while we are thus talking the city of New Amsterdam is in a bustle The host of warriors encamped in the Bowling Green are striking their tents the brazen trumpet of Antony Van Corlear makes the welkin to resound with portentous clangour the drums beat the standards of the Manhattoes of Hell gate and of Michael Paw wave proudly in the air And now behold where the mariners are busily employed hoisting the sails of yon topsail schooner and those clump built sloops which are to waft the army of the Nederlanders to gather immortal honors on the Delaware The entire population of the city man woman and child turned out to behold the chivalry of New Amsterdam as it paraded the streets previous to embarkation Many a handkerchief was waved out of the windows many a fair nose was blown in melodious sorrow on the mournful occasion The grief of the fair dames and beauteous damsels of Grenada could not have been more vociferous on the banishment of the gallant tribe of Abencerrages than was that of the kind hearted fair ones of New Amsterdam on the departure of their intrepid warriors Every love sick maiden fondly crammed the pockets of her hero with gingerbread and doughnuts many a copper ring was exchanged and crooked sixpence broken in pledge of eternal constancy and there remain extant to this day some love verses written on that occasion sufficiently crabbed and incomprehensible to confound the whole universe But it was a moving sight to see the buxom lasses how they hung about the doughty Antony Van Corlear for he was a jolly rosy faced lusty bachelor fond of his joke and withall a desperate rogue among the women Fain would they have kept him to comfort them while the army was away for besides what I have said of him it is no more than justice to add that he was a kind hearted soul noted for his benevolent attentions in comforting disconsolate wives during the absence of their husbands and this made him to be very much regarded by the honest burghers of the city But nothing could keep the valiant Antony from following the heels of the old governor whom he loved as he did his very soul so embracing all the young vrouws and giving every one of them that had good teeth and rosy lips a dozen hearty smacks he departed loaded with their kind wishes Nor was the departure of the gallant Peter among the least causes of public distress Though the old governor was by no means indulgent to the follies and waywardness of his subjects yet somehow or other he had become strangely popular among the people There is something so captivating in personal bravery that with the common mass of mankind it takes the lead of most other merits The simple folk of New Amsterdam looked upon Peter Stuyvesant as a prodigy of valor His wooden leg that trophy of his martial encounters was regarded with reverence and admiration Every old burgher had a budget of miraculous stories to tell about the exploits of Hardkoppig Piet wherewith he regaled his children of a long winter night and on which he dwelt with as much delight and exaggeration as do our honest country yeomen on the hardy adventures of old General Putnam or as he is familiarly termed Old Put during our glorious revolution Not an individual but verily believed the old governor was a match for Beelzebub himself and there was even a story told with great mystery and under the rose of his having shot the devil with a silver bullet one dark stormy night as he was sailing in a canoe through Hell gate but this I do not record as being an absolute fact Perish the man who would let fall a drop to discolor the pure stream of history Certain it is not an old woman in New Amsterdam but considered Peter Stuyvesant as a tower of strength and rested satisfied that the public welfare was secure so long as he was in the city It is not surprising then that they looked upon his departure as a sore affliction With heavy hearts they dragged at the heels of his troop as they marched down to the riverside to embark The governor from the stern of his schooner gave a short but truly patriarchal address to his citizens wherein he recommended them to comport like loyal and peaceable subjects to go to church regularly on Sundays and to mind their business all the week besides That the women should be dutiful and affectionate to their husbands looking after nobody s concerns but their own eschewing all gossipings and morning gaddings and carrying short tongues and long petticoats That the men should abstain from intermeddling in public concerns intrusting the cares of government to the officers appointed to support them staying at home like good citizens making money for themselves and getting children for the benefit of the country That the burgomasters should look well to the public interest not oppressing the poor nor indulging the rich not tasking their ingenuity to devise new laws but faithfully enforcing those which were already made rather bending their attention to prevent evil than to punish it ever recollecting that civil magistrates should consider themselves more as guardians of public morals than ratcatchers employed to entrap public delinquents Finally he exhorted them one and all high and low rich and poor to conduct themselves as well as they could assuring them that if they faithfully and conscientiously complied with this golden rule there was no danger but that they would all conduct themselves well enough This done he gave them a paternal benediction the sturdy Anthony sounded a most loving farewell with his trumpet the jolly crews put up a shout of triumph and the invincible armada swept off proudly down the bay The good people of New Amsterdam crowded down to the Battery that blest resort from whence so many a tender prayer has been wafted so many a fair hand waved so many a tearful look been cast by love sick damsel after the lessening barque bearing her adventurous swain to distant climes Here the populace watched with straining eyes the gallant squadron as it slowly floated down the bay and when the intervening land at the Narrows shut it from their sight gradually dispersed with silent tongues and downcast countenances A heavy gloom hung over the late bustling city the honest burghers smoked their pipes in profound thoughtfulness casting many a wistful look to the weathercock on the church of saint Nicholas and all the old women having no longer the presence of Peter Stuyvesant to hearten them gathered their children home and barricaded the doors and windows every evening at sun down In the meanwhile the armada of the sturdy Peter proceeded prosperously on its voyage and after encountering about as many storms and waterspouts and whales and other horrors and phenomena as generally befall adventurous landsmen in perilous voyages of the kind and after undergoing a severe scouring from that deplorable and unpitied malady called sea sickness the whole squadron arrived safely in the Delaware Without so much as dropping anchor and giving his wearied ships time to breathe after laboring so long on the ocean the intrepid Peter pursued his course up the Delaware and made a sudden appearance before Fort Casimir Having summoned the astonished garrison by a terrific blast from the trumpet of the long winded Van Corlear he demanded in a tone of thunder an instant surrender of the fort To this demand Suen Skytte the wind dried commandant replied in a shrill whiffling voice which by reason of his extreme spareness sounded like the wind whistling through a broken bellows that he had no very strong reason for refusing except that the demand was particularly disagreeable as he had been ordered to maintain his post to the last extremity He requested time therefore to consult with Governor Risingh and proposed a truce for that purpose The choleric Peter indignant at having his rightful fort so treacherously taken from him and thus pertinaciously withheld refused the proposed armistice and swore by the pipe of saint Nicholas which like the sacred fire was never extinguished that unless the fort were surrendered in ten minutes he would incontinently storm the works make all the garrison run the gauntlet and split their scoundrel of a commander like a pickled shad To give this menace the greater effect he drew forth his trusty sword and shook it at them with such a fierce and vigorous motion that doubtless if it had not been exceeding rusty it would have lightened terror into the eyes and hearts of the enemy He then ordered his men to bring a broadside to bear upon the fort consisting of two swivels three muskets a long duck fowling piece and two braces of horse pistols In the meantime the sturdy Van Corlear marshaled all his forces and commenced his warlike operations Distending his cheeks like a very Boreas he kept up a most horrific twanging of his trumpet the lusty choristers of Sing Sing broke forth into a hideous song of battle the warriors of Breuckelen and the Wallabout blew a potent and astounding blast on their conch shells altogether forming as outrageous a concerto as though five thousand French fiddlers were displaying their skill in a modern overture Whether the formidable front of war thus suddenly presented smote the garrison with sore dismay or whether the concluding terms of the summons which mentioned that he should surrender at discretion were mistaken by Suen Skytte who though a Swede was a very considerate easy tempered man as a compliment to his discretion I will not take upon me to say certain it is he found it impossible to resist so courteous a demand Accordingly in the very nick of time just as the cabin boy had gone after a coal of fire to discharge the swivel a chamade was beat on the rampart by the only drum in the garrison to the no small satisfaction of both parties who not withstanding their great stomach for fighting had full as good an inclination to eat a quiet dinner as to exchange black eyes and bloody noses Thus did this impregnable fortress once more return to the domination of their High Mightinesses Skytte and his garrison of twenty men were allowed to march out with the honors of war and the victorious Peter who was as generous as brave permitted them to keep possession of all their arms and ammunition the same on inspection being found totally unfit for service having long rusted in the magazine of the fortress even before it was wrested by the Swedes from the windy Van Poffenburgh But I must not omit to mention that the governor was so well pleased with the service of his faithful squire Van Corlear in the reduction of this great fortress that he made him on the spot lord of a goodly domain in the vicinity of New Amsterdam which goes by the name of Corlear s Hook unto this very day The unexampled liberality of Peter Stuyvesant towards the Swedes occasioned great surprise in the city of New Amsterdam nay certain factious individuals who had been enlightened by political meetings in the days of William the Testy but who had not dared to indulge their meddlesome habits under the eye of their present ruler now emboldened by his absence gave vent to their censures in the street Murmurs were heard in the very council chamber of New Amsterdam and there is no knowing whether they might not have broken out into downright speeches and invectives had not Peter Stuyvesant privately sent home his walking stick to be laid as a mace on the table of the council chamber in the midst of his counsellors who like wise men took the hint and for ever after held their peace CHAPTER VII Like as a mighty alderman when at a corporation feast the first spoonful of turtle soup salutes his palate feels his appetite but tenfold quickened and redoubles his vigorous attacks upon the tureen while his projecting eyes rolled greedily round devouring everything at table so did the mettlesome Peter Stuyvesant feel that hunger for martial glory which raged within his bowels inflamed by the capture of Fort Casimir and nothing could allay it but the conquest of all New Sweden No sooner therefore had he secured his conquest than he stumped resolutely on flushed with success to gather fresh laurels at Fort Christina fifty five This was the grand Swedish post established on a small river or as it is improperly termed creek of the same name and here that crafty governor Jan Risingh lay grimly drawn up like a grey bearded spider in the citadel of his web But before we hurry into the direful scenes which must attend the meeting of two such potent chieftains it is advisable to pause for a moment and hold a kind of warlike council Battles should not be rushed into precipitately by the historian and his readers any more than by the general and his soldiers The great commanders of antiquity never engaged the enemy without previously preparing the minds of their followers by animating harangues spiriting them up to heroic deeds assuring them of the protection of the gods and inspiring them with a confidence in the prowess of their leaders So the historian should awaken the attention and enlist the passions of his readers and having set them all on fire with the importance of his subject he should put himself at their head flourish his pen and lead them on to the thickest of the fight An illustrious example of this rule may be seen in that mirror of historians the immortal Thucydides Having arrived at the breaking out of the Peloponnesian War one of his commentators observes that he sounds that charge in all the disposition and spirit of Homer He catalogues the allies on both sides He awakens our expectations and fast engages our attention All mankind are concerned in the important point now going to be decided Endeavors are made to disclose futurity Heaven itself is interested in the dispute The earth totters and nature seems to labor with the great event This is his solemn sublime manner of setting out Thus he magnifies a war between two as Rapin styles them petty states and thus artfully he supports a little subject by treating it in a great and noble method In like manner having conducted my readers into the very teeth of peril having followed the adventurous Peter and his band into foreign regions surrounded by foes and stunned by the horrid din of arms at this important moment while darkness and doubt hang o er each coming chapter I hold it meet to harangue them and prepare them for the events that are to follow And here I would premise one great advantage which as historian I possess over my reader and this it is that though I cannot save the life of my favorite hero nor absolutely contradict the event of a battle both which liberties though often taken by the French writers of the present reign I hold to be utterly unworthy of a scrupulous historian yet I can now and then make him bestow on his enemy a sturdy back stroke sufficient to fell a giant though in honest truth he may never have done anything of the kind or I can drive his antagonist clear round and round the field as did Homer make that fine fellow Hector scamper like a poltroon round the walls of Troy for which if ever they have encountered one another in the Elysian Fields I ll warrant the prince of poets has had to make the most humble apology I am aware that many conscientious readers will be ready to cry out foul play whenever I render a little assistance to my hero but I consider it one of those privileges exercised by historians of all ages and one which has never been disputed An historian is in fact as it were bound in honor to stand by his hero the fame of the latter is intrusted to his hands and it is his duty to do the best by it he can Never was there a general an admiral or any other commander who in giving an account of any battle he had fought did not sorely belabor the enemy and I have no doubt that had my heroes written the history of their own achievements they would have dealt much harder blows than any that I shall recount Standing forth therefore as the guardian of their fame it behoves me to do them the same justice they would have done themselves and if I happen to be a little hard upon the Swedes I give free leave to any of their descendants who may write a history of the State of Delaware to take fair retaliation and belabor Peter Stuyvesant as hard as they please Therefore stand by for broken heads and bloody noses My pen hath long itched for a battle siege after siege have I carried on without blows or bloodshed but now I have at length got a chance and I vow to Heaven and saint Nicholas that let the chronicles of the times say what they please neither Sallust Livy Tacitus Polybius nor any other historian did ever record a fiercer fight than that in which my valiant chieftains are now about to engage And you O most excellent readers whom for your faithful adherence I could cherish in the warmest corner of my heart be not uneasy trust the fate of our favorite Stuyvesant with me for by the rood come what may I ll stick by Hardkoppig Piet to the last I ll make him drive about these losels vile as did the renowned Launcelot of the Lake a herd of recreant Cornish knights and if he does fall let me never draw my pen to fight another battle in behalf of a brave man if I don t make these lubberly Swedes pay for it No sooner had Peter Stuyvesant arrived before Forth Christina than he proceeded without delay to entrench himself and immediately on running his first parallel dispatched Antony Van Corlear to summon the fortress to surrender Van Corlear was received with all due formality hoodwinked at the portal and conducted through a pestiferous smell of salt fish and onions to the citadel a substantial hut built of pine logs His eyes were here uncovered and he found himself in the august presence of Governor Risingh This chieftain as I have before noted was a very giantly man and was clad in a coarse blue coat strapped round the waist with a leathern belt which caused the enormous skirts and pockets to set off with a very warlike sweep His ponderous legs were cased in a pair of foxy colored jack boots and he was straddling in the attitude of the Colossus of Rhodes before a bit of broken looking glass shaving himself with a villainously dull razor This afflicting operation caused him to make a series of horrible grimaces which heightened exceedingly the grisly terrors of his visage On Antony Van Corlear s being announced the grim commander paused for a moment in the midst of one of his most hard favored contortions and after eyeing him askance over the shoulder with a kind of snarling grin on his countenance resumed his labors at the glass This iron harvest being reaped he turned once more to the trumpeter and demanded the purport of his errand Antony Van Corlear delivered in a few words being a kind of short hand speaker a long message from his excellency recounting the whole history of the province with a recapitulation of grievances and enumeration of claims and concluding with a peremptory demand of instant surrender which done he turned aside took his nose between his thumb and finger and blew a tremendous blast not unlike the flourish of a trumpet of defiance which it had doubtless learned from a long and intimate neighborhood with that melodious instrument Governor Risingh heard him through trumpet and all but with infinite impatience leaning at times as was his usual custom on the pommel of his sword and at times twirling a huge steel watch chain or snapping his fingers Van Corlear having finished he bluntly replied that Peter Stuyvesant and his summons might go to the d whither he hoped to send him and his crew of ragamuffins before supper time Then unsheathing his brass hilted sword and throwing away the scabbard Fore gad quoth he but I will not sheathe thee again until I make a scabbard of the smoke dried leathern hide of this runagate Dutchman Then having flung a fierce defiance in the teeth of his adversary by the lips of his messenger the latter was reconducted to the portal with all the ceremonious civility due to the trumpeter squire and ambassador of so great a commander and being again unblinded was courteously dismissed with a tweak of the nose to assist him in recollecting his message No sooner did the gallant Peter receive this insolent reply than he let fly a tremendous volley of red hot execrations which would infallibly have battered down the fortifications and blown up the powder magazine about the ears of the fiery Swede had not the ramparts been remarkably strong and the magazine bomb proof Perceiving that the works withstood this terrific blast and that it was utterly impossible as it really was in those unphilosophic days to carry on a war with words he ordered his merry men all to prepare for an immediate assault But here a strange murmur broke out among his troops beginning with the tribe of the Van Bummels those valiant trenchermen of the Bronx and spreading from man to man accompanied with certain mutinous looks and discontented murmurs For once in his life and only for once did the great Peter turn pale for he verily thought his warriors were going to falter in this hour of perilous trial and thus to tarnish forever the fame of the province of New Netherlands But soon did he discover to his great joy that in this suspicion he deeply wronged this most undaunted army for the cause of this agitation and uneasiness simply was that the hour of dinner was at hand and it would almost have broken the hearts of these regular Dutch warriors to have broken in upon the invariable routine of their habits Besides it was an established rule among our ancestors always to fight upon a full stomach and to this may be doubtless attributed the circumstance that they came to be so renowned in arms And now are the hearty men of the Manhattoes and their no less hearty comrades all lustily engaged under the trees buffeting stoutly with the contents of their wallets and taking such affectionate embraces of their canteens and pottles as though they verily believed they were to be the last And as I foresee we shall have hot work in a page or two I advise my readers to do the same for which purpose I will bring this chapter to a close giving them my word of honor that no advantage shall be taken of this armistice to surprise or in anywise molest the honest Nederlanders while at their vigorous repast FOOTNOTES fifty five At present a flourishing town called Christiana or Christeen about thirty seven miles from Philadelphia on the post road to Baltimore CHAPTER VIII Now had the Dutchmen snatched a huge repast and finding themselves wonderfully encouraged and animated thereby prepared to take the field Expectation says the writer of the Stuyvesant manuscript expectation now stood on stilts The world forgot to turn round or rather stood still that it might witness the affray like a round bellied alderman watching the combat of two chivalrous flies upon his jerkin The eyes of all mankind as usual in such cases were turned upon Fort Cristina The sun like a little man in a crowd at a puppet show scampered about the heavens popping his head here and there and endeavoring to get a peep between the unmannerly clouds that obtruded themselves in his way The historians filled their inkhorns the poets went without their dinners either that they might buy paper and goose quills or because they could not get anything to eat Antiquity scowled sulkily out of its grave to see itself outdone while even Posterity stood mute gazing in gaping ecstasy of retrospection on the eventful field The immortal deities who whilom had seen service at the affair of Troy now mounted their feather bed clouds and sailed over the plain or mingled among the combatants in different disguises all itching to have a finger in the pie Jupiter sent off his thunderbolt to a noted coppersmith to have it furbished up for the direful occasion Venus vowed by her chastity to patronize the Swedes and in semblance of a blear eyed trull paraded the battlements of Fort Christina accompanied by Diana as a sergeant s widow of cracked reputation The noted bully Mars stuck two horse pistols into his belt shouldered a rusty firelock and gallantly swaggered at their elbow as a drunken corporal while Apollo trudged in their rear as a bandy legged fifer playing most villainously out of tune On the other side the ox eyed Juno who had gained a pair of black eyes over night in one of her curtain lectures with old Jupiter displayed her haughty beauties on a baggage wagon Minerva as a brawny gin suttler tacked up her skirts brandished her fists and swore most heroically in exceeding bad Dutch having but lately studied the language by way of keeping up the spirits of the soldiers while Vulcan halted as a club footed blacksmith lately promoted to be a captain of militia All was silent awe or bustling preparation war reared his horrid front gnashed loud his iron fangs and shook his direful crest of bristling bayonets And now the mighty chieftains marshaled out their hosts Here stood stout Risingh firm as a thousand rocks incrusted with stockades and in trenched to the chin in mud batteries His valiant soldiery lined the breastwork in grim array each having his mustachios fiercely greased and his hair pomatumed back and queued so stiffly that he grinned above the ramparts like a grisly death s head There came on the intrepid Peter his brows knit his teeth set his fists clenched almost breathing forth volumes of smoke so fierce was the fire that raged within his bosom His faithful squire Van Corlear trudged valiantly at his heels with his trumpet gorgeously bedecked with red and yellow ribands the remembrances of his fair mistresses at the Manhattoes Then came waddling on the sturdy chivalry of the Hudson There were the Van Wycks and the Van Dycks and the Ten Eycks the Van Nesses the Van Tassels the Van Grolls the Van Hoesens the Van Giesons and the Van Blarcoms the Van Warts the Van Winkles the Van Dams the Van Pelts the Van Rippers and the Van Brunts There were the Van Hornes the Van Hooks the Van Bunschotens the Van Gelders the Van Arsdales and the Van Bummels the Vander Belts the Vander Hoofs the Vander Voorts the Vander Lyns the Vander Pools and the Vander Spiegles there came the Hoffmans the Hooglands the Hoppers the Cloppers the Ryckmans the Dyckmans the Hogebooms the Rosebooms the Oothouts the Quackenbosses the Roerbacks the Garrebrantzes the Bensons the Brouwers the Waldrons the Onderdonks the Varra Vangers the Schermerhorns the Stoutenburghs the Brinkerhoffs the Bontecous the Knickerbockers the Hockstrassers the Ten Breecheses and the Tough Breecheses with a host more of worthies whose names are too crabbed to be written or if they could be written it would be impossible for man to utter all fortified with a mighty dinner and to use the words of a great Dutch poet Brimful of wrath and cabbage For an instant the mighty Peter paused in the midst of his career and mounting on a stump addressed his troops in eloquent Low Dutch exhorting them to fight like duyvels and assuring them that if they conquered they should get plenty of booty if they fell they should be allowed the satisfaction while dying of reflecting that it was in the service of their country and after they were dead of seeing their names inscribed in the temple of renown and handed down in company with all the other great men of the year for the admiration of posterity Finally he swore to them on the word of a governor and they knew him too well to doubt it for a moment that if he caught any mother s son of them looking pale or playing craven he would curry his hide till he made him run out of it like a snake in spring time Then lugging out his trusty sabre he brandished it three times over his head ordered Van Corlear to sound a charge and shouting the words saint Nicholas and the Manhattoes courageously dashed forwards His warlike followers who had employed the interval in lighting their pipes instantly stuck them into their mouths gave a furious puff and charged gallantly under cover of the smoke The Swedish garrison ordered by the cunning Risingh not to fire until they could distinguish the whites of their assailants eyes stood in horrid silence on the covert way until the eager Dutchmen had ascended the glacis Then did they pour into them such a tremendous volley that the very hills quaked around and were terrified even into an incontinence of water insomuch that certain springs burst forth from their sides which continue to run unto the present day Not a Dutchman but would have bitten the dust beneath that dreadful fire had not the protecting Minerva kindly taken care that the Swedes should one and all observe their usual custom of shutting their eyes and turning away their heads at the moment of discharge The Swedes followed up their fire by leaping the counterscarp and falling tooth and nail upon the foe with furious outcries And now might be seen prodigies of valor unmatched in history or song Here was the sturdy Stoffel Brinkerhoff brandishing his quarter staff like the giant Blanderon his oak tree for he scorned to carry any other weapon and drumming a horrific tune upon the hard heads of the Swedish soldiery There were the Van Kortlandts posted at a distance like the Locrian archers of yore and plying it most potently with the long bow for which they were so justly renowned On a rising knoll were gathered the valiant men of Sing Sing assisting marvellously in the fight by chanting the great song of saint Nicholas but as to the Gardeniers of Hudson they were absent on a marauding party laying waste the neighboring water melon patches In a different part of the field were the Van Grolls of Anthony s Nose struggling to get to the thickest of the fight but horribly perplexed in a defile between two hills by reason of the length of their noses So also the Van Bunschotens of Nyack and Kakiat so renowned for kicking with the left foot were brought to a stand for want of wind in consequence of the hearty dinner they had eaten and would have been put to utter rout but for the arrival of a gallant corps of voltigeurs composed of the Hoppers who advanced nimbly to their assistance on one foot Nor must I omit to mention the valiant achievements of Antony Van Corlear who for a good quarter of an hour waged stubborn fight with a little pursy Swedish drummer whose hide he drummed most magnificently and whom he would infallibly have annihilated on the spot but that he had come into the battle with no other weapon but his trumpet But now the combat thickened On came the mighty Jacobus Varra Vanger and the fighting men of the Wallabout after them thundered the Van Pelts of Esopus together with the Van Riepers and the Van Brunts bearing down all before them then the Suy Dams and the Van Dams pressing forward with many a blustering oath at the head of the warriors of Hell gate clad in their thunder and lightning gaberdines and lastly the standard bearers and body guards of Peter Stuyvesant bearing the great beaver of the Manhattoes And now commenced the horrid din the desperate struggle the maddening ferocity the frantic desperation the confusion and self abandonment of war Dutchman and Swede commingled tugged panted and blowed The heavens were darkened with a tempest of missives Bang went the guns whack went the broad swords thump went the cudgels crash went the musket strocks blows kicks cuffs scratches black eyes and bloody noses swelling the horrors of the scene Thick thwack cut and hack helter skelter higgledy piggledy hurly burly head over heels rough and tumble Dunder and blixum swore the Dutchmen splitter and splutter cried the Swedes Storm the works shouted Hardkoppig Peter Fire the mine roared stout Risingh Tanta ra ra ra twanged the trumpet of Antony Van Corlear until all voice and sound became unintelligible grunts of pain yells of fury and shouts of triumph mingling in one hideous clamor The earth shook as if struck with a paralytic stroke trees shrunk aghast and withered at the sight rocks burrowed in the ground like rabbits and even Christina Creek turned from its course and ran up a hill in breathless terror Long hung the contest doubtful for though a heavy shower of rain sent by the cloud compelling Jove in some measure cooled their ardor as doth a bucket of water thrown on a group of fighting mastiffs yet did they but pause for a moment to return with tenfold fury to the charge Just at this juncture a vast and dense column of smoke was seen slowly rolling toward the scene of battle The combatants paused for a moment gazing in mute astonishment until the wind dispelling the murky cloud revealed the flaunting banner of Michael Paw the patroon of Communipaw That valiant chieftain came fearlessly on at the head of a phalanx of oyster fed Pavonians and a corps de reserve of the Van Arsdales and Van Bummels who had remained behind to digest the enormous dinner they had eaten These now trudged manfully forward smoking their pipes with outrageous vigor so as to raise the awful cloud that has been mentioned but marching exceedingly slow being short of leg and of great rotundity in the belt And now the deities who watched over the fortunes of the Nederlanders having unthinkingly left the field and stepped into a neighboring tavern to refresh themselves with a pot of beer a direful catastrophe had well night ensued Scarce had the myrmidons of Michael Paw attained the front of battle when the Swedes instructed by the cunning Risingh levelled a shower of blows full at their tobacco pipes Astounded at this assault and dismayed at the havoc of their pipes these ponderous warriors gave way and like a drove of frightened elephants broke through the ranks of their own army The little Hoppers were borne down in the surge the sacred banner emblazoned with the gigantic oyster of Communipaw was trampled in the dirt on blundered and thundered the heavy sterned fugitives the Swedes pressing on their rear and applying their feet a parte poste of the Van Arsdales and the Van Bummels with a vigor that prodigiously accelerated their movements nor did the renowned Michael Paw himself fail to receive divers grievous and dishonorable visitations of shoe leather But what O Muse was the rage of Peter Stuyvesant when from afar he saw his army giving way In the transports of his wrath he sent forth a roar enough to shake the very hills The men of the Manhattoes plucked up new courage at the sound or rather they rallied at the voice of their leader of whom they stood more in awe than of all the Swedes in Christendom Without waiting for their aid the daring Peter dashed sword in hand into the thickest of the foe Then might be seen achievements worthy of the days of the giants Wherever he went the enemy shrank before him the Swedes fled to right and left or were driven like dogs into the own ditch but as he pushed forward singly with headlong courage the foe closed behind and hung upon his rear One aimed a blow full at his heart but the protecting power which watches over the great and the good turned aside the hostile blade and directed it to a side pocket where reposed an enormous iron tobacco box endowed like the shield of Achilles with supernatural powers doubtless from bearing the portrait of the blessed saint Nicholas Peter Stuyvesant turned like an angry bear upon the foe and seizing him as he fled by an immeasurable queue Ah whoreson caterpillar roared he here s what shall make worms meat of thee So saying he whirled his sword and dealt a blow that would have decapitated the varlet but that the pitying steel struck short and shaved the queue for ever from his crown At this moment an arquebusier levelled his piece from a neighboring mound with deadly aim but the watchful Minerva who had just stopped to tie up her garter seeing the peril of her favorite hero sent old Boreas with his bellows who as the match descended to the pan gave a blast that blew the priming from the touch hole Thus waged the fight when the stout Risingh surveying the field from the top of a little ravelin perceived his troops banged beaten and kicked by the invincible Peter Drawing his falchion and uttering a thousand anathemas he strode down to the scene of combat with some such thundering strides as Jupiter is said by Hesiod to have taken when he strode down the spheres to hurl his thunderbolts at the Titans When the rival heroes came face to face each made prodigious start in the style of a veteran stage champion Then did they regard each other for a moment with the bitter aspect of two furious ram cats on the point of a clapper clawing Then did they throw themselves into one attitude then into another striking their swords on the ground first on the right side then on the left at last at it they went with incredible ferocity Words cannot tell the prodigies of strength and valor displayed in this direful encounter an encounter compared to which the far famed battles of Ajax with Hector of Aeneas with Turnus Orlando with Rodomont Guy of Warwick and Colbrand the Dane or of that renowned Welsh knight Sir Owen of the Mountains with the giant Guylon were all gentle sports and holiday recreations At length the valiant Peter watching his opportunity aimed a blow enough to cleave his adversary to the very chine but Risingh nimbly raising his sword warded it off so narrowly that glancing on one side it shaved away a huge canteen in which he carried his liquor thence pursuing its trenchant course it severed off a deep coat pocket stored with bread and cheese which provant rolling among the armies occasioned a fearful scrambling between the Swedes and Dutchmen and made the general battle wax ten times more furious than ever Enraged to see his military stores laid waste the stout Risingh collecting all his forces aimed a mighty blow full at the hero s crest In vain did his fierce little cocked hat oppose its course The biting steel clove through the stubborn ram beaver and would have cracked the crown of any one not endowed with supernatural hardness of head but the brittle weapon shivered in pieces on the skull of Hardkoppig Piet shedding a thousand sparks like beams of glory round his grizzly visage The good Peter reeled with the blow and turning up his eyes beheld a thousands suns beside moons and stars dancing about the firmament at length missing his footing by reason of his wooden leg down he came on his seat of honor with a crash which shook the surrounding hills and might have wrecked his frame had he not been received into a cushion softer than velvet which Providence or Minerva or saint Nicholas or some kindly cow had benevolently prepared for his reception The furious Risingh in despite of the maxim cherished by all true knights that fair play is a jewel hastened to take advantage of the hero s fall but as he stooped to give a fatal blow Peter Stuyvesant dealt him a thwack over the sconce with his wooden leg which set a chime of bells ringing triple bob majors in his cerebellum The bewildered Swede staggered with the blow and the wary Peter seizing a pocket pistol which lay hard by discharged it full at the head of the reeling Risingh Let not my reader mistake it was not a murderous weapon loaded with powder and ball but a little sturdy stone pottle charged to the muzzle with a double dram of true Dutch courage which the knowing Antony Van Corlear carried about him by way of replenishing his valor and which had dropped from his wallet during his furious encounter with the drummer The hideous weapon sang through the air and true to its course as was the fragment of a rock discharged at Hector by bully Ajax encountered the head of the gigantic Swede with matchless violence This heaven directed blow decided the battle The ponderous pericranium of General Jan Risingh sank upon his breast his knees tottered under him a death like torpor seized upon his frame and he tumbled to the earth with such violence that old Pluto started with affright lest he should have broken through the roof of his infernal palace His fall was the signal of defeat and victory the Swedes gave way the Dutch pressed forward the former took to their heels the latter hotly pursued Some entered with them pell mell through the sallyport others stormed the bastion and others scrambled over the curtain Thus in a little while the fortress of Fort Christina which like another Troy had stood a siege of full ten hours was carried by assault without the loss of a single man on either side Victory in the likeness of a gigantic ox fly sat perched on the cocked hat of the gallant Stuyvesant and it was declared by all the writers whom he hired to write the history of his expedition that on this memorable day he gained a sufficient quantity of glory to immortalize a dozen of the greatest heroes in Christendom CHAPTER IX Thanks to saint Nicholas we have safely finished this tremendous battle Let us sit down my worthy reader and cool ourselves for I am in a prodigious sweat and agitation Truly this fighting of battles is hot work and if your great commanders did but know what trouble they give their historians they would not have the conscience to achieve so many horrible victories But methinks I hear my reader complain that throughout this boasted battle there is not the least slaughter nor a single individual maimed if we except the unhappy Swede who was shorn of his queue by the trenchant blade of Peter Stuyvesant all of which he observes as a great outrage on probability and highly injurious to the interest of the narration This is certainly an objection of no little moment but it arises entirely from the obscurity enveloping the remote periods of time about which I have undertaken to write Thus though doubtless from the importance of the object and the prowess of the parties concerned there must have been terrible carnage and prodigies of valor displayed before the walls of Christina yet not withstanding that I have consulted every history manuscript and tradition touching this memorable though long forgotten battle I cannot find mention made of a single man killed or wounded in the whole affair This is without doubt owing to the extreme modesty of our forefathers who unlike their descendants were never prone to vaunt of their achievements but it is a virtue which places their historian in a most embarrassing predicament for having promised my readers a hideous and unparalleled battle and having worked them up into a warlike and blood thirsty state of mind to put them off without any havoc and slaughter would have been as bitter a disappointment as to summon a multitude of good people to attend an execution and then cruelly balk them by a reprieve Had the Fates allowed me some half a score of dead men I had been content for I would have made them such heroes as abounded in the olden time but whose race is now unfortunately extinct any one of whom if we may believe those authentic writers the poets could drive great armies like sheep before him and conquer and desolate whole cities by his single arm But seeing that I had not a single life at my disposal all that was left me was to make the most I could of my battle by means of kicks and cuffs and bruises and such like ignoble wounds And here I cannot but compare my dilemma in some sort to that of the divine Milton who having arrayed with sublime preparation his immortal hosts against each other is sadly put to it how to manage them and how he shall make the end of his battle answer to the beginning inasmuch as being mere spirits he cannot deal a mortal blow nor even give a flesh wound to any of his combatants For my part the greatest difficulty I found was when I had once put my warriors in a passion and let them loose into the midst of the enemy to keep them from doing mischief Many a time had I to restrain the sturdy Peter from cleaving a gigantic Swede to the very waistband or spitting half a dozen little fellows on his sword like so many sparrows And when I had set some hundred of missives flying in the air I did not dare to suffer one of them to reach the ground lest it should have put an end to some unlucky Dutchman The reader cannot conceive how mortifying it is to a writer thus in a manner to have his hands tied and how many tempting opportunities I had to wink at where I might have made as fine a death blow as any recorded in history or song From my own experience I begin to doubt most potently of the authenticity of many of Homer s stories I verily believe that when he had once launched one of his favorite heroes among a crowd of the enemy he cut down many an honest fellow without any authority for so doing excepting that he presented a fair mark and that often a poor fellow was sent to grim Pluto s domains merely because he had a name that would give a sounding turn to a period But I disclaim all such unprincipled liberties let me but have truth and the law on my side and no man would fight harder than myself but since the various records I consulted did not warrant it I had too much conscience to kill a single soldier By saint Nicholas but it would have been a pretty piece of business My enemies the critics who I foresee will be ready enough to lay any crime they can discover at my door might have charged me with murder outright and I should have esteemed myself lucky to escape with no harsher verdict than manslaughter And now gentle reader that we are tranquilly sitting down here smoking our pipes permit me to indulge in a melancholy reflection which at this moment passes across my mind How vain how fleeting how uncertain are all those gaudy bubbles after which we are panting and toiling in this world of fair delusions The wealth which the miser has amassed with so many weary days so many sleepless nights a spendthrift heir may squander away in joyless prodigality the noblest monuments which pride has ever reared to perpetuate a name the hand of time will shortly tumble into ruins and even the brightest laurels gained by feats of arms may wither and be for ever blighted by the chilling neglect of mankind How many illustrious heroes says the good Boetius who were once the pride and glory of the age hath the silence of historians buried in eternal oblivion And this it was that induced the Spartans when they went to battle solemnly to sacrifice to the Muses supplicating that their achievements might be worthily recorded Had not Homer turned his lofty lyre observes the elegant Cicero the valor of Achilles had remained unsung And such too after all the toils and perils he had braved after all the gallant actions he had achieved such too had nearly been the fate of the chivalric Peter Stuyvesant but that I fortunately stepped in and engraved his name on the indellible tablet of history just as the caitiff Time was silently brushing it away for ever The more I reflect the more I am astonished at the important character of the historian He is the sovereign censor to decide upon the renown or infamy of his fellow men He is the patron of kings and conquerors on whom it depends whether they shall live in after ages or be forgotten as were their ancestors before them The tyrant may oppress while the object of his tyranny exists but the historian possesses superior might for his power extends even beyond the grave The shades of departed and long forgotten heroes anxiously bend down from above while he writes watching each movement of his pen whether it shall pass by their names with neglect or inscribe them on the deathless pages of renown Even the drop of ink which hangs trembling on his pen which he may either dash upon the floor or waste in idle scrawlings that very drop which to him is not worth the twentieth part of a farthing may be of incalculable value to some departed worthy may elevate half a score in one moment to immortality who would have given worlds had they possessed them to ensure the glorious meed Let not my readers imagine however that I am indulging in vain glorious boastings or am anxious to blazon forth the importance of my tribe On the contrary I shrink when I reflect on the awful responsibility we historians assume I shudder to think what direful commotions and calamities we occasion in the world I swear to thee honest reader as I am a man I weep at the very idea Why let me ask are so many illustrious men daily tearing themselves away from the embraces of their families slighting the smiles of beauty despising the allurements of fortune and exposing themselves to the miseries of war Why are kings desolating empires and depopulating whole countries In short what induces all great men of all ages and countries to commit so many victories and misdeeds and inflict so many miseries upon mankind and upon themselves but the mere hope that some historian will kindly take them into notice and admit them into a corner of his volume For in short the mighty object of all their toils their hardships and privations is nothing but immortal fame And what is immortal fame Why half a page of dirty paper Alas alas how humiliating the idea that the renown of so great a man as Peter Stuyvesant should depend upon the pen of so little a man as Diedrich Knickerbocker And now having refreshed ourselves after the fatigues and perils of the field it behoves us to return once more to the scene of conflict and inquire what were the results of this renowned conquest The fortress of Christina being the fair metropolis and in a manner the key to New Sweden its capture was speedily followed by the entire subjugation of the province This was not a little promoted by the gallant and courteous deportment of the chivalric Peter Though a man terrible in battle yet in the hour of victory was he endued with a spirit generous merciful and humane He vaunted not over his enemies nor did he make defeat more galling by unmanly insults for like that mirror of knightly virtue the renowned Paladin Orlando he was more anxious to do great actions than to talk of them after they were done He put no man to death ordered no houses to be burnt down permitted no ravages to be perpetrated on the property of the vanquished and even gave one of his bravest officers a severe punishment with his walking staff for having been detected in the act of sacking a hen roost He moreover issued a proclamation inviting the inhabitants to submit to the authority of their High Mightinesses but declaring with unexampled clemency that whoever refused should be lodged at the public expense in a goodly castle provided for the purpose and have an armed retinue to wait on them in the bargain In consequence of these beneficent terms about thirty Swedes stepped manfully forward and took the oath of allegiance in reward for which they were graciously permitted to remain on the banks of the Delaware where their descendants reside at this very day I am told however by divers observant travelers that they have never been able to get over the chap fallen looks of their ancestors but that they still do strangely transmit from father to son manifest marks of the sound drubbing given them by the sturdy Amsterdammers The whole country of New Sweden having thus yielded to the arms of the triumphant Peter was reduced to a colony called South River and placed under the superintendence of a lieutenant governor subject to the control of the supreme government of New Amsterdam This great dignitary was called Mynheer William Beekman or rather Beck man who derived his surname as did Ovidius Naso of yore from the lordly dimensions of his nose which projected from the center of his countenance like the beak of a parrot He was the great progenitor of the tribe of the Beekmans one of the most ancient and honorable families of the province the members of which do gratefully commemorate the origin of their dignity nor as your noble families in England would do by having a glowing proboscis emblazoned in their escutcheon but by one and all wearing a right goodly nose stuck in the very middle of their faces Thus was this perilous enterprise gloriously terminated with the loss of only two men Wolfet Van Horne a tall spare man who was knocked overboard by the boom of a sloop in a flaw of wind and fat Brom Van Bummel who was suddenly carried off by an indigestion both however were immortalized as having bravely fallen in the service of their country True it is Peter Stuyvesant had one of his limbs terribly fractured in the act of storming the fortress but as it was fortunately his wooden leg the wound was promptly and effectually healed And now nothing remains to this branch of my history but to mention that this immaculate hero and his victorious army returned joyously to the Manhattoes where they made a solemn and triumphant entry bearing with them the conquered Risingh and the remnant of his battered crew who had refused allegiance for it appears that the gigantic Swede had only fallen into a swoon at the end of the battle from which he was speedily restored by a wholesome tweak of the nose These captive heroes were lodged according to the promise of the governor at the public expense in a fair and spacious castle being the prison of state of which Stoffel Brinkerhoff the immortal conqueror of Oyster Bay was appointed governor and which has ever since remained in the possession of his descendants fifty six It was a pleasant and goodly sight to witness the joy of the people of New Amsterdam at beholding their warriors once more return from this war in the wilderness The old women thronged round Antony Van Corlear who gave the whole history of the campaign with matchless accuracy saving that he took the credit of fighting the whole battle himself and especially of vanquishing the stout Risingh which he considered himself as clearly entitled to seeing that it was effected by his own stone pottle The schoolmasters throughout the town gave holiday to their little urchins who followed in droves after the drums with paper caps on their heads and sticks in their breeches thus taking the first lesson in the art of war As to the sturdy rabble they thronged at the heels of Peter Stuyvesant wherever he went waving their greasy hats in the air and shouting Hardkoppig Piet forever It was indeed a day of roaring rout and jubilee A huge dinner was prepared at the stadthouse in honor of the conquerors where were assembled in one glorious constellation the great and little luminaries of New Amsterdam There were the lordly Schout and his obsequious deputy the burgomasters with their officious schepens at their elbows the subaltern officers at the elbows of the schepens and so on down to the lowest hanger on of police every tag having his rag at his side to finish his pipe drink off his heel taps and laugh at his flights of immortal dulness In short for a city feast is a city feast all over the world and has been a city feast ever since the creation the dinner went off much the same as do our great corporation junketings and Fourth of July banquets Loads of fish flesh and fowl were devoured oceans of liquor drunk thousands of pipes smoked and many a dull joke honored with much obstreperous fat sided laughter I must not omit to mention that to this far famed victory Peter Stuyvesant was indebted for another of his many titles for so hugely delighted were the honest burghers with his achievements that they unanimously honored him with the name of Pieter de Groodt that is to say Peter the Great or as it was translated into English by the people of New Amsterdam for the benefit of their New England visitors Piet de pig an appellation which he maintained even unto the day of his death FOOTNOTES fifty six This castle though very much altered and modernized is still in being and stands at the corner of Pearl Street facing Coentie s Slip BOOK VII CONTAINING THE THIRD PART OF THE REIGN OF PETER THE HEADSTRONG HIS TROUBLES WITH THE BRITISH NATION AND THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE DUTCH DYNASTY CHAPTER I The history of the reign of Peter Stuyvesant furnishes an edifying picture of the cares and vexations inseparable from sovereignty and a solemn warning to all who are ambitious of attaining the seat of honor Though returning in triumph and crowned with victory his exultation was checked on observing the abuses which had sprung up in New Amsterdam during his short absence His walking staff which he had sent home to act as his vicegerent had it is true kept his council chamber in order the counsellors eyeing it with awe as it lay in grim repose upon the table and smoking their pipes in silence but its control extended not out of doors The populace unfortunately had had too much their own way under the slack though fitful reign of William the Testy and though upon the accession of Peter Stuyvesant they had felt with the instinctive perception which mobs as well as cattle possess that the reins of government had passed into stronger hands yet could they not help fretting and chafing and champing upon the bit in restive silence Scarcely therefore had he departed on his expedition against the Swedes than the whole factions of William Kieft s reign had again thrust their heads above water Pot house meetings were again held to discuss the state of the nation where cobblers tinkers and tailors the self dubbed friends of the people once more felt themselves inspired with the gift of legislation and undertook to lecture on every movement of government Now as Peter Stuyvesant had a singular inclination to govern the province by his individual will his first move on his return was to put a stop to this gratuitous legislation Accordingly one evening when an inspired cobbler was holding forth to an assemblage of the kind the intrepid Peter suddenly made his appearance with his ominous walking staff in his hand and a countenance sufficient to petrify a millstone The whole meeting was thrown into confusion the orators stood aghast with open mouth and trembling knees while Horror Tyranny Liberty Rights Taxes Death Destruction and a host of other patriotic phrases were bolted forth before he had time to close his lips Peter took no notice of the skulking throng but strode up to the brawling bully ruffian and pulling out a huge silver watch which might have served in times of yore as a town clock and which is still retained by his descendants as a family curiosity requested the orator to mend it and set it going The orator humbly confessed it was utterly out of his power as he was unacquainted with the nature of its construction Nay but said Peter try your ingenuity man you see all the springs and wheels and how easily the clumsiest hand may stop it and pull it to pieces and why should it not be equally easy to regulate as to stop it The orator declared that his trade was wholly different that he was a poor cobbler and had never meddled with a watch in his life that there were men skilled in the art whose business it was to attend to those matters but for his part he should only mar the workmanship and put the whole in confusion Why harkee master of mine cried Peter turning suddenly upon him with a countenance that almost petrified the patcher of shoes into a perfect lapstone dost thou pretend to meddle with the movements of government to regulate and correct and patch and cobble a complicated machine the principles of which are above thy comprehension and its simplest operations too subtle for thy understanding when thou canst not correct a trifling error in a common piece of mechanism the whole mystery of which is open to thy inspection Hence with thee to the leather and stone which are emblems of thy head cobble thy shoes and confine thyself to the vocation for which Heaven has fitted thee but elevating his voice until it made the welkin ring if ever I catch thee or any of thy tribe meddling again with affairs of government by saint Nicholas but I ll have every mother s bastard of ye flayed alive and your hides stretched for drumheads that ye may thenceforth make a noise to some purpose This threat and the tremendous voice in which it was uttered caused the whole multitude to quake with fear The hair of the orator rose on his head like his own swine s bristles and not a knight of the thimble present but his heart died within him and he felt as though he could have verily escaped through the eye of a needle The assembly dispersed in silent consternation the pseudo statesmen who had hitherto undertaken to regulate public affairs were now fain to stay at home hold their tongues and take care of their families and party feuds died away to such a degree that many thriving keepers of taverns and dram shops were utterly ruined for want of business But though this measure produced the desired effect in putting an extinguisher on the new lights just brightening up yet did it tend to injure the popularity of the great Peter with the thinking part of the community that is to say that part which think for others instead of for themselves or in other words who attend to everybody s business but their own These accused the old governor of being highly aristocratical and in truth there seems to have been some ground for such an accusation for he carried himself with a lofty soldier like air and was somewhat particular in his dress appearing when not in uniform in rich apparel of the antique flaundish cut and was especially noted for having his sound leg which was a very comely one always arrayed in a red stocking and high heeled shoe Justice he often dispensed in the primitive patriarchal way seated on the stoep before the door under the shade of a great button wood tree but all visits of form and state were received with something of court ceremony in the best parlor where Antony the Trumpeter officiated as high chamberlain On public occasions he appeared with great pomp of equipage and always rode to church in a yellow wagon with flaming red wheels These symptoms of state and ceremony as we have hinted were much caviled at by the thinking and talking part of the community They had been accustomed to find easy access to their former governors and in particular had lived on terms of extreme intimacy with William the Testy and they accused Peter Stuyvesant of assuming too much dignity and reserve and of wrapping himself in mystery Others however have pretended to discover in all this a shrewd policy on the part of the old governor It is certainly of the first importance say they that a country should be governed by wise men but then it is almost equally important that the people should think them wise for this belief alone can produce willing subordination To keep up however this desirable confidence in rulers the people should be allowed to see as little of them as possible It is the mystery which envelopes great men that gives them half their greatness There is a kind of superstitious reverence for office which leads us to exaggerate the merits of the occupant and to suppose that he must be wiser than common men He however who gains access to cabinets soon finds out by what foolishness the world is governed He finds that there is quackery in legislation as in everything else that rulers have their whims and errors as well as other men and are not so wonderfully superior as he had imagined since even he may occasionally confute them in argument Thus awe subsides into confidence confidence inspires familiarity and familiarity produces contempt Such was the case say they with William the Testy By making himself too easy of access he enabled every scrub politician to measure wits with him and to find out the true dimensions not only of his person but of his mind and thus it was that by being familiarly scanned he was discovered to be a very little man Peter Stuyvesant on the contrary say they by conducting himself with dignity and loftiness was looked up to with great reverence As he never gave his reasons for anything he did the public gave him credit for very profound ones every movement however intrinsically unimportant was a matter of speculation and his very red stockings excited some respect as being different from the stockings of other men Another charge against Peter Stuyvesant was that he had a great leaning in favor of the patricians and indeed in his time rose many of those mighty Dutch families which have taken such vigorous root and branched out so luxuriantly in our state Some to be sure were of earlier date such as the Van Kortlandts the Van Zandts the Ten Broecks the Harden Broecks and others of Pavonian renown who gloried in the title of Discoverers from having been engaged in the nautical expedition from Communipaw in which they so heroically braved the terrors of Hell gate and Buttermilk channel and discovered a site for New Amsterdam Others claimed to themselves the appellation of Conquerors from their gallant achievements in New Sweden and their victory over the Yankees at Oyster Bay Such was that list of warlike worthies heretofore enumerated beginning with the Van Wycks the Van Dycks and the Ten Eycks and extending to the Rutgers the Bensons the Brinkerhoffs and the Schermerhorns a roll equal to the Doomsday Book of William the Conqueror and establishing the heroic origin of many an ancient aristocratical Dutch family These after all are the only legitimate nobility and lords of the soil these are the real beavers of the Manhattoes and much does it grieve me in modern days to see them elbowed aside by foreign invaders and more especially by those ingenious people the Sons of the Pilgrims who out bargain them in the market out speculate them on the exchange out top them in fortune and run up mushroom palaces so high that the tallest Dutch family mansion has not wind enough left for its weathercock In the proud days of Peter Stuyvesant however the good old Dutch aristocracy loomed out in all its grandeur The burly burgher in round crowned flaunderish hat with brim of vast circumference in portly gaberdine and bulbous multiplicity of breeches sat on his stoep and smoked his pipe in lordly silence nor did it ever enter his brain that the active restless Yankee whom he saw through his half shut eyes worrying about in dog day heat ever intent on the main chance was one day to usurp control over these goodly Dutch domains Already however the races regarded each other with disparaging eyes The Yankees sneeringly spoke of the round crowned burghers of the Manhattoes as the Copper heads while the latter glorying in their own nether rotundity and observing the slack galligaskins of their rivals flapping like an empty sail against the mast retorted upon them with the opprobrious appellation of Platter breeches CHAPTER II From what I have recounted in the foregoing chapter I would not have it imagined that the great Peter was a tyrannical potentate ruling with a rod of iron On the contrary where the dignity of office permitted he abounded in generosity and condescension If he refused the brawling multitude the right of misrule he at least endeavored to rule them in righteousness To spread abundance in the land he obliged the bakers to give thirteen loaves to the dozen a golden rule which remains a monument of his beneficence So far from indulging in unreasonable austerity he delighted to see the poor and the laboring man rejoice and for this purpose he was a great promoter of holidays Under his reign there was a great cracking of eggs at Paas or Easter Whitsuntide or Pinxter also flourished in all its bloom and never were stockings better filled on the eve of the blessed saint Nicholas New Year s Day however was his favorite festival and was ushered in by the ringing of bells and firing of guns On that genial day the fountains of hospitality were broken up and the whole community was deluged with cherry brandy true hollands and mulled cider every house was a temple to the jolly god and many a provident vagabond got drunk out of pure economy taking in liquor enough gratis to serve him half a year afterwards The great assemblage however was at the governor s house whither repaired all the burghers of New Amsterdam with their wives and daughters pranked out in their best attire On this occasion the good Peter was devoutly observant of the pious Dutch rite of kissing the women kind for a happy new year and it is traditional that Antony the trumpeter who acted as gentleman usher took toll of all who were young and handsome as they passed through the ante chamber This venerable custom thus happily introduced was followed with such zeal by high and low that on New Year s Day during the reign of Peter Stuyvesant New Amsterdam was the most thoroughly be kissed community in all Christendom Another great measure of Peter Stuyvesant for public improvement was the distribution of fiddles throughout the land These were placed in the hands of veteran negroes who were despatched as missionaries to every part of the province This measure it is said was first suggested by Antony the Trumpeter and the effect was marvelous Instead of those indignation meetings set on foot in the time of William the Testy where men met together to rail at public abuses groan over the evils of the times and make each other miserable there were joyous gatherings of the two sexes to dance and make merry Now were instituted quilting bees and husking bees and other rural assemblages where under the inspiring influence of the fiddle toil was enlivened by gayety and followed up by the dance Raising bees also were frequent where houses sprang up at the wagging of the fiddle stick as the walls of Thebes sprang up of yore to the sound of the lyre of Amphion Jolly autumn which pours its treasures over hill and dale was in those days a season for the lifting of the heel as well as the heart labor came dancing in the train of abundance and frolic prevailed throughout the land Happy days when the yeomanry of the Nieuw Nederlands were merry rather than wise and when the notes of the fiddle those harbingers of good humor and good will resounded at the close of the day from every hamlet along the Hudson Nor was it in rural communities alone that Peter Stuyvesant introduced his favorite engine of civilization Under his rule the fiddle acquired that potent sway in New Amsterdam which it has ever since retained Weekly assemblages were held not in heated ball rooms at midnight hours but on Saturday afternoons by the golden light of the sun on the green lawn of the Battery with Antony the Trumpeter for master of ceremonies Here would the good Peter take his seat under the spreading trees among the old burghers and their wives and watch the mazes of the dance Here would he smoke his pipe crack his joke and forget the rugged toils of war in the sweet oblivious festivities of peace giving a nod of approbation to those of the young men who shuffled and kicked most vigorously and now and then a hearty smack in all honesty of soul to the buxom lass who held out longest and tired down every competitor infallible proof of her being the best dancer Once it is true the harmony of these meetings was in danger of interruption A young belle just returned from a visit to Holland who of course led the fashions made her appearance in not more than half a dozen petticoats and these of alarming shortness A whisper and a flutter ran through the assembly The young men of course were lost in admiration but the old ladies were shocked in the extreme especially those who had marriageable daughters the young ladies blushed and felt excessively for the poor thing and even the governor himself appeared to be in some kind of perturbation To complete the confusion of the good folk she undertook in the course of a jig to describe some figures in algebra taught her by a dancing master at Rotterdam Unfortunately at the highest flourish of her feet some vagabond zephyr obtruded his services and a display of the graces took place at which all the ladies present were thrown into great consternation several grave country members were not a little moved and the good Peter Stuyvesant himself was grievously scandalized The shortness of the female dresses which had continued in fashion ever since the days of William Kieft had long offended his eye and though extremely averse to meddling with the petticoats of the ladies yet he immediately recommended that every one should be furnished with a flounce to the bottom He likewise ordered that the ladies and indeed the gentlemen should use no other step in dancing than shuffle and turn and double trouble and forbade under pain of his high displeasure any young lady thenceforth to attempt what was termed exhibiting the graces These were the only restrictions he ever imposed upon the sex and these were considered by them as tyrannical oppressions and resisted with that becoming spirit manifested by the gentle sex whenever their privileges are invaded In fact Antony Van Corlear who as has been shown was a sagacious man experienced in the ways of women took a private occasion to intimate to the governor that a conspiracy was forming among the young vrouws of New Amsterdam and that if the matter were pushed any further there was danger of their leaving off petticoats altogether whereupon the good Peter shrugged his shoulders dropped the subject and ever after suffered the women to wear their petticoats and cut their capers as high as they pleased a privilege which they have jealously maintained in the Manhattoes unto the present day CHAPTER III In the last two chapters I have regaled the reader with a delectable picture of the good Peter and his metropolis during an interval of peace It was however but a bit of blue sky in a stormy day the clouds are again gathering up from all points of the compass and if I am not mistaken in my forebodings we shall have rattling weather in the ensuing chapters It is with some communities as it is with certain meddlesome individuals they have a wonderful facility at getting into scrapes and I have always remarked that those are most prone to get in who have the least talent at getting out again This is doubtless owing to the excessive valor of those states for I have likewise noticed that this rampant quality is always most frothy and fussy where most confined which accounts for its vaporing so amazingly in little states little men and ugly little women more especially Such is the case with this little province of the Nieuw Nederlands which by its exceeding valor has already drawn upon itself a host of enemies has had fighting enough to satisfy a province twice its size and is in a fair way of becoming an exceedingly forlorn well belabored and woebegone little province All which was providentially ordered to give interest and sublimity to this pathetic history The first interruption to the halcyon quiet of Peter Stuyvesant was caused by hostile intelligence from the old belligerent nest of Rensellaersteen Killian the lordly patroon of Rensellaerwick was again in the field at the head of his myrmidons of the Helderberg seeking to annex the whole of the Catskill mountains to his domains The Indian tribes of these mountains had likewise taken up the hatchet and menaced the venerable Dutch settlements of Esopus Fain would I entertain the reader with the triumphant campaign of Peter Stuyvesant in the haunted regions of those mountains but that I hold all Indian conflicts to be mere barbaric brawls unworthy of the pen which has recorded the classic war of Fort Christina and as to these Helderberg commotions they are among the flatulencies which from time to time afflict the bowels of this ancient province as with a wind colic and which I deem it seemly and decent to pass over in silence The next storm of trouble was from the south Scarcely had the worthy Mynheer Beekman got warm in the seat of authority on the South River than enemies began to spring up all around him Hard by was a formidable race of savages inhabiting the gentle region watered by the Susquehanna of whom the following mention is made by Master Hariot in his excellent history The Susquesahanocks are a giantly people strange in proportion behavior and attire their voice sounding from them as out of a cave Their tobacco pipes were three quarters of a yard long carved at the great end with a bird beare or other device sufficient to beat out the brains of a horse The calfe of one of their legges measured three quarters of a yard about the rest of the limbs proportionable fifty seven These gigantic savages and smokers caused no little disquiet in the mind of Mynheer Beekman threatening to cause a famine of tobacco in the land but his most formidable enemy was the roaring roistering English colony of Maryland or as it was anciently written Merryland so called because the inhabitants not having the fear of the Lord before their eyes were prone to make merry and get fuddled with mint julep and apple toddy They were moreover great horse racers and cock fighters mighty wrestlers and jumpers and enormous consumers of hoe cake and bacon They lay claim to be the first inventors of those recondite beverages cock tail stone fence and sherry cobbler and to have discovered the gastronomical merits of terrapins soft crabs and canvas back ducks This rantipole colony founded by Lord Baltimore a British nobleman was managed by his agent a swaggering Englishman commonly called Fendall that is to say offend all a name given him for his bullying propensities These were seen in a message to Mynheer Beekman threatening him unless he immediately swore allegiance to Lord Baltimore as the rightful lord of the soil to come at the head of the roaring boys of Merryland and the giants of the Susquehanna and sweep him and his Nederlanders out of the country The trusty sword of Peter Stuyvesant almost leaped from its scabbard when he received missives from Mynheer Beekman informing him of the swaggering menaces of the bully Fendall and as to the giantly warriors of the Susquehanna nothing would have more delighted him than a bout hand to hand with half a score of them having never encountered a giant in the whole course of his campaigns unless we may consider the stout Risingh as such and he was but a little one Nothing prevented his marching instantly to the South River and enacting scenes still more glorious than those of Fort Christina but the necessity of first putting a stop to the increasing aggressions and inroads of the Yankees so as not to leave an enemy in his rear but he wrote to Mynheer Beekman to keep up a bold front and a stout heart promising as soon as he had settled affairs in the east that he would hasten to the south with his burly warriors of the Hudson to lower the crests of the giants and mar the merriment of the Merrylanders FOOTNOTES fifty seven Hariot s Journal Purch Pilgrims CHAPTER IV To explain the apparently sudden movement of Peter Stuyvesant against the crafty men of the East Country I would observe that during his campaigns on the South River and in the enchanted regions of the Catskill Mountains the twelve tribes of the East had been more than usually active in prosecuting their subtle scheme for the subjugation of the Nieuw Nederlands Independent of the incessant maraudings among hen roosts and squattings along the border invading armies would penetrate from time to time into the very heart of the country As their prototypes of yore went forth into the land of Canaan with their wives and their children their men servants and their maid servants their flocks and herds to settle themselves down in the land and possess it so these chosen people of modern days would progress through the country in patriarchal style conducting carts and waggons laden with household furniture with women and children piled on top and pots and kettles dangling beneath At the tail of these vehicles would stalk a crew of long limbed lank sided varlets with axes on their shoulders and packs on their backs resolutely bent upon locating themselves as they termed it and improving the country These were the most dangerous kind of invaders It is true they were guilty of no overt acts of hostility but it was notorious that wherever they got a footing the honest Dutchmen gradually disappeared retiring slowly as do the Indians before the white men being in some way or other talked and chaffered and bargained and swapped and in plain English elbowed out of all those rich bottoms and fertile nooks in which our Dutch yeomanry are prone to nestle themselves Peter Stuyvesant was at length roused to this kind of war in disguise by which the Yankees were craftily aiming to subjugate his dominions He was a man easily taken in it is true as all great hearted men are apt to be but if he once found it out his wrath was terrible He now threw diplomacy to the dogs determined to appear no more by ambassadors but to repair in person to the great council of the Amphictyons bearing the sword in one hand and the olive branch in the other and giving them their choice of sincere and honest peace or open and iron war His privy council were astonished and dismayed when he announced his determination For once they ventured to remonstrate setting forth the rashness of venturing his sacred person in the midst of a strange and barbarous people They might as well have tried to turn a rusty weathercock with a broken winded bellows In the fiery heart of the iron headed Peter sat enthroned the five kinds of courage described by Aristotle and had the philosopher enumerated five hundred more I verily believed he would have possessed them all As to that better part of valor called discretion it was too cold blooded a virtue for his tropical temperament Summoning therefore to his presence his trusty follower Antony Van Corlear he commanded him to hold himself in readiness to accompany him the following morning on this his hazardous enterprise Now Antony the Trumpeter was by this time a little stricken in years yet by dint of keeping up a good heart and having never known care or sorrow having never been married he was still a hearty jocund rubicund gamesome wag and of great capacity in the doublet This last was ascribed to his living a jolly life on those domains at the Hook which Peter Stuyvesant had granted to him for his gallantry at Fort Casimir Be this as it may there was nothing that more delighted Antony than this command of the great Peter for he could have followed the stout hearted old governor to the world s end with love and loyalty and he moreover still remembered the frolicing and dancing and bundling and other disports of the east country and entertained dainty recollections of numerous kind and buxom lasses whom he longed exceedingly again to encounter Thus then did this mirror of hardihood set forth with no other attendant but his trumpeter upon one of the most perilous enterprises ever recorded in the annals of knight errantry For a single warrior to venture openly among a whole nation of foes but above all for a plain downright Dutchman to think of negotiating with the whole council of New England never was there known a more desperate undertaking Ever since I have entered upon the chronicles of this peerless but hitherto uncelebrated chieftain has he kept me in a state of incessant action and anxiety with the toils and dangers he is constantly encountering Oh for a chapter of the tranquil reign of Wouter Van Twiller that I might repose on it as on a feather bed Is it not enough Peter Stuyvesant that I have once already rescued thee from the machinations of these terrible Amphictyons by bringing the powers of witchcraft to thine aid Is it not enough that I have followed thee undaunted like a guardian spirit into the midst of the horrid battle of Fort Christina That I have been put incessantly to my trumps to keep them safe and sound now warding off with my single pen the shower of dastard blows that fell upon thy rear now narrowly shielding thee from a deadly thrust by a mere tobacco box now casing thy dauntless skull with adamant when even thy stubborn ram beaver failed to resist the sword of the stout Risingh and now not merely bringing thee off alive but triumphant from the clutches of the gigantic Swede by the desperate means of a paltry stone pottle Is not all this enough but must thou still be plunging into new difficulties and hazarding in headlong enterprises thyself thy trumpeter and thy historian And now the ruddy faced Aurora like a buxom chambermaid draws aside the sable curtains of the night and out bounces from his bed the jolly red haired Phoebus startled at being caught so late in the embraces of Dame Thetis With many a stable boy oath he harnesses his brazen footed steeds and whips and lashes and splashes up the firmament like a loitering coachman half an hour behind his time And now behold that imp of fame and prowess the headstrong Peter bestriding a raw boned switch tailed charger gallantly arrayed in full regimentals and bracing on his thigh that trusty brass hilted sword which had wrought such fearful deeds on the banks of the Delaware Behold hard after him his doughty trumpeter Van Corlear mounted on a broken winded walleyed calico mare his stone pottle which had laid low the mighty Risingh slung under his arm and his trumpet displayed vauntingly in his right hand decorated with a gorgeous banner on which is emblazoned the great beaver of the Manhattoes See them proudly issuing out of the city gate like an iron clad hero of yore with his faithful squire at his heels the populace following with their eyes and shouting many a parting wish and hearty cheering Farewell Hardkoppig Piet Farewell honest Antony pleasant be your wayfaring prosperous your return the stoutest hero that ever drew a sword and the worthiest trumpeter that ever trod shoe leather Legends are lamentably silent about the events that befell our adventurers in this their adventurous travel excepting the Stuyvesant manuscript which gives the substance of a pleasant little heroic poem written on the occasion by Dominie AEgidius Luyck fifty eight who appears to have been the poet laureate of New Amsterdam This inestimable manuscript assures us that it was a rare spectacle to behold the great Peter and his loyal follower hailing the morning sun and rejoicing in the clear countenance of Nature as they pranced it through the pastoral scenes of Bloemen Dael which in those days was a sweet and rural valley beautiful with many a bright wild flower refreshed by many a pure streamlet and enlivened here and there by a delectable little Dutch cottage sheltered under some sloping hill and almost buried in embowering trees Now did they enter upon the confines of Connecticut where they encountered many grievous difficulties and perils At one place they were assailed by a troop of country squires and militia colonels who mounted on goodly steeds hung upon their rear for several miles harassing them exceedingly with guesses and questions more especially the worthy Peter whose silver chased leg excited not a little marvel At another place hard by the renowned town of Stamford they were set upon by a great and mighty legion of church deacons who imperiously demanded of them five shillings for traveling on Sunday and threatened to carry them captive to a neighboring church whose steeple peered above the trees but these the valiant Peter put to rout with little difficulty insomuch that they bestrode their canes and galloped off in horrible confusion leaving their cocked hats behind in the hurry of their flight But not so easily did he escape from the hands of a crafty man of Pyquag who with undaunted perseverance and repeated onsets fairly bargained him out of his goodly switch tailed charger leaving in place thereof a villainous foundered Narraganset pacer But maugre all these hardships they pursued their journey cheerily along the course of the soft flowing Connecticut whose gentle waves says the song roll through many a fertile vale and sunny plain now reflecting the lofty spires of the bustling city and now the rural beauties of the humble hamlet now echoing with the busy hum of commerce and now with the cheerful song of the peasant At every town would Peter Stuyvesant who was noted for warlike punctilio order the sturdy Antony to sound a courteous salutation though the manuscript observes that the inhabitants were thrown into great dismay when they heard of his approach For the fame of his incomparable achievements on the Delaware had spread throughout the east country and they dreaded lest he had come to take vengeance on their manifold transgressions But the good Peter rode through these towns with a smiling aspect waving his hand with inexpressible majesty and condescension for he verily believed that the old clothes which these ingenious people had thrust into their broken windows and the festoons of dried apples and peaches which ornamented the fronts of their houses were so many decorations in honor of his approach as it was the custom in the days of chivalry to compliment renowned heroes by sumptuous displays of tapestry and gorgeous furniture The women crowded to the doors to gaze upon him as he passed so much does prowess in arms delight the gentler sex The little children too ran after him in troops staring with wonder at his regimentals his brimstone breeches and the silver garniture of his wooden leg Nor must I omit to mention the joy which many strapping wenches betrayed at beholding the jovial Van Corlear who had whilom delighted them so much with his trumpet when he bore the great Peter s challenge to the Amphictyons The kind hearted Antony alighted from his calico mare and kissed them all with infinite loving kindness and was right pleased to see a crew of little trumpeters crowding round him for his blessing each of whom he patted on the head bade him be a good boy and gave him a penny to buy molasses candy FOOTNOTES fifty eight This Luyck was moreover rector of the Latin School in Nieuw Nederlands sixteen sixty three There are two pieces addressed to AEgidius Luyck in D Selyn s MSS of poesies upon his marriage with Judith Isendoorn Old MSS CHAPTER V Now so it happened that while the great and good Peter Stuyvesant followed by his trusty squire was making his chivalric progress through the east country a dark and direful scheme of war against his beloved province was forming in that nursery of monstrous projects the British Cabinet This we are confidently informed was the result of the secret instigations of the great council of the league who finding themselves totally incompetent to vie in arms with the heavy sterned warriors of the Manhattoes and their iron headed commander sent emissaries to the British Government setting forth in eloquent language the wonders and delights of this delicious little Dutch Canaan and imploring that a force might be sent out to invade it by sea while they should company operate by land These emissaries arrived at a critical juncture just as the British Lion was beginning to bristle up his mane and wag his tail for we are assured by the anonymous writer of the Stuyvesant manuscript that the astounding victory of Peter Stuyvesant at Fort Christina had resounded throughout Europe and his annexation of the territory of New Sweden had awakened the jealousy of the British Cabinet for their wild lands at the south This jealousy was brought to a head by the representations of Lord Baltimore who declared that the territory thus annexed lay within the lands granted to him by the British Crown and he claimed to be protected in his rights Lord Sterling another British subject claimed the whole of Nassau or Lond Island once the Ophir of William the Testy but now the kitchen garden of the Manhattoes which he declared to be British territory by the right of discovery but unjustly usurped by the Nederlanders The result of all these rumors and representations was a sudden zeal on the part of his Majesty Charles the Second for the safety and well being of his transatlantic possessions and especially for the recovery of the New Netherlands which Yankee logic had somehow or other proved to be a continuity of the territory taken possession of for the British Crown by the pilgrims when they landed on Plymouth Rock fugitives from British oppression All this goodly land thus wrongfully held by the Dutchmen he presented in a fit of affection to his brother the Duke of York a donation truly royal since none but great sovereigns have a right to give away what does not belong to them That this munificent gift might not be merely nominal his Majesty ordered that an armament should be straightway despatched to invade the city of New Amsterdam by land and water and put his brother in complete possession of the premises Thus critically situated are the affairs of the New Nederlanders While the honest burghers are smoking their pipes in somber security and the privy councillors are snoring in the council chamber while Peter the Headstrong is undauntedly making his way through the east country in the confident hope by honest words and manly deeds to bring the grand council to terms a hostile fleet is sweeping like a thunder cloud across the Atlantic soon to rattle a storm of war about the ears of the dozing Nederlanders and to put the mettle of their governor to the trial But come what may I here pledge my veracity that in all warlike conflicts and doubtful perplexities he will every acquit himself like a gallant noble minded obstinate old cavalier Forward then to the charge Shine out propitious stars on the renowned city of the Manhattoes and the blessing of saint Nicholas go with thee honest Peter Stuyvesant CHAPTER VI Great nations resemble great men in this particular that their greatness is seldom known until they get in trouble adversity therefore has been wisely denominated the ordeal of true greatness which like gold can never receive its real estimation until it has passed through the furnace In proportion therefore as a nation a community or an individual possessing the inherent quality of greatness is involved in perils and misfortunes in proportion does it rise in grandeur and even when sinking under calamity makes like a house on fire a more glorious display than ever it did in the fairest period of its prosperity The vast Empire of China though teeming with population and imbibing and concentrating the wealth of nations has vegetated through a succession of drowsy ages and were it not for its internal revolution and the subversion of its ancient government by the Tartars might have presented nothing but a dull detail of monotonous prosperity Pompeii and Herculaneum might have passed into oblivion with a herd of their contemporaries had they not been fortunately overwhelmed by a volcano The renowned city of Troy acquired celebrity only from its ten years distress and final conflagration Paris rose in importance by the plots and massacres which ended in the exaltation of Napoleon and even the mighty London has skulked through the records of time celebrated for nothing of moment excepting the Plague the Great Fire and Guy Faux s Gunpowder Plot Thus cities and empires creep along enlarging in silent obscurity until they burst forth in some tremendous calamity and snatch as it were immortality from the explosion The above principle being admitted my reader will plainly perceive that the city of New Amsterdam and its dependent province are on the high road to greatness Dangers and hostilities threaten from every side and it is really a matter of astonishment how so small a State has been able in so short a time to entangle itself in so many difficulties Ever since the province was first taken by the nose at the Fort of Good Hope in the tranquil days of Wouter Van Twiller has it been gradually increasing in historic importance and never could it have had a more appropriate chieftain to conduct it to the pinnacle of grandeur than Peter Stuyvesant This truly headstrong hero having successfully effected his daring progress through the east country girded up his loins as he approached Boston and prepared for the grand onslaught with the Amphictyons which was to be the crowning achievement of the campaign Throwing Antony Van Corlear who with his calico mare formed his escort and army a little in the advance and bidding him be of stout heart and great mind he placed himself firmly in his saddle cocked his hat more fiercely over his left eye summoned all the heroism of his soul into his countenance and with one arm akimbo the hand resting on the pommel of his sword rode into the great metropolis of the league Antony sounding his trumpet before him in a manner to electrify the whole community Never was there such a stir in Boston as on this occasion never such a hurrying hither and thither about the streets such popping of heads out of windows such gathering of knots in market places Peter Stuyvesant was a straightforward man and prone to do everything above board He would have ridden at once to the great council house of the league and sounded a parley but the grand council knew the mettlesome hero they had to deal with and were not for doing things in a hurry On the contrary they sent forth deputations to meet him on the way to receive him in a style befitting the great potentate of the Manhattoes and to multiply all kinds of honors and ceremonies and formalities and other courteous impediments in his path Solemn banquets were accordingly given him equal to thanksgiving feasts Complimentary speeches were made him wherein he was entertained with the surpassing virtues long sufferings and achievements of the Pilgrim Fathers and it is even said he was treated to a sight of Plymouth Rock that great corner stone of Yankee empire I will not detain my readers by recounting the endless devices by which time was wasted and obstacles and delays multiplied to the infinite annoyance of the impatient Peter Neither will I fatigue them by dwelling on his negotiations with the grand council when he at length brought them to business Suffice it to say it was like most other diplomatic negotiations a great deal was said and very little done one conversation led to another one conference begot misunderstandings which it took a dozen conferences to explain at the end of which both parties found themselves just where they had begun but ten times less likely to come to an agreement In the midst of these perplexities which bewildered the brain and incensed the ire of honest Peter he received private intelligence of the dark conspiracy matured in the British Cabinet with the astounding fact that a British squadron was already on the way to invade New Amsterdam by sea and that the grand council of Amphictyons while thus beguiling him with subtleties were actually prepared to company operate by land Oh how did the sturdy old warrior rage and roar when he found himself thus entrapped like a lion in the hunter s toil Now did he draw his trusty sword and determine to break in upon the council of the Amphictyons and put every mother s son of them to death Now did he resolve to fight his way throughout all the regions of the east and to lay waste Connecticut river Gallant but unfortunate Peter Did I not enter with sad forebodings on this ill starred expedition Did I not tremble when I saw thee with no other councillor than thine own head no other armour but an honest tongue a spotless conscience and a rusty sword no other protector but saint Nicholas and no other attendant but a trumpeter did I not tremble when I beheld thee thus sally forth to contend with all the knowing powers of New England It was a long time before the kind hearted expostulations of Antony Van Corlear aided by the soothing melody of his trumpet could lower the spirits of Peter Stuyvesant from their warlike and vindictive tone and prevent his making widows and orphans of half the population of Boston With great difficulty he was prevailed upon to bottle up his wrath for the present to conceal from the council his knowledge of their machinations and by effecting his escape to be able to arrive in time for the salvation of the Manhattoes The latter suggestion awakened a new ray of hope in his bosom he forthwith dispatched a secret message to his councillors at New Amsterdam apprising them of their danger and commanding them to put the city in a posture of defense promising to come as soon as possible to their assistance This done he felt marvelously relieved rose slowly shook himself like a rhinoceros and issued forth from his den in much the same manner as Giant Despair is described to have issued from Doubting Castle in the chivalric history of the Pilgrim s Progress And now much does it grieve me that I must leave the gallant Peter in this imminent jeopardy but it behooves us to hurry back and see what is going on at New Amsterdam for greatly do I fear that city is already in a turmoil Such was ever the fate of Peter Stuyvesant while doing one thing with heart and soul he was too apt to leave everything else at sixes and sevens While like a potentate of yore he was absent attending to those things in person which in modern days are trusted to generals and ambassadors his little territory at home was sure to get in an uproar all which was owing to that uncommon strength of intellect which induced him to trust to nobody but himself and which had acquired him the renowned appellation of Peter the Headstrong CHAPTER VII There is no sight more truly interesting to a philosopher than a community where every individual has a voice in public affairs where every individual considers himself the Atlas of the nation and where every individual thinks it his duty to bestir himself for the good of his country I say there is nothing more interesting to a philosopher than such a community in a sudden bustle of war Such clamor of tongues such patriotic bawling such running hither and thither everybody in a hurry everybody in trouble everybody in the way and everybody interrupting his neighbor who is busily employed in doing nothing It is like witnessing a great fire where the whole community are agog some dragging about empty engines others scampering with full buckets and spilling the contents into their neighbors boots and others ringing the church bells all night by way of putting out the fire Little firemen like sturdy little knights storming a breach clambering up and down scaling ladders and bawling through tin trumpets by way of directing the attack Here a fellow in his great zeal to save the property of the unfortunate catches up some article of no value and gallants it off with an air of as much self importance as if he had rescued a pot of money there another throws looking glasses and china out of the window to save them from the flames whilst those who can do nothing else run up and down the streets keeping up an incessant cry of Fire fire fire When the news arrived at Sinope says Lucian though I own the story is rather trite that Philip was about to attack them the inhabitants were thrown into a violent alarm Some ran to furbish up their arms others rolled stones to build up the walls everybody in short was employed and everybody in the way of his neighbor Diogenes alone could find nothing to do whereupon not to be idle when the welfare of his country was at stake he tucked up his robe and fell to rolling his tub with might and main up and down the Gymnasium In like manner did every mother s son in the patriotic community of New Amsterdam on receiving the missives of Peter Stuyvesant busy himself most mightily in putting things in confusion and assisting the general uproar Every man said the Stuyvesant manuscript flew to arms by which is meant that not one of our honest Dutch citizens would venture to church or to market without an old fashioned spit of a sword dangling at his side and a long Dutch fowling piece on his shoulder nor would he go out of a night without a lantern nor turn a corner without first peeping cautiously round lest he should come unawares upon a British army and we are informed that Stoffel Brinkerhoff who was considered by the old women almost as brave a man as the governor himself actually had two one pound swivels mounted in his entry one pointing out at the front door and the other at the back But the most strenuous measure resorted to on this awful occasion and one which has since been found of wonderful efficacy was to assemble popular meetings These brawling convocations I have already shown were extremely offensive to Peter Stuyvesant but as this was a moment of unusual agitation and as the old governor was not present to repress them they broke out with intolerable violence Hither therefore the orators and politicians repaired striving who should bawl loudest and exceed the others in hyperbolical bursts of patriotism and in resolutions to uphold and defend the government In these sage meetings it was resolved that they were the most enlightened the most dignified the most formidable and the most ancient community upon the face of the earth This resolution being carried unanimously another was immediately proposed whether it were not possible and politic to exterminate Great Britain upon which sixty nine members spoke in the affirmative and only one arose to suggest some doubts who as a punishment for his treasonable presumption was immediately seized by the mob and tarred and feathered which punishment being equivalent to the Tarpeian Rock he was afterwards considered as an outcast from society and his opinion went for nothing The question therefore being unanimously carried in the affirmative it was recommended to the grand council to pass it into a law which was accordingly done By this measure the hearts of the people at large were wonderfully encouraged and they waxed exceeding choleric and valorous Indeed the first paroxysm of alarm having in some measure subsided the old women having buried all the money they could lay their hands on and their husbands daily getting fuddled with what was left the community began even to stand on the offensive Songs were manufactured in Low Dutch and sung about the streets wherein the English were most woefully beaten and shown no quarter and popular addresses were made wherein it was proved to a certainty that the fate of Old England depended upon the will of the New Amsterdammers Finally to strike a violent blow at the very vitals of Great Britain a multitude of the wiser inhabitants assembled and having purchased all the British manufactures they could find they made thereof a huge bonfire and in the patriotic glow of the moment every man present who had a hat or breeches of English workmanship pulled it off and threw it into the flames to the irreparable detriment loss and ruin of the English manufacturers In commemoration of this great exploit they erected a pole on the spot with a device on the top intended to represent the province of Nieuw Nederlandts destroying Great Britain under the similitude of an eagle picking the little island of Old England out of the globe but either through the unskillfulness of the sculptor or his ill timed waggery it bore a striking resemblance to a goose vainly striving to get hold of a dumpling CHAPTER VIII It will need but little penetration in any one conversant with the ways of that wise but windy potentate the sovereign people to discover that not withstanding all the warlike bluster and bustle of the last chapter the city of New Amsterdam was not a whit more prepared for war than before The privy councillors of Peter Stuyvesant were aware of this and having received his private orders to put the city in an immediate posture of defense they called a meeting of the oldest and richest burghers to assist them with their wisdom These were of that order of citizens commonly termed men of the greatest weight in the community their weight being estimated by the heaviness of their heads and of their purses Their wisdom in fact is apt to be of a ponderous kind and to hang like a millstone round the neck of the community Two things were unanimously determined in this assembly of venerables first that the city required to be put in a state of defense and second that as the danger was imminent there should be no time lost which points being settled they fell to making long speeches and belaboring one another in endless and intemperate disputes For about this time was this unhappy city first visited by that talking endemic so prevalent in this country and which so invariably evinces itself wherever a number of wise men assemble together breaking out in long windy speeches caused as physicians suppose by the foul air which is ever generated in a crowd Now it was moreover that they first introduced the ingenious method of measuring the merits of an harangue by the hour glass he being considered the ablest orator who spoke longest on a question For which excellent invention it is recorded we are indebted to the same profound Dutch critic who judged of books by their size This sudden passion for endless harangues so little consonant with the customary gravity and taciturnity of our sage forefathers was supposed by certain philosophers to have been imbibed together with divers other barbarous propensities from their savage neighbors who were peculiarly noted for long talks and council fires and never undertook any affair of the least importance without previous debates and harangues among their chiefs and old men But the real cause was that the people in electing their representatives to the grand council were particular in choosing them for their talents at talking without inquiring whether they possessed the more rare difficult and oft times important talent of holding their tongues The consequence was that this deliberative body was composed of the most loquacious men in the community As they considered themselves placed there to talk every man concluded that his duty to his constituents and what is more his popularity with them required that he should harangue on every subject whether he understood it or not There was an ancient mode of burying a chieftain by every soldier throwing his shield full of earth on the corpse until a mighty mound was formed so whenever a question was brought forward in this assembly every member pressing forward to throw on his quantum of wisdom the subject was quickly buried under a mountain of words We are told that disciples on entering the school of Pythagoras were for two years enjoined silence and forbidden either to ask questions or make remarks After they had thus acquired the inestimable art of holding their tongues they were gradually permitted to make inquiries and finally to communicate their own opinions With what a beneficial effect could this wise regulation of Pythagoras be introduced in modern legislative bodies and how wonderfully would it have tended to expedite business in the grand council of the Manhattoes At this perilous juncture the fatal word economy the stumbling block of William the Testy had been once more set afloat according to which the cheapest plan of defense was insisted upon as the best it being deemed a great stroke of policy in furnishing powder to economise in ball Thus old Dame Wisdom whom the wags of antiquity have humorously personified as a woman seem to take a mischievous pleasure in jilting the venerable councillors of New Amsterdam To add to the confusion the old factions of Short Pipes and Long Pipes which had been almost strangled by the Herculean grasp of Peter Stuyvesant now sprang up with tenfold vigor Whatever was proposed by a Short Pipe was opposed by the whole tribe of Long Pipes who like true partisans deemed it their first duty to effect the downfall of their rivals their second to elevate themselves and their third to consult the public good though many left the third consideration out of question altogether In this great collision of hard heads it is astonishing the number of projects that were struck out projects which threw the windmill system of William the Testy completely in the background These were almost uniformly opposed by the men of the greatest weight in the community your weighty men though slow to devise being always great at negativing Among these were a set of fat self important old burghers who smoked their pipes and said nothing except to negative every plan of defence proposed These were that class of conservatives who having amassed a fortune button up their pockets shut their mouths sink as it were into themselves and pass the rest of their lives in the indwelling beatitude of conscious wealth as some phlegmatic oyster having swallowed a pearl closes its shell sinks in the mud and devotes the rest of its life to the conservation of its treasure Every plan of defence seemed to these worthy old gentlemen pregnant with ruin An armed force was a legion of locusts preying upon the public property to fit out a naval armament was to throw their money into the sea to build fortifications was to bury it in the dirt In short they settled it as a sovereign maxim so long as their pockets were full no matter how much they were drubbed A kick left no scar a broken head cured itself but an empty purse was of all maladies the slowest to heal and one in which nature did nothing for the patient Thus did this venerable assembly of sages lavish away their time which the urgency of affairs rendered invaluable in empty brawls and long winded speeches without ever agreeing except on the point with which they started namely that there was no time to be lost and delay was ruinous At length saint Nicholas taking compassion on their distracted situation and anxious to preserve them from anarchy so ordered that in the midst of one of their most noisy debates on the subject of fortification and defence when they had nearly fallen to loggerheads in consequence of not being able to convince each other the question was happily settled by the sudden entrance of a messenger who informed them that a hostile fleet had arrived and was actually advancing up the bay CHAPTER IX Like as an assemblage of belligerent cats gibbering and caterwauling eyeing one another with hideous grimaces and contortions spitting in each other s faces and on the point of a general clapper clawing are suddenly put to scampering rout and confusion by the appearance of a house dog so was the no less vociferous council of New Amsterdam amazed astounded and totally dispersed by the sudden arrival of the enemy Every member waddled home as fast as his short legs could carry him wheezing as he went with corpulency and terror Arrived at his castle he barricaded the street door and buried himself in the cider cellar without venturing to peep out lest he should have his head carried off by a cannon ball The sovereign people crowded into the marketplace herding together with the instinct of sheep who seek safety in each other s company when the shepherd and his dog are absent and the wolf is prowling round the fold Far from finding relief however they only increased each other s terrors Each man looked ruefully in his neighbor s face in search of encouragement but only found in its woebegone lineaments a confirmation of his own dismay Not a word now was to be heard of conquering Great Britain not a whisper about the sovereign virtues of economy while the old women heightened the general gloom by clamorously bewailing their fate and calling for protection on saint Nicholas and Peter Stuyvesant Oh how did they bewail the absence of the lion hearted Peter and how did they long for the comforting presence of Antony Van Corlear Indeed a gloomy uncertainty hung over the fate of these adventurous heroes Day after day had elapsed since the alarming message from the governor without bringing any further tidings of his safety Many a fearful conjecture was hazarded as to what had befallen him and his loyal squire Had they not been devoured alive by the cannibals of Marblehead and Cape Cod Had they not been put to the question by the great council of Amphictyons Had they not been smothered in onions by the terrible men of Pyquag In the midst of this consternation and perplexity when horror like a mighty nightmare sat brooding upon the little fat plethoric city of New Amsterdam the ears of the multitude were suddenly startled by the distant sound of a trumpet it approached it grew louder and louder and now it resounded at the city gate The public could not be mistaken in the well known sound a shout of joy burst from their lips as the gallant Peter covered with dust and followed by his faithful trumpeter came galloping into the marketplace The first transports of the populace having subsided they gathered round the honest Antony as he dismounted overwhelming him with greetings and congratulations In breathless accents he related to them the marvelous adventures through which the old governor and himself had gone in making their escape from the clutches of the terrible Amphictyons But though the Stuyvesant manuscript with its customary minuteness where anything touching the great Peter is concerned is very particular as to the incidents of this masterly retreat the state of the public affairs will not allow me to indulge in a full recital thereof Let it suffice to say that while Peter Stuyvesant was anxiously revolving in his mind how he could make good his escape with honor and dignity certain of the ships sent out for the conquest of the Manhattoes touched at the eastern ports to obtain supplies and to call on the grand council of the league for its promised company operation Upon hearing of this the vigilant Peter perceiving that a moment s delay were fatal made a secret and precipitate decampment though much did it grieve his lofty soul to be obliged to turn his back even upon a nation of foes Many hair breadth escapes and divers perilous mishaps did they sustain as they scourged without sound of trumpet through the fair regions of the east Already was the country in an uproar with hostile preparation and they were obliged to take a large circuit in their flight lurking along through the woody mountains of the Devil s Backbone whence the valiant Peter sallied forth one day like a lion and put to rout a whole legion of squatters consisting of three generations of a prolific family who were already on their way to take possession of some corner of the New Netherlands Nay the faithful Antony had great difficulty at sundry times to prevent him in the excess of his wrath from descending down from the mountains and falling sword in hand upon certain of the border towns who were marshaling forth their draggle tailed militia The first movement of the governor on reaching his dwelling was to mount the roof whence he contemplated with rueful aspect the hostile squadron This had already come to anchor in the bay and consisted of two stout frigates having on board as John Josselyn gent informs us three hundred valiant red coats Having taken this survey he sat himself down and wrote an epistle to the commander demanding the reason of his anchoring in the harbor without obtaining previous permission so to do This letter was couched in the most dignified and courteous terms though I have it from undoubted authority that his teeth were clinched and he had a bitter sardonic grin upon his visage all the while he wrote Having despatched his letter the grim Peter stumped to and fro about the town with a most war betokening countenance his hands thrust into his breeches pockets and whistling a low Dutch psalm tune which bore no small resemblance to the music of a northeast wind when a storm is brewing The very dogs as they eyed him skulked away in dismay while all the old and ugly women of New Amsterdam ran howling at his heels imploring him to save them from murder robbery and pitiless ravishment The reply of Colonel Nicholas who commanded the invaders was couched in terms of equal courtesy with the letter of the governor declaring the right and title of his British Majesty to the province where he affirmed the Dutch to be mere interlopers and demanding that the town forts et cetera should be forthwith rendered into his majesty s obedience and protection promising at the same time life liberty estate and free trade to every Dutch denizen who should readily submit to his Majesty s government Peter Stuyvesant read over this friendly epistle with some such harmony of aspect as we may suppose a crusty farmer reads the loving letter of John Stiles warning him of an action of ejectment He was not however to be taken by surprise but thrusting the summons into his breeches pocket stalked three times across the room took a pinch of snuff with great vehemence and then loftily waving his hand promised to send an answer the next morning He now summoned a general meeting of his privy councillors and burgomasters not to ask their advice for confident in his own strong head he needed no man s counsel but apparently to give them a piece of his mind on their late craven conduct His orders being duly promulgated it was a piteous sight to behold the late valiant burgomasters who had demolished the whole British empire in their harangues peeping ruefully out of their hiding places crawling cautiously forth dodging through narrow lanes and alleys starting at every little dog that barked mistaking lamp posts for British grenadiers and in the excess of their panic metamorphosing pumps into formidable soldiers levelling blunderbusses at their bosoms Having however in despite of numerous perils and difficulties of the kind arrived safe without the loss of a single man at the hall of assembly they took their seats and awaited in fearful silence the arrival of the governor In a few moments the wooden leg of the intrepid Peter was heard in regular and stout hearted thumps upon the staircase He entered the chamber arrayed in full suit of regimentals and carrying his trusty toledo not girded on his thigh but tucked under his arm As the governor never equipped himself in this portentious manner unless something of martial nature were working within his pericranium his council regarded him ruefully as if they saw fire and sword in his iron countenance and forgot to light their pipes in breathless suspense His first words were to rate his council soundly for having wasted in idle debate and party feud the time which should have been devoted to putting the city in a state of defence He was particularly indignant at those brawlers who had disgraced the councils of the province by empty bickerings and scurrilous invectives against an absent enemy He now called upon them to make good their words by deeds as the enemy they had defied and derided was at the gate Finally he informed them of the summons he had received to surrender but concluded by swearing to defend the province as long as Heaven was on his side and he had a wooden leg to stand upon which warlike sentence he emphasized by a thwack with the flat of his sword upon the table that quite electrified his auditors The privy councillors who had long since been brought into as perfect discipline as were ever the soldiers of the great Frederick knew there was no use in saying a word so lighted their pipes and smoked away in silence like fat and discreet councillors But the burgomasters being inflated with considerable importance and self sufficiency acquired at popular meetings were not so easily satisfied Mustering up fresh spirit when they found there was some chance of escaping from their present jeopardy without the disagreeable alternative of fighting they requested a copy of the summons to surrender that they might show it to a general meeting of the people So insolent and mutinous a request would have been enough to have roused the gorge of the tranquil Van Twiller himself what then must have been its effect upon the great Stuyvesant who was not only a Dutchman a governor and a valiant wooden legged soldier to boot but withal a man of the most stomachful and gunpowder disposition He burst forth into a blaze of indignation swore not a mother s son of them should see a syllable of it that as to their advice or concurrence he did not care a whiff of tobacco for either that they might go home and go to bed like old women for he was determined to defend the colony himself without the assistance of them or their adherents So saying he tucked his sword under his arm cocked his hat upon his head and girding up his loins stumped indignantly out of the council chamber everybody making room for him as he passed No sooner was he gone than the busy burgomasters called a public meeting in front of the stadthouse where they appointed as chairman one Dofue Roerback formerly a meddlesome member of the cabinet during the reign of William the Testy but kicked out of office by Peter Stuyvesant on taking the reins of government He was withal a mighty gingerbread baker in the land and reverenced by the populace as a man of dark knowledge seeing that he was the first to imprint New year cakes with the mysterious hieroglyphics of the Cock and Breeches and such like magical devices This burgomaster who still chewed the cud of ill will against Peter Stuyvesant addressed the multitude in what is called a patriotic speech informing them of the courteous summons which the governor had received to surrender of his refusal to comply therewith and of his denying the public even a sight of the summons which doubtless contained conditions highly to the honor and advantage of the province He then proceeded to speak of his excellency in high sounding terms of vituperation suited to the dignity of his station comparing him to Nero Caligula and other flagrant great men of yore assuring the people that the history of the world did not contain a despotic outrage equal to the present that it would be recorded in letters of fire on the blood stained tablet of history that ages would roll back with sudden horror when they came to view it that the womb of time by the way your orators and writers take strange liberties with the womb of time though some would fain have us believe that time is an old gentleman that the womb of time pregnant as it was with direful horrors would never produce a parallel enormity with a variety of other heart rending soul stirring tropes and figures which I cannot enumerate neither indeed need I for they were of the kind which even to the present day form the style of popular harangues and patriotic orations and may be classed in rhetoric under the general title of Rigmarole The result of this speech of the inspired burgomaster was a memorial addressed to the governor remonstrating in good round terms on his conduct It was proposed that Dofue Roerback himself should be the bearer of this memorial but this he warily declined having no inclination of coming again within kicking distance of his excellency Who did deliver it has never been named in history in which neglect he has suffered grievous wrong seeing that he was equally worthy of blazon with him perpetuated in Scottish song and story by the surname of Bell the cat All we know of the fate of this memorial is that it was used by the grim Peter to light his pipe which from the vehemence with which he smoked it was evidently anything but a pipe of peace CHAPTER X Now did the high minded Peter de Groodt shower down a pannier load of maledictions upon his burgomaster for a set of self willed obstinate factious varlets who would neither be convinced nor persuaded Nor did he omit to bestow some left handed compliments upon the sovereign people as a heard of poltroons who had no relish for the glorious hardships and illustrious misadventures of battle but would rather stay at home and eat and sleep in ignoble ease than fight in a ditch for immortality and a broken head Resolutely bent however upon defending his beloved city in despite even of itself he called unto him his trusty Van Corlear who was his right hand man in all times of emergency Him did he adjure to take his war denouncing trumpet and mounting his horse to beat up the country night and day sounding the alarm along the pastoral border of the Bronx startling the wild solitudes of Croton arousing the rugged yeomanry of Weehawk and Hoboken the mighty men of battle of Tappan Bay and the brave boys of Tarry Town Petticoat Lane and Sleepy Hollow charging them one and all to sling their powder horns shoulder their fowling pieces and march merrily down to the Manhattoes Now there was nothing in all the world the divine sex excepted that Antony Van Corlear loved better than errands of this kind So just stopping to take a lusty dinner and bracing to his side his junk bottle well charged with heart inspiring Hollands he issued jollily from the city gate which looked out upon what is at present called Broadway sounding a farewell strain that rung in sprightly echoes through the winding streets of New Amsterdam Alas never more were they to be gladdened by the melody of their favorite trumpeter It was a dark and stormy night when the good Antony arrived at the creek sagely denominated Haerlem river which separates the island of Manna hata from the mainland The wind was high the elements were in an uproar and no Charon could be found to ferry the adventurous sounder of brass across the water For a short time he vapored like an impatient ghost upon the brink and then bethinking himself of the urgency of his errand took a hearty embrace of his stone bottle swore most valorously that he would swim across in spite of the devil spyt den duyvel and daringly plunged into the stream Luckless Antony scarce had he buffeted half way over when he was observed to struggle violently as if battling with the spirit of the waters Instinctively he put his trumpet to his mouth and giving a vehement blast sank for ever to the bottom The clangor of his trumpet like that of the ivory horn of the renowned Paladin Orlando when expiring in the glorious field of Roncesvalles rang far and wide through the country alarming the neighbors round who hurried in amazement to the spot Here an old Dutch burgher famed for his veracity and who had been a witness of the fact related to them the melancholy affair with the fearful addition to which I am slow of giving belief that he saw the duyvel in the shape of a huge mossbonker seize the sturdy Antony by the leg and drag him beneath the waves Certain it is the place with the adjoining promontory which projects into the Hudson has been called Spyt den Duyvel ever since the ghost of the unfortunate Antony still haunts the surrounding solitudes and his trumpet has often been heard by the neighbors of a stormy night mingling with the howling of the blast Nobody ever attempts to swim across the creek after dark on the contrary a bridge has been built to guard against such melancholy accidents in the future and as to moss bonkers they are held in such abhorrence that no true Dutchman will admit them to his table who loves good fish and hates the devil Such was the end of Antony Van Corlear a man deserving of a better fate He lived roundly and soundly like a true and jolly bachelor until the day of his death but though he was never married yet did he leave behind some two or three dozen children in different parts of the country fine chubby brawling flatulent little urchins from whom if legends speak true and they are not apt to lie did descend the innumerable race of editors who people and defend this country and who are bountifully paid by the people for keeping up a constant alarm and making them miserable It is hinted too that in his various expeditions into the east he did much towards promoting the population of the country in proof of which is adduced the notorious propensity of the people of those parts to sound their own trumpet As some way worn pilgrim when the tempest whistles through his locks and night is gathering round beholds his faithful dog the companion and solace of his journeying stretched lifeless at his feet so did the generous hearted hero of the Manhattoes contemplate the untimely end of Antony Van Corlear He had been the faithful attendant of his footsteps he had charmed him in many a weary hour by his honest gayety and the martial melody of his trumpet and had followed him with unflinching loyalty and affection through many a scene of direful peril and mishap He was gone for ever and that too at a moment when every mongrel cur was skulking from his side This Peter Stuyvesant was the moment to try thy fortitude and this was the moment when thou didst indeed shine forth Peter the Headstrong The glare of day had long dispelled the horrors of the stormy night still all was dull and gloomy The late jovial Apollo hid his face behind lugubrious clouds peeping out now and then for an instant as if anxious yet fearful to see what was going on in his favorite city This was the eventful morning when the Great Peter was to give his reply to the summons of the invaders Already was he closeted with his privy council sitting in grim state brooding over the fate of his favorite trumpeter and anon boiling with indignation as the insolence of his recreant burgomasters flashed upon his mind While in this state of irritation a courier arrived in all haste from Winthrop the subtle governor of Connecticut counseling him in the most affectionate and disinterested manner to surrender the province and magnifying the dangers and calamities to which a refusal would subject him What a moment was this to intrude officious advice upon a man who never took advice in his whole life The fiery old governor strode up and down the chamber with a vehemence that made the bosoms of his councillors to quake with awe railing at his unlucky fate that thus made him the constant butt of factious subjects and jesuitical advisers Just at this ill chosen juncture the officious burgomasters who had heard of the arrival of mysterious despatches came marching in a body into the room with a legion of schepens and toad eaters at their heels and abruptly demanded a perusal of the letter This was too much for the spleen of Peter Stuyvesant He tore the letter in a thousand pieces threw it in the face of the nearest burgomaster broke his pipe over the head of the next hurled his spitting box at an unlucky schepen who was just retreating out at the door and finally prorogued the whole meeting sine die by kicking them downstairs with his wooden leg As soon as the burgomasters could recover from their confusion and had time to breathe they called a public meeting where they related at full length and with appropriate coloring and exaggeration the despotic and vindictive deportment of the governor declaring that for their own parts they did not value a straw the being kicked cuffed and mauled by the timber toe of his excellency but that they felt for the dignity of the sovereign people thus rudely insulted by the outrage committed on the seat of honor of their representatives The latter part of the harangue came home at once to that delicacy of feeling and jealous pride of character vested in all true mobs who though they may bear injuries without a murmur yet are marvelously jealous of their sovereign dignity and there is no knowing to what act of resentment they might have been provoked had they not been somewhat more afright of their sturdy old governor than they were of saint Nicholas the English or the d l himself CHAPTER XI There is something exceedingly sublime and melancholy in the spectacle which the present crisis of our history presents An illustrious and venerable little city the metropolis of a vast extent of uninhabited country garrisoned by a doughty host of orators chairmen committee men burgomasters schepens and old women governed by a determined and strong headed warrior and fortified by mud batteries palisadoes and resolutions blockaded by sea beleaguered by land and threatened with direful desolation from without while its very vitals are torn with internal faction and commotion Never did historic pen record a page of more complicated distress unless it be the strife that distracted the Israelites during the siege of Jerusalem where discordant parties were cutting each other s throats at the moment when the victorious legions of Titus had toppled down their bulwarks and were carrying fire and sword into the very sanctum sanctorum of the temple Governor Stuyvesant having triumphantly put his grand council to the rout and delivered himself from a multitude of impertinent advisers despatched a categorical reply to the commanders of the invading squadron wherein he asserted the right and title of their High Mightinesses the Lords States General to the province of New Netherlands and trusting in the righteousness of his cause set the whole British nation at defiance My anxiety to extricate my readers and myself from these disastrous scenes prevents me from giving the whole of this gallant letter which concluded in these manly and affectionate terms As touching the threats in your conclusion we have nothing to answer only that we fear nothing but what God who is as just as merciful shall lay upon us all things being in His gracious disposal and we may as well be preserved by Him with small forces as by a great army which makes us to wish you all happiness and prosperity and recommend you to His protection My lords your thrice humble and affectionate servant and friend P STUYVESANT Thus having thrown his gauntlet the brave Peter stuck a pair of horse pistols in his belt girded an immense powder horn on his side thrust his sound leg into a Hessian boot and clapping his fierce little war hat on the top of his head paraded up and down in front of his house determined to defend his beloved city to the last While all these struggles and dissentions were prevailing in the unhappy city of New Amsterdam and while its worthy but ill starred governor was framing the above quoted letter the English commanders did not remain idle They had agents secretly employed to foment the fears and clamors of the populace and moreover circulated far and wide through the adjacent country a proclamation repeating the terms they had already held out in their summons to surrender at the same time beguiling the simple Nederlanders with the most crafty and conciliating professions They promised that every man who voluntarily submitted to the authority of his British Majesty should retain peaceful possession of his house his vrouw and his cabbage garden That he should be suffered to smoke his pipe speak Dutch wear as many beeches as he pleased and import bricks tiles and stone jugs from Holland instead of manufacturing them on the spot That he should on no account be compelled to learn the English language nor eat codfish on Saturdays nor keep accounts in any other way than by casting them up on his fingers and chalking them down upon the crown of his hat as is observed among the Dutch yeomanry at the present day That every man should be allowed quietly to inherit his father s hat coat shoe buckles pipe and every other personal appendage and that no man should be obliged to conform to any improvements inventions or any other modern innovations but on the contrary should be permitted to build his house follow his trade manage his farm rear his hogs and educate his children precisely as his ancestors had done before him from time immemorial Finally that he should have all the benefits of free trade and should not be required to acknowledge any other saint in the calendar than saint Nicholas who should thenceforward as before be considered the tutelar saint of the city These terms as may be supposed appeared very satisfactory to the people who had a great disposition to enjoy their property unmolested and a most singular aversion to engage in a contest where they could gain little more than honor and broken heads the first of which they held in philosophic indifference the latter in utter detestation By these insidious means therefore did the English succeed in alienating the confidence and affections of the populace from their gallant old governor whom they considered as obstinately bent upon running them into hideous misadventures and did not hesitate to speak their minds freely and abuse him most heartily behind his back Like as a mighty grampus when assailed and buffeted by roaring waves and brawling surges still keeps on an undeviating course rising above the boisterous billows spouting and blowing as he emerges so did the inflexible Peter pursue unwavering his determined career and rise contemptuous above the clamors of the rabble But when the British warriors found that he set their power at defiance they despatched recruiting officers to Jamaica and Jericho and Nineveh and Quag and Patchog and all those towns on Long Island which had been subdued of yore by Stoffel Brinkerhoff stirring up the progeny of Preserved Fish and Determined Cock and those other New England squatters to assail the city of New Amsterdam by land while the hostile ships prepared for an assault by water The streets of New Amsterdam now presented a scene of wild dismay and consternation In vain did Peter Stuyvesant order the citizens to arm and assemble on the Battery Blank terror reigned over the community The whole party of Short Pipes in the course of a single night had changed into arrant old women a metamorphosis only to be paralleled by the prodigies recorded by Livy as having happened at Rome at the approach of Hannibal when statues sweated in pure affright goats were converted into sheep and cocks turning into hens ran cackling about the street Thus baffled in all attempts to put the city in a state of defence blockaded from without tormented from within and menaced with a Yankee invasion even the stiff necked will of Peter Stuyvesant for once gave way and in spite of his mighty heart which swelled in his throat until it nearly choked him he consented to a treaty of surrender Words cannot express the transports of the populace on receiving this intelligence had they obtained a conquest over their enemies they could not have indulged greater delight The streets resounded with their congratulations they extolled their governor as the father and deliverer of his country they crowded to his house to testify their gratitude and were ten times more noisy in their plaudits than when he returned with victory perched upon his beaver from the glorious capture of Fort Christina But the indignant Peter shut his doors and windows and took refuge in the innermost recesses of his mansion that he might not hear the ignoble rejoicings of the rabble Commissioners were now appointed on both sides and a capitulation was speedily arranged all that was wanting to ratify it was that it should be signed by the governor When the commissioners waited upon him for this purpose they were received with grim and bitter courtesy His warlike accoutrements were laid aside an old Indian night gown was wrapped about his rugged limbs a red nightcap overshadowed his frowning brow an iron grey beard of three days growth gave additional grimness to his visage Thrice did he seize a worn out stump of a pen and essay to sign the loathsome paper thrice did he clinch his teeth and make a horrible countenance as though a dose of rhubarb senna and ipecacuanha had been offered to his lips At length dashing it from him he seized his brass hilted sword and jerking it from the scabbard swore by saint Nicholas to sooner die than yield to any power under heaven For two whole days did he persist in this magnanimous resolution during which his house was besieged by the rabble and menaces and clamorous revilings exhausted to no purpose And now another course was adopted to soothe if possible his mighty ire A procession was formed by the burgomasters and schepens followed by the populace to bear the capitulation in state to the governor s dwelling They found the castle strongly barricaded and the old hero in full regimentals with his cocked hat on his head posted with a blunderbuss at the garret window There was something in this formidable position that struck even the ignoble vulgar with awe and admiration The brawling multitude could not but reflect with self abasement upon their own pusillanimous conduct when they beheld their hardy but deserted old governor thus faithful to his post like a forlorn hope and fully prepared to defend his ungrateful city to the last These compunctions however were soon overwhelmed by the recurring tide of public apprehension The populace arranged themselves before the house taking off their hats with most respectful humility Burgomaster Roerback who was of that popular class of orators described by Sallust as being talkative rather than eloquent stepped forth and addressed the governor in a speech of three hours length detailing in the most pathetic terms the calamitous situation of the province and urging him in a constant repetition of the same arguments and words to sign the capitulation The mighty Peter eyed him from his garret window in grim silence Now and then his eye would glance over the surrounding rabble and an indignant grin like that of an angry mastiff would mark his iron visage But though a man of most undaunted mettle though he had a heart as big as an ox and a head that would have set adamant to scorn yet after all he was a mere mortal Wearied out by these repeated oppositions and this eternal haranguing and perceiving that unless he complied the inhabitants would follow their own inclination or rather their fears without waiting for his consent or what was still worse the Yankees would have time to pour in their forces and claim a share in the conquest he testily ordered them to hand up the paper It was accordingly hoisted to him on the end of a pole and having scrawled his hand at the bottom of it he anathematised them all for a set of cowardly mutinous degenerate poltroons threw the capitulation at their heads slammed down the window and was heard stumping downstairs with vehement indignation The rabble incontinently took to their heels even the burgomasters were not slow in evacuating the premises fearing lest the sturdy Peter might issue from his den and greet them with some unwelcome testimonial of his displeasure Within three hours after the surrender a legion of British beef fed warriors poured into New Amsterdam taking possession of the fort and batteries And now might be heard from all quarters the sound of hammers made by the old Dutch burghers in nailing up their doors and windows to protect their vrouws from these fierce barbarians whom they contemplated in silent sullenness from the garret windows as they paraded through the streets Thus did Colonel Richard Nichols the commander of the British forces enter into quiet possession of the conquered realm as locum tenens for the Duke of York The victory was attended with no other outrage than that of changing the name of the province and its metropolis which thenceforth were denominated New York and so have continued to be called unto the present day The inhabitants according to treaty were allowed to maintain quiet possession of their property but so inveterately did they retain their abhorrence of the British nation that in a private meeting of the leading citizens it was unanimously determined never to ask any of their conquerors to dinner NOTE Modern historians assert that when the New Netherlands were thus overrun by the British as Spain in ancient days by the Saracens a resolute band refused to bend the neck to the invader Led by one Garret Van Horne a valorous and gigantic Dutchman they crossed the bay and buried themselves among the marshes and cabbage gardens of Communipaw as did Pelayo and his followers among the mountains of Asturias Here their descendants have remained ever since keeping themselves apart like seed corn to repeople the city with the genuine breed whenever it shall be effectually recovered from its intruders It is said the genuine descendants of the Nederlanders who inhabit New York still look with longing eyes to the green marshes of ancient Pavonia as did the conquered Spaniards of yore to the stern mountains of Asturias considering these the regions whence deliverance is to come CHAPTER XII Thus then have I concluded this great historical enterprise but before I lay aside my weary pen there yet remains to be performed one pious duty If among the variety of readers who may peruse this book there should haply be found any of those souls of true nobility which glow with celestial fire at the history of the generous and the brave they will doubtless be anxious to know the fate of the gallant Peter Stuyvesant To gratify one such sterling heart of gold I would go more lengths than to instruct the cold blooded curiosity of a whole fraternity of philosophers No sooner had that high mettled cavalier signed the articles of capitulation than determined not to witness the humiliation of his favorite city he turned his back on its walls and made a growling retreat to his bowery or country seat which was situated about two miles off where he passed the remainder of his days in patriarchal retirement There he enjoyed that tranquillity of mind which he had never known amid the distracting cares of government and tasted the sweets of absolute and uncontrolled authority which his factious subjects had so often dashed with the bitterness of opposition No persuasion should ever induce him to revisit the city on the contrary he would always have his great arm chair placed with its back to the windows which looked in that direction until a thick grove of trees planted by his own hand grew up and formed a screen that effectually excluded it from the prospect He railed continually at the degenerate innovations and improvements introduced by the conquerors forbade a word of their detested language to be spoken in his family a prohibition readily obeyed since none of the household could speak anything but Dutch and even ordered a fine avenue to be cut down in front of his house because it consisted of English cherry trees The same incessant vigilance which blazed forth when he had a vast province under his care now showed itself with equal vigor though in narrower limits He patroled with unceasing watchfulness the boundaries of his little territory repelled every encroachment with intrepid promptness punished every vagrant depredation upon his orchard or his farmyard with inflexible severity and conducted every stray hog or cow in triumph to the pound But to the indigent neighbor the friendless stranger or the weary wanderer his spacious doors were ever open and his capacious fireplace that emblem of his own warm and generous heart had always a corner to receive and cherish them There was an exception to this I must confess in case the ill starred applicant were an Englishman or a Yankee to whom though he might extend the hand of assistance he could never be brought to yield the rites of hospitality Nay if peradventure some straggling merchant of the East should stop at his door with his cart load of tinware or wooden bowls the fiery Peter would issue forth like a giant from his castle and make such a furious clattering among his pots and kettles that the vender of notions was fain to betake himself to instant flight His suit of regimentals worn threadbare by the brush was carefully hung up in the state bedchamber and regularly aired the first fair day of every month and his cocked hat and trusty sword were suspended in grim repose over the parlor mantelpiece forming supporters to a full length portrait of the renowned admiral Van Tromp In his domestic empire he maintained strict discipline and a well organized despotic government but though his own will was the supreme law yet the good of his subjects was his constant object He watched over not merely their immediate comforts but their morals and their ultimate welfare for he gave them abundance of excellent admonition nor could any of them complain that when occasion required he was by any means niggardly in bestowing wholesome correction The good old Dutch festivals those periodical demonstrations of an overflowing heart and a thankful spirit which are falling into sad disuse among my fellow citizens were faithfully observed in the mansion of Governor Stuyvesant New year was truly a day of open handed liberality of jocund revelry and warm hearted congratulation when the bosom swelled with genial good fellowship and the plenteous table was attended with an unceremonious freedom and honest broad mouthed merriment unknown in these days of degeneracy and refinement Paas and Pinxter were scrupulously observed throughout his dominions nor was the day of saint Nicholas suffered to pass by without making presents hanging the stocking in the chimney and complying with all its other ceremonies Once a year on the first day of April he used to array himself in full regimentals being the anniversary of his triumphal entry into New Amsterdam after the conquest of New Sweden This was always a kind of saturnalia among the domestics when they considered themselves at liberty in some measure to say and do what they pleased for on this day their master was always observed to unbend and become exceedingly pleasant and jocose sending the old gray headed negroes on April fool s errands for pigeons milk not one of whom but allowed himself to be taken in and humored his old master s jokes as became a faithful and well disciplined dependent Thus did he reign happily and peacefully on his own land injuring no man envying no man molested by no outward strifes perplexed by no internal commotions and the mighty monarchs of the earth who were vainly seeking to maintain peace and promote the welfare of mankind by war and desolation would have done well to have made a voyage to the little island of Manna hata and learned a lesson in government from the domestic economy of Peter Stuyvesant In process of time however the old governor like all other children of mortality began to exhibit evident tokens of decay Like an aged oak which though it long has braved the fury of the elements and still retains its gigantic proportions begins to shake and groan with every blast so was it with the gallant Peter for though he still bore the port and semblance of what he was in the days of his hardihood and chivalry yet did age and infirmity begin to sap the vigor of his frame but his heart that unconquerable citadel still triumphed unsubdued With matchless avidity would he listen to every article of intelligence concerning the battles between the English and Dutch still would his pulse beat high whenever he heard of the victories of De Ruyter and his countenance lower and his eyebrows knit when fortune turned in favor of the English At length as on a certain day he had just smoke his fifth pipe and was napping after dinner in his arm chair conquering the whole British nation in his dreams he was suddenly aroused by a ringing of bells rattling of drums and roaring of cannon that put all his blood in a ferment But when he learnt that these rejoicings were in honor of a great victory obtained by the combined English and French fleets over the brave De Ruyter and the younger Van Tromp it went so much to his heart that he took to his bed and in less than three days was brought to death s door by a violent cholera morbus Even in this extremity he still displayed the unconquerable sprit of Peter the Headstrong holding out to the last gasp with inflexible obstinacy against a whole army of old women who were bent upon driving the enemy out of his bowels in the true Dutch mode of defense by inundation While he thus lay lingering on the verge of dissolution news was brought him that the brave De Ruyter had made good his retreat with little loss and meant once more to meet the enemy in battle The closing eye of the old warrior kindled with martial fire at the words He partly raised himself in bed clinched his withered hand as if he felt within his gripe that sword which waved in triumph before the walls of Port Christina and giving a grim smile of exultation sank back upon his pillow and expired Thus died Peter Stuyvesant a valiant soldier a loyal subject an upright governor and an honest Dutchman who wanted only a few empires to desolate to have been immortalized as a hero His funeral obsequies were celebrated with the utmost grandeur and solemnity The town was perfectly emptied of its inhabitants who crowded in throngs to pay the last sad honors to their good old governor All his sterling qualities rushed in full tide upon their recollection while the memory of his foibles and his faults had expired with him The ancient burghers contended who should have the privilege of bearing the pall the populace strove who should walk nearest to the bier and the melancholy procession was closed by a number of gray bearded negroes who had wintered and summered in the household of their departed master for the greater part of a century With sad and gloomy countenances the multitude gathered round the grave They dwelt with mournful hearts on the sturdy virtues the signal services and the gallant exploits of the brave old worthy They recalled with secret upbraiding their own factious oppositions to his government and many an ancient burgher whose phlegmatic features had never been known to relax nor his eyes to moisten was now observed to puff a pensive pipe and the big drop to steal down his cheek while he muttered with affectionate accent and melancholy shake of the head Well den Hardkoppig Peter ben gone at last His remains were deposited in the family vault under a chapel which he had piously erected on his estate and dedicated to saint Nicholas and which stood on the identical spot at present occupied by saint Mark s church where his tombstone is still to be seen His estate or bowery as it was called has ever continued in the possession of his descendants who by the uniform integrity of their conduct and their strict adherence to the customs and manners that prevailed in the good old times have proved themselves worthy of their illustrious ancestor Many a time and oft has the farm been haunted at night by enterprising money diggers in quest of pots of gold said to have been buried by the old governor though I cannot learn that any of them have ever been enriched by their researches and who is there among my native born fellow citizens that does not remember when in the mischievous days of his boyhood he conceived it a great exploit to rob Stuyvesant s orchard on a holiday afternoon At this stronghold of the family may still be seen certain memorials of the immortal Peter His full length portrait frowns in martial terrors from the parlor wall his cocked hat and sword still hang up in the best bed room his brimstone colored breeches were for a long while suspended in the hall until some years since they occasioned a dispute between a new married couple and his silver mounted wooden leg is still treasured up in the store room as an invaluable relique CHAPTER XIII Among the numerous events which are each in their turn the most direful and melancholy of all possible occurrences in your interesting and authentic history there is none that occasions such deep and heart rending grief as the decline and fall of your renowned and mighty empires Where is the reader who can contemplate without emotion the disastrous events by which the great dynasties of the world have been extinguished While wandering in imagination among the gigantic ruins of states and empires and marking the tremendous convulsions that wrought their overthrow the bosom of the melancholy inquirer swells with sympathy commensurate to the surrounding desolation Kingdoms principalities and powers have each had their rise their progress and their downfall each in its turn has swayed a potent sceptre each has returned to its primeval nothingness And thus did it fare with the empire of their High Mightinesses at the Manhattoes under the peaceful reign of Walter the Doubter the fretful reign of William the Testy and the chivalric reign of Peter the Headstrong Its history is fruitful of instruction and worthy of being pondered over attentively for it is by thus raking among the ashes of departed greatness that the sparks of true knowledge are to be found and the lamp of wisdom illuminated Let then the reign of Walter the Doubter warn against yielding to that sleek contented security and that overweening fondness for comfort and repose which are produced by a state of prosperity and peace These tend to unnerve a nation to destroy its pride of character to render it patient of insult deaf to the calls of honor and of justice and cause it to cling to peace like the sluggard to his pillow at the expense of every valuable duty and consideration Such supineness ensures the very evil from which it shrinks One right yielded up produces the usurpation of a second one encroachment passively suffered makes way for another and the nation which thus through a doting love of peace has sacrificed honor and interest will at length have to fight for existence Let the disastrous reign of William the Testy serve as a salutary warning against that fitful feverish mode of legislation which acts without system depends on shifts and projects and trusts to lucky contingencies which hesitates and wavers and at length decides with the rashness of ignorance and imbecility which stoops for popularity by courting the prejudices and flattering the arrogance rather than commanding the respect of the rabble which seeks safety in a multitude of counsellors and distracts itself by a variety of contradictory schemes and opinions which mistakes procrastination for weariness hurry for decision parsimony for economy bustle for business and vaporing for valor which is violent in council sanguine in expectation precipitate in action and feeble in execution which undertakes enterprises without forethought enters upon them without preparation conducts them without energy and ends them in confusion and defeat Let the reign of the good Stuyvesant show the effects of vigor and decision even when destitute of cool judgment and surrounded by perplexities Let it show how frankness probity and high souled courage will command respect and secure honor even where success is unattainable But at the same time let it caution against a too ready reliance on the good faith of others and a too honest confidence in the loving professions of powerful neighbors who are most friendly when they most mean to betray Let it teach a judicious attention to the opinions and wishes of the many who in times of peril must be soothed and led or apprehension will overpower the deference to authority Let the empty wordiness of his factious subjects their intemperate harangues their violent resolutions their hectorings against an absent enemy and their pusillanimity on his approach teach us to distrust and despise those clamorous patriots whose courage dwells but in the tongue Let them serve as a lesson to repress that insolence of speech destitute of real force which too often breaks forth in popular bodies and bespeaks the vanity rather than the spirit of a nation Let them caution us against vaunting too much of our own power and prowess and reviling a noble enemy True gallantry of soul would always lead us to treat a foe with courtesy and proud punctilio a contrary conduct but takes from the merit of victory and renders defeat doubly disgraceful But I cease to dwell on the stores of excellent examples to be drawn from the ancient chronicles of the Manhattoes He who reads attentively will discover the threads of gold which run throughout the web of history and are invisible to the dull eye of ignorance But before I conclude let me point out a solemn warning furnished in the subtle chain of events by which the capture of Fort Casimir has produced the present convulsions of our globe Attend then gentle reader to this plain deduction which if thou art a king an emperor or other powerful potentate I advise thee to treasure up in thy heart though little expectation have I that my work will fall into such hands for well I know the care of crafty ministers to keep all grave and edifying books of the kind out of the way of unhappy monarchs lest peradventure they should read them and learn wisdom By the treacherous surprisal of Fort Casimir then did the crafty Swedes enjoy a transient triumph but drew upon their heads the vengeance of Peter Stuyvesant who wrested all New Sweden from their hands By the conquest of New Sweden Peter Stuyvesant aroused the claims of Lord Baltimore who appealed to the Cabinet of Great Britain who subdued the whole province of New Netherlands By this great achievement the whole extent of North America from Nova Scotia to the Floridas was rendered one entire dependency upon the British crown But mark the consequence the hitherto scattered colonies being thus consolidated and having no rival colonies to check or keep them in awe waxed great and powerful and finally becoming too strong for the mother country were enabled to shake off its bonds and by a glorious revolution became an independent empire But the chain of effects stopped not here the successful revolution in America produced the sanguinary revolution in France which produced the puissant Bonaparte who produced the French despotism which has thrown the whole world in confusion Thus have these great Powers been successively punished for their ill starred conquests and thus as I asserted have all the present convulsions revolutions and disasters that overwhelm mankind originated in the capture of the little Fort Casimir as recorded in this eventful history And now worthy reader ere I take a sad farewell which alas must be for ever willingly would I part in cordial fellowship and bespeak thy kind hearted remembrance That I have not written a better history of the days of the patriarchs is not my fault had any other person written one as good I should not have attempted it at all That many will hereafter spring up and surpass me in excellence I have very little doubt and still less care well knowing that when the great Christovallo Colon who is vulgarly called Columbus had once stood his egg upon its end every one at table could stand his up a thousand times more dexterously Should any reader find matter of offence in this history I should heartily grieve though I would on no account question his penetration by telling him he was mistaken his good nature by telling him he was captious or his pure conscience by telling him he was startled at a shadow Surely when so ingenious in finding offence where none was intended it were a thousand pities he should not be suffered to enjoy the benefit of his discovery I have too high an opinion of the understanding of my fellow citizens to think of yielding them instruction and I covet too much their good will to forfeit it by giving them good advice I am none of those cynics who despise the world because it despises them on the contrary though but low in its regard I look up to it with the most perfect good nature and my only sorrow is that it does not prove itself more worthy of the unbounded love I bear it If however in this my historic production the scanty fruit of a long and laborious life I have failed to gratify the dainty palate of the age I can only lament my misfortune for it is too late in the season for me even to hope to repair it Already has withering age showered his sterile snows upon my brow in a little while and this genial warmth which still lingers around my heart and throbs worthy reader throbs kindly toward thyself will be chilled for ever Haply this frail compound of dust which while alive may have given birth to naught but unprofitable weeds may form a humble sod of the valley whence may spring many a sweet wild flower to adorn my beloved island of Mannahata THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Knickerbocker s
