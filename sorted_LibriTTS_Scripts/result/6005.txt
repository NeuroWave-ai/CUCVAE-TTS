of Spring Days A Mummer s Wife et cetera With Introduction By TEMPLE SCOTT NEW YORK nineteen fifteen COPYRIGHT eighteen ninety five BY MACMILLAN AND company COPYRIGHT nineteen fifteen BY BRENTANO S INTRODUCTION Looking back over the twenty years since Celibates was first published I find that the George Moore of the earlier year is the George Moore of to day The novelist of eighteen ninety five and the novelist of nineteen fifteen are one and the same person Each is really interested in himself each is more concerned with how the world and its humanity appear to him than how they appear to the casual observer or how they may be in themselves The writer is always expressing himself through the facts and personalities which have stirred his imagination to creative effort George Moore has never been a reporter or a philosopher he has always been an artist Now to say that the author of Celibates is always expressing himself does not at all mean that he is recording merely his private sensations emotions and moods Egoist as he is George Moore could not write his autobiography He tried to do this lately in Ave Vale and Salve and failed failed captivatingly He is always most himself when he is dealing with what is not himself with skies and hills and ocean and gardens and men and women Moore is a naturalist in the finest sense of that word He deals with nature as the artist must deal with it if nature is to be understood and enjoyed For Moore s relationship with nature and especially with human nature is of that rare kind which is the experience of the very few of those fine spirits endowed with the highest sympathy a sympathy which is not a feeling with or for others but an actual union with others a union which brings suffering as well as enjoyment This is the artist s burden of sorrow and it is also his privilege It is because of it that every true work of art has in it also something of a religious influence a binding power which unites the separated onlookers in an experience of a common emotion If the artist have not this peculiar sympathy he can have no vision and will never be a creator he will never show us or tell us the new and strange mysteries of life which nature is continually unfolding The artist s mission is to reveal to us the visions he alone has been vouchsafed to see and to reveal them so that the revelation is a creation The men and women he is introducing to us must be as real and as living to us as they are to him That is what George Moore has done in Celibates and that is why I say he is an artist Celibates consists of three stories two of women and one of a man Mildred Lawson and John Norton are celibates by nature Agnes Lahens is a celibate from environment and circumstance Each of the three is utterly different from the other and yet all are alike in that they are the products of a modern civilization Mildred and John are without that compulsive force which is known as the sexual passion If they have it at all it has been diluted by tradition and so called culture into a mere sensation Agnes s passion is an arrested one so that what there is of it is easily diverted into an expression of religious aspiration Mildred Lawson would be called a born flirt She is pretty charming and talented but she is cold unresponsive selfish and futile She is also eminently respectable after the English middle class manner She has ambition but she lacks the will power to school herself and the determination to accomplish She is rich in goods but very poor in goodness She is often moved profoundly by beautiful thoughts and uplifting emotions of which she herself is the pleasing pulsating centre but her soul is negative so that her spiritual states evaporate when the opportunity is given her for transforming them into acts She never gets anywhere She is self conscious to a degree and unstable as water After breaking one man s heart and deadening the hearts of three other men she finally accepts an old and rejected sweetheart only to be torn by suspicions that he no longer cares for her and is marrying her only for her money We leave her a prey to thoughts of a life which unconsciously she has brought on herself John Norton might be called the born monk He is however but the male embodiment of that cultured selfishness of which Mildred Lawson is the female expression He is not a flirt He takes life too seriously to be that but he takes it so seriously that there is only room in the world for himself alone He comes of a fine old English stock is rich and is his own master He treats his mother as a cold blooded English gentleman with Norton s peculiar nature would treat a mother with polite but firm disregard of her claims He has enough and to spare of will power but it is become degenerated into obstinacy He fails because he wants too much because he is unsocial at heart and does not understand that life means giving as well as taking His sexual passion finds expression in a religious fanaticism which is but the expression of utter selfishness as all sexual passion is In the company of Kitty he has moments of exaltation when his degenerate passion scents the pure air of love but he can never let himself go When on one occasion he so far forgets himself as to allow his heart to be responsive to Kitty s natural purity and he kisses her he is so shocked at what he has done that he runs away and leaves the girl to a terrible fate We leave him also a prey to thoughts

none	none	he might have prevented He too like Mildred Lawson must henceforth face a life of his own unconscious making Agnes Lahens is the victim of a heartless selfish society in which the abuse of love has made its world a desert and its products Dead Sea fruit Out of a sheer impulse for self protection she flies to the nunnery which is ready to give her life at the price of her womanhood and her self sacrifice As portraits these of Mildred Lawson and John Norton are exquisitely finished They are half lengths with a quality of coloring fascinating in its repelling truth Every tint and shade have been cunningly and caressingly laid in so that the features living and animated are yet filled with suggestions of the spiritual barrenness in the originals Very human they are and yet they are without those gracious qualities which link humanity with what we feel to be divine There is the touch of nature here but it is not the touch which makes the whole world kin That touch we ourselves supply and it speaks eloquently for Moore s art that in picturing these unlovely beings he throws us back on our better selves Beyond the vision of these celibates here revealed we see a passionate humanity working hating sorrowing and dying yet always loving and in loving finding its fullest life in an earthly salvation True love is a mighty democrat Knowing these Celibates we welcome the more gladly those who even if less gifted are ready to walk with us hand in hand along the common human highway of the pilgrim s progress TEMPLE SCOTT CONTENTS MILDRED LAWSON JOHN NORTON AGNES LAHENS MILDRED LAWSON I The tall double stocks were breathing heavily in the dark garden the delicate sweetness of the syringa moved as if on tip toe towards the windows but it was the aching smell of lilies that kept Mildred awake As she tossed to and fro the recollections of the day turned and turned in her brain ticking loudly and she could see each event as distinctly as the figures on the dial of a great clock What a strange woman that missus Fargus her spectacles her short hair and that dreadful cap which she wore at the tennis party It was impossible not to feel sorry for her she did look so ridiculous I wonder her husband allows her to make such a guy of herself What a curious little man his great cough and that foolish shouting manner a good natured empty headed little fellow They are a funny couple Harold knew her husband at Oxford they were at the same college She took honours at Oxford that s why she seemed out of place in a little town like Sutton She is quite different from her husband he couldn t pass his examinations he had been obliged to leave What made them marry I don t know anything about Comte I wish I did it is so dreadful to be ignorant I never felt my ignorance before but that little woman does make me feel it not that she intrudes her learning on any one I wish she did for I want to learn I wish I could remember what she told me that all knowledge passes through three states the theological the the metaphysical and the scientific We are religious when we are children metaphysical when we are one and twenty and as we get old we grow scientific And I must not forget this that what is true for the individual is true for the race In the earliest ages man was religious I wonder what our vicar would say if he heard this In the Middle Ages man was metaphysical and in these latter days he is growing scientific The other day when I came into the drawing room she didn t say a word I waited and waited to see if she would speak no not a word She sat reading Occasionally she would look up stare at the ceiling and then take a note I wonder what she put down on that slip of paper But when I spoke she seemed glad to talk and she told me about Oxford It evidently was the pleasantest time of her life It must have been very curious There were a hundred girls and they used to run in and out of each other s rooms and they had dances they danced with each other and never thought about men She told me she never enjoyed any dances so much as those and they had a gymnasium and special clothes to wear there a sort of bloomer costume It must have been very jolly I wish I had gone to Oxford Girls dancing together and never thinking about men How nice At Oxford they say that marriage is not the only mission for women that is to say for some women They don t despise marriage but they think that for some women there is another mission When I spoke to missus Fargus about her marriage she had to admit that she had written to her college friends to apologise no not to apologise she said but to explain She was not ashamed but she thought she owed them an explanation Just fancy any of the girls in Sutton being ashamed of being married The darkness was thick with wandering scents and Mildred s thoughts withered in the heat She closed her eyes she lay quite still but the fever of the night devoured her the sheet burned like a flame she opened her eyes and was soon thinking as eagerly as before She thought of the various possibilities that marriage would shut out to her for ever She reproached herself for having engaged herself to Alfred Stanby and remembered that Harold had been opposed to the match and had refused to give his consent until Alfred was in a position to settle five hundred a year upon her Alfred would expect her to keep house for him exactly as she was now keeping house for her brother Year after year the same thing seeing Alfred go away in the morning seeing him come home in the evening That was how her life would pass She did not wish to be cruel she knew that Alfred would suffer terribly if she broke off her engagement but it would be still more cruel to marry him if she did not think she would make him happy and the conviction that she would not make him happy pressed heavily upon her What was she to do She could not she dared not face the life he offered her It would be selfish of her to do so The word selfish suggested a new train of thought to Mildred She argued that it was not for selfish motives that she desired freedom If she thought that she would marry him to morrow It was because she did not wish to lead a selfish life that she intended to break off her engagement She wished to live for something she wished to accomplish something what could she do There was art She would like to be an artist She paused astonished at the possibility But why not she as well as the other women whom she had met at missus Fargus She had met many artists ladies who had studios at missus Fargus She had been to their studios and had admired their independence They had spoken of study in Paris and of a village near Paris where they went to paint landscape Each had a room at the inn they met at meal times and spent the day in the woods and fields Mildred had once been fond of drawing and in the heat of the summer night she wondered if she could do anything worth doing She knew that she would like to try She would do anything sooner than settle down with Alfred Marriage and children were not the only possibilities in woman s life The girls she knew thought so but the girls missus Fargus knew didn t think so And rolling over in her hot bed she lamented that there was no escape for a girl from marriage If so why not Alfred Stanby he as well as another But no she could not settle down to keep house for Alfred for the rest of her life She asked herself again why she should marry at all what it was that compelled all girls rich or poor it was all the same to marry and keep house for their husbands She remembered that she had five hundred a year and that she would have four thousand a year if her brother died the distillery was worth that But money made no difference There was something in life which forced all girls into marriage with their will or against their will Marriage marriage always marriage always the eternal question of sex as if there was nothing else in the world But there was much else in life There was a nobler purpose in life than keeping house for a man Of that she felt quite sure and she hoped that she would find a vocation She must first educate herself so far she knew and that was all that was at present necessary for her to know But how hot it is I shan t be able to go out in the cart to morrow I wish everything would change especially the weather I want to go away I hate living in a house without another woman I wish Harold would let me have a companion a nice elderly lady but not too elderly a woman about forty who could talk some one like missus Fargus When mother was alive it was different She has been dead now three years How long it seems Poor mother I wish she were here I scarcely knew much of
6497_234106_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 father 
none	none	he went to the city every morning just as Harold does by that dreadful ten minutes past nine It seems to me that I have never heard of anything all my life but that horrible ten minutes past nine and the half past six from London Bridge I don t hear so much about the half past six but the ten minutes past nine is never out of my head Father is dead seven years mother is dead three and since her death I have kept house for Harold Then as sleep pressed upon her eyelids Mildred s thoughts grew disjointed Alfred I have thought it all over I cannot marry you Do not reproach me she said between dreaming and waking and as the purple space of sky between the trees grew paler she heard the first birds Then dream and reality grew undistinguishable and listening to the carolling of a thrush she saw a melancholy face and then a dejected figure pass into the twilight II What a fright I am looking I did not get to sleep till after two o clock the heat was something dreadful and to day will be hotter still One doesn t know what to wear She settled the ribbons in her white dress and looked once again in the glass to see if the soft almost fluffy hair which the least breath disturbed was disarranged She smoothed it with her short white hand There was a wistful expression in her brown eyes a little pathetic won t you care for me expression which she cultivated knowing its charm in her somewhat short rather broad face which ended in a pointed chin the nose was slightly tip tilted her teeth were white but too large Her figure was delicate and with quick steps she hurried along the passages and down the high staircase Harold was standing before the fireplace reading the Times when she entered You are rather late Mildred I am afraid I shall lose the ten minutes past nine My dear Harold you have gone up to town for the last ten years by that train and every day we go through a little scene of fears and doubts you have never yet missed it I may safely assume you will not miss it this morning I m afraid I shall have to order the cart and I like to get a walk if possible in the morning I can walk it in twelve minutes I shouldn t like to walk it in this broiling sun in fifteen By the way have you looked at the glass this morning No I am tired of looking at it It never moves from set fair It is intolerably hot can you sleep at night No I didn t get to sleep till after two I lay awake thinking of missus Fargus I never saw you talk to a woman like that before I wonder what you see in her She s very plain I daresay she s very clever but she never says anything at least not to me She talks fast enough on her own subjects You didn t try to draw her out She requires drawing out But it wasn t so much missus Fargus as having a woman in the house It makes one s life so different one feels more at ease I think I ought to have a companion Have a middle aged lady here who would bore me with her conversation all through dinner when I come home from the City tired and worn out But you don t think that your conversation when you come home from the City tired and worn out has no interest whatever for me that this has turned out a good investment that the shares have gone up and will go up again I should like to know how I am to interest myself in all that What has it to do with me What has it to do with you How do you think that this house and grounds carriages and horses and servants glasshouses without end are paid for Do I ever grumble about the dressmakers bills and heaven knows they are high enough I believe all your hats and hosiery are put down to house expenses but I never grumble I let you have everything you want horses carriages dresses servants You ought to be the happiest girl in the world in this beautiful place Beautiful place I hate the place I hate it a nasty gaudy vulgar place in a vulgar suburb where nothing but money grubbing is thought of from morning noon till night how much percentage can be got out of everything cut down the salaries of the employees work everything on the most economic basis it does not matter what the employees suffer so long as seven per cent dividend is declared at the end of the year I hate the place My dear dear Mildred what are you saying I never heard you talk like this before missus Fargus has been filling your head with nonsense I wish I had never asked her to the house absurd little creature with her eternal talk about culture her cropped hair and her spectacles glimmering What nonsense she has filled your head with missus Fargus is a very clever woman I think I should like go to Girton Go to Girton Yes go to Girton I ve never had any proper education I should like to learn Greek Living here cooped up with a man all one s life isn t my idea I should like to see more of my own sex missus Fargus told me about the emulation of the class rooms about the gymnasium about the dances the girls had in each other s rooms She never enjoyed any dances like those She said that I must feel lonely living in a house without another woman I know what it ll be I shall never hear the end of missus Fargus I wish I d never asked them Men are so selfish If by any chance they do anything that pleases any one but themselves how they regret it Harold was about the middle height but he gave the impression of a small man He was good looking but his features were without charm for his mind was uninteresting a dry barren mind a somewhat stubbly mind but there was an honest kindliness in his little eyes which was absent from his sister s The conversation had paused and he glanced quickly every now and then at her pretty wistful face expressive at this moment of much irritated and nervous dissatisfaction also an irritated obstinacy lurked in her eyes and knowing how obstinate she was in her ideas Harold sincerely dreaded that she might go off to Girton to learn Greek any slightest word might precipitate the catastrophe I think at least that I might have a companion she said at last Of course you can have a companion if you like Mildred but I thought you were going to marry Alfred Stanby You objected to him you said he had nothing that he couldn t afford to marry Yes until he got his appointment but I hear now that he s nearly certain of it I don t think I could marry Alfred You threw Lumly over who was an excellent match for Alfred So long as Alfred wasn t in a position to marry you you would hear of no one else and now but you don t mean to say you are going to throw him over I don t know what I shall do Well I have no time to discuss the matter with you now It is seven minutes to nine I shall only have just time to catch the train by walking very fast Good bye Please mam any orders to day for the butcher Always the same question how tired I am of hearing the same words I suppose it is very wicked of me to be so discontented thought Mildred as she sat on the sofa with her key basket in her hand but I have got so tired of Sutton I know I shouldn t bother Harold he is very good and he does his best to please me It is very odd I was all right till missus Fargus came she upset me It was all in my mind before no doubt but she brought it out Now I can t interest myself in anything I really don t care to go to this tennis party and the people who go there are not in the least interesting I am certain I should not meet a soul whom I should care to speak to No I won t go there There s a lot to be done in the greenhouses and in the afternoon I will write a long letter to missus Fargus She promised to send me a list of books to read There was nothing definite in her mind but something was germinating within her and when the work of the day was done she wondered at the great tranquillity of the garden A servant was there in a print dress and the violet of the skies and the green of the trees seemed to be closing about her like a tomb How beautiful Mildred mused softly I wish I could paint that A little surprised and startled she went upstairs to look for her box of water colours she had not used it since she left school She found also an old block with a few sheets remaining and she worked on and on conscious only of the green stillness of the trees and the romance of rose and grey that the sky unfolded She had begun her second water colour and was so intent upon it as not to be aware that a new presence had come into the garden Alfred Stanby was walking towards her He was a tall elegantly dressed good looking young man What painting I thought you had given it up Let me see Oh Alfred how you startled me He took the sketch from the girl s lap and handing it back he said I suppose you had nothing else to do this afternoon it was too hot to go out in the cart Do you like painting Yes I think I do They were looking at each other and there was a questioning look in the girl s eyes for she perceived in that moment more distinctly than she had before the difference in their natures Have you finished the smoking cap you are making for me No I did not feel inclined to go on with it Something in Mildred s tone of voice and manner struck Alfred and dropping his self consciousness he said You thought that I d like a water colour sketch better Mildred did not answer I should like to have some drawings to hang in the smoking room when we re married But I like figures better than landscapes You never tried horses and dogs did you No I never did Mildred answered languidly and she continued to work on her sky But her thoughts were far from it and she noticed that she was spoiling it No I never tried horses and dogs But you could dearest if you were to try You could do anything you tried You are so clever I don t know that I am I should like to be They looked at each other and anxiously each strove to read the other s thoughts Landscapes are more suited to a drawing room than a smoking room It will look very well in your drawing room when we re married We shall want some pictures to cover the walls At the word marriage Mildred s lips seemed to grow thinner The conversation paused Alfred noticed that she hesitated that she was striving to speak She had broken off her engagement once before with him and he had begun to fear that she was going to do so again There was a look of mingled irresolution and determination in her face She continued to work on her sky but at every touch it grew worse and feeling that she had irretrievably spoilt her drawing she said But do you think that we shall ever be married Alfred Of course Why Are you going to break it off We have been engaged nearly two years and there seems no prospect of our being married Harold will never consent It does not seem fair to keep you waiting any longer I d willingly wait twenty years for you Mildred She looked at him a little tenderly and he continued more confidently But I m glad to say there is no longer any question of waiting My father has consented to settle four hundred a year upon me the same sum as your brother proposes to settle on you We can be married when you like She only looked at the spoilt water colour and it was with difficulty that Alfred restrained himself from snatching it out of her hands You do not answer You heard what I said that my father had agreed to settle four hundred a year upon me I m sure I m very glad for your sake That s a very cold answer Mildred I think I can say that I m sure of the appointment I m glad indeed I am Alfred But only for my sake Mildred sat looking at the water colour You see our marriage has been delayed so long many things have come between us What things Much that I m afraid you d not understand You ve often reproached me she said her voice quickening a little with coldness I m cold it is not my fault I m afraid I m not like other girls I don t think I want to be married This is missus Fargus doing What do you want I m not quite sure I should like to study This must be missus Fargus I should like to do something But marriage Marriage is not everything There are other things I should like to study art But marriage won t prevent your studying art I want to go away to leave Sutton I should like to travel But we should travel our honeymoon I don t think I could give up my freedom Alfred I ve thought it all over I m afraid I m not the wife for you Some one else has come between us Some one richer Who s this other fellow No there s no one else I assure you there s no one else I don t think I shall marry at all There are other things besides marriage I m not fitted for marriage I m not strong I don t think I could have children It would kill me All this is the result of missus Fargus I can read her ideas in every word you say Women like missus Fargus ought to be ducked in the horse pond They re a curse Mildred smiled You re as strong as other girls I never heard of anything being the matter with you You re rather thin that s all You ought to go away for a change of air I never heard such things a young girl who has been brought up like you I don t know what Harold would say not fitted for marriage not strong enough to bear children What conversations you must have had with missus Fargus studying art and the rest of it Really Mildred I did not think a young girl ever thought of such things We cannot discuss the subject We had better let it drop Yes he said we d better say no more the least said the soonest mended You re ill you don t know what you re saying You re not looking well you ve been brooding over things You d better go away for a change When you come back you ll think differently Go away for a change Yes she said I ve been thinking over things and am not feeling well But I know my own mind now I can never love you as I should like to Then you d like to love me Ah I will make you love me I ll teach you to love me Only give me the chance I don t think I shall ever love at least not as other girls do He leaned forward and took her hand he caught her other hand and the movement expressed his belief in his power to make her love him No she said resisting him You cannot I m as cold as ice Think what you re doing Mildred You re sacrificing a great love no man will ever love you as I do and for a lot of stuff about education that missus Fargus has filled your head with You re sacrificing your life for that he said pointing to the sketch that had fallen on the grass Is it worth it She picked up the sketch It was better before you came she said examining it absent mindedly I went on working at it I ve spoiled it Then noticing the incongruity she added But
6497_234106_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 it doesn t matter 
none	none	Art is not the only thing in the world There is good to be done if one only knew how to do it I don t mean charity such goodness is only on the surface it is merely a short cut to the real true goodness Art may be only selfishness indeed I m inclined to think it is but art is education not the best perhaps but the best within my reach Mildred I really do not understand You cannot be well or you wouldn t talk so I m quite well she said I hardly expected you would understand But I beg you to believe that I cannot act otherwise My life is not with you I feel sure of that The words were spoken so decisively that he knew he would not succeed in changing her Then his face grew pale with anger and he said Then everything you ve said all your promises everything was a lie a wretched lie No Alfred I tried to believe I did believe but I had not thought much then Remember I was only eighteen She gathered up her painting materials and holding out her hand said Won t you forgive me No I cannot forgive you She saw him walk down the pathway she saw him disappear in the shadow And this rupture was all that seemed real in their love story It was in his departure that she felt for the first time the touch of reality III Mildred did not see Alfred again 
6497_234067_000001_000001	train-clean-360	In the pauses of her painting she wondered if he thought of her if he missed her 
none	none	Something had gone out of her life but a great deal more had come into it mister Hoskin a young painter whose pictures were sometimes rejected in the Academy but who was a little lion in the minor exhibitions came once a week to give her lessons and when she went to town she called at his studio with her sketches mister Hoskin s studio was near the King s Road the last of a row of red houses with gables cross beams and palings 
6497_234067_000002_000002	train-clean-360	He was a good looking blond man somewhat inclined to the poetical and melancholy type his hair bristled and he wore a close cut red beard the moustache was long and silky there was a gentle pathetic look in his pale blue eyes and a slight hesitation of speech an inability to express himself in words created a passing impression of a rather foolish tiresome person 
6497_234067_000002_000003	train-clean-360	But beneath this exterior there lay a deep true nature which found expression in twilit landscapes the tenderness of cottage lights in the gloaming vague silhouettes and vague skies and fields 
6497_234067_000002_000004	train-clean-360	Ralph Hoskin was very poor his pathetic pictures did not find many purchasers and he lived principally by teaching 
6497_234067_000003_000000	train-clean-360	But he had not given Mildred her fourth lesson in landscape painting when he received an advantageous offer to copy two pictures by Turner in the National Gallery 
none	none	Would it be convenient to her to take her lesson on Friday instead of on Thursday She listened to him her eyes wide open and then in her little allusive way suggested that she would like to copy something She might as well take her lesson in the National Gallery as in Sutton Besides he would be able to take her round the gallery and explain the merits of the pictures 
6497_234067_000004_000000	train-clean-360	She was anxious to get away from Sutton and the prospect of long days spent in London pleased her and on the following Thursday Harold took her up to London by the ten minutes past nine 
6497_234067_000004_000001	train-clean-360	For the first time she found something romantic in that train

6497_234067_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 I m so frightened she said I m afraid I don t paint well enough

6497_234067_000006_000003	train-clean-360	I ve got your easel and your place is taken 
6497_234067_000007_000000	train-clean-360	They went up to the galleries 
none	none	Oh dear me this seems rather alarming she exclaimed stopping before the crowd of easels the paint boxes the palettes on the thumbs the sheaves of brushes the maulsticks in the air 
6497_234067_000008_000001	train-clean-360	She glanced at the work seeking eagerly for copies worse than any she was likely to perpetrate 
none	none	mister Hoskin assured her that there were many in the gallery who could not do as well as she And she experienced a little thrill when he led her to the easel A beautiful white canvas stood on it ready for her to begin and on a chair by the side of the easel was her paint box and brushes 
6497_234067_000008_000005	train-clean-360	He told her where she would find him in the Turner room and that she must not hesitate to come and fetch him whenever she was in difficulties 
6497_234067_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I should like you to see the drawing she said before I begin to paint 
none	none	I shall look to your drawing many times before I allow you to begin painting

none	none	The picture that Mildred had elected to copy was Reynolds s angel heads She looked at the brown gold of their hair and wondered what combination of umber and sienna would produce it 
6497_234067_000011_000002	train-clean-360	She studied the delicate bloom of their cheeks and wondered what mysterious proportions of white ochre and carmine she would have to use to obtain it 
none	none	The bright blue and grey of the eyes frightened her She felt sure that such colour did not exist in the little tin tubes that lay in rows in the black japanned box by her side 
6497_234067_000011_000005	train-clean-360	Already she despaired 
6497_234067_000011_000006	train-clean-360	But before she began to paint she would have to draw those heavenly faces in every feature 
6497_234067_000011_000007	train-clean-360	It was more difficult than sketching from nature 
6497_234067_000011_000008	train-clean-360	She could not follow the drawing it seemed to escape her 
6497_234067_000011_000009	train-clean-360	It did not exist in lines which she could measure which she could follow 
none	none	It seemed to have grown out of the canvas rather than to have been placed there The faces were leaned over illusive foreshortenings which she could not hope to catch 
6497_234067_000011_000012	train-clean-360	The girl in front of her was making it seemed to Mildred a perfect copy 
none	none	There seemed to be no difference or very little between her work and Reynolds s Mildred felt that she could copy the copy easier than she could the original But on the whole she got on better than she had expected and it was not till she came to the fifth head that she found she had drawn them all a little too large and had not sufficient space left on her canvas 
6497_234067_000012_000001	train-clean-360	This was a disappointment 
none	none	There was nothing for it but to dust out her drawing and begin it all again 
6497_234067_000012_000003	train-clean-360	She grew absorbed in her work she did not see the girl in front of her nor the young man copying opposite she did not notice their visits to each other s easels she forgot everything in the passion of drawing 
6497_234067_000012_000004	train-clean-360	Time went by without her perceiving it she was startled by the sound of her master s voice and looked in glad surprise 
none	none	How are you getting on he said Very badly Can t you see
6497_234067_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 No not so badly 
6497_234067_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Will you let me sit down 
6497_234067_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Will you give me your charcoal 
none	none	The first thing is to get the heads into their places on the canvas don t think of detail but of two or three points the crown of the head the point of the chin the placing of the ear 
6497_234067_000016_000001	train-clean-360	If you get them exactly right the rest will come easily 
none	none	You see there was not much to correct He worked on the drawing for some few minutes and then getting up he said But you ll want some lunch it is one o clock There s a refreshment room downstairs 
6497_234067_000016_000003	train-clean-360	Let me introduce you to Miss Laurence he said 
none	none	The women bowed
6497_234067_000016_000005	train-clean-360	 You re doing an excellent copy Miss Laurence 
none	none	Praise from you is praise indeed
6497_234067_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I would give anything to paint like that said Mildred 
6497_234067_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 You ve only just begun painting said Miss Laurence 
6497_234067_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Only a few months said Mildred 
none	none	Miss Lawson does some very pretty sketches from nature said mister Hoskin this is her first attempt at copying I shall never get those colours said Mildred
6497_234067_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 You must tell me which you use 
6497_234067_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Hoskin can tell you better than I You can t have a better master 
none	none	Do you copy much here asked Mildred
6497_234067_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I paint portraits when I can get them to do when I can t I come here and copy 
none	none	We re in the same boat she said turning to mister Hoskin mister Hoskin paints beautiful landscapes as long as he can find customers when he can t he undertakes to copy a Turner Mildred noticed the expression that passed over her master s face 
6497_234067_000026_000001	train-clean-360	It quickly disappeared and he said Will you take Miss Lawson to the refreshment room Miss Laurence 
6497_234067_000026_000002	train-clean-360	You re going there I suppose 
none	none	Yes I m going to the lunch room and shall be very glad to show Miss Lawson the way And in company with quite a number of students they walked through the galleries Mildred noticed that Miss Laurence s nose was hooked that her feet were small and that she wore brown leather shoes Suddenly Miss Laurence said This way and she went through a door marked Students only mister Hoskin held the door open for her they went down some stone steps looking on a courtyard mister Hoskin said I always think of Peter De Hooch when I go down these stairs 
6497_234067_000028_000003	train-clean-360	The contrast between its twilight and the brightness of the courtyard is quite in his manner 
none	none	And I always think how much I can afford to spend on my lunch said Elsie laughing 
6497_234067_000030_000000	train-clean-360	The men turned to the left top to go to their room the women turned to the right to go to theirs 
6497_234067_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 This way said Miss Laurence and she opened a glass door and Mildred found herself in what looked like an eating house of the poorer sort 
none	none	There was a counter where tea and coffee and rolls and butter were sold Plates of beef and ham could be had there too The students paid for their food at the counter and carried it to the tables I can still afford a plate of beef said Miss Laurence but I don t know how long I shall be able to if things go on as they ve been going 
6497_234067_000032_000001	train-clean-360	But you don t know what it is to want money and in a rapid glance Miss Laurence roughly calculated the price of Mildred s clothes 
6497_234067_000033_000000	train-clean-360	A tall rather handsome girl with dark coarse hair and a face lit up by round grey eyes entered 
6497_234067_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 So you are here Elsie and she stared at Mildred 
6497_234067_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Let me introduce you to Miss Lawson 
6497_234067_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Miss Lawson Miss Cissy Clive 
none	none	I m as hungry as a hawk Cissy said and she selected the plate on which there was most beef I haven t seen you here before Miss Lawson 
6497_234067_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Is this your first day 
6497_234067_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes this is my first day 
none	none	They took their food to the nearest table and Elsie asked Cissy if she had finished her copy of Etty s Bather Cissy told how the old gentleman in charge of the gallery had read her a lecture on the subject He did not like to see such pictures copied especially by young women Copies of such pictures attracted visitors 
6497_234067_000039_000003	train-clean-360	But Cissy had insisted and he had put her and the picture into a little room off the main gallery where she could pursue her nefarious work unperceived 
6497_234067_000040_000000	train-clean-360	The girls laughed heartily 
6497_234067_000040_000001	train-clean-360	Elsie asked for whom Cissy was making the copy 
6497_234067_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 For a friend of Freddy s a very rich fellow 
none	none	Herbert is going to get him to give me a commission for a set of nude figures 
6497_234067_000041_000002	train-clean-360	Freddy has just come back from Monte Carlo 
6497_234067_000041_000003	train-clean-360	He has lost all his money 
6497_234067_000041_000004	train-clean-360	He says he s stony and doesn t know how he ll pull through 
6497_234067_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Was he here this morning 
6497_234067_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 He ran in for a moment to see me 
6497_234067_000043_000001	train-clean-360	I m dining with him to night 
none	none	You re not at home then
6497_234067_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 No I forgot to tell you I m staying with you so be careful not to give me away if you should meet mother 
none	none	Freddy will be back this afternoon I ll get him to ask you if you ll come
6497_234067_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I promised to go out with Walter to night 
6497_234067_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 You can put him off 
none	none	Say that you ve some work to finish some black and white
6497_234067_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Then he d want to come round to the studio 
6497_234067_000048_000001	train-clean-360	I don t like to put him off 
6497_234067_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 As you like 
none	none	It ll be a very jolly dinner 
6497_234067_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Johnny and Herbert are coming 
none	none	But I daresay Freddy ll ask Walter 
6497_234067_000049_000004	train-clean-360	He ll do anything I ask him 
6497_234067_000050_000000	train-clean-360	When lunch was over Cissy and Elsie took each other s arms and went upstairs together 
6497_234067_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Mildred heard Cissy ask who she was 
6497_234067_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Elsie whispered A pupil of Ralph s 
6497_234067_000051_000001	train-clean-360	You shouldn t have talked so openly before her 
6497_234067_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 So his name is Ralph Mildred said to herself and thought that she liked the name 
none	none	IV Mildred soon began to perceive and to understand the intimate life of the galleries a strange life full of its special idiosyncrasies There were titled ladies who came with their maids and commanded respect from the keeper of the gallery and there was a lady with bright yellow hair who occasioned him much anxiety For she allowed visitors not only to enter into conversation with her but if they pleased her fancy she would walk about the galleries with them and take them out to lunch There was an old man who copied Hogarth he was madly in love with a young woman who copied Rossetti But she was in love with an academy student who patronised all the girls and spent his time in correcting their drawings A little further away was another old man who copied Turner By a special permission he came at eight o clock two hours before the galleries were open It was said that with a tree from one picture a foreground from another a piece of distance from a third a sky from a fourth he had made a picture which had taken in the Academicians and had been hung in Burlington House as an original work by Crome Most of his work was done before the students entered the galleries he did very little after ten o clock he pottered round from easel to easel chattering but he never imparted the least of his secrets He knew how to evade questions and after ten minutes cross examination he would say Good morning and leave the student no wiser than he was before A legend was in circulation that to imitate Turner s rough surfaces he covered his canvas with plaster of Paris and glazed upon it The little life of the galleries was alive with story Walter was a fair young man with abundant hair and conversation Elsie hung about his easel He covered a canvas with erratic blots of colour and quaint signs but his plausive eloquence carried him through and Elsie thought more highly of his talents than he did of hers They were garrulous one as the other and it was pleasant to see them strolling about the galleries criticising and admiring until Elsie said Now Walter I must get back to my work and don t you think it would be better if you went on with yours So far as Mildred could see Elsie s life seemed from the beginning to have been made up of painting and young men She was fond of Walter but she wasn t sure that she did not like Henry best and later others a Jim a Hubert and a Charles knocked at her studio door and they were all admitted and they wasted Elsie s time and drank her tea Very often they addressed their attentions to Mildred but she said she could not encourage them they were all fast and she said she did not like fast men I never knew a girl like you you re not like other girls Did you never like a man I never really I once thought you liked Ralph Yes I do like him But he s different from these men he doesn t make love to me I like him to like me but I don t think I should like him if he made love to me You re an odd girl I don t believe there s another like you I can t think how you can like all these men to make love to you They don t all make love to me Elsie answered quickly I hope you don t think there s anything wrong It is merely Platonic I should hope so But they waste a great deal of your time Yes that s the worst of it I like men men are my life I don t mind admitting it But I know they ve interfered with my painting That s the worst of it Then the conversation turned on Cissy Clive Cissy is a funny girl Elsie said For nine months out of every twelve she leads a highly respectable life in West Kensington But every now and then the fit takes her and she tells her mother who believes every word she says that she s staying with me In reality she takes rooms in Clarges Street and has a high old time I once heard her whispering to you something about not giving her away if you should happen to meet her mother I remember about Hopwood Blunt He had just returned from Monte Carlo But I suppose it is all right She likes talking to him I don t think she can find much to talk about to Hopwood Blunt said Elsie laughing Haven t you seen him He is often in the galleries What does she say She says he s a great baby that he amuses her Next day Mildred went to visit Cissy in the unfrequented gallery where her Bather would not give scandal to the visitors She had nearly completed her copy it was excellent and Mildred could not praise it sufficiently Then the girls spoke of Elsie and Walter Mildred said She seems very fond of him And of how many others Elsie never could be true to a man It was just the same in the Academy schools And that studio of hers Have you been to any of her tea parties They turn down the lights don t they As Mildred was about to answer Cissy said Oh here s Freddy mister Hopwood Blunt was tall and fair a brawny young Englishman still though the champagne of fashionable restaurants and racecourses was beginning to show itself in a slight puffiness in his handsome florid cheeks He shook hands carelessly with Miss Clive whom he called Cis and declared himself dead beat She hastened to hand him her chair I know what s the matter with you she said too much champagne last night at the Cafe Royal Wrong again We weren t at the Cafe Royal we dined at the Bristol Don t like the place give me the good old Cafe Savoy How many bottles Don t know know that I didn t drink my share It was something I had after Then followed an account of the company and the dinner The conversation was carried on in allusions and Mildred heard something about Tommy s girl and a horse that was worth backing at Kempton At last it occurred to Cissy to introduce Mildred mister Hopwood Blunt made a faint pretence of rising from his chair and the conversation turned on the Bather I think you ought to make her a little better looking What do you say Miss Lawson Cis is painting that picture for a smoking room and in the smoking room we like pretty girls He thought that they ought to see a little more of the lady s face and he did not approve of the drapery Cissy argued that she could not alter Etty s composition she reproved him for his facetiousness and was visibly annoyed at the glances he bestowed on Mildred A moment after Ralph appeared Don t let me disturb you he said I did not know where you were Miss Lawson that was all I thought you might like me to see how you re getting on Ralph and Mildred walked through two galleries in silence Elsie had gone out to lunch with Walter the old lady with the grey ringlets who copied Gainsborough s Watering Place was downstairs having a cup of coffee and a roll the cripple leaned on his crutch and compared his drawing of missus Siddons s nose with Gainsborough s Ralph waited till he hopped away and Mildred was grateful to him for the delay she did not care for her neighbours to see what work her master did on her picture You ve got the background wrong he said taking off a yellowish grey with the knife The cloud in the left hand corner is the deepest dark you have in the picture and he prepared a tone What a lovely quality Reynolds has got into the sky This face is not sufficiently foreshortened Too long from the nose to the chin he said taking off an eighth of an inch Then the mouth had to be raised Mildred watched nervous with apprehension lest Elsie or the old lady or the cripple should return and interrupt him There it is better now he said surveying the picture his head on one side I should think it was she answered enthusiastically I shall be able to get on now I could not get the drawing of that face right And the sky what a difference I like it as well as the original It s quite as good Ralph laughed and they walked through the galleries The question of course arose which was the greater the Turner or the Claude Mildred thought that she liked the Claude One is romance the other is common sense If the Turner is romance I wonder I don t prefer it to the Claude I love romance School girl romance very likely Mildred didn t answer and without noticing her Ralph continued I like Turner best in the grey and English manner that picture for instance on the other side of the doorway How much simpler how much more original how much more beautiful That grey and yellow sky the delicacy of the purple in the clouds But even in classical landscape Turner did better than Claude Turner created all that architecture is dreamed Claude copied his At the end of each little sentence he stared at Mildred half ashamed at having expressed himself so badly half surprised at having expressed himself so well Anxious to draw him out she said But the picture you admire is merely a strip of sea with some fishing boats I ve seen it a hundred times before at Brighton at Westgate at whatever seaside place we go to just like that only not quite so dark Yes just like that only not quite so dark That not quite so dark makes the difference Turner didn t copy he transposed what he saw Transposed what he saw he repeated I don t explain myself very well I don t know if you understand But what I mean is that the more realistic you are the better so long as you transpose there must always be a transposition of tones Mildred admitted that she did not quite understand Ralph stammered and relinquished the attempt to explain They walked in silence until they came to the Rembrandts the portrait of the painter as a young man and the portrait of the Jew Merchant Mildred preferred the portrait of the young man But not because it s a young man she pleaded but because it is it is Compared with the Jew Merchant it is like a coloured photograph Look at him he rises up grand and mysterious as a pyramid the other is as insignificant as life Look at the Jew s face it is done with one tint a synthesis a dark red and the face is as it were made out of nothing hardly anything and yet everything is said You can t say where the picture begins or ends the Jew surges out of the darkness like a vision Look at his robe a few folds that is all and yet he s completely dressed and his hand how large how great Don t you see don t you understand I think I do Mildred replied a little wistfully and she cast a last look on the young man whom she must admire no more Ralph opened the door marked students only and they went down the stone steps When they came to where the men and women separated for their different rooms Mildred asked Ralph if he were going out to lunch He hesitated and then answered that it took too long to go to a restaurant Mildred guessed by his manner that he had no money There s no place in the gallery where we can get lunch you women are luckier than us men What do they give you in your room You mean in the way of meat Cold meat beef and ham pork pies But I don t care for meat I never touch it What do you eat There are some nice cakes I ll go and get some we ll share them No no I really am not hungry much obliged Oh do let me go and get some cakes it ll be such fun and so much nicer than sitting with a lot of women in that little room They shared their cakes walking up and down the great stone passages and this was the beginning of their intimacy On the following week she wrote to say what train she was coming up by he met her at the station and they went together to the National Gallery But their way led through saint James Park they lingered there and as the season advanced their lingerings in the park grew longer and longer What a pretty park this is It always seems to me like a lady s boudoir or what I imagine a lady s boudoir must be like Have you never seen a lady s boudoir No I don t think I have I ve never been in what you call society I had to make my living ever since I was sixteen My father was a small tradesman in Brixton When I was sixteen I had to make my own living I used to draw in the illustrated papers I began by making two pounds a week Then as I got on I used to live as much as possible in the country You can t paint landscapes in London You must have had a hard time I suppose I had It was all right as long as I kept to my newspaper work But I was ambitious and wanted to paint in oils but I never had a hundred pounds in front of me I could only get away for a fortnight or a month at a time Then as things got better I had to help my family My father died and I had to look after my mother Mildred raised her eyes and looked at him affectionately I think I could have done something if I had had a fair chance Done something But you have done something Have you forgotten what the Spectator said of your farmyard That s nothing If I hadn t to think of getting my living I could do better than that Oil painting is the easiest material of all until you come to a certain point after that point when you begin to think of quality and transparency it is most difficult They were standing on the bridge The water below them was full of ducks The birds balanced themselves like little boats on the waves and Mildred thought of her five hundred a year and the pleasure it would be to help Ralph to paint the pictures he wanted to paint She imagined him a great artist his success would be her doing At that same moment he was thinking that there never had been any pleasure in his life and Mildred her hat her expensive dress her sunshade seemed in such bitter contrast to himself to his own life that he could not hide a natural irritation Your life has been all pleasure he said glancing at her disdainfully No indeed it has not My life has been miserable enough We are rich it is true but our riches have never brought me happiness The best time I ve had has been since I met you Is that true I wonder if that s true Their eyes met and she said hastily with seeming desire to change the subject So you re a Londoner born and bred and yet you d like to live in the country Only for my painting I love London but you can t paint landscapes in London I wonder why not You said you loved this park There s nothing more beautiful in the country those trees this quiet misty lake it is exquisite and yet I suppose it wouldn t make a picture I don t know I ve often thought of trying to do something with it But what s beautiful to look at doesn t do well in a picture The hills and dales in the Green Park are perfect their artificiality is their beauty There s one bit that I like especially Which is that The bit by Buckingham Palace where the sheep feed the trees there are beautiful large spreading trees and they give the place a false air of Arcady But in a picture it wouldn t do Why I can t say I don t think it would mean much if it were painted You couldn t have a shepherd or if you had he d have to be cross gartered and his lady love in flowery silk would have to be sitting on a bank and there is not a bank there you d have to invent one That s it the park is eighteenth century a comedy of the restoration But why couldn t you paint that said Mildred pointing to where a beautiful building passed across the vista I suppose one ought to be able to The turrets in the distance are fine But no it wouldn t make a picture The landscape painter never will be able to do much with London He ll have to live in the country and if he can t afford to do that he d better turn it up Elsie Laurence and Cissy Clive are going to France soon They say that s the only place to study In the summer they re going to a place called Barbizon near Fontainebleau I was thinking of going with them Were you I wish I were going Especially to Barbizon The country would suit me Mildred longed to say I shall be glad if you ll let me lend you the money but she didn t dare At the end of a long silence Ralph said I think we d better be going on It must be nearly ten V As the spring advanced they spent more and more time in the park They learnt to know it in its slightest aspects they anticipated each bend of the lake s bank they looked out for the tall trees at the end of the island and often thought of the tree that leaned until its lower leaves swept the water s edge Close to this tree was their favourite seat And as they sat by the water s edge in the vaporous afternoons the park seemed part and parcel of their love of each other it was their refuge it was only there that they were alone the park was a relief from the promiscuity of the galleries In the park they could talk without fear of being overheard and they took interest in the changes that spring was effecting in this beautiful friendly nature their friend and their accomplice The park is greener than it was yesterday he said Look at that tree How bright the green and how strange it seems amid all the blackness And that rose cloud and the reflection of the evening in the lake how tranquil And that great block of buildings Queen Anne s Mansions is it not beautiful in the blue atmosphere In London the ugliest things are beautiful in the evening No city has so pictorial an atmosphere Not Paris I ve not seen Paris I ve never been out of England Then you re speaking of things you haven t seen Of things that I ve only imagined The conversation paused a moment and then Ralph said Are you still thinking of going to Paris with Elsie Laurence and Cissy Clive I think so Paris is the only place one can study art so they say You ll be away a long while several months It wouldn t be much good going if I didn t stop some time six or seven months would it I suppose not Mildred raised her eyes cautiously and looked at him His eyes were averted He was looking where some ducks were swimming They came towards the bank slowly a drake and two ducks A third duck paddled aimlessly about at some little distance There was a slight mist on the water If you go to Paris I hope I may write to you Send me your drawings to correct Any advice I can give you is at your service I shall only be too pleased Oh yes I hope you will write to me I shall be so glad to hear from you I shall be lonely all that time away from home And you ll write to me Of course And if I write to you you won t misunderstand Ralph looked up surprised I mean if I write affectionately you won t misunderstand It will be because Because you feel lonely Partly But you don t misunderstand do you They watched the ducks in silence At last Mildred said That duck wanders about by herself why doesn t she join the others Perhaps she can t find a drake Perhaps she prefers to be alone We shall see the drake is going to her She is going away from him She doesn t want him She s jealous of the others If there were no other she would There are always others Do you think so Mildred did not answer Ralph waited a few moments then he said So you re going away for six or seven months the time will seem very long while you re away Again Mildred was tempted to ask him if she might lend him the money to go to Paris She raised her eyes to his he wondered what was passing in her mind but he did not find courage to speak until some days later He had asked her to come to his studio to see a picture he had begun It was nearly six o clock Mildred had been there nearly an hour the composition had been exhaustively admired but something still unsaid seemed to float in the air and every moment that something seemed to grow more imminent You are decided to go to France When do you leave Some time next week The day is not yet fixed Elsie Laurence and Cissy Clive are going Yes Why don t you come too I wish I could I can t I have no money But I can lend you what you want I have more than I require Let me lend you a hundred pounds Do Ralph smiled through his red moustache and his grey gentle eyes smiled too a melancholy little smile that passed quickly It is very kind of you But it would be impossible for me to borrow money from you Even if I had the money I could hardly go with you Why not there s a party Walter is going and Hopwood Blunt is going I m the fifth wheel Ralph was about to say something but he checked himself he never spoke ill of any one So putting his criticism of her companions aside he said Only under one condition could I go abroad with you You know Mildred I love you An expression of pleasure came upon her face and seeing it he threw his arms out to draw her closer She drew away You shrink from me I suppose I m too rough You could never care for me Yes indeed Ralph I do care for you I like you very much indeed but not like that You could not like me enough to marry me I don t think I could marry any one Why not I don t know Do you care for any one else No indeed I don t I like you very much I want you to be my friend But you don t understand Men never do I suppose affection would not satisfy you But you could not marry me I d sooner marry you than any one But But what Mildred told the story of her engagement and how in the end she had been forced to break it off And you think if you engaged yourself to me it might end in the same way Yes And I would not cause you pain Forgive me But if you never intend to marry what do you intend to do There are other things to do surely What There s art Art You think I shall not succeed with my painting No I did not mean that I hope you will But painting is very difficult I ve found it so It seems hopeless You think I shall be a failure You think that I d better remain at home and marry than go to France and study It s impossible to say who will succeed I only know it is very difficult too difficult for me Women never have succeeded in painting Some have to a certain extent But you re not angry offended at my having spoken No I hope we shall always be friends You know that I like you very much Then why not why not be engaged It will give you time to consider to find out if you could But you see I ve broken off one engagement so that I might be free to devote myself to painting But that man was not congenial to you He was not an artist he would have opposed your painting you d have had to give up painting if you had married him But I m quite different I should help and encourage you in your art All you know I have taught you I could teach you a great deal more Mildred Do you think that you could Yes will you let me try But you see I m going away Shall I see you again before I go When you like When To morrow To morrow would be nice Where in the National No in the park It will be nicer in the park Then about eleven At five minutes past eleven he saw her coming through the trees and she signed to him with a little movement of her parasol which was particularly charming and which seemed to him to express her They walked from the bridge along the western bank the trees were prettier there and from their favourite seat they saw the morning light silver the water the light mist evaporate and the trees on the other bank emerge from vague masses into individualities of trunk and bough The day was warm though there was little sun and the park swung a great mass of greenery under a soft grey sky The drake and the two ducks came swimming towards them the drake of course in the middle looking very handsome and pleased and at a little distance the third duck pursued her rejected and disconsolate courtship Whenever she approached too near the drake rushed at her with open beak and drove her back Then she affected not to know where she was going wandering in an aimless absent minded fashion getting near and nearer her recalcitrant drake But these ruses were wasted upon him he saw through them all and at last he attacked the poor broken hearted duck so determinedly that she was obliged to seek safety in flight And the entire while of the little aquatic comedy the wisdom of an engagement had been discussed between Ralph and Mildred She had consented But her promise had not convinced Ralph and he said referring to the duck which they had both been watching I shall dangle round you for a time and when I come too near you ll chase me away until at last you ll make up your mind that you can stand it no longer and will refuse ever to see me again VI She had had a rough passage sea sickness still haunted in her she was pale with fatigue and her eyes longed for sleep But Elsie and Cissy were coming to take her to the studio at ten o clock So she asked to be called at nine and she got up when she was called The gilt clock was striking ten in the empty drawing room when she entered I didn t expect her to get up at six to receive me but she might be up at ten I think However it doesn t much matter I suppose she s looking after her sick husband Well I don t think much of her drawing room Red plush sofas and chairs It is just like an hotel and the street is dingy enough thought Mildred as she pulled one of the narrow lace curtains aside I don t think much of Paris But it doesn t matter I shall be at the studio nearly all day A moment after missus Fargus entered I m so sorry she said I wasn t up to receive you but I didn t expect you to get up at five which you would have had to do I was here soon after six missus Fargus asked her if she had had a good passage if she felt fatigued and what she thought of Paris And then the conversation dropped She s a good little soul thought Mildred even though she does dress shabbily It is pure kindness of her to have me here she doesn t want the three pounds a week I pay her But I had to pay something I couldn t sponge on her hospitality for six months I wonder she doesn t say something I suppose I must You know it is very kind of you to have me here I don t know how to thank you missus Fargus thoughts seemed on their way back from a thousand miles From the depths of Comte thought Mildred My dear you wanted to study Yes but if it hadn t been for you I should never have got the chance As it was Harold did his best to keep me He said he d have to get a housekeeper and it would put him to a great deal of inconvenience men are so selfish He d like me to keep house for him always We re all selfish Mildred Men aren t worse than women only it takes another form We only recognise selfishness when it takes a form different from our practice Mildred listened intently but missus Fargus said no more and the conversation seemed as if it were going to drop Suddenly to Mildred s surprise missus Fargus said When do you propose to begin work This morning Elsie Laurence and Cissy Clive are coming to take me to the studio I m expecting them every moment They re late They know the studio they re taking you to I suppose Oh yes they ve worked there before The question is whether I ought to work in the men s studio or if it would be better safer to join the ladies class What does Miss Laurence say Oh Elsie and Cissy are going to work with the men They wouldn t work with a lot of women Why Because they like being with men in the first place Oh But you No I don t mind and yet I don t think I should care to be cooped up all day with a lot of women You mean that there would be more emulation in a mixed class Yes and Elsie says it is better to work in the men s studio There are cleverer pupils there than in the ladies studio and one learns as much from one s neighbours as from the professor more Are you sure of that Do you not think that we are all far too ready to assume that whatever men do is the best I suppose we are Men kept us uneducated till a hundred years ago we are only gaining our rights inch by inch prejudice is only being overcome very slowly and whenever women have had equal or nearly equal advantages they have proved themselves equal or superior to men Women s inferiority in physical strength is immaterial for as mankind grows more civilised force will be found in the brain and not in the muscles missus Fargus was now fairly afloat on her favourite theme viz if men were kind to women their kindness was worse than their cruelty it was demoralising Eventually the conversation returned whence it had started and missus Fargus said Then why do you hesitate What is the objection to the men s studio I do not know that there is any particular objection nothing that I ought to let stand in the way of my studies It was only something that Elsie and Cissy said They said the men s conversation wasn t always very nice But they weren t sure for they understand French hardly at all they may have been mistaken But if the conversation were coarse it would be very unpleasant for me the students would know that I understood Then there s the model there s that to be got over But Elsie and Cissy say that the model s nothing no more than a statue The model is undraped Oh yes Really Mildred That s the disadvantage of being a girl Prejudice closes the opportunity of study to one missus Fargus did not speak for a long time At last she said Of course Mildred you must consult your own feeling if it s the custom if it s necessary Your vocation is of course everything Then it was Mildred s turn to pause before answering At last she said It does seem rather well disgusting but if it is necessary for one s art In a way I d as soon work in the ladies studio I daresay you derive just as much advantage Do you think so It s from the students round one that one learns and there s no use coming to Paris if one doesn t make the most of one s opportunities You might give the ladies studio a trial and if you didn t find you were getting on you could join the men s After having wasted three months As you say my vocation is everything It would be useless for me to think of taking up painting as a profession if I did not work in the men s studio But are you going there I can t make up my mind You have frightened me you ve put me off it I think I hardly offered an opinion Perhaps Harold would not like me to go there You might write to him Yes write to him Write to Harold about such a thing the most conventional man in the world At that moment the servant announced Elsie and Cissy They wore their best dresses and were clearly atingle with desire of conversation and Paris We re a little late aren t we dear We re so sorry said Elsie How do you do dear said Cissy Mildred introduced her friends They bowed and shook hands with missus Fargus but were at no pains to conceal their indifference to the drab and dowdy little woman in the soiled sage green and the glimmering spectacles What a complexion whispered Elsie the moment they were outside the door What s her husband like asked Cissy as they descended the first flight Mildred answered that mister Fargus suffered from asthma and hoped no further questions would be asked so happy was she in the sense of real emancipation from the bondage of home so delighted was she in the spectacle of the great boulevard now radiant with spring sunlight She wondered at the large blue cravats of idlers sitting in cafes freshly strewn with bright clean sand at the aprons of the waiters the waiters were now pouring out green absinthe at the little shop girls in tight black dresses and frizzled hair passing three together arm in arm all the boulevard amused and interested Mildred It looked so different she said from what it had done four hours before But none of us look our best at six in the morning she added laughing and her friends laughed too Elsie and Cissy chattered of some project to dine with Walter and go to the theatre afterwards and incidentally Mildred learnt that Hopwood Blunt would not be in Paris before the end of the week But where was the studio The kiosques were now open the morning papers were selling briskly the roadway was full of fiacres plying for hire or were drawn up in lines three deep the red waistcoated coachmen slept on their box seats But where was the studio Suddenly they turned into an Arcade The shops on either side were filled with jet ornaments fancy glass bon bons boxes and fans Cissy thought of a present for Hopwood that case of liqueur glasses Mildred examined a jet brooch which she thought would suit missus Fargus Elsie wished that Walter would present her with a fan and then they went up a flight of wooden stairs and pushed open a swing door In a small room furnished with a divan a desk and a couple of cane chairs they met M Daveau He wore a short jacket and a brown black beard He shook hands with Elsie and Cissy and was introduced to Mildred Elsie said You speak better than we do Tell him you ve come here to study I ve come to Paris to study painting said Mildred But I don t know which I shall join the ladies studio or the men s studio Miss Laurence and Miss Clive advised me to work here in the men s studio I know Miss Laurence and Miss Clive very well There was charm in his voice and Mildred was already interested in him Cissy and Elsie had drawn a curtain at the end of the room and were peeping into the studio Miss Laurence and Miss Clive he said worked here for more than a year They made a great deal of progress a great deal They worked also in the ladies studio opposite Ah that is what I wanted to speak to you about Would you advise me to work in the men s studio Do you think it would be advisable Do you think there would be any advantages We have some very clever pupils here very clever of course it is of great advantage to work with clever pupils That is what I think but I am not certain If Mademoiselle intends to study painting seriously Oh but I do I am very serious Then I do not think there can be any doubt which studio she should choose Very well This studio is a hundred francs a month for a lady the ladies studio is sixty francs a month Why is that Because if it were not so we should be overcrowded Ladies prefer to work in this studio it is much more advantageous If you would like to see the studio first There were more than thirty in the studio about twenty men and fifteen women Some sat on low stools close under the platform whereon the model stood some worked at easels drawn close together in a semicircle round the room The model was less shocking than Mildred had imagined he stood with his hands on his hip a staff in his hand and had it not been for a slight swaying motion she would hardly have known he was alive She had never drawn before from the living model and was puzzled to know how to begin She was going to ask Elsie to tell her when M Daveau drew the curtain aside and picking his way through the pupils came straight to her He took the stool next her and with a pleasant smile asked if she had ever drawn from the life No she said I have only copied a few pictures you learn nothing from copying He told her how she must count the number of heads and explained to her the advantage of the plumb line in determining the action of the figure Mildred was much interested she wondered if she would be able to put the instruction she was receiving into practice and was disappointed when the model got down from the table and put on his trousers The model rests for ten minutes every three quarters of an hour He ll take the pose again presently It is now eleven o clock M Daveau laid the charcoal upon her easel and promised to come and see how she was getting on later in the afternoon But just as the model was about to take the pose again a young girl entered the studio Do you want a model Yes if she has a good figure said a student Have you a good figure he added with a smile Some people think so You must judge for yourselves she answered taking off her hat Surely she is not going to undress in public said Mildred to Elsie who had come to her easel VII Mildred worked hard in the studio She was always one of the first to arrive and she did not leave till the model had finished sitting and during the eight hours interrupted only by an hour in the middle of the day for lunch she applied herself to her drawing eschewing conversation with the students whether French or English She did not leave her easel when the model rested she waited patiently sharpening her pencils or reading she never came to the studio unprovided with a book And she made a pretty picture sitting on her high stool and the students often sketched her during the rests Although quietly she was always beautifully dressed Simple though they appeared to be her black crepe de chine skirts told of large sums of money spent in fashionable millinery establishments and her large hats profusely trimmed with ostrich feathers which suited her so well contrasted strangely with the poor head gear of the other girls and when the weather grew warmer she appeared in a charming shot silk grey and pink and a black straw hat lightly trimmed with red flowers In answer to Elsie who had said that she looked as if she were going to a garden party Mildred said I don t see why because you re an artist you should be a slattern I don t feel comfortable in a dirty dress It makes me feel quite ill Although Mildred was constantly with Elsie and Cissy she never seemed to be of their company and seeing them sitting together in the Bouillon Duval at their table next the window an observer would be sure to wonder what accident had sent out that rare and subtle girl with such cheerful commonness as Elsie and Cissy The contrast was even more striking when they entered the eating house Mildred looking a little annoyed and always forgetful of the tariff card which she should take from the door keeper Elsie and Cissy triumphant making for the staircase as Mildred said to herself with a flourish of cards Mildred instinctively hated the Bouillon Duval and only went there because her friends could not afford a restaurant The traffic of the Bouillon disgusted her the food she admitted was well enough but as she said it was mealing feeding like an animal in a cage not dining or breakfasting Very often she protested Oh nonsense said Cissy we shall get one of Catherine s tables if we make haste Catherine was their favourite waitress Like a hen she seemed to have taken them under her protection And she told them what were the best dishes and devoted a large part of her time to attending on them She liked Mildred especially she paid her compliments and so became a contrary influence in Mildred s dislike of the Bouillon She seemed to understand them thoroughly from the first Elsie and Cissy she knew would eat everything they were never without their appetites but Mildred very often said she could eat nothing Then Catherine would come to the rescue with a tempting suggestion Une belle aile de poulet avec sauce remoulade Well perhaps I could pick a bone Mildred would answer and these wings of chicken seemed to her the best she had ever eaten She liked the tiny strawberries which were beginning to come into season she liked les petites suisses and she liked the chatter of her friends and her own chatter across the little marble table She thought that she had never enjoyed talking so much before One evening as they stirred their coffee Elsie said looking down the street What a pretty effect Mildred leaned over her friend s shoulder and saw the jagged outline of the street and a spire beautiful in the sunset She was annoyed that she had not first discovered the picturesqueness of the perspective and when Elsie sketched the street on the marble table she felt that she would never be able to draw like that The weather grew warmer and in June M Daveau and three or four of the leading students proposed that they should make up a party to spend Sunday at Bas Mendon To arrive at Bas Mendon in time for breakfast they would have to catch the ten o clock boat from the Pont Neuf Cissy Elsie and Mildred were asked there were no French girls to ask so as Elsie said they d have the men to themselves The day impressed itself singularly on Mildred s mind She never forgot the drive to the Pont Neuf in the early morning the sunshine had seemed especially lovely she did not forget her fear lest she should be late she was only just in time they were waiting for her their paint boxes slung over their shoulders and the boat was moving alongside as she ran down the steps She did not forget M Daveau s black beard she saw it and remembered it long afterwards But she never could recall her impressions of the journey she only remembered that it had seemed a long while and that she was very hungry when they arrived She remembered the trellis and the boiled eggs and the cutlets and that after breakfast M Daveau had painted a high stairway that led to the top of the hill and she remembered how she had stood behind him wondering at the ease with which he drew in the steps In the evening there had been a little exhibition of sketches and in the boat going home he had talked to her and she had enjoyed talking to him Of his conversation she only recalled one sentence She had asked him if he liked classical music and he had answered There is no music except classical music And it was this chance phrase that made the day memorable its very sententiousness had pleased her in that calm bright evening she had realised and it had helped her to realise that there existed a higher plane of appreciation and feeling than that on which her mind moved At the end of July Elsie and Cissy spoke of going into the country and they asked Mildred to come with them Barbizon was a village close to the Forest of Fontainebleau There was an inn where they would be comfortable all the clever young fellows went to Barbizon for the summer But Mildred thought that on the whole it would be better for her to continue working in the studio without interruption Elsie and Cissy did not agree with her They told her that she would find the studio almost deserted and quite intolerable in August Bad tobacco drains and Italian models Faugh But their description of what the studio would become in the hot weather did not stir Mildred s resolution M Daveau had told her that landscape painting would come to her very easily when she had learnt to draw and that the way to learn to draw was to draw from the nude So she bore with the heat and the smells for eight hours a day There were but four or five other pupils beside herself this was an advantage in a way but these few were not inclined for work idleness is contagious and Mildred experienced much difficulty in remaining at her easel In the evenings her only distraction was to go for a drive with missus Fargus But too often missus Fargus could not leave her husband and these evenings Mildred spent in reading or in writing letters The dullness of her life and the narrowness and aridity of her acquaintance induced her to write very often to Ralph and depression of spirits often tempted her to express herself more affectionately than she would have done in wider and pleasanter circumstances She once spoke of the pleasure it would give her to see him she said that she would like to see him walk into the studio But when he took her at her word and she saw him draw aside the curtain and look in a cloud of annoyance gathered on her face But she easily assumed her pretty mysterious smile and said When did you arrive Only this morning You said you d like to see me I had to come I hope you are not angry Then noticing that the girl next them was an English girl Ralph spoke about Mildred s drawing She did not like him to see it but he asked her for the charcoal and said if she would give him her place he would see if he could find out what was wrong he did not think she had got enough movement into the figure Ah that s what the professor says when he comes round toujours un peu froid comme mouvement I can get the proportions it is the movement that bothers me Movement is drawing in the real sense of the word If they would only teach you to draw by the movement He continued to correct Mildred s drawing for some time When he laid down the charcoal he said How hot it is here I wonder how you can bear it Yes the heat is dreadful I m too exhausted to do much work Supposing we go out They went downstairs and some way along the Passage des Panoramas without speaking At last Mildred said Are you going to be in Paris for long No I m going back at once perhaps to morrow You know I ve a lot of work on hand I m getting on luck has turned I ve sold several pictures I must get back Why to morrow it was hardly worth while coming for so short a time I only came to see you You know I couldn t you know I mean that I felt that I must see you Mildred looked up it was an affectionate glance and she swung her parasol in a way that recalled their walks in the Green Park They passed out of the passage into the boulevard As they crossed the Rue Vivienne Ralph said in his abrupt fragmentary way You said you d like to see me I could see from your letters that you were unhappy No I m not unhappy a little dull at times that is all You wrote me some charming letters I hope you meant all you said Did I say so much then I daresay I said more than I intended No don t say that don t say that The absinthe drinkers the green trees the blue roofs of the great houses all these signs of the boulevard intruded upon and interrupted their thoughts then the boulevard passed out of their sight and they were again conscious of nothing but each other I met your brother He was anxious about you He wondered if you were getting on and I said that I d go and see And do you think I m getting on Yes I think you ve made progress You couldn t have done that drawing before you went to Paris You really think so I was right to go to Paris I must show you my other drawings I ve some better than that The artistic question was discussed till they reached the Place de l Opera That is the opera house Mildred said and that is the Cafe de la Paix You haven t been to Paris before No this is my first visit But I didn t come to Paris to see Paris I came to see you I could not help myself Your letters were so charming I have read them over a thousand times I couldn t go on reading them without seeing you I got afraid that you d find some one here you d fall in love with Some one whom you d prefer to me Have you No I don t know that I have Then why shouldn t we be married That s what I ve come to ask you You mean now in Paris Why not If you haven t met any one you like better you know And give up my painting and just at the time I m beginning to get on You said I had improved in my drawing Ah your drawing interests you more than I I d give anything to draw like Misal You don t know him a student of the Beaux Arts When you d learnt all he knows you wouldn t be any nearer to painting a picture That isn t very polite You don t think much of my chances of success But we shall see Mildred you don t understand me This is not fair to me Only say when you ll marry me and I ll wait I ll wait yes as long as you like only fix a time When I ve learnt to draw You re laughing at me Her face darkened and they did not speak again till the green roof of the Madeleine appeared striking sharp against a piece of blue sky Mildred said This is my way and she turned to the right You take offence without cause When you have learnt to draw We re always learning to draw No one has ever learnt to draw perfectly I have no other answer Mildred this isn t fair If you re not satisfied I release you from your engagement Yes I release you from your engagement Mildred you re cruel You seem to take pleasure in torturing me But this cannot be I cannot live without you What am I to do You must try No I shall not try he answered sullenly What will you do My plans are made I shall not live Oh Ralph you will not kill yourself It would not be worth while You ve your art to live for You are how old are you thirty You re no longer a sentimental boy You ve got your man s life to lead You must think of it I don t feel as if I could Life seems impossible She looked into his pale gentle eyes and the thought crossed her mind that his was perhaps one of those narrow gentle natures that cannot outlive such a disappointment as she intended to inflict It would be very terrible if he did commit suicide the object of his visit to Paris would transpire But no he would not commit suicide she was quite safe and on that thought she said I cannot remain out any longer VIII She stopped in the middle of the room and holding in her hand her large hat decorated with ostrich feathers she assured herself that it was not at all likely that he would commit suicide Yet men did commit suicide She did not want him to kill himself that anything so terrible should happen would grieve her very much She was quite sincere yet the thought persisted that it would be very wonderful if he did do so It would make a great scandal That a man should kill himself for her No woman had ever obtained more than that Standing in the middle of the room twirling her hat she asked herself if she really wished him to kill himself Of course not Then she thought of herself of how strange she was She was very strange she had never quite understood herself Mechanically as if in a dream she opened a bandbox and put her hat away She smoothed her soft hair before the glass Her appearance pleased her and she wondered if she were worth a man s life She was a dainty morsel no doubt so dainty that life was unendurable without her But she was wronging herself she did not wish him to kill himself Men had done so before for women If it came to the point she would do everything in her power to prevent such a thing She would do everything yes everything except marry him She couldn t settle down to watch him painting pictures She wanted to paint pictures herself Would she succeed He didn t think so but that was because he wanted her to marry him And if she didn t succeed she would have to marry him or some one else She would have to live with a man give up her whole life to him submit herself to him She must succeed Success meant so much If she succeeded she would be spoken of in the newspapers and best of all she would hear people say when she came into a room That is Mildred Lawson She didn t want to marry but she would like to have all the nicest men in love with her Meanwhile she was doing the right thing She must learn to draw and the studio was the only place she could learn But she did not want to paint large portraits with dark backgrounds She could not see herself doing things like that Chaplin was her idea She had always admired him His women were so dainty so elegant so eighteenth century wicked little women in swings as wicked as their ankles as their lovers guitars But she would have to work two or three years before any one could tell her whether she would succeed Two or three years It was a long time but a woman must do something if she wishes to attract attention to be a success A little success in art went a long way in society But Paris was so dull Elsie and Cissy were still away There was no one in the studio who interested her moreover Elsie had told her that any flirtation there might easily bring banishment to the ladies studio across the way So it was provoking that Ralph had forced her to throw him over at that particular moment She would have liked to have kept him on at least till the end of the month when Elsie and Cissy would return The break with Ralph was certainly not convenient She still felt some interest in him She would write to him IX We ve come back said Elsie We heard at the studio that you had gone away feeling ill so we came on here to find out how you were Oh it is nothing said Mildred I ve been working rather hard lately that s all You should have come with us said Cissy We ve had an awfully jolly time We ll go into the drawing room Wait a minute till I find my slippers Oh don t trouble to get up we only came to see how you were said Elsie But I m quite well there s really nothing the matter It was only that I felt I couldn t go on working this afternoon The model bored me and it was so hot It was very good of you to come and see me like this We ve had a jolly time and have done a lot of work Elsie has done a girl weaving a daisy chain in a meadow It is wonderful how she has got the sunlight on the grass All our things are in the studio you will see them to morrow I don t see why I shouldn t see them to day I ll dress myself The account they gave of their summer outing was tantalising to the tired and jaded girl She imagined the hushed and shady places the murmuring mystery of bird and insect life She could see them going forth in the mornings with their painting materials sitting at their easels under the tall trees intent on their work or lying on rugs spread in the shade the blue smoke of cigarettes curling and going out or later in the evening packing up easels and paint boxes and finding their way out of the forest It was Elsie who did most of the talking Cissy reminded her now and then of something she had forgotten and when they turned into the Passage des Panoramas Elsie was deep in an explanation of the folly of square brush work Both were converts to open brush work They had learnt it from a very clever fellow an impressionist All his shadows were violet She did not hold with his theory regarding the division of the tones at least not yet Perhaps she would come to it in time Mildred liked Elsie s lady in a white dress reading under a rhododendron tree in full blossom Cissy had painted a naked woman in the garden sunshine Mildred did not think that flesh could be so violet as that but there was a dash and go about it that she felt she would never attain It seemed to her a miracle and in her admiration for her friend s work she forgot her own failure The girls dined at a Bouillon Duval and afterwards they went to the theatre together Next morning they met all three in the studio the model was interesting Mildred caught the movement more happily than usual her friends advice had helped her But at least two years would have to pass before she would know if she had the necessary talent to succeed as an artist For that while she must endure the drudgery of the studio and the boredom of evenings alone with missus Fargus She went out with Elsie and Cissy sometimes but the men they introduced her to were not to her taste She had seen no one who interested her in Paris except perhaps M Daveau That thick set black bearded southern with his subtle southern manner had appealed to her in a way But M Daveau had been ordered suddenly to Royon for gout and rheumatism and Mildred was left without any one to exercise her attractions upon She spent evening after evening with missus Fargus until the cropped hair the spectacles above all the black satin dress with the crimson scarf getting more and more twisted became intolerable And mister Fargus cough and his vacuous conversation in which no shadow of an idea ever appeared tried her temper But she forebore seeing how anxious they were to please her That was the worst These simple kind hearted people saw that their sitting room bored Mildred and they often took her for drives in the Bois after dinner Crazed with boredom Mildred cast side long glances of hatred at missus Fargus who sat by her side a mute little figure lost in Comte mister Fargus sallow complexioned face was always opposite her he uttered commonplaces in a loud voice and Mildred longed to fling herself from the carriage At last unable to bear with reality she chattered laughed and told stories and joked until her morose friends wondered at her happiness Her friends were her audience they sufficed to stimulate the histrionic spirit in her and she felt pleased like an actor who has amused an audience which he despises She had now been in Paris seven months but she had seen little of Paris except the studio and the Bouillon Duval where she went to breakfast with Elsie and Cissy The spectacle of the Boulevards the trees and the cafes always the same had begun to weary her Her health too troubled her a little she was not very strong and she had begun to think that a change would do her good She would return to Paris in the spring she would spend next summer in Barbizon she was determined to allow nothing to interfere with her education but for the moment she felt that she must go back to Sutton Every day her craving for England grew more intolerable She craved for England for her home for its food for its associations She longed for her own room for her garden for the trap She wanted to see all the girls to hear what they thought of her absence She wanted to see Harold At first his letters had irritated her she had said that he wanted her to look after his house she had argued that a man never hesitates to put aside a woman s education if it suits his convenience But now it seemed to her that it would be unkind to leave Harold alone any longer It was manifestly her duty to go home to spend Christmas with him She was only going to Sutton for a while She loved France and would certainly return She knew now what Paris was like and when she returned it would be alone or in different company missus Fargus was very well but she could not go on living with her for ever She would come in useful another time But for the moment she could not go on living with her she had become a sort of Old Man of the Sea and the only way to rid herself of her was by returning to England An imperative instinct was drawing her back to England but another instinct equally strong said As soon as I am rested nothing shall prevent me from returning to Paris X The sea was calm and full of old fashioned brigs and barques She watched them growing small like pictures floating between a green sea and a mauve sky and then was surprised to see the white cliffs so near and the blowing woodland was welcome after the treeless French plain Harold was to meet her at Victoria and when she had answered his questions regarding the crossing and they had taken their seats in the suburban train he said You re looking a little tired you ve been over doing it Yes I ve been working pretty hard she said and the conversation paused The trap was waiting for them at the station and when they got in Mildred said I wonder what there will be for dinner I think there is boiled salmon and a roast leg of mutton Will that suit you Well said Mildred isn t that taking a somewhat sudden leap Leap where Why into England I should have thought that some sort of dish a roast chicken or a boiled chicken would have been a pas de Calais kind of dish You shall have roast chicken to morrow or would you like them boiled I don t mind said Mildred more disappointed at the failure of her joke than at the too substantial fare that awaited her Poor Harold she thought is the best of fellows but like all of them he can t see a joke The cooking I can alter but he ll always remain boiled and roast leg of mutton But though with little sense of humour Harold was not as dense as Mildred thought He saw that her spirits were forced that she was in ill health and required a long rest So he was not surprised to hear in the morning that she was too tired to come down to breakfast she had a cup of tea in her room and when she came down to the dining room she turned from the breakfast table She could touch nothing and went out of doors to see what kind of day it was The skies were grey and lowering the little avenue that led to the gate was full of dead leaves they fluttered down from the branches the lawn was soaked and the few flowers that remained were pale and worn A sense of death and desolation pervaded the damp moist air Mildred felt sorrow mounting in her throat and a sense of dread occasioned by the sudden showering of a bough caused her to burst into tears She had no strength left she felt that she was going to be ill and trembled lest she should die To die and she so young No she would live she would succeed But to do that she must take more care of her health She would eat no more bon bons she threw the box away And conquering her repugnance to butchers meat she finished a chop and drank a couple of glasses of wine for lunch The food did her good and she determined to take a long rest For a month she would do nothing but rest she would not think of painting she would not even draw on the blotting pad Rest was what she wanted and there was no better place to rest than Sutton If it weren t so dull She sighed and looked out on the wet lawn No one would call no one knew she had come home Was it wise for her to venture out and on such a day She felt that it was not and immediately after ordered the trap She went to call on some friends If they would allow her to bring Mabel back to dinner it would be nice she could show Mabel her dresses and tell her about Paris But Mabel was staying with friends in London This was very disappointing but determined to see some one Mildred went a long way in search of a girl who used to bore her dreadfully But she too was out Coming home Mildred was caught in the rain the exertion of changing her clothes had exhausted her and sitting in the warmth of the drawing room fire she grew fainter and fainter The footman brought in the lamp She got up in some vague intention of fetching a book but as she crossed the room she fell full length along the floor XI When she was able to leave her room she was ordered to the sea side After a fortnight in Brighton she went to stay with some friends in town Christmas she spent in Sutton There was a large party of Harold s friends business folk whom Mildred hated She was glad when they left and she was free to choose the room that suited her purpose best She purchased draperies and hired models and commenced a picture She commenced a second picture but that too went wrong she then tried a few studies She got on better with these but it soon became clear to her that she could not carry out her ideas until she had learned to draw Another two years of hard work in the studio were necessary But as she was not going to Paris till the spring her thoughts turned to the National Gallery and on the following week she commenced copying a head by Greuse She had barely finished sketching in the head when Miss Brand told her that Ralph was very ill and was not expected to live She laid her charcoal on the easel the movement was very slow and she lifted a frightened face What is the matter with him Do you know He caught a bad cold about a month ago he doesn t seem ever to have got over it But for a long time he has been looking worried you know the look of a man who has something on his mind A close observer might have noticed that the expression on Mildred s face changed a little He is dying for me she thought He is dying for love of me And as in a ray of sunlight she basked for a moment in a little glow of self satisfaction Then almost angrily she defended herself against herself She was not responsible for so casual a thought the greatest saint might be the victim of a wandering thought She was of course glad that he liked her but she was sorry that she had caused him suffering He must have suffered Men will sacrifice anything for their passions But no Ralph had always been nice with her she owed him a great deal they had had pleasant times together in this very gallery She could remember almost every word he said She had liked him to lean over her shoulder and correct her drawing He would never do so again Good heavens Just before Miss Brand came up to speak to her she was wondering if she should meet him in the gallery and what he would think of the Greuse He wouldn t care much about it He didn t care much about the French eighteenth century of course he admired Watteau but it was an impersonal admiration there was nothing of the Watteau Greuse Pater or Lancret in him He was purely English He took no interest in the unreal charm that that head expressed Of course no such girl had ever existed or could exist those melting eyes and the impossible innocence of that mouth It was the soul of a courtesan in the body of a virgin She was like that somewhat like that and inspired by the likeness between herself and the picture Mildred took up her charcoal and continued her drawing But she must have been thinking vaguely all the while of Ralph for suddenly her thoughts became clear and she heard the words as if they had been read to her Lots of men have killed themselves for women but to die of a broken heart proves a great deal more Few women have inspired such a love as that If it were known if she pushed the thought angrily aside as one might a piece of furniture over which one has stumbled in the dark It was shocking that thoughts should come uncalled for and such thoughts the very opposite of what she really felt That man had been very good to her she had liked him very much It was shocking that she had been the cause of his death It was too terrible But it was most improbable it was much more likely that his illness was the effect of the cold he had caught last month Men did not die of broken hearts She had nothing whatever to do with it And yet she didn t know When men like him set their hearts on a woman she was very sorry she was sorry But there was no use thinking any more about it So she locked up her paint box and left the gallery She was nervous her egotism had frightened her a little He was dying and for her yet she felt nothing Not only were her eyes dry but her heart was too A pebble with her own name written on it that was her heart She wished to feel she longed for the long ache of regret which she read of in books she yearned for tears Tears were a divine solace grief was beautiful And all along the streets she continued to woo sorrow she thought of his tenderness the real goodness of his nature his solicitude for her and she allowed her thoughts to dwell on the pleasant hours they had passed together Her heart remained unmoved but her feet led her towards saint James Park She thought she would like to see it again and when she stood on the bridge where they had so often stood when she visited the seat where they had often sat chatting under the budding trees her eyes would surely fill with tears and she would grieve for her dying lover as appropriately as any other woman But that day the park was submerged in blue mist The shadows of the island fell into the lake still as death and the birds moving through the little light that lingered on the water seemed like shadows strange and woe begone To Mildred it seemed all like death She would never again walk with him in the pretty spring mornings when light mist and faint sunlight play together and the trees shake out their foliage in the warm air How sad it all was But she did feel sorry for him she really was sorry though she wasn t overcome with grief But she had done nothing wrong In justice to herself she could not admit that she had She always knew just where to draw the line and if other girls did not so much the worse for them He had wanted to marry her but that was no reason why she should marry him She may have led him to expect that she would sooner or later but in breaking with him she had done the wisest thing She would not have made him happy she was not sure that she could make any man happy Awaking from her thoughts she reproached herself for her selfishness she was always thinking of herself and that poor fellow was dying for love of her She knew what death was she too had been ill She was quite well now but she had been ill enough to see to the edge of that narrow little slit in the ground that terrible black little slit whence Ralph was going going out of her sight for ever out of sight of the park this park which would be as beautiful as ever in another couple of months and where he had walked with her How terrible it was how awful and how cold she could not stand on the bridge any longer She shivered and said I m catching a cold For the sake of her figure she never wore quite enough clothes and she regretted her imprudence in standing so long on the misty bridge She must take care of herself for her to feel ill would serve no purpose she would not be able to see Ralph and she wanted to see him above all things As she crossed the open space in front of Buckingham Palace the desire to see him laid hold of her She must know if he were really dying She would drive straight to his studio She had been there before but then she knew no one would be there She would have to risk the chance of some one seeing her going in and coming out But no matter who saw her she must go She hailed a hansom and the discovery that she was capable of so much adventure pleased her She thought of his poor sick bed in the dark room behind the studio She had caught sight of his bedroom as she had passed through the passage She believed herself capable and willing to sit by his sick bed and nurse him She did not as a rule care for sick people but she thought she would like to nurse him The hansom turned through the Chelsea streets getting nearer and nearer to the studio She wondered who was nursing him there must be some one there The hansom stopped She got out and knocked The door was opened by a young woman who looked like a servant but Mildred was not deceived by her appearance One of his models come to nurse him she thought I have heard she said that mister Hoskin is ill Yes he is very ill I m sorry to say I should like to see him Will you inquire He s not well enough to see any one to day He has just dozed off I couldn t awake him But I ll give him any message Give him my card and say I would like to see him Stay I ll write a word upon it While Mildred wrote on the card the girl watched her her face was full of suspicion and when she read the name an involuntary Oh escaped from her and Mildred knew that Ralph had spoken of her Probably she thought she has been his mistress She wouldn t be here nursing if she hadn t been I ll give him your card There was nothing for it but to lower her eyes and murmur thank you and before she reached the end of the street her discomfort had materially increased She was humiliated and angry humiliated that that girl should have seen through her so easily angry that Ralph should have spoken about her to his mistress for she was sure that the woman was or had been his mistress She regretted having asked to see Ralph but she had asked for an appointment she could hardly get out of it now She would have to meet that woman again but she wanted to see Ralph Ralph I suppose told her the truth A moment s reflection convinced Mildred that that was probably the case and reassured she went to bed wondering when she would get a letter She might get one in the morning She was not disappointed the first letter she opened read as follows MADAM mister Hoskin begs me to thank you for your kind inquiry He is feeling a little stronger and will be glad to see you His best time is in the afternoon about three o clock Could you make it convenient to call about that time I think it right to warn you that it would be well not to speak of anything that would be likely to excite him for the doctor says that all hope of his recovery depends on his being kept quiet I am Madam yours truly ELLEN GIBBS Ellen Gibbs so that is her name thought Mildred There was a note of authority in the letter which did not escape Mildred s notice and which she easily translated into a note of animosity if not of hatred Mildred did not like meeting this woman something told her that it would be wiser not but she wanted to see Ralph and an expression of vindictiveness came into her cunning eyes If she dares to try to oppose me she ll soon find out her mistake I ll very soon settle her a common woman like that Moreover she has been his mistress I have not she will quail before me I shall have no difficulty in getting the best of her To morrow This letter was written last night so I have to go to see him to day this afternoon three o clock I shall have to go up after lunch by the two o clock train That will get me there by three I wonder if he is really dying If I were to go and see him and he were to recover it would be like beginning it over again But I don t know why every base thought and calculation enter my head I don t know why such thoughts should come into my head I don t know why they do come I don t call them nor do their promptings affect me I am going to see him because I was once very fond of him because I caused him through no fault of mine a great deal of suffering because it appears that he s dying for love of me I know he d like to see me before he dies that s why I am going and yet horrid thoughts will come into my head to hear me thinking any one would imagine it was only on account of my own vanity that I wanted to see him whereas it is quite the contrary As a rule I hate sick people and I m sure it is most disagreeable to me to meet that woman The two o clock train took her to town a hansom from Victoria to the studio she dismissed the hansom at the corner and walked up the street thinking of the woman who would open the door to her There was something about the woman she didn t like But it didn t matter she would be shown in at once and of course left alone with Ralph Supposing the woman were to sit there all the while But it was too late now she had knocked I ve come to see mister Hoskin Feeling that her speech was too abrupt she added I hope he is better to day Yes I m thankful to say he s a little better Mildred stopped in the passage and Ellen said mister Hoskin isn t in his bedroom We ve put him into the studio I hope she doesn t think that I ve been in his bedroom thought Mildred Ralph lay in a small iron bed hardly more than a foot from the floor and his large features wasted by illness seemed larger than ever But a glow appeared in his dying eyes at the sight of Mildred Ellen placed a chair by his bedside and said I will go out for a short walk I shan t be away more than half an hour Their eyes said We shall be alone for half an hour and she took the thin hand he extended to her Oh Ralph I m sorry to find you ill But you re better to day aren t you Yes I feel a little better to day It was good of you to come I came at once How did you hear I was ill We ve not written to each other for a long while I heard it in the National Miss Brand told me You know her I remember she wrote about the new pictures for an American paper Yes How familiar it sounds those dear days in the National Ralph s eyes were fixed upon her She could not bear their wistfulness and she lowered hers She told me you were ill But when did you return from France Tell me About six weeks ago I fell ill the moment I got back What was the matter I had overdone it I had overworked myself I had let myself run down The doctor said that I didn t eat enough meat You know I never did care for meat I remember When I got better I was ordered to the seaside then I went on a visit to some friends and didn t get back to Sutton till Christmas We had a lot of stupid people staying with us I couldn t do any work while they were in the house When they left I began a picture but I tried too difficult subjects and got into trouble with my drawing You said I d never succeed I often thought of what you said Well then I went to the National Nellie Brand told me you were ill that you had been ill for some time at least a month A thin smile curled Ralph s red lips and his eyes seemed to grow more wistful I ve been ill more than a month he said But no matter Nellie Brand told you and Of course I could not stay at the National I felt I must see you I didn t know how My feet turned towards saint James Park I stood on the little bridge thinking You know I was very fond of you Ralph only it was in my way and you weren t satisfied She looked at him sideways so that her bright brown eyes might have all their charm his pale eyes wistful and dying were fixed on her not intently as a few moments before but vaguely and the thought stirred in her that he might die before her eyes In that case what was she to do Are you listening she said Oh yes I m listening he answered his smile was reassuring and she said Suddenly I felt that that I must see you I felt I must know what was the matter so I took a cab and came straight here Your servant You mean Ellen I thought she was your servant she said that you were lying down and could not be disturbed She did not seem to wish me to see you or to know what was the matter I was asleep when you called yesterday but when I heard of your visit I told her to write the letter which you received this morning It was kind of you to come Kind of me to come You must think badly of me if you think I could have stayed away But now tell me Ralph what is the matter what does the doctor say Have you had the best medical advice are you in want of anything Can I do anything Pray don t hesitate You know that I was that I am very fond of you that I would do anything You have been ill a long while now what is the matter Thank you dear Things must take their course What that course is it is impossible to say I ve had excellent medical advice and Ellen takes care of me But what is your illness Nellie Brand told me that you caught a bad cold about a month ago Perhaps a specialist Yes I had a bad attack of influenza about a month or six weeks ago and I hadn t strength the doctor said to recover from it I have been in bad health for some time I ve been disappointed My painting hasn t gone very well lately That was a disappointment Disappointment I think is as often the cause of a man s death as anything else The doctors give it a name influenza or paralysis of the brain failure of the heart s action but these are the superficial causes of death There is often a deeper reason one which medical science is unable to take into account Oh Ralph you mean me Don t say that I am the cause It was not my fault If I broke my engagement it was because I knew I could not have made you happy There s no reason to be jealous it wasn t for any other man There never will be another man I was really very fond of you It wasn t my fault

none	none	it wasn t your fault It wasn t any one s fault it was the fault of luck Mildred longed for tears but her eyes remained dry and they wandered round the studio examining and wondering at the various canvases A woman who had just left her bath passed her arms into the sleeves of a long white wrapper There was something peculiarly attractive in the picture The picture said something that had not been said before and Mildred admired its naturalness But she was still more interested in the fact that the picture had been painted from the woman who had opened the door to her She sits for the figure and attends on him when he is ill she must be his mistress Since when I wonder How do you like it he asked Very much It is beautifully drawn so natural and so original How did you think of that movement That is just how a woman passes her arms into her wrapper when she get out of her bath How did you think of it I don t know She took the pose I think the movement is all right Yes it is a movement that happens every morning yet no one thought of it before How did you think of it I don t know I asked her to take some poses and it came like that I think it is good I m glad you like it It is very different from the stupid things we draw in the studio I told you that you d do no good by going to France I learnt a good deal there Every one cannot learn by themselves as you did Only genius can do that Genius A few little pictures I think I might have done something if I had got the chance I should have liked to have finished that picture It is a good beginning I never did better Dearest you will live to paint your picture I want you to finish it I want you to live for my sake I will buy that picture There s only one thing I should care to live for And that you shall have Then I ll try to live He raised himself a little in bed His eyes were fixed on her and he tried hard to believe I m afraid he said it s too late now She watched him with the eyes she knew he loved and though ashamed of the question she could not put it back and it slipped through her lips Would you sooner live for me than for that picture One never knows what one would choose he said Such speculations are always vain and never were they vainer than now But I m glad you like that movement It doesn t matter even if I never finish it I don t think it looks bad in its present state does it It is a sketch one of those things that could not be finished I recognise the model She sat for it didn t she Yes You seem very intimate She seems very devoted She has been very good to me Don t say anything against her I ve nothing to conceal Mildred It is an old story It began long before I knew you And continued while you knew me Yes And you never told me Oh Ralph while you were telling me you loved me you were living with this woman It happened so Things don t come out as straight or as nice as we d like them to that s the way things come out in life a bit crooked tangled cracked I only know that I loved you I couldn t have done otherwise That s the way things happened to come out There s no other explanation And if I had consented to marry you you d have put her away Mildred don t scold me Things happened that way Mildred did not answer and Ralph said What are you thinking of Of the cruelty of the wretchedness of it all Why look at that side of it If I did wrong I ve been punished She knows all She has forgiven me You can do as much Forgive me kiss me I ve never kissed you I cannot kiss you now I hear her coming Wipe those tears away The doctor said that you were to be kept quiet Shall I see you again I don t think I can come again She ll be here Mildred What difference can it make We shall see The door opened Ellen came in and Mildred got up to go I hope you ve enjoyed your walk Miss Gibbs Yes thank you I haven t been out for some days Nursing is very fatiguing Good bye mister Hoskin I hope I shall soon hear that you re better Perhaps Miss Gibbs will write Yes I ll write but I m afraid mister Hoskin has been talking too much Let me open the door for you XII When she got home she went to her room She took off her dress and put on an old wrapper and then lay on the floor and cried She could not cry in a pair of stays To abandon herself wholly to grief she must have her figure free And all that evening she hardly spoke she lay back in her chair her soul lost in one of her most miserable of moods Harold spoke a few words from time to time so that she should not perceive that he was aware of her depression Her novel lay on her knees unread and she sat her eyes fixed staring into the heart of life She had never seen so far into life before she was looking into the heart of life which is death He was about to die he had loved her even unto death he had loved her even while he was living with another woman As she sat thinking her novel on her knees she could see that other woman sitting by his death bed Two candles were burning in the vast studio and by their dim light she saw the shadow of the profile on the pillow She thought of him as a man yearning for an ideal which he could never attain and dying of his yearning in the end And that so beautiful and so holy an aspiration should proceed from the common concubinage of a studio Suddenly she decided that Ralph was not worthy of her Her instinct had told her from the first that something was wrong She had never known why she had refused him Now she knew But in the morning she was as she put it herself better able to see things from a man s point of view and she found some excuses for Ralph s life This connection had been contracted long ago Ralph had had to earn his living since he was sixteen he had never been in society he had never known nice women the only women he had known were his models what was he to do A lonely life in a studio his meals brought in from the public house no society but those women She could understand Nevertheless it was a miserable thing to think that all the time he had been making love to her he had been living with that woman He used to leave her to come to meet me in the park This was a great bitterness She thought that she hated him But hatred was inconsistent with her present mood and she reflected that after all Ralph was dying for love of her that was a fact and behind that fact it were not wise to look No man could do more than die for the woman he loved no man could prove his love more completely But it was so sad to think he was dying Could nothing be done to save him Would he recover if she were to promise to be his wife She need not carry out her promise she didn t know if she could But if a promise would cure him she would promise She would go as far as that But for what good To get him well so that he might continue living with that woman If he hadn t confessed if she hadn t known of this shameful connection if it hadn t been dragged under her eyes Ralph might have spared her that If he had spared her that she felt that she could promise to be his wife and perhaps to keep her promise for in the end she supposed she would have to marry some one She didn t see how she was going to escape Yes if he had not told her or better still if he had not proved himself unworthy of her she felt she would have been capable of the sacrifice She had been to see him She knew that she ought not to have gone Her instinct had told her not to go But she had conquered her feeling If she had known that she was going to meet that woman she would not have gone Whenever we allow ourselves to be led by our better feelings we come to grief That woman hated her she knew she did She could see it in her look She wouldn t put herself in such a false position again A moment after she was considering if she should go to Ellen and propose that she Mildred should offer to marry Ralph but not seriously only just to help him to get well If the plan succeeded she would persuade Ralph that his duty was to marry Ellen And intoxicated with her own altruism Mildred s thoughts passed on and she imagined a dozen different dramas in every one of which she appeared in the character of a heroine Mildred what is the matter Nothing dear I ve only forgotten my pocket handkerchief How irritating were Harold s stupid interruptions She had to ask him if he would take another cup of tea He said that he thought he would just have time He had still five minutes She poured out the tea thinking all the while of the sick man lying on his poor narrow bed in the corner of the great studio It was shameful that he should die tears rose to her eyes and she had to walk across the room to hide them It was a pitiful story He was dying for her and she wasn t worth it She hadn t much heart she knew it perhaps one of these days she would meet some one who would make her feel She hoped so she wanted to feel She wanted to love if her brother were to die to morrow she didn t believe she would really care It was terrible if people only knew what she was like they would look the other way when she passed down the street But no all this was morbid nonsense she was overwrought and nervous and that proved that she had a heart Perhaps too much heart In the next few days Ralph died a hundred times and had been rescued from death at least a dozen times by Mildred she had watched by his bedside she had even visited his grave And at the end of each dream came the question Would he live would he die At last unable to bear the suspense any longer she went to the National Gallery to obtain news of him But Miss Brand had little news of him She was leaving the gallery and the two girls went for a little walk Mildred was glad of company anything to save her from thinking of Ralph and she laughed and talked with Nellie on the bridge in saint James Park until she began to feel that the girl must think her very heartless How pale and ill you re looking Mildred Am I I feel all right Nellie s remark delighted Mildred Then I have a heart she thought I m not so unfeeling as I thought The girls separated at Buckingham Palace Mildred walked a little way and then suddenly called a hansom and told the man to drive to Chelsea But he had not driven far before thoughts of the woman he was living with obtruded upon her pity and she decided that it would be unwise for her to venture on a second visit The emotion of seeing her again might make him worse might kill him So she poked her parasol through the trap and told the cabby to drive to Victoria Station There she bought some violets she kept a little bunch for herself and sent him a large bouquet They ll look nice in the studio she said I think that will be best Two days after she received a letter from Ellen Gibbs MADAM It is my sad duty to inform you that mister Ralph Hoskin died this afternoon at two o clock He begged me to write and thank you for the violets you sent him and he expressed a hope that you would come and see him when he was dead The funeral will take place on Monday If you come here to morrow you will see him before he is put into his coffin I am yours truly ELLEN GIBBS The desire to see her dead lover was an instinct and the journey from Sutton to Chelsea was unperceived by her and she did not recover from the febrile obedience her desire imposed until Ellen opened the studio door I received a letter from you Yes I know come in Mildred hated the plain middle class appearance and dress of this girl She hated the tone of her voice She walked straight into the studio There was a sensation of judgment in the white profile cold calm severe and Mildred drew back affrighted But she recovered a little when she saw that her violets lay under the dead hand He thought of me to the end I forgive him everything As she stood watching the dead man she could hear Ellen moving in the passage She did not know what Ellen knew of her relations with Ralph But there could be no doubt that Ellen was aware that they were of an intimate nature She hoped hurriedly that Ellen did not suspect her of being Ralph s mistress and listened again wondering if Ellen would come into the studio Or would she have the tact to leave her alone with the dead If she did come in it would be rather awkward She did not wish to appear heartless before Ellen but tears might lead Ellen to suspect As Mildred knelt down Ellen entered Mildred turned round Don t let me disturb you said Ellen when you have finished Will you not say a prayer with me I have said my prayers Our prayers would not mingle What does she mean thought Mildred She buried her face in her hands and asked herself what Ellen meant Our prayers would not mingle Why Because I m a pure woman and she isn t I wonder if she meant that I hope she does not intend any violence I must say nothing to annoy her Her heart throbbed with fear her knees trembled she thought she would faint Then it occurred to her that it would be a good idea to faint Ellen would have to carry her into the street and in the street she would be safe And resolved to faint on the slightest provocation she rose from her knees and stood facing the other woman whom she noticed with some farther alarm stood between her and the door If she could get out of this difficulty she never would place herself in such a position again Mildred tried to speak but words stuck fast in her throat and it was some time before her terror allowed her to notice that the expression on Ellen s face was not one of anger but of resignation She was safe She has pretty eyes thought Mildred a weak nervous creature I can do with her what I like If she thinks that she can get the better of me I ll very soon show her that she is mistaken Of course if it came to violence I could do nothing but scream I m not strong Then Mildred said in a firm voice I m much obliged to you for your letter This is very sad I ll send some more flowers for the coffin Good morning But a light came into Ellen s eyes which Mildred did not like Well she said I hope you re satisfied He died thinking of you I hope you re satisfied mister Hoskin and I were intimate friends It is only natural that he should think of me We were happy until you came you ve made dust and ashes of my life Why did you take the trouble to do this You were not in love with him and I did you no injury I didn t know of your existence till the other day I heard that That I was his mistress Well so I was It appears that you were not But I should like to know which of us two is the most virtuous which has done the least harm I made him happy you killed him This is madness No it is not madness I know all about you Ralph told me everything It surprises me very much that he should have spoken about me It was not like him I hope that he didn t tell you that he didn t suggest that there were any improper relations between me and him I daresay that you were virtuous more or less as far as your own body is concerned Faugh Women like you make virtue seem odious I cannot discuss such questions with you Mildred said timidly and swinging her parasol vaguely she tried to pass Ellen by But it was difficult to get by The picture she had admired the other day blocked the way Mildred s eyes glanced at it vindictively Yes said Ellen in her sad doleful voice You can look at it I sat for it I m not ashamed and perhaps I did more good by sitting for it than you ll do with your painting But look at him there he lies He might have been a great artist if he had not met you and I should have been a happy woman Now I ve nothing to live for You said that you didn t know of my existence till the other day But you knew that in making that man love you you were robbing another woman That is very subtle You knew that you did not love him and that it could end only in unhappiness It has ended in death Mildred looked at the cold face so claylike and trembled The horror of the situation crept over her she had no strength to go and listened meekly to Ellen He smiled a little it was a little sad smile when he told me that I was to write saying that he would be glad if you would come to see him when he was dead I think I know what was passing in his mind he hoped that his death might be a warning to you Not many men die of broken hearts but one never knows One did Look at him take your lesson I assure you that we were merely friends He liked me I know he loved me if you will I could not help that Mildred drew on the floor of the studio with her parasol I am very sorry it is most unfortunate I did nothing wrong I m sure he never suggested How that one idea does run in your head I wonder if your thoughts are equally chaste Mildred did not answer I read you in the first glance one glance was enough your eyes tell the tale of your cunning mean little soul Perhaps you sometimes try to resist maybe your nature turns naturally to evil There are people like that If I had done what you seem to think I ought to have done he would have abandoned you And Mildred looked at her rival triumphantly That would have been better than what has happened Then there would have been only one heart broken now there are two Mildred hated the woman for the humiliation she was imposing upon her but in her heart she could not but feel admiration for such single heartedness Noticing on Mildred s face the change of expression but misinterpreting it Ellen said I can read you through and through You have wrecked two lives Oh that any one should be so wicked that any one should delight in wickedness I cannot understand You are accusing me wrongly But let me go It is not likely that we shall arrive at any understanding Go then you came to gloat you have gloated go Ellen threw herself on a chair by the bedside Her head fell on her hands Mildred whisked her black crape dress out of the studio XIII It was not until the spring was far advanced that the nostalgia of the boulevards began to creep into her life Then without intermission the desire to get away grew more persistent at last she could think of nothing else Harold oppressed her But missus Fargus was not in France she could not live alone But why could she not live alone Although she asked herself this question Mildred felt that she could not live alone in Paris But she must go to Paris but with whom Not with Elsie or Cissy they both had studios in London Moreover they were not quite the girls she would like to live with they were very well as studio friends Mildred thought she might hire a chaperon that would be very expensive And for the solution of her difficulty Mildred sought in vain until one day in the National Gallery Miss Brand suggested that they should go to Paris together Miss Brand had told Mildred how she had begun life as a musician When she was thirteen she had followed Rubenstein from London to Birmingham from Birmingham to Manchester and then to Liverpool Her parents did not know what had become of her Afterwards she studied counterpoint and harmony with Rubenstein in saint Petersburg and also with Von Bulow in Leipsic But she had given up music for journalism Her specialty was musical criticism to which having been thrown a good deal with artists she had added art criticism Mildred could help her with her art criticism She thought they d get on very well together She would willingly share the expenses of a little flat Mildred was fascinated by the project if she could possibly get Harold to agree He must agree He would raise many objections But that did not matter she was determined And at the end of the month Mildred and Miss Brand left for Paris They had decided that for fifteen hundred or two thousand francs a year they could find an apartment that would suit them five or six rooms within easy reach of the studio and leaning back in their cab discussing the advantages or the disadvantages of the apartment they had seen they grew conscious of their intimacy and Mildred rejoiced in the freedom of her life Their only trouble was the furnishing Mildred did not like to ask Harold for any more money and credit was difficult to obtain But even this difficulty was surmounted and they found an upholsterer who agreed to furnish the apartment they had taken in the Rue Hauteville for five thousand francs payable in monthly instalments To have to pay five hundred francs every month would keep them very short of money for the first year but that could not be helped They would get on somehow and the first dinner in the half furnished dining room with the white porcelain stove in the corner seemed to them the most delicious they had ever tasted Josephine their servant was certainly an excellent cook and so obliging they could find no fault with her But the upholsterer was dilatory and days elapsed before he brought the chairs that were to match the sofa nearly every piece of drapery was hung separately and they had given up hope of the etageres and girondoles For a long while a grand piano was their principal piece of furniture Though she never touched it Miss Brand could not live without a grand piano What s the use she d say I ve only to open the score to remember to hear Rubenstein play the passage When they were tout a fait bien installees they had friends to dinner and they were especially proud of M Daveau s company Mildred liked this large stout man There was something strangely winning in his manner a mystery seemed to surround him and it was impossible not to wish to penetrate this mystery Besides was he not their master the lord of the studio Though a large fat man none was more illusive more difficult to realise harder to get on terms of intimacy with These were temptations which appealed to Mildred and she had determined on his subduction But the wily Southerner had read her through Those little brown eyes of his had searched the bottom of her soul and with pleasant smiles and engaging courtesies he had answered all her coquetries But the difficulty of conquest only whetted her appetite for victory and she might even have pursued her quest with ridiculous attentions if accident had not made known to her the fact that M Daveau was not only the lover of another lady in the studio but that he loved her to the perfect exclusion of every other woman Mildred s face darkened between the eyes a black little cloud of hatred appeared and settled there She invented strange stories about M Daveau and it surprised her that M Daveau took no notice of her calumnies She desired above all things to annoy the large mysterious Southerner who had resisted her attractions who had preferred another and who now seemed indifferent to anything she might say about him But M Daveau was only biding his time and when Mildred came to renew her subscription to the studio he told her that he was very sorry but that he could not accept her any longer as a pupil Mildred asked for a reason M Daveau smiled sweetly enigmatically and answered that he wished to reduce the number of ladies in his studio There were too many Expulsion from the studio made shipwreck of her life in Paris There was no room in the flat in which she could paint She had spent all her money and could not afford to hire a studio She took lessons in French and music and began a novel and when she wearied of her novel she joined another studio a ladies class But Mildred did not like women the admiration of men was the breath of her nostrils With a difference men were her life as much as they were Elsie s She pined in this new studio it grew hateful to her and she spoke of returning to England But Miss Brand said that one of these days she would meet M Daveau that he would apologise if he had offended her and that all would be made right For Mildred had given Miss Brand to understand that M Daveau had made love to her then she said that he had tried to kiss her and that it would be unpleasant for her to meet him again And her story had been accepted as the true one by the American and English girls the other students had assumed that Miss Lawson had given up painting or had taken a holiday So she had got herself out of her difficulty very cleverly And she listened complacently to Miss Brand s advice There was something in what Nellie said If she were to meet M Daveau she felt that she could talk him over But she did not know if she could bring herself to try after 
6497_234100_000020_000004	train-clean-360	what had happened 
none	none	She hated him and the desire as she put it to get even with him often rose up in her heart At last she caught sight of him in the Louvre He was looking at a picture on the other side of the gallery and she crossed over so that he should see her He bowed and was about to pass on but Mildred insisted and responding to the question why he had refused her subscription he said I think I told you at the time that I found myself obliged to reduce the number of pupils But tell me are you copying here One doesn t learn anything from copying Won t you allow me to come back I don t see how I can There are so many ladies at present in the studio I hear that some have left Madlle Berge has left hasn t she Yes she has left If Madlle Berge has left there is no reason why I should not return M Daveau did not answer he smiled satirically and bade her good bye Mildred hated him more than ever but when a subscription was started by the pupils to present him with a testimonial she did not neglect to subscribe The presentation took place in the studio I think this is an occasion to forget our differences he said when he had finished his speech If you wish to return you ll find my studio open to you And to show that he wished to let bygones be bygones he often came and helped her with her drawing he seemed to take an interest in her and she tried to lead him on But one day she discovered that she could not deceive him and again she began to hate him but remembering the price of her past indiscretions she refrained and the matter was forgotten in another of more importance Miss Brand suddenly fell out of health and was obliged to return to England Then the little flat became too expensive for Mildred she let it and went to live in a boarding house on the other side of the water where Cissy was staying But at the end of the first quarter Mildred thought the neighbourhood did not suit her and she went to live near saint Augustine She remained there till the autumn till Elsie came over and then she went to Elsie s boarding house Elsie returned to England in the spring and Mildred wandered from boarding house to boarding house She took a studio and spent a good deal of money on models frames and costumes But nothing she did satisfied her and after various failures she returned to Daveau s convinced that she must improve her drawing She was moreover determined to put her talent to the test of severe study She got to the studio every morning at eight she worked there till five As she did not know how to employ her evenings she took M Daveau s advice and joined his night class For three months she bore the strain of these long days easily but the fourth month pressed heavily upon her and in the fifth month she was a mere mechanism She counted the number of heads more correctly than she used to she was more familiar with the proportions of the human figure Alas her drawing was no better It was blacker harder less alive And to drag her weariness all the way along the boulevards seemed impossible That foul smelling studio repelled her from afar the prospect of the eternal model a man with his hand on his hip a woman leaning one hand on a stool frightened her and her blackened drawing that would not move out of its insipid ugliness tempted her no more with false hopes Mildred paused in her dressing it seemed that she could not get her clothes on She had to sit down to rest Tears welled up into her eyes and in the midst of much mental and physical weakness the maid knocked at her door and handed her a letter It was from Elsie DEAREST MILDRED Here we are again in Barbizon painting in the day and dancing in the evening There are a nice lot of fellows here one or two very clever ones I have already picked up a lot of hints How we did waste our time in that studio Square brush work drawing by the masses what rot I suppose you have abandoned it all long ago Cissy is here she has thrown over Hopwood Blunt for good and all She is at present much interested in a division of the tones man A clever fellow but not nearly so good looking as mine The inn stands in a large garden and we dine and walk after dinner under the trees and watch the stars come out There s a fellow here who might interest you his painting would even if he failed to respond to the gentle Platonism of your flirtations The forest too would interest you It is an immense joy I m sure you want change of air Life here is very cheap only five francs room and meals breakfast and dinner everything included except coffee Mildred rejoiced in the prospect of escape from the studio and her life quickened at the thought of the inn with its young men its new ideas the friends the open air and the great forest that Elsie described as an immense joy There was no reason why she should not go at once that very day And the knowledge that she could thus peremptorily decide her life was in itself a pleasure which she would not have dispensed with There were difficulties in the way of clothes she wanted some summer dresses It would be difficult to get all she wanted before four o clock She would have to get the things ready made others she could have sent after her Muslins trimmings hats stockings shoes and sunshades occupied Mildred all the morning and she only just got to the Gare de Lyons in time to catch the four o clock train Elsie s letter gave explicit directions she was not to go to Fontainebleau she was to book to Melun that was the nearest station there she would find an omnibus waiting which would take her to Barbizon or if she did not mind the expense she could take a fly which would be pleasanter and quicker XIV A formal avenue of trim trees led out of the town of Melun But these were soon exchanged for rough forest growths and out of cabbage and corn lands the irruptive forest broke into islands and the plain was girdled with a dark green belt of distant forest She lay back in the fly tasting in the pure air the keen joy of returning health and she thrilled a little at the delight of an expensive white muslin and a black sash which accentuated the smallness of her waist She liked her little brown shoes and brown stockings and the white sunshade through whose strained silk the red sun showed At the cross roads she noticed a still more formal avenue trees planted in single line and curving like a regiment of soldiers marching across country The whitewashed stead and the lonely peasant scratching like an insect in the long tilth were painful impressions She missed the familiar hedgerows which make England like a garden and she noticed that there were trees everywhere except about the dwellings and that there were neither hollybush or sunflowers in the white village they rolled through a gaunt white village which was not Barbizon The driver mentioned the name but Mildred did not heed him She looked from the blank white walls to her prettily posed feet and heard him say that Barbizon was still a mile away It lay at the end of the plain and when the carriage entered the long street it rocked over huge stones so that Mildred was nearly thrown out She called to the driver to go slower he smiled and pointing with his whip said that the hotel that Mademoiselle wanted was at the end of the village on the verge of the forest A few moments after the carriage drew up before an iron gateway and Mildred saw a small house at the bottom of a small garden There was a pavilion on the left and a numerous company were dining beneath the branches of a cedar Elsie and Cissy got up and dropping their napkins ran to meet their friend She was led in triumph to the table and all through dinner she had a rough impression of English girls in cheap linen dresses and of men in rough suits and flowing neck ties She was given some soup and when the plate of veal had been handed round and Elsie and Cissy had exhausted their first store of questions she was introduced to Morton Mitchell His singularly small head was higher by some inches than any other bright eyes and white teeth showing through a red moustache and a note of defiance in his open hearted voice made him attractive Mildred was also introduced to Rose Turner the girl who sat next him a weak girl with pretty eyes Rose already looked at Mildred as if she anticipated rivalry and was clearly jealous of every word that Morton did not address to her Mildred looked at him again He was better dressed than the others and an air of success in his face made him seem younger than he was He leaned across the table and Mildred liked his brusque but withal well bred manner She wondered what his pictures were like At Daveau s only the names of the principal exhibitors at the Salon were known and he had told her that he had not sent there for the last three years He didn t care to send to the vulgar place more than he could help Mildred noticed that all listened to Morton and she was sorry to leave the table so interesting was his conversation But Elsie and Cissy wanted to talk to her and they marched about the grass plot their arms about each other s waists and while questioning Mildred about herself and telling her about themselves they frequently looked whither their lovers sat smoking Sometimes Mildred felt them press her along the walk which passed by the dining table But for half an hour their attractions were arrayed vainly against those of cigarettes and petits verres Rose was the only woman who remained at table She hung over her lover desirous that he should listen to her Mildred thought What a fool We shall see presently The moment the young men got up Cissy and Elsie forgot Mildred An angry expression came upon her face and she went into the house The walls had been painted all over landscapes still life nude figures rustic and elegiac subjects Every artist had painted something in memory of his visit and Mildred sought vaguely for what mister Mitchell had painted Then remembering that he had chosen to walk about with the Turner girl she abandoned her search and leaning on the window sill watched the light fading in the garden She could hear the frogs in a distant pond and thought of the night in the forest amid millions of trees and stars Suddenly she heard some one behind her say Do you like being alone It was Morton I m so used to being alone Use is a second nature I will not interrupt your solitude But sometimes one gets tired of solitude Would you like to share your solitude You can have half of mine I m sure it is very kind of you but It was on Mildred s tongue to ask him what he had done with Rose Turner She said instead and where does your solitude hang out Chiefly in the forest Shall we go there Is it far I don t know where the others have gone They re in the forest we walk there every evening we shall meet them How far is the forest At our door We re in the forest Come and see There is the forest he said pointing to a long avenue How bright the moonlight is one can read by this light And how wonderfully the shadows of the tall trunks fall across the white road How unreal how phantasmal is that grey avenue shimmering in the moonlight Yes isn t the forest ghostlike And isn t that picturesque he said pointing to a booth that had been set up by the wayside On a tiny stage a foot or so from the ground by the light of a lantern and a few candle ends a man and a woman were acting some rude improvisation Morton and Mildred stayed but neither was in the mood to listen They contributed a trifle each to these poor mummers of the lane s end and it seemed that their charity had advanced them in their intimacy Without hesitation they left the road taking a sandy path which led through some rocks Mildred s feet sank in the loose sand and very soon it seemed to her that they had left Barbizon far behind For the great grey rocks and the dismantled tree trunk which they had suddenly come upon frightened her and she could hardly bear with the ghostly appearance the forest took in the stream of glittering light which flowed down from the moon She wished to turn back But Morton said that they would meet the others beyond the hill and she followed him through great rocks filled with strange shadows The pines stood round the hill top making it seem like a shrine a round yellow moon looked through there was the awe of death in the lurid silence and so clear was the sky that the points of the needles could be seen upon it We must go back she said If you like But at that moment voices were heard coming over the brow of the hill You see I did not deceive you There are your friends I knew we should meet them That is Miss Laurence s voice one can always recognise it Then let us go to them If you like But we can talk better here Let me find you a place to sit down Before Mildred could answer Elsie cried across the glade So there you are What do you think of the forest shouted Cissy Wonderful replied Mildred Well we won t disturb you we shall be back presently And like ghosts they passed into the shadow and mystery of the trees So you work in the men s studio Does that shock you No nothing shocks me In the studio a woman puts off her sex There s no sex in art I quite agree with you There s no sex in art and a woman would be very foolish to let anything stand between her and her art I m glad you think that I ve made great sacrifices for painting What sacrifices I ll tell you one of these days when I know you better Will you The conversation paused a moment and Mildred said How wonderful it is here Those pines that sky one hears the silence it enters into one s very bones It is a pity one cannot paint silence Millet painted silence The Angelus is full of silence the air trembles with silence and sunset But the silence of the moonlight is more awful it really is very awful I m afraid Afraid of what there s nothing to be afraid of You asked me just now if I believed in Daveau s I didn t like to say I had only just been introduced to you but it seems to me that I know you better now Daveau s is a curse It is the sterilisation of art You must give up Daveau s and come and work here I m afraid it would make no difference Elsie and Cissy have spent years here and what they do does not amount to much They wander from method to method abandoning each in turn I am utterly discouraged and made up my mind to give up painting What are you going to do I don t know One of these days I shall find out my true vocation You re young you are beautiful No I m not beautiful but there are times when I look nice Yes indeed there are Those hands how white they are in the moonlight He took her hands Why do you trouble and rack your soul about painting A woman s hands are too beautiful for a palette and brushes The words were on her tongue to ask him if he did not admire Rose s hands equally but remembering the place the hour and the fact of her having made his acquaintance only a few hours before she thought it more becoming to withdraw her hands and to say The others do not seem to be coming back We had better return They moved out of the shadows of the pines and stood looking down the sandy pathway How filmy and grey those top branches did you ever see anything so delicate I never saw anything like this before This is primeval I used to walk a good deal with a friend of mine in saint James Park The park where the ducks are and a little bridge Your friend was not an artist Yes he was and a very clever artist too Then he admired the park because you were with him Perhaps that had something to do with it But the park is very beautiful I don t think I care much about cultivated nature Don t you like a garden Yes a disordered garden a garden that has been let run wild They walked down the sandy pathway and came unexpectedly upon Elsie and her lover sitting behind a rock They asked where the others were Elsie did not know But at that moment voices were heard and Cissy cried from the bottom of the glade So there you are we ve been looking for you Looking for us indeed said Mildred Now Mildred don t be prudish this is Liberty Hall You must lend us mister Mitchell we want to dance What here in the sand No in the Salon Come along Rose will play for us XV Mildred was the first down She wore a pretty robe a fleurs and her straw hat was trimmed with tremulous grasses and cornflowers A faint sunshine floated in the wet garden A moment after Elsie cried from the door step Well you have got yourself up We don t run to anything like that here You re going out flirting It s easy to see that My flirtations don t amount to much Kisses don t thrill me as they do you I m afraid I ve never been what you call in love You seem on the way there if I m to judge by last night Elsie answered rather tartly You know Mildred I don t believe all you say not quite all A pained and perplexed expression came upon Mildred s face and she said Perhaps I shall meet a man one of these days who will inspire passion in me I hope so It would be a relief to all of us I wouldn t mind subscribing to present that man with a testimonial Mildred laughed I often wonder what will become of me I ve changed a good deal in the last two years I ve had a great deal of trouble I m sorry you re so depressed I know what it is That wretched painting we give ourselves to it heart and soul and it deceives us as you deceive your lovers So it does I had not thought of it like that Yes I ve been deceived just as I have deceived others But you Elsie you ve not been deceived you can do something If I could do what you do You had a picture in the Salon Cissy had a picture in the Salon That doesn t mean much What we do doesn t amount to much But do you think that I shall ever do as much Elsie did not think so and the doubt caused her to hesitate Mildred perceived the hesitation and said Oh there s no necessity for you to lie I know the truth well enough I have resolved to give up painting I have given it up You ve given up painting Do you really mean it Yes I feel that I must When I got your letter I was nearly dead with weariness and disappointment what a relief your letter was what a relief to be here Well you see something has happened Barbizon has happened Morton has happened I wonder if anything will come of it He s a nice fellow I like him You re not the first All the women are crazy about him He was the lover of Merac the actress of the Francais They say she could only play Phedre when he was in the stage box He always produced that effect upon her Then he was the lover of the Marquise de la de la Per I can t remember the name Is he in love with any one now No we thought he was going to marry Rose That little thing Well he seemed devoted to her He seemed inclined to settle down Did he ever flirt with you No he s not my style I know what that means thought Mildred The conversation paused and then Elsie said It really is a shame to upset him with Rose unless you mean to marry him Even the impressionists admit that he has talent He belongs to the old school it is true but his work is interesting all the same The English and American girls were dressed like Elsie and Cissy in cheap linen dresses one of the French artists was living with a cocotte She was dressed more elaborately somewhat like Mildred Elsie remarked and the girls laughed and sat down to their bowls of coffee Morton and Elsie s young man were almost the last to arrive Swinging their paint boxes they came forward talking gaily Yours is the best looking said Elsie Perhaps you d like to get him from me No I never do that What about Rose Mildred bit her lips and Elsie couldn t help thinking How cruel she is she likes to make that poor little thing miserable It s only vanity for I don t suppose she cares for Morton Those who were painting in the adjoining fields and forest said they would be back to the second breakfast at noon those who were going further and whose convenience it did not suit to return took sandwiches with them Morton was talking to Rose but Mildred soon got his attention You re going to paint in the forest she said I wonder what your picture is like you haven t shown it to me It s all packed up But aren t you going into the forest If you re going with Miss Laurence and Miss Clive you might come with me You d better take your painting materials you ll find the time hang heavily if you don t Oh no the very thought of painting bores me Very well then If you are ready we might make a start mine is a mid day effect I hope you re a good walker But you ll never be able to get along in those shoes and that dress that s no dress for the forest You ve dressed as if for a garden party It is only a little robe a fleurs there s nothing to spoil and as for my shoes you ll see I shall get along all right unless it is very far It is more than a mile I shall have to take you down to the local cobbler and get you measured I never saw such feet He was oddly matter of fact There was something naive and childish about him and he amused and interested Mildred With whom she said do you go out painting when I m not here Every Jack seems to have his own Jill in Barbizon And don t they everywhere else It would be damned dull without Do you think it would Have you always got a Jill I ve been down in my luck lately Mildred laughed Which of the women here has the most talent Perhaps Miss Laurence But Miss Clive does a nice thing occasionally What do you think of Miss Turner s work It s pretty good She has talent She had two pictures in the Salon last year Mildred bit her lips Have you ever been out with her Yes but why do you ask Because I think she likes you She looked very miserable when she heard that we were going out together Just as if she were going to cry If I thought I was making another person unhappy I would sooner give you give up the pleasure of going out with you And what about me Don t I count for anything I must not do a direct wrong to another Each of us has a path to walk in and if we deviate from our path we bring unhappiness upon ourselves and upon others Morton stopped and looked at her his stolid childish stare made her laugh and it made her like him I wonder if I am selfish said Mildred reflectively Sometimes I think I am sometimes I think I am not I ve suffered so much my life has been all suffering There s no heart left in me for anything I wonder what will become of me I often think I shall commit suicide Or I might go into a convent You d much better commit suicide than go into a convent Those poor devils of nuns as if there wasn t enough misery in this world We are certain of the misery and if we give up the pleasures I should like to know where we are Each had been so interested in the other that they had seen nothing else But now the road led through an open space where every tree was torn and broken Mildred stopped to wonder at the splintered trunks and out of the charred spectre of a great oak crows flew and settled among the rocks in the fissures of a rocky hill But you re not going to ask me to climb those rocks said Mildred There are miles and miles of rocks It is like a landscape by Salvator Rosa Climb that hill you couldn t I ll wait until our cobbler has made you a pair of boots But isn t that desolate region of blasted oaks and sundered rocks wonderful You find everything in the forest In a few minutes I shall show you some lovely underwood And they had walked a very little way when he stopped and said Don t you call that beautiful and leaning against the same tree Morton and Mildred looked into the dreamy depth of a summer wood The trunks of the young elms rose straight and through the pale leafage the sunlight quivered full of the impulse of the morning The ground was thick with grass and young shoots Something ran through the grass paused and then ran again What is that Mildred asked A squirrel I think yes he s going up that tree How pretty he is his paws set against the bark Come this way and we shall see him better But they caught no further sight of the squirrel and Morton asked Mildred the time A quarter past ten she said glancing at the tiny watch which she wore in a bracelet Then we must be moving on I ought to be at work at half past One can t work more than a couple of hours in this light They passed out of the wood and crossed an open space where rough grass grew in patches Mildred opened her parasol You asked me just now if I ever went to England Do you intend to go back or do you intend to live in France That s my difficulty So long as I was painting there was a reason for my remaining in France now that I ve given it up But you ve not given it up Yes I have If I don t find something else to do I suppose I must go back That s what I dread We live in Sutton But that conveys no idea to your mind Sutton is a little town in Surrey It was very nice once but now it is little better than a London suburb My brother is a distiller He goes to town every day by the ten minutes past nine and he returns by the six o clock I ve heard of nothing but those two trains all my life We have ten acres of ground gardens greenhouses and a number of servants Then there s the cart I go out for drives in the cart We have tennis parties the neighbours you know and I shall have to choose whether I shall look after my brother s house or marry and look after my husband s It must be very lonely in Sutton Yes it is very lonely There are a number of people about but I ve no friends that I care about There s missus Fargus Who s missus Fargus Oh you should see missus Fargus she reads Comte and has worn the same dinner dress ever since I knew her a black satin with a crimson scarf Her husband suffers from asthma and speaks of his wife as a very clever woman He wears an eyeglass and she wears spectacles Does that give you an idea of my friends I should think it did What damned bores they must be He bores me she doesn t I owe a good deal to missus Fargus If it hadn t been for her I shouldn t be here now What do you mean They again passed out of the sunlight into the green shade of some beech trees Mildred closed her parasol and swaying it to and fro amid the ferns she continued in a low laughing voice her tale of missus Fargus and the influence that this lady had exercised upon her Her words floated along a current of quiet humour cadenced by the gentle swaying of her parasol and brought into relief by a certain intentness of manner which was peculiar to her And gradually Morton became more and more conscious of her the charm of her voice stole upon him and once he lingered allowing her to get a few yards in front so that he might notice the quiet figure a little demure and intensely itself in a yellow gown When he first saw her she had seemed to him a little sedate even a little dowdy and when she had spoken of her intention to abandon painting although her manner was far from cheerless he had feared a bore He now perceived that this she at least was not moreover her determination to paint no more announced an excellent sense of the realities of things in which the other women the Elsies and the Cissys seemed to him to be strangely deficient And when he set up his easel her appreciation of his work helped him to further appreciation of her He had spread the rug for her in a shady place but for the present she preferred to stand behind him her parasol slanted slightly talking he thought very well of the art of the great men who had made Barbizon rememberable And the light tone of banter in which she now admitted her failure seemed to Morton to be just the tone which she should adopt and her ridicule of the impressionists and above all of the dottists amused him I don t know why they come here at all he said unless it be to prove to themselves that nature falls far short of their pictures I wonder why they come here They could paint their gummy tapestry stuff anywhere I can imagine your asking them what they thought of Corot Their faces would assume a puzzled expression I can see them scratching their heads reflectively at last one of them would say Yes there is Chose who lives behind the Odeon he admires Corot Pas de blague he really does Then all the others in chorus he really does admire Corot we ll bring him to see you next Tuesday Morton laughed loudly Mildred laughed quietly and there was an intense intimacy of enjoyment in her laughter I can see them she said bringing Chose le petit Chose who lives behind the Odeon and admires Corot to see you bringing him you know as a sort of strange survival a curious relic It really is very funny He was sorry when she said the sun was getting too hot for her and she went and lay on the rug he had spread for her in the shade of the oak She had brought a book to read but she only read a line here and there Her thoughts followed the white clouds for a while and then she admired the man sitting easily on his camp stool his long legs wide apart His small head his big hat the line of his bent back amused and interested her she liked his abrupt speech and wondered if she could love him A couple of peasant women came by bent under the weight of the faggots they had picked and Mildred could see that Morton was watching the movement of these women and she thought how well they would come into the picture he was painting Soon after he rose from his easel and walked towards her Have you finished she said No not quite but the light has changed I cannot go on any more to day One can t work in the sunlight above an hour and a half You ve been working longer than that But haven t touched the effect I ve been painting in some figures two peasant women picking sticks come and look XVI Three days after Morton finished his picture Mildred had been with him most of the time And now lunch was over and they lay on the rug under the oak tree talking eagerly Corot never married Morton remarked as he shaded his eyes with his hand and asked himself if any paint appeared in his sky There was a corner on the left that troubled him He doesn t seem to have ever cared for any woman They say he never had a mistress I hear that you have not followed his example Not more than I could help His childish candour amused her so that she laughed outright and she watched the stolid childish stare that she liked until a longing to take him in her arms and kiss him came upon her Her voice softened and she asked him if he had ever been in love Yes I think I was How long did it last About five years And then A lot of rot about scruples of conscience I said I give you a week to think it over and if I don t hear from you in that time I m off to Italy Did she write Not until I had left Paris Then she spent five and twenty pounds in telegrams trying to get me back But you wouldn t go back Not I with me when an affair of that sort is over it is really over Don t you think I m right Perhaps so But I m afraid we ve learnt love in different schools Then the sooner you relearn it in my school the better At that moment a light breeze came up the sandy path carrying some dust on to the picture Morton stamped and swore For three minutes it was damn damn damn Do you always swear like that in the presence of ladies What s a fellow to do when a blasted wind comes up smothering his picture in sand Mildred could only laugh at him and while he packed up his canvases paint box and easel she thought about him She thought that she understood him and fancied that she would be able to manage him And convinced of her power she said aloud as they plunged into the forest I always think it is a pity that it is considered vulgar to walk arm in arm I like to take an arm I suppose we can do what we like in the forest of Fontainebleau But you re too heavily laden No not a bit I should like it She took his arm and walked by his side with a sweet caressing movement and they talked eagerly until they reached the motive of his second picture What I ve got on the canvas isn t very much like the view in front of you is it No not much I don t like it as well as the other picture I began it late one evening I ve never been able to get the same effect again Now it looks like a Puvis de Chavannes not my picture but that hillside that large space of blue sky and the wood cutters It does a little Are you going on with it Why Because there is no shade for me to sit in I shall be roasted if we remain here What shall we do Lie down in some shady place We might do that I know what I should like What A long drive in the forest A capital idea We can do that We shall meet some one going to Barbizon We ll ask them to send us a fly Their way lay through a pine wood where the heat was stifling the dry trees were like firewood scorched and ready to break into flame and their steps dragged through the loose sand And when they had passed this wood they came to a place where the trees had all been felled and a green undergrowth of pines two or three feet high had sprung up It was difficult to force their way through the prickly branches were disagreeable to touch and underneath the ground was spongy with layers of fallen needles hardly covered with coarse grass Morton missed the way and his paint box and canvases had begun to weigh heavy when they came upon the road they were seeking But where they came upon it there was only a little burnt grass and Morton proposed that they should toil on until they came to a pleasanter place The road ascended along the verge of a steep hill at the top of which they met a bicyclist who promised to deliver Morton s note There was an opening in the trees and below them the dark green forest waved for miles It was pleasant to rest they were tired The forest murmured like a shell They could distinguish here and there a tree and their thoughts went to that tree But absorbed though they were by this vast nature each was thinking intensely of the other Mildred knew she was near the moment when Morton would take her hand and tell her that he loved her She wondered what he would say She did not think he would say he loved her he would say You re a damned pretty woman She could see he was thinking of something and suspected him of thinking out a phrase or an oath appropriate to the occasion She was nearly right Morton was thinking how he should act Mildred was not the common Barbizon art student whose one idea is to become the mistress of a painter so that she may learn to paint She had encouraged him but she had kept her little dignity Moreover he did not feel sure of her So the minutes went by in awkward expectancy and Morton had not kissed her before the carriage arrived She lay back in the fly smiling Morton thought superciliously It seemed to him stupid to put his arm round her waist and try to kiss her But sooner or later he would have to do this Once this Rubicon was passed he would know where he was As he debated the tall trunks rose branchless for thirty or forty feet and Mildred said that they were like plumed lances So they are he said like plumed lances And how beautifully that beech bends what an exquisite curve like a lance bent in the shock of the encounter The underwood seemed to promise endless peace happy life amid leaves and birds and Mildred thought of a duel under the tall trees She saw two men fighting to the death for her A romantic story begun in a ball room she was not quite certain how Morton remembered a drawing of fauns and nymphs But there was hardly cover for a nymph to hide her whiteness The ground was too open the faun would soon overtake her She could better elude his pursuit in the opposite wood There the long branches of the beeches swept the heads of the ferns and in mysterious hollows ferns made mysterious shade places where nymphs and fauns might make noonday festival What are you thinking of said Mildred Of fauns and nymphs he answered These woods seem to breathe antiquity But you never paint antiquity I try to Millet got its spirit Do you know the peasant girl who has taken off her clothes to bathe in a forest pool her sheep wandering through the wood By God I should like you to see that picture At the corner of the carrefour the serpent catcher showed them two vipers in a low flat box They darted their forked tongues against the wire netting and the large green snake which he took out of a bag curled round his arm seeking to escape In questioning him they learnt that the snakes were on their way to the laboratory of a vivisectionist This dissipated the mystery which they had suggested and the carriage drove in silence down the long forest road We might have bought those snakes from him and set them at liberty We might have but we didn t Why didn t we What would be the good If we had he would have caught others I suppose so But I don t like the idea of that beautiful snake which you compared to me being vivisected The forest now extended like a great temple hushed in the beautiful ritual of the sunset The light that suffused the green leaves overhead glossed the brown leaves underfoot marking the smooth grosund as with a pattern And like chapels every dell seemed in the tranquil light and leading from them a labyrinthine architecture without design or end Mildred s eyes wandered from the colonnades to the underwoods She thought of the forest as of a great green prison and then her soul fled to the scraps of blue that appeared through the thick leafage and she longed for large spaces of sky for a view of a plain for a pine plumed hill top Once more she admired once more she wearied of the forest aisles and was about to suggest returning to Barbizon when Morton said We are nearly there now I m going to show you our lake A lake Is there a lake Yes there s a lake not a very large one it is true but still a lake on the top of a hill where you can see the forest Under a sunset sky the view is magnificent The carriage was to wait for them and a little excited by the adventure Mildred followed Morton through rocks and furze bushes When it was possible she took his arm and once accidentally or nearly accidentally she sprang from a rock into his arms She was surprised that he did not take advantage of the occasion to kiss her Standing on this flat rock we re like figures in a landscape by Wilson Mildred said So we are said Morton who was struck by the truth of the comparison But there is too much colour in the scene for Wilson he would have reduced it all to a beautiful blue with only a yellow flush to tell where the sun had gone It would be very nice if you would make me a sketch of the lake I ll lend you a lead pencil the back of an envelope will do I ve a water colour box in my pocket and a block Sit down there and I ll do you a sketch And while you are accomplishing a work of genius I ll supply the levity and don t you think I m just the person to supply the necessary leaven of lightness Look at my frock and my sunshade Morton laughed the conversation paused and the water colour progressed Suddenly Mildred said What did you think of me the first time you saw me What impression did I produce on you Do you want me to tell you to tell you exactly Yes indeed I do I don t think I can What was it Mildred asked in a low affectionate tone and she leaned towards him in an intimate affectionate way Well you struck me as being a little dowdy Dowdy I had a nice new frock on I don t think I could have looked dowdy and among the dreadful old rags that the girls wear here It had nothing to do with the clothes you wore It was a little quiet sedate air I wasn t in good spirits when I came down here No you weren t I thought you might be a bore But I haven t been that have I No I m damned if you re that But what a charming sketch you re making You take that ordinary common grey from the palette and it becomes beautiful If I were to take the very same tint and put it on the paper it would be mud Morton placed his sketch against a rock and surveyed it from a little distance I don t call it bad do you I think I ve got the sensation of the lonely lake But the effect changes so rapidly Those clouds are quite different from what they were just now I never saw a finer sky it is wonderful It is splendid as a battle Write underneath it That night the sky was like a battle No it would do for my sketch You think the suggestion would overpower the reality But it is a charming sketch It will remind me of a charming day of a very happy day She raised her eyes The moment had come He threw one arm round her and raised her face with the other hand She gave her lips easily with a naturalness that surprised and deceived him He might marry her or she might be his mistress he didn t know which but he was quite sure that he liked her better than any woman he had seen for a long time He had not known her a week and she already absorbed his thoughts And during the drive home he hardly saw the forest Once a birch whose faint leaves and branches dissolved in a glittering light drew his thoughts away from Mildred She lay upon his shoulder his arm was affectionately around her and looking at him out of eyes whose brown seemed to soften in affection she said Elsie said you d get round me What did she mean Well said Mildred nestling a little closer and laughing low haven t you got round me Her playfulness enchanted her lover and when she discreetly sought his hand he felt that he understood her account of Alfred s brutality But her tenderness in speaking of Ralph quickened his jealousy My violets lay under his hand he must have died thinking of me But the woman who wrote to you his mistress she must have known all about his love for you What did she say She said very little She was very nice to me She could see that I was a good woman But that made no difference so far as she was concerned You took her lover away from her She knew that I hadn t done anything wrong that we were merely friends The conversation paused a moment then Morton said It seems to have been a mysterious kind of death What did he die of Ah no one ever knew The doctors could make nothing of his case He had been complaining a long time They spoke of overwork but But what I believe he died of slow poisoning Slow poisoning Who could have poisoned him Ellen Gibbs What an awful thing to say I suppose you have some reason for suspecting her His death was very mysterious The doctors could not account for it There ought to have been a post mortem examination Feeling that this was not sufficient reason and remembering suddenly that Ralph held socialistic theories and was a member of a sect of socialists she said Ralph was a member of a secret society He was an anarchist no one suspected it but he told me everything and it was I who persuaded him to leave the Brotherhood I do not see what that has to do with his death by slow poisoning Those who retire from these societies usually die But why Ellen Gibbs She was a member of the same society it was she who got him to join When he resigned it was her duty to Kill him What a terrible story I wonder if you re right I know I am right At the end of a long silence Morton said I wonder if you like me as much as you liked Ralph It is very different He was very good to me And do you think that I shall not be good to you Yes I think you will she said looking up and taking the hand which pressed against her waist You say he was a very clever artist Do you like his work better than mine It was as different as you yourselves are I wonder if I should like it He would have liked that and she pointed with her parasol towards an oak glade golden hearted and hushed A sort of Diaz then No not the least like that No it wasn t the Rousseau palette That s a regular Diaz motive It would be difficult to treat it differently The carriage rolled through a tender summer twilight through a whispering forest XVII At the end of September the green was duskier yellow had begun to appear and the crisped leaf falling through the still air stirred the heart like a memory The skies which rose above the dying forest had acquired gentler tints a wistfulness had come into the blue which was in keeping with the fall of the leaf There was a scent of moisture in the underwoods rills had begun to babble on the hazel rods leaves fluttered pathetically the branches of the plane trees hung out like plumes their drooping leaves making wonderful patterns In the hotel gardens a sunflower watched the yellowing forest then bent its head and died The great cedar was deserted and in October Morton was painting chrysanthemums on the walls of the dining room He called them the flowers of twilight the flowers of the summer s twilight Mildred watched him adding the last sprays to his bouquet of white and purple bloom The inveigling sweetness of these last bright days entered into life quickening it with desire to catch and detain some tinge of autumn s melancholy All were away in the fields and the forest and though little of their emotion transpired on their canvases they were moved as were Rousseau and Millet by the grandeur of the blasted oak and the lonely byre standing against the long forest fringes dimming in the violet twilight Elsie was delighted with her birch and Cissy considered her rocks approvingly You ve caught the beauty of that birch said Cissy How graceful it is in the languid air It seems sad about something About the pine at the end of the glade said Elsie laughing I brought the pine a little nearer I think it composes better Yes I think it does You must come and see my rocks and ferns There s one corner I don t know what to do with But I like my oak I will come presently I m working at the effect the light will have changed in another half hour I ve done all I can do to mine It would make a nice background for a hunting picture There s a hunt to day in the forest Mildred and Morton are going to see the meet Elsie continued painting Cissy sat down on a stone and soon lost herself in meditations She thought about the man she was in love with he had gone back to Paris She was now sure that she hated his method of painting and finding that his influence had not been a good one she strove to look on the landscape with her own eyes But she saw only various painters in it The last was Morton Mitchell and she thought if he had been her lover she might have learnt something from him But he was entirely taken up with Mildred She did not like Mildred any more she had behaved very badly to that poor little Rose Turner Poor little thing she trembles like that birch What are you saying Cissy Who trembles like that birch I was thinking of Rose she seems dreadfully upset Morton never looks at her now I think that Morton would have married her if Mildred hadn t appeared on the scene I know he was thinking of settling down Mildred is a mystery Her pleasure seems to be to upset people s lives You remember poor Ralph Hoskin He died of a broken heart I can t make Mildred out she tells a lot of lies She s always talking about her virtue But I hardly think that Morton would be as devoted to her as he is if he weren t her lover Do you think so I don t know men are very strange Elsie rose to her feet She put aside her camp stool walked back a few yards and looked at her picture The motive of her picture was a bending birch at the end of the glade Rough forest growth made clear its delicate drawing and in the pale sky washed by rains to a faded blue clouds arose and evaporated The road passed at the bottom of the hill and several huntsmen had already ridden by Now a private carriage with a pair of horses stood waiting That s Madame Delacour s carriage she is waiting for Mildred and Morton The people at Fontainebleau Yes the wife of the great Socialist Deputy They re at Fontainebleau for the season M Delacour has taken the hunting They say he has a fine collection of pictures He buys Morton s pictures It was he who bought his Sheepfold Elsie did not admire Morton s masterpiece as much as Cissy But they were agreed that Mildred might prove a disintegrating influence in the development of his talent He had done no work since he had made her acquaintance She was a mere society woman She had never cared for painting she had taken up painting because she thought that it would help her socially She had taken up Morton for the same reason He had introduced her to the Delacours She had been a great success at the dinner they had given last week No doubt she had exaggerated her success but old Dedyier who had been there too had said that every one was talking of la belle et la spirituelle anglaise The girls sat watching the carriage stationed at the bottom of the hill The conversation paused a sound of wheels was heard and a fly was seen approaching The fly was dismissed and Mildred took her seat next to Madame Delacour Morton sat opposite He settled the rug over the ladies knees and the carriage drove rapidly away They ll be late for the meet said Cissy And all the afternoon the girls listened to the hunting In the afternoon three huntsmen crashed through the brushwood at the end of a glade winding the long horns they wore about their shoulders Once a strayed hound came very near them Elsie threw the dog a piece of bread It did not see the bread and pricking up its ears it trotted away The horns came nearer and nearer and the girls were affrighted lest they should meet the hunted boar and be attacked It must have turned at the bottom of the hill The horns died through the twilight a spectral moon was afloat in the sky and some wood cutters told them that they were three kilometres from Barbizon When about a mile from the village they were overtaken by the Delacours carriage Morton and Mildred bade Madame good bye and walked home with them Their talk was of hunting The boar had been taken close to the central carrefour they had watched the fight with the dogs seven of which he had disabled before M Delacour succeeded in finally despatching him The edible value of boar s head was discussed until Mildred mentioned that Madame Delacour was going to give a ball Elsie and Cissy were both jealous of Mildred but they hoped she would get them invited She said that she did not know Madame Delacour well enough to ask for invitations Later on she would see what could be done Morton thought that there would be no difficulty and Elsie asked Mildred what dress she was going to wear Mildred said she was going to Paris to order some clothes and the conversation dropped At the end of the week the Delacours drove over to Barbizon and lunched at Lunions The horses the carriage liveries the dresses the great name of the Deputy made a fine stir in the village I wonder if she ll get us invited said Elsie Not she said Cissy But Mildred was always unexpected She introduced Monsieur and Madame Delacour to Elsie and Cissy she insisted on their showing their paintings they were invited to the ball and Mildred drove away nodding and smiling Her dress was coming from Paris she was staying with the Delacours until after the ball so as Cissy said her way was nice and smooth and easy very different indeed from theirs They had to struggle with the inability and ignorance of a provincial dressmaker working against time At the last moment it became clear that their frocks could not be sent to Barbizon that they would have to dress for the ball in Fontainebleau But where They would have to hire rooms at the hotel and having gone to the expense of hiring rooms they had as well sleep at Fontainebleau They could return with Mildred she would have the Delacours carriage They could all four return together that would be very jolly The hotel omnibus was going to Melun to catch the half past six train If they went by train they would economise sufficiently in carriage hire to pay their hotel expenses or very nearly Morton agreed to accompany them He got their tickets and found them places but they noticed that he seemed a little thoughtful not to say gloomy Not the least as Elsie said like a man who was going to meet his sweetheart at a ball I think whispered Cissy that he s beginning to regret that he introduced her to the Delacours He feels that it is as likely as not that she ll throw him over for some of the grand people she will meet there Cissy had guessed rightly A suspicion had entered into his heart that Mildred was beginning to perceive that her interest lay rather with the Delacours than with him And he had not engaged himself to Mildred for any dances because he wished to see if she would reserve any dances for him This ball he felt would prove a turning point in his love story He suspected M Delacour of entertaining some very personal admiration for Mildred he would see if his suspicion were well founded he would not rush to her at once and having shaken hands with his host and hostess he sought a corner whence he could watch Mildred and the ball The rooms were already thronged but the men were still separated from the women the fusion of the sexes which was the mission of the dance to accomplish had hardly begun Some few officers were selecting partners up and down the room but the politicians their secretaries the prefects and the sub prefects had not yet moved from the doorways The platitudes of public life were written in their eyes But these made expressions were broken at the sight of some young girl s fragility or the paraded charms of a woman of thirty and then each feared that his neighbour had discovered thoughts in him unappropriate to the red ribbon which he wore in his buttonhole A cross between clergymen and actors thought Morton and he indulged in philosophical reflections The military had lost its prestige in the boudoir Nothing short of a continental war could revive it the actor and the tenor never did more than to lift the fringe of society s garment The curate continues a very solid innings in the country but in town the political lover is in the ascendent A possible under secretary is just the man to cut me out with Mildred They d discuss the elections between kisses At that moment he saw Mildred struggling through the crowd with a young diplomatist Le Comte de la Ferriere She wore white tulle laid upon white silk The bodice was silver fish scales and she shimmered like a moonbeam She laid her hand on her dancer s shoulder moving forward with a motion that permeated her whole body A silver shoe appeared and Morton thought What a vanity only a vanity but what a delicious and beautiful vanity The waltz ended some dancers passed out of the ball room and Mildred was surrounded It looked as if her card would be filled before Morton could get near her But she stood on tiptoe and looking over the surrounding shoulders cried that she would keep the fourteenth for him Why did you not come before she asked smiling and went out of the room on the arm of the young comte At that moment M Delacour took Morton s arm and asked when would the picture he had ordered be finished Morton hoped by the end of next week and the men walked through the room talking of pictures On the way back they met Mildred She told Morton that she would make it all right later on He must now go and talk to Madame Delacour She had promised M Delacour the next dance M Delacour was fifty but he was straight and thin and there was no sign of grey in his black hair which fitted close and tight as a skull cap His face was red and brown but he did not seem very old and Morton wondered if it were possible for Mildred to love so old a man Madame Delacour sat in a high chair within the doorway out of reach of any draught that might happen on the staircase Her blond hair was drawn high up in an eighteenth century coiffure and her high pale face looked like a cameo or an old coin She spoke in a high clear voice and expressed herself in French a little unfamiliar to her present company She must have married beneath her thought Morton and he wondered on what terms she lived with her husband He spoke of Mildred as the prettiest woman in the room and was disappointed that Madame Delacour did not contest the point When Cissy and Elsie came whirling by Cissy unnecessarily large and bare and Elsie intolerably pert and middle class Morton regretted that he would have to ask them to dance And when he had danced with them and the three young ladies Madame Delacour had introduced him to and had taken a comtesse into supper he found that the fourteenth waltz was over But Mildred bade him not to look so depressed she had kept the cotillion for him It was going to begin very soon He had better look after chairs So he tied his handkerchief round a couple But he knew what the cotillion meant She would be always dancing with others And the cotillion proved as he had expected Everything happened but it was all the same to him Dancers had gone from the dancing room and returned in masks and dominoes A paper imitation of a sixteenth century house had been brought in ladies had shown themselves at the lattice they had been serenaded and had chosen serenaders to dance with And when at the end of his inventions the leader fell back on the hand glass and the cushion Mildred refused dance after dance At last the leader called to Morton he came up certain of triumph but Mildred passed the handkerchief over the glass and drew the cushion from his knee She danced both figures with M Delacour She was covered with flowers and ribbons and though a little woman she looked very handsome in her triumph Morton hated her triumph knowing that it robbed him of her But he hid his jealousy as he would his hand in a game of cards and when the last guests were going he bade her good night with a calm face He saw her go upstairs with M Delacour Madame Delacour had gone to her room she had felt so tired that she could sit up no longer and had begged her husband to excuse her and as Mildred went upstairs three or four steps in front of M Delacour she stopped to arrange with Elsie and Cissy when she should come to fetch them they were all going home together At that moment Morton saw her so clearly that the thought struck him that he had never seen her before She appeared in that instant as a toy a trivial toy made of coloured glass and as a maleficent toy for he felt if he played with it any longer that it would break and splinter in his fingers As brilliant as hard and as dangerous as a piece of broken glass He wondered why he had been attracted by this bit of coloured glass he laughed at his folly and went home certain that he could lose her without pain But memory of her delicate neck and her wistful eyes suddenly assailed him he threw himself over on his pillow aching to clasp the lissome mould of her body a mould which he knew so well that he seemed to feel its every shape in his arms his nostrils recalled its perfume and he asked himself if he would destroy his picture The Sheepfold if by destroying it he could gain her For six months with her in Italy he would destroy it and he would not regret its destruction But had she the qualities that make a nice mistress Candidly he did not think she had He d have to risk that Anyhow she wasn t common like the others In time she would become common time makes all things common But this is God damned madness he cried out and lay staring into the darkness his eyes and heart on fire Visions of Mildred and Delacour haunted his pillow he did not know whether he slept or waked and he rose from his bed weary heavy eyed and pale He was to meet her at eleven on the terrace by the fish pond and had determined to come to an understanding with her but his heart choked him when he saw her coming toward him along the gravel path He bought some bread at the stall for the fish and talking to her he grew so happy that he feared to imperil his happiness by reproaches They wondered if they would see the fabled carp in whose noses rings had been put in the time of Louis XIV The statues on their pedestals high up in the clear bright air were singularly beautiful and they saw the outlines of the red castle and the display of terraces reaching to the edge of the withering forest They were conscious that the place was worthy of its name Fontainebleau The name is evocative of stately days and traditions and Mildred fancied herself a king s mistress La Pompadour The name is a romance an excitement and throwing her arms on Morton s shoulders she said Morton dear don t be angry I m very fond of you I really am I only stop with the Delacours because they amuse me It means nothing If I could only believe you said Morton holding her arms in his hands and looking into her brown eyes Why don t you believe me she said but there was no longer any earnestness in her voice It had again become a demure insincerity If you were really fond of me you d give yourself Perhaps I will one of these days When when you return to Barbizon I won t promise When I promise I like to keep my promise You ask too much You don t realise what it means to a woman to give herself Have you never had a scruple about anything Scruple about anything I don t know what you mean What scruple can you have you re not a religious woman It isn t religion it is well something I don t know This has gone on too long he said if I don t get you now I shall lose you If you were really afraid of losing me you would ask me to marry you Morton was taken aback I never thought of marriage but I would marry you Do you mean it Yes I mean it When One of these days I don t believe you You re a bundle of falsehoods I m not as false as you say There s no use making me out worse than I am I m very fond of you Morton I wonder said Morton I asked you just now to be my mistress you said you d prefer to marry me Very well when will you marry me Don t ask me I cannot say when Besides you don t want to marry me You think so You hesitated just now A woman always knows If you had wanted to marry me you would have begun by asking me This is tomfoolery I asked you to be my mistress and then at your suggestion I asked you to be my wife I really don t see what more I can do You say you re very fond of me and yet you want to be neither mistress nor wife A little dark cloud gathered between her eyes She did not answer She did not know what to answer for she was acting in contradiction to her reason Her liking for Morton was quite real there were even moments when she thought that she would end by marrying But mysterious occult influences which she could neither explain nor control were drawing her away from him She asked herself what was this power which abided in the bottom of her heart from which she could not rid herself and which said thou shalt not marry him She asked herself if this essential force was the life of pleasure and publicity which the Delacours offered her She had to admit that she was drawn to this life and that she had felt strangely at ease in it In the few days that she had spent with the Delacours she had for the first time in her life felt in agreement with her surroundings She had always hated that dirty studio and still more its dirty slangy frequenters And she lay awake a great part of the night thinking She felt that she must act in obedience to her instinct whatever it might cost her and her instinct drew her towards the Delacours and away from Morton But her desire for Morton was not yet exhausted and the struggle between the two forces resulted in one of her moods Its blackness lay on forehead between her eyes and in the influence of its mesmerism she began to hate him As she put it to herself she began to feel ugly towards him She hated to return to Barbizon and when they met she gave her cheek instead of her lips and words which provoked and wounded him rose to her tongue s tip she could not save herself from speaking them and each day their estrangement grew more and more accentuated She came down one morning nervously calm her face set in a definite and gathering expression of resolution Elsie could see that something serious had happened But Mildred did not seem inclined to explain she only said that she must leave Barbizon at once That she was going that very morning that her boxes were packed that she had ordered a carriage Are you going back to Paris Yes but I don t think I shall go to Melun I shall go to Fontainebleau I d like to say good bye to the Delacours This is hardly a day for a drive through the forest you ll be blown to pieces I don t mind a little wind I shall tie my veil tighter Mildred admitted that she had quarrelled with Morton But she would say no more She declared however that she would not see him again Her intention was to leave before he came down and as if unable to bear the delay any longer she asked Cissy and Elsie to walk a little way with her The carriage could follow The wind was rough but they were burning to hear what Morton had done and hoping that Mildred would become more communicative when they got out of the village they consented to accompany her I m sorry to leave said Mildred but I cannot stay after what happened last night Oh dear she exclaimed my hat nearly went that time I m afraid I shall have a rough drive You will indeed You d better stay said Elsie I cannot It would be impossible for me to see him again But what did he say to offend you It wasn t what he said it was what he did What did he do He came into my room last night Did he were you in bed Yes I was in bed reading I was awfully frightened I never saw a man in such a state I think he was mad What did you do I tried to calm him I felt that I must not lose my presence of mind I spoke to him gently I appealed to his honour and at last I persuaded him to go What did you say I at last persuaded him to go We can t talk in this wind screamed Elsie we d better go back We shall be killed cried Cissy starting back in alarm for a young pine had crashed across the road not very far from where they were standing and the girls could hear the wind trumpeting careering springing forward it rushed leaped it paused and the whole forest echoed its wrath When the first strength of the blast seemed ebbing the girls looked round for shelter They felt if they remained where they were holding on to roots and grasses that they would be carried away Those rocks cried Cissy We shan t get there in time the trees will fall cried Elsie Not a minute to lose said Mildred Come And the girls ran through the swaying trees at the peril of their lives And as they ran the earth gave forth a rumbling sound and was lifted beneath their feet It seemed as if subterranean had joined with aerial forces for the crumbling sound they had heard as they ran through the scattered pines increased it was the roots giving way and the pines bent wavered and fell this way and that But about the rocks where the girls crouched the trees grew so thickly that the wind could not destroy them singly so it had taken the wood in violent and passionate grasp and was striving to beat it down But under the rocks all was quiet the storm was above in the branches and hearing almost human cries the girls looked up and saw great branches interlocked like serpents in the writhe of battle In half an hour the storm had blown itself out But a loud wind shook through the stripped and broken forest lament was in all the branches the wind forced them upwards and they gesticulated their despair The leaves rose and sank like cries of woe adown the raw air and the roadway was littered with ruin The whirl of the wind still continued and the frightened girls dreaded lest the storm should return overtaking them as they passed through the avenue The avenue was nearly impassable with fallen trees and Elsie said You ll not be able to go to Fontainebleau to day Then I shall go to Melun As they entered the village they met the carriage and Mildred bade her friends good bye XVIII In the long autumn and winter evenings Harold often thought of his sister His eyes often wandered to the writing table and he asked himself if he should write to her again There seemed little use She either ignored his questions altogether or alluded to them in a few words and passed from them into various descriptive writing the aspects of the towns she had visited and the general vegetation of the landscapes she had seen or she dilated on the discovery of a piece of china a bronze or an old engraving in some forgotten corner Her intention to say nothing about herself was obvious In a general way he gathered that she had been to Nice and Monte Carlo and he wondered why she had gone to the Pyrenees and with whom she was living in the Boulevard Poissonier That was her last address The letter was dated the fifteenth of December she had not written since and it was now March But scraps of news of her had reached him One day he learnt from a paragraph in a newspaper that Miss Mildred Lawson had been received into the Church of Rome he wrote to inquire if this was true and a few days after a lady told him that she had heard that Mildred had entered a Carmelite convent and taken the veil The lady s information did not seem very trustworthy but Harold was nevertheless seriously alarmed and without waiting for an answer to the letter he had written the day before he telegraphed to Mildred I have not entered a convent and have no present intention of doing so Could anything be more unsatisfactory Harold thought She does not say whether she has gone over to Rome Perhaps that is untrue too Shall I telegraph again He hesitated and then decided that he would not She did not wish to be questioned and would find an evasive answer that would leave him only more bewildered than before He hoped for an answer to his letter but Mildred did not write no doubt being of opinion that her telegram met the necessity of the case and he heard no more until some news of her came to him through Elsie Laurence whom Harold met one afternoon as he was coming home from the city From Elsie he learnt that Mildred was a great social success in Paris She was living with the Delacours she had met them at Fontainebleau Morton Mitchell that was the man she had thrown over had introduced her to them Harold had never heard of the Delacours and he hastened to acquaint himself with them Morton Mitchell he reserved for some future time one flirtation more or less mattered little but that his sister should be living with the Delacours a radical and socialist deputy a questionable financier a company promoter a journalist was very shocking Delacour was all these things and many more according to Elsie and she rattled on until Harold s brain whirled He learnt too that it was with the Delacours that Mildred had been in the South She wrote to me from some place in the Pyrenees From Lourdes she was there A cloud gathered on Harold s face She didn t write to me from Lourdes he said But Lourdes is I suppose the reason of her perversion to Rome No Mildred told me that Lourdes had nothing to do with it You say that she now lives with these people the Delacours Yes she s just like one of the family She invites her friends to dinner She invited me to dinner The Delacours are very rich and Mildred is now all the rage in Paris And Madame Delacour what kind of a woman is she Madame Delacour has very poor health they say she was once a great beauty but there s very little of her beauty left She s very fond of Mildred They are great friends The next time that Harold heard of Mildred was through his solicitors In the course of conversation regarding some investments Messrs Blunt and Hume mentioned that Miss Lawson had taken five thousand pounds out of mortgage They did not know if she had re invested it she had merely requested them to pay the money into her banking account Why did you not mention this to me before Miss Lawson has complete control over her private fortune On a former occasion you remember when she required five hundred pounds to hire and furnish a studio she wrote very sharply because we had written to you on the subject She spoke of a breach of professional etiquette Then why do you tell me now about this five thousand pounds Strictly speaking we ought not to have done so but we thought that we might venture on a confidential statement Harold thought that Messrs Blunt and Hume had acted very stupidly and he asked himself what Mildred proposed to do with the money Did she intend to re invest it in French securities Or had the Roman Catholics persuaded her to leave it to a convent or to spend it in building a church Or perhaps Delacour and the Socialists have got hold of the money But Mildred was never very generous with her money He stepped into a telegraph office and stepped out again without having sent a message He wrote a long letter when he arrived home and tore it up when he had finished it It was not a case for a letter or telegram but for an immediate journey He could send a telegram to the office saying he would not be there to morrow he remembered a business appointment for Friday which could not be broken But he could return on Thursday morning Arrive on Wednesday night return on Thursday morning or Thursday night if he did not succeed in seeing Mildred on Wednesday night Yes that would do it but it would mean a tedious journey on the coldest month of the year But five thousand English pounds was a large sum of money he must do what he could to save it Save it Yes for he hadn t a doubt that it was in danger He would take the train at Charing Cross to morrow morning He would arrive in Paris about eight He would then go to his hotel change his clothes dine and get to Mildred s about nine or half past This was the course he adopted and on Wednesday night at half past nine he crossed the Rue Richlieu and inquired the way to Boulevard Poissonier If Mildred were going to a ball he would be able to get half an hour s conversation were her before she went upstairs to dress If she were dining out he could wait until she came in She would not be later than eleven he thought as he entered a courtyard There were a number of staircases and he at last found himself in the corridors and the salons of La voix du Peuple which was printed and published on the first floor He addressed questions to various men who passed him with proofs in their hands and when a door was opened on the left he saw a glare of gas and the compositors bending over the cases Then he found his way to the floor above and there doors were open on both sides of the landing footmen hurried to and fro He asked for Mademoiselle Lawson and was led through rooms decorated with flowers They are giving a ball here to night he thought and the footmen drew aside a curtain and in a small end room a boudoir dimly lighted and hung with tapestry and small pictures in gold frames he found Mildred sitting on a couch with an elderly man about fifty They seemed to be engaged in intimate conversation and they rose abruptly as if disconcerted by his sudden intrusion Oh Harold said Mildred Why didn t you write to say that you were coming vous tombez comme une tuile Permettez moi Monsieur Delacour de vous presenter a won frere Harold bowed and shook hands with the tall thin man with the high bridged nose and the close cut black hair fitting close to his head In the keen grey eyes which shone out of a studiously formal face there was a look which passed from disdain to swift interrogation and then to an expression of courteous and polite welcome M Delacour professed himself delighted to make Harold s acquaintance and he hoped that Harold was staying some time in Paris Harold regretted that he was obliged to return on the following morning and M Delacour s face assumed an expression of disappointment He said that it would have been his pleasure to make Harold s stay as agreeable as possible However on the occasion of Harold s next visit M Delacour hoped that he could stay with them He went so far as to say that he hoped that Harold would consider this house as his own Harold thanked him and again expressed regret that he was obliged to leave the following morning He noticed a slight change of expression on the diplomatist s face when he mentioned that he had come over in a hurry to discuss some business matters with his sister A moment later M Delacour was smiling perfect approval and comprehension and moving towards the door At the door he lingered to express a hope that Harold would stay for the ball He said that Mildred must do her best to persuade her brother to remain The musicians had just come she could hear them tuning their instruments Guests would soon arrive so she hoped that the interview would not be prolonged The way to shorten it was to say nothing She could see that Harold was embarrassed silence would increase his embarrassment She knew that he had come to speak about the four thousand pounds which she had taken out of mortgage She knew that he hoped to induce her to re invest it in some good security at five per cent But she did not intend to take his advice or to inform him regarding her relations with the Delacours She knew too that he disapproved of her dress it was certainly cut a little lower than she had intended and then she saw that his eyes had wandered to the newspaper which lay open on the table In a moment he would see her name at the bottom of the first article If he were to read the article he would be more shocked than he was by her dress It was even more decolletee than her dress both had come out a little more decolletee than she had intended I see he said that you write in this paper A little I m doing a series of articles under the title of Bal Blanc My articles are a success I like that one as well as any you shall take the number of the paper away with you But how do you manage about writing in French I write very easily in French now as easily as in English M Delacour looks over my proof but he hardly finds anything to correct Mildred suppressed a smile she had taken in the entire situation and was determined to act up to it It offered an excellent opportunity for acting and Mildred was only happy when she could get outside herself She crossed her hands and composed her most demure air and for the sake of the audience which it pleased her to imagine and when Harold was not looking she allowed her malicious eyes to say what she was really thinking And he unconscious of the amusement he afforded made delightful comedy He tried to come to the point but feared to speak too suddenly of the money she had drawn out of the mortgage and in his embarrassment he took a book from the table The character of the illustrations caused his face to flush and an expression of shame to appear Mildred snatched the book out of his hand saying That is one of M Delacour s books You know the book then One knows everything You are not an artist and see things in a different light I don t think that art has much to do with a book of that kind You must have changed very much Mildred No she said that shows me how little you understand me I have not changed at all The word suggested the idea and he said you have changed your religion You ve become a Roman Catholic I must say if that book is That book has nothing to do with me I glanced at it once that was all and when I saw what it was I put it down The subject was a painful one and Harold was willing to let it drop But why he said did you go over to Rome Wasn t the religion you were brought up in good enough for you I was so unhappy at the time I had suffered a great deal I didn t believe in anything I did not know what was going to become of me Didn t believe in anything Mildred I m very sorry But if you found difficulty in accepting Protestantism Catholicism I should have thought would be still more impossible It makes so much a larger demand on faith The discovery of the book had for a moment forced her out of the part she was playing but religious discussion afforded her ample facility which she eagerly availed herself of to return to it You do not understand women But what has understanding women to do with a religious question Harold asked a little more petulantly than usual These were the words and intonation she had expected and she smiled inwardly Women s lives are so different from men we need a more intimate consolation than Protestantism can give us Our sense of the beauty The old story those who find difficulty in believing in the divinity of our Lord will swallow infallibility transubstantiation and the rest of it all the miracles and the entire hierarchy of the saints male and female if they may be gratified by music candles incense gold vestments and ceremonial display It is not love of God it is love of the senses Ou fait la guerre avec de la musique des panaches des drapeaux des harnais d or un deploiement de ceremonie What s that That is from the Tentation de Saint Antoine It comes in the dialogue between Death and Lust They make war with music with banners with plumes with golden trappings and ceremonial display What s that got to do with what we were saying Only that you accidentally made use of nearly the same words as Flaubert Ceremonial display is not so good as deploiement de ceremonie but Mildred Well She wore a little subdued look and he did not detect the malice that it superficially veiled She did not wish him to see that she was playing with him but she wished to fret him with some slight suspicion that she was She was at the same time conscious of his goodness and her own baseness she even longed to throw herself into his arms and thank him for having come to Paris she knew that it was in her interest that he had come but an instinct stronger than her will forced her to continue improvising the words of her part and it was her pleasure to provide it with suitable gesture expression of face and inflection of voice She could hear the fiddles in the ball room and wished the wall away and the company ranged behind a curtain And as these desires crossed her mind she pitied poor Harold with his one idea how he may serve me When she came to the word me her heart softened towards him but the temptation to discuss her conversion with him was imperative and she watched him guessing easily how his idea of Catholicism turned in his narrow brain and she knew that turn it as he pleased that he would get no nearer to any understanding of it or of her Religion was a fixed principle in his life it was there as his head neck and arms were there and it played a very definite part in his life his religion was not a doll that could be dressed to suit the humours of the day but an unchanging principle that ruled that was obeyed and that visited all fallings away with remorse So this opportunity to play with her brother s religious consciousness was to be gainsayed no more than an opportunity to persuade a lover into exhibition of passion And she remembered how Harold and Alfred used to sit over the dining room fire shaking their heads over the serious scandal that had been caused in the parish by the new Vicar who had introduced the dangerous innovation of preaching in his surplice She had laughed and sneered at her brother s hesitations and scruples about accepting the surplice for the black robe and now she wondered if he would ask her if she considered it a matter of no importance if the priests put on vestments to say Mass or if there were wine and water in the cruets She had as she had told her brother embraced Catholicism in a time of suffering and depression when she had fancied herself very near to suicide when she didn t know what else was going to become of her Her painting had failed and she had gone to Barbizon a wreck of abandoned hopes She had gone there because at that moment it was necessary to create some interest in her life And Barbizon had succeeded in a way she had liked Morton and it was not her fault if he had failed to understand her that was one of the reasons why she had left Barbizon and her distress of mind on leaving was the result of indiscretions which she did not like to remember True it was that she had not actually been his mistress but she had gone further than she had intended to go and she had felt that she must leave Barbizon at once For her chastity was her one safeguard if she were to lose that she had always felt and never more strongly than after the Barbizon episode that there would be no safety for her She knew that her safety lay in her chastity others might do without chastity and come out all right in the end but she could not an instinct told her so There had been moments when she had wondered if she were really quite sane Something had to happen Catholicism had happened and she had gone to travel with the Delacours Madame Delacour was a strict Catholic and was therefore interested in Mildred s conversion And with her Mildred went to Mass high and low vespers and benediction She selected an old priest for confessor who gave her absolution without hearing half she said and she went to communion and besought of M Delacour never to laugh at her when she was in one of her religious moods These occurred at undetermined intervals speaking broadly about every two months they lasted sometimes a week sometimes a fortnight In her moods she was a strict Catholic but as they wore away she grew more loose and Madame Delacour noticed Mildred s absentations from Mass Mildred answered that she was a Newmanite and was more concerned with the essential spirit of Catholicism than with its outward practice and she adopted the same train of argument when Harold asked her if she believed that the bread and wine consecrated and swallowed by the priest was the real Body and Blood of God She replied I take all that as a symbol But Catholicism imposes the belief that it is the real Body and Blood Mildred passed off her perplexity with a short laugh You re always the same she said you never get farther than externals I remember how you and Alfred used to shake your heads over the surplice and the black robe question You re an enemy of ritualism and yet I know no one more ritualistic than you are only your ritual is not ours You cannot listen to a sermon if the preacher wears a surplice you waive the entire merit of the sermon and see nothing but the impudent surplice All the beautiful instruction passes unheeded and your brows gather into a frown black as the robe that isn t there I believe that you would insist that Christ Himself should ascend into Heaven in a black robe and you would send the goats to hell draped in samite and white linen Her paradoxical imagination of the ascent into Heaven and the judgment seat amused her and the glimpse she had caught of her brother s portentous gravity curled her up like a cigarette paper But he was too shocked for speech and Mildred strove to curb her hilarity No she said you can never get farther than externals you are the true ritualist the Pope is not more so Harold s face now wore an expression of such awful gravity that Mildred could hardly contain herself she bit her lips and continued But ritual hardly concerns me at all I was received into the Church before I had ever heard Mass I am not interested in externals I think of the essentials and Catholicism seems to me to be essentially right A great deal of it I look upon as symbolism I am a Catholic but my Catholicism is my own I am a Newmanite If there be no future life and all is mistake then Catholicism is a sublime mistake if there be a future life then we re on the right side I m afraid there is little use in our discussing this subject Mildred We feel religion very differently You say that I don t understand women it seems to me that some women do not understand religion They have never originated any religious movement There have been great saints among women there have been great Roman Catholic saints Mildred really this discussion is futile not to say exasperating Don t you hear the fiddles in the next room they re playing a waltz Mildred had heard the fiddlers all the while without them the conversation would have been shorn of most of its interest for her We have wandered very far from the subject on which I came to talk to you the matter which I came to Paris to talk to you about Mildred suppressed a smile She had annoyed him sufficiently there was no reason why she should press this interview towards a quarrel Harold paused a moment and then said I hear from our solicitors that you have drawn five thousand pounds out of first class mortgages Now this is a large sum of money How do you intend to re invest it I don t see how you could get better interest than you have been getting unless you accept doubtful security I hope that neither this paper La Voix du Peuple or Panama has tempted you It is very kind of you Harold to come to Paris to inquire into this matter You won t think that I am ungrateful will you No Then I would sooner say nothing about this money I have re invested it and I think well invested it I am satisfied it is my own money I am of age and quite capable of judging You know a great deal more than I do Mildred about art and literature and all that kind of thing but I have had business experience that you have not and I feel it my duty to tell you if you have invested your money in La Voix du Peuple that I can only look upon it as lost Come Harold Let us admit for the sake of argument that I have invested the whole or part of my money in this paper Then you have done so If you hadn t you would not feel inclined to discuss hypothetical investments Why not For you impugn the integrity of my dearest friends The circulation of the paper is going up steadily When we reach sixty thousand I shall have invested my money supposing I have put it into the paper at twenty per cent and will then receive not two hundred fifty pounds but one thousand pounds a year You will admit there is a difference I should think there was I wish I could get twenty per cent for my money But I thought that getting a big interest for money was against your principles I thought that the Socialists said that interest was unpaid labour Isn t that the expression you use Yes it is I had scruples on this point but M Delacour overruled my scruples Your objection is answered by the theory that individual sacrifice is unavailing indeed it is as useless as giving charity quite A case of intense suffering is brought under the notice of a bourgeois it awakens in him a certain hysterical pity or I should say remorse for he feels that a system that permits such things to be cannot be wholly right He relieves this suffering and then he thinks he is a virtuous man he thinks he has done a good action but a moment s reflection shows us that this good action is only selfishness in disguise that it is nothing more than a personal gratification a balm to his wound which by a sort of reflective action he has received from outraged humanity Charity is of no use it is individual and nothing individual is of any value the movement must be general It seems to me that pity is a human sentiment that it always existed In all ages there has been pity for the blind the lame the deformed never was pity so general or so ardent as in the nineteenth century but it always existed for the poor of spirit and the feeble of body and these are not the victims of our social system they are nature s victims Mildred did not answer and they heard the fiddles the piano and then the cornet The Delacours entertain a great deal I suppose on the first floor the editor writes that property is robbery and advocates an equal division of property on the second floor he spends the money he gets out of the people by holding illusory hopes of an approaching spoliation of the rich and advocating investment in a fraudulent enterprise like Panama You always accuse me of want of humour but I have sufficient to appreciate The Voice of the People on the first floor and the voice of the ball on the second At that moment M Delacour opened the door of the boudoir Forgive me he said for interrupting you but I wanted to tell that every one has read your article It is a great success spirituel charmant surtout tres parisien that s what is said on every side Mildred s face flushed with pleasure and turning to Harold she said I am writing a series of articles in La Voix du Peuple under the title of Bal Blanc Have you not seen your sister s articles M Lawson asked M Delacour No Mildred did not send them to me and I rarely see the French papers in London Mildred looked at M Delacour and Harold read in her eyes that she was annoyed that M Delacour had called attention to the article He asked himself why this was and when M Delacour left the room he took up the paper He read a few lines and then Mildred said I cannot remain much longer away from my guests Your guests Yes they are my guests in a way the ball was given for me You can go to them I can remain here I suppose I can see you later on Mildred did not answer and while Harold looked through the article her face darkened and she bit her lips twice At last she said We had better finish I cannot remain away any longer from my guests and I shall be engaged the rest of the evening There s no use in your reading that article You won t like it You won t approve of it I certainly do not approve of it and are all the articles you write under this title of the same character I can t see anything wrong in it Of course you can read meanings into it that I don t intend if you like I am afraid that your articles must give people a very false idea of you Every one who knows me knows that I would not do anything wrong that I am not that kind of woman You need not be afraid I shall not disgrace you I m not thinking of myself Mildred I am sure you would not do anything wrong that you would not disgrace yourself I was merely wondering what people would think Do the priests approve of this kind of writing I don t submit my writings to my Confessor Mildred answered laughing And your position in this house Your intimacy with M Delacour I found you sitting side by side on this sofa I never heard before that there was any harm in sitting on a sofa with a man But there are people who see immorality in every piece of furniture in a drawing room You seemed very intimate that s all What does Madame Delacour say Does she approve of this intimacy I don t know what you mean What intimacy Madame Delacour does not see any harm in my sitting on a sofa with her husband She knows me very well She knows that I wouldn t do anything wrong She s my most intimate friend she is quite satisfied I can assure you I ll introduce you to her as you go out I see you are anxious to join your company I must not keep you from your guests any longer I suppose I shall not see you again I return to morrow Then it is good bye I suppose so unless you return with me Return to Sutton to look after your house I don t want you to look after my house you can have a housekeeper I m sorry you think that is why I want you to return Perhaps you think that is why I came over Oh Mildred Harold I m sorry I did not think such a thing It was good of you to come to Paris Harold you re not angry No Mildred I m not angry But all this seems strange to me this house these people this paper I know I know But we cannot all think alike We never did think alike But that should not interfere in our affection for one another We should love each other We are alone in the world father and mother both gone only a few aunts and cousins that we don t care about Do you ever think of what father and mother would say if they knew What would they think of your choosing to leave home to live with these people Do not let us argue these things we shall never agree The affection which had suddenly warmed her had departed and her heart had grown cold as stone again Each must be free to choose his or her life You surely don t intend always to live here Always I don t know about always for the present certainly Then there is nothing but to say good bye XIX One evening in spring Mildred returned home Harold had not long returned from the city the candles were lighted He was sitting in the drawing room thinking thinking of her Mildred is that you Yes how do you do Harold Come and sit near the fire you ve had a cold journey When did you return Last night We had a dreadful crossing I stayed in bed all the morning That was why I didn t come to see you in the city Harold sat for some moments without speaking looking into the fire Reticence was natural to him he refrained from questioning her and thought instead of some harmless subject of conversation Her painting But she had abandoned painting Her money she had lost it that was the trouble she was in He had warned her against putting her money into that paper But there was no use worrying her she would tell him presently Besides there was not time to talk about it now dinner would soon be ready It is now half past six don t you think you d better go upstairs and get ready Oh don t bother me about the dinner Harold What does it matter if it is a few minutes late I can t go upstairs yet I want to sit here She looked round the room and remembered how her father used to sit in the chair Harold was sitting in He was getting bald just like father He looked just like father his head seen against the book cases the light catching the ends of his bristly hair But who was she like she didn t know not like poor dear mother who thought of nothing but her husband and her children From whom had she got her tastes her taste for painting her ideas God knows She wished she were like other people Like Harold Yet she didn t know that she would like to be quite so simple so matter of fact They were only like in one thing neither had married She had never thought of that before and wondered why But he would marry one of these days He wasn t forty yet Then she would have to leave Sutton she couldn t live there with a step sister So you re not married yet Harold No not yet Not even engaged No not even engaged I suppose you will one of these days Perhaps one of these days but I m in no hurry And you are you as much set against marriage as ever Alfred Stanby has never married I don t think he ever will I think you broke his heart I don t believe in breaking men s hearts You are just the kind of woman who does break men s hearts Why do you say that You think me heartless No Mildred I don t think you heartless only you re not like other girls No I m not I ve too much heart that s been my misfortune I should have got on better if I had less Harold had no aptitude or taste of philosophical reflections so he merely mentioned that Alfred was living in Sutton and hoped that Mildred would not mind meeting him No I don t mind meeting him but he may not like to meet me Does he ever speak of me Yes he does sometimes I never knew why you threw him over He s really a very good fellow He has worked hard and is now making a fair income I m glad of that I suppose I did treat him badly But no worse than men treat women every day Why did you throw him over I don t know It s so long ago He didn t understand me I thought I should find some one who did I know the world better now Would you marry him if he were to propose again I don t know I don t know I don t know what I should do now Don t question me Harold At that moment the gong sounded for dinner Harold refrained from saying I knew you d be late An hour after brother and sister were sitting by the library fire At last Harold said I m glad you re going to stop here for the present that you re not going back to Paris Do you never intend to live there again There s no reason why I should go back certainly none that I should live there again my life in Paris is ended She did not recount her misfortunes in plain straightforward narrative her story fluctuated and transpired in inflections of voice and picturesque glances She was always aware of the effect of herself on others and she forgot a great deal of her disappointment in the pleasure of astonishing Harold The story unwound itself like spun silk The principal spool was the Panama scandals But around it there were little spools full of various thread a little of which Mildred unwound from time to time When the first accusations against the Deputies were made I warned him I told him that the matter would not stop there but he was over confident Moreover I warned him against Darres Who s Darres Oh he was the secretaire de la redaction and a sort of partner But I never liked him I gave him one look I told M Delacour not to trust him And he knew that I suspected him He admired me I could see that but he wasn t my kind of man a tall bullet headed fellow shoulders thrown well back the type of the sous officier le beau soudard smelling of the cafe and a cigarette A plain sensualist I can tell them at once and when he saw that I was not that kind of person he went and made love to Madame Delacour She was only too glad to listen to him Is Madame Delacour good looking I daresay she s what some people would call good looking But she has wretched health she never got over the birth of her last child Madame Delacour s health was the subject of many disparaging remarks in the course of which Mildred called into question the legitimacy of one of her children and the honourability of Darres as a card player The conversation at last turned on Panama M Delacour had of course denied the charge of blackmail and bribery Neither had been proved against him Nevertheless his constituency had refused to re elect him That of course had ruined him politically Nothing had been proved against him but he had merely failed to explain how he had lived at the rate of twelve thousand a year for the last three years But the paper The paper never was a pecuniary success The money you put into it I suppose is lost For the present at all events Things may right themselves Delacour may come up to the top of the wheel again He must have cheated you he swindled you I suppose he did but he was very hard pressed at the time He didn t know where to turn for money Harold was surprised by the gentleness of Mildred s tone You must give me the particulars and I ll do all that can be done to get back your money Now tell me how Yes you shall have all the particulars she said but I m afraid that you ll not be able to do much What were the conditions I cannot talk about them now I m too tired There was a petulant note in her voice which told Harold that it would be useless to question her He smoked his pipe and listened and in her low musical and so well modulated voice she continued her tale about herself M Delacour La Voix du Peuple and M Darres Her conversation was full of names and allusions to matters of which Harold knew nothing He failed to follow her tale and his thoughts reverted to the loss of three thousand pounds in the shocking Voix du Peuple and two thousand in scandalous Panama Every now and then something surprising in her tale caught his ear he asked for precise information but Mildred answered evasively and turned the conversation She was much more interested in the influence M Delacour had exercised over her She admitted that she had liked him very much and attributed the influence he had exercised to hypnotism and subordination of will She had however refused to run away with him when he had asked her You mean to say that he asked you to run away with him a married man Yes but I said no I knew that it would ruin him to run away with me I told him that he must not go away either with me or alone that he must face his enemies and overcome them I was a true friend It is most extraordinary You must have been very intimate for him to propose such a thing Yes we were very intimate but when it came to the point I felt that I couldn t Came to the point It was impossible to lead Mildred into further explanation and she spoke of the loss of the paper It had passed into the hands of M Darres he had changed the staff he had refused her articles that was the extraordinary part explained the unwisdom Darres had showed in his editorship The paper was now a wreck He had changed its policy and the circulation had sunk from sixty to twenty five thousand Harold cared nothing whether La Voix du Peuple was well or badly edited except so far as its prosperity promised hope of the recovery of the money Mildred had invested in it and he had begun to feel that the paper was not responsible for M Delacour s debts and that Mildred s money was lost irretrievably He was thinking of M Delacour and the proposal he had made to Mildred that they should go away together M Delacour a married man But his wife must have been aware of her husband s intimacy of his love for Mildred But wasn t Madame Delacour jealous of you of your intimacy with her husband She knew there was nothing wrong But she accused me of kissing her husband that was spite But it wasn t true No certainly it wasn t true I wonder you can ask me But after that it was impossible for me to stay any longer in the house Where is Madame Delacour is she with her husband No she s separated from him She s gone back to her own people She lives with them somewhere in the south near Pau I think She s not with Darres Mildred hesitated No she s not living with him but I daresay they see each other occasionally They can t see each other very often if she s living near Pau and he s editing a paper in Paris XX One morning after breakfast Harold said as he rose from table You must be very lonely here Don t you think you would like some one to keep you company missus Fargus is in London we might ask her she d be glad to come you used to like her That s a long while ago I don t think she d amuse me now She d talk about art about things that interest you I m away all day and when I come home in the evening I m tired I m no society for you I know that No Harold I assure you I m all right don t worry about me I shouldn t care to have missus Fargus here If I did I d say so I know that you re anxious to please me I like you better than any one else But I don t understand you Mildred We never did understand each other Our tastes are so different he added hastily lest his words might be construed into a reproach Oh yes we understand each other very well I used to think we didn t I don t think there s anything in me that any one could not understand I am afraid I m a very ordinary person But I can see that you re bored I don t mean that you show it But it would be impossible otherwise all alone in this house all day by yourself You used to read a great deal You never read now Are there any books I can bring you from London Do you want any paints canvases You haven t touched your paints since you ve been back You might have your drawing master here you might go out painting with him This is just the time of year I ve given up painting No Harold thank you all the same I know I m dull cheerless you mustn t mind me it is only a fit of the blues it will wear off One of these days I shall be all right But do you mind my asking people to the house Not if it pleases you But don t do so for me Harold looked at his watch I must say good bye now I ve only just time to catch the train That same evening brother and sister sat together in the library neither had spoken for some time and coming at the end of a long silence Mildred s voice sounded clear and distinct Alfred Stanby called here to day I wonder he did not call before There was a note of surprise in his voice which did not quite correspond with his words Did he stay long He stayed for tea Did you find him changed It must be five years since you met He has grown stouter What did he talk about Ordinary things He was very formal He was very much cut up when you broke off your engagement You never approved of it No but it was not for me that you broke it off No it wasn t on account of you The conversation paused At last Harold said Are you as indisposed as ever towards marriage If Alfred were to propose again would you have him I really don t know Do you want me to marry I m not very pleasant company I m well aware of that You know that I didn t mean that Mildred I don t want to press you into any marriage I ve always wished you to do what you like And I have done so I still want you to do what you like But I can t forget that if I were to die to morrow you would be practically alone in the world a few cousins But what makes you think of dying You re in as good health as ever I m forty three and father died when he was forty eight He died of heart disease I have suffered from my heart so it is not probable that I shall make very old bones If I were to die you would inherit everything What would become of this place of this business Isn t it natural that I should wish to see you settled in life You think that Alfred would be a suitable match Would you like to see me marry him There s nothing against him he s not very well off But he s got on while you ve been away He s making I should say now at least five hundred pounds a year That isn t much but to have increased his income from three to five hundred a year in five years proves that he is a steady man No one ever doubted Alfred s steadiness Mildred it is time to have done with those sneers I suppose it is I suppose what you say is right I ve been from pillar to post and nothing has come of it Perhaps I was only fitted for marriage after all And for what better purpose could a woman be fitted We won t discuss that subject Mildred answered If I m to marry any one as well Alfred as another It was the deeper question that perplexed Could she accept marriage at all And in despair she decided that things must take their chance If she couldn t marry when it came to the point why she couldn t if she married and found marriage impossible they would have to separate The experience might be an unpleasant one but it could not be more unpleasant than her present life which was driving her to suicide Marriage seemed a thing that every one must get through one of the penalties of existence Why it should be so she couldn t think but it was so Marriage was supposed to be for ever but nothing was for ever Even if she did marry she felt that it would not be for ever No it would not be for ever Further into the future she could not see nor did she care to look She remembered that she was not acting fairly towards Alfred But instead of considering that question she repelled it She had suffered enough suffering had made her what she was she must now think of herself She must get out of her present life marriage might be worse but it would be a change and change she must have Things must take their course she did not know whether she would accept or refuse but she was sure she would like him to propose He had loved her and as he had not married it was probable that he still loved her anyway she would like to find out He interested her yes in a way for she no longer understood him Five years are a long while he was practically a new man and she wondered if he had changed as much as she Perhaps he hated her Perhaps he had forgiven her Perhaps she was indifferent to him Perhaps his conventional politeness was the real man Perhaps no real man existed underneath it In that case the pursuit would not prove very exciting But she did not think that this was so She remembered certain traits of character certain looks Thinking of Alfred carried her back to the first years of her girlhood She was only eighteen when she first met him He was the first man who had kissed her and she had lain awake thinking of something which his sister Edith had told her Edith knew that she did not love a man to whom she was engaged because when he kissed her his kiss did not thrill her Alfred s kiss had not thrilled so far as Mildred could make out But she had admired his frock coat his gloves and his general bearing had seemed to her most gentlemanly not to say distinguished She had felt that she would never feel ashamed of him his appearance had flattered her girlish vanity and for nearly two years they had been engaged She remembered that she had not discovered any new attractions about him he had always remained at the frock coat and the gloves stage she remembered that she had on more than one occasion wearied of his society and suspected that there was little in him They had nevertheless very nearly been married when she was twenty But Harold had always been opposed to the match and at the bottom of her heart she had never cared much about it If she had she would have married him then The first stirring influence that had entered into her life was missus Fargus She could trace everything back to missus Fargus missus Fargus had awakened all that lay dormant in her desire of self realisation and although missus Fargus had not directly impugned marriage she had said enough to make her understand that it were possible to rebel against marriage and that in proclaiming antipathy to marriage she would win admiration and would in a measure distinguish herself And with the first discovery of a peculiarity of temperament Mildred had grown intensely interested in herself she remembered how day by day she had made new discoveries in herself how she had wondered at this being which was she Her faults at all times had especially interested her She remembered how frightened how delighted she had been when she discovered that she was a cruel woman She had not suspected this till the day she sat in the garden listening to Alfred s reproaches and expostulations She had thrilled at the thought that she could make a man so unhappy His grief was wonderful to witness and involuntary remarks had escaped her admirably designed to draw it forth to exhibit it she was sorry for him but in the background of her mind she could not help rejoicing the instinct of cruelty would not be wholly repressed But once the interview over she had thought very little of him there was little in his nature to attract hers nothing beyond the mere antagonism of opposites he was straightforward and gross she was complex and artificial But in her relations with Ralph there had been sympathy and affection she had felt sorry that she would not marry him and his death had come as a painful shock which had affected her life She had not been able to grieve for him as violently as she would have liked but she retained a very tender memory Tears sometimes rose to her eyes when she thought of him and that past in the National Gallery and in saint James Park For the sentiment of love if not its realisation was largely appreciated by Mildred and that a man should choose and failing to obtain should reject all else as inadequate was singularly attractive to her All the tenderness that her nature was capable of had vented itself in Ralph he had been so good to her so kind so unquestioning the time they had spent together had been peaceful and full of gentle inspiration she remembered and thought of him differently from the others His love had gratified her vanity but not grossly as Alfred s had done there had been no feeling of cruelty she would have been glad to have made him happy she would have done so if she had been able But at that time all her energy will and all her desire of personal fame were in art She had striven on the thorny and rocky hill till she could climb no more and then had crept away to Barbizon anxious to accept life unconditionally But life even as art had been refused to her She could not live as others lived she could only enjoy in her way and her way was not that of mankind She had liked Morton very dearly She had felt pleasure in his conversation in himself and moved by the warmth of the night she had been drawn to his side and as they strayed along the grass grown paths and had stooped under the mysterious darkness of the trees she had taken his arm affectionately conscious of the effect upon him but still taking it from personal choice and as they leaned over the broken paling at the bottom of the garden in front of the stars it had pleased her that he should put his arm round her take her face in his hand and to kiss her lips The forest too the enchantment of the tall trees and the enigma of the moonlight falling through the branches and lighting up the banks over which he helped her had wrought upon her imagination upon her nerves and there had been moments when she had thought that she could love him as other women loved Perhaps she ought to have told no one He was not altogether to blame and her eyes softened as she dwelt on the recollection It was not his fault nor her fault She could not control her moods and she was not responsible for what she said and did when they were upon her She had felt that she must leave Barbizon she had felt that she hated artists and studios and a force which she could not resist had drawn her towards the Delacours She remembered it all very well She did not blame Morton She had acted wrongly but it was fate Looking back she could honestly say that it was impossible for her to have acted otherwise Those moods of hers Delacour she had never cared about He had made love to her but she had done nothing wrong Madame Delacour knew that she had done nothing wrong and Mildred hated her for the accusation She accused me of kissing her husband Mildred reflected Mildred often liked to look the truth in the face but in this instance the truth was unpleasant to look in the face she shrank from it and excused herself She was at that time without hope everything had gone wrong with her She had to have a friend Moreover she had resolved to break off with M Delacour as soon as the Panama scandal had passed But owing to the accusations of that odious woman her life had suddenly fallen to pieces In two more years she would have mastered the French language and might have won some place for herself in literature But in English she could do nothing She hated the language It did not suit her No there was nothing for her now to do but to live at Sutton and look after her brother s house or marry After all her striving she found herself back at the point whence she had started she had accomplished the circle of life or nearly so To fulfil the circle she had to marry There was nothing in life except a little fruitless striving and then marriage If she did not accept marriage what should she do She was tired asking herself that question so she put it aside and applied herself day by day with greater diligence to the conquest of Alfred Their first letters were quite formal But one day Alfred was surprised by a letter beginning My dear mister Stanby He asked himself if the my was intentional or accidental and after some reflection began his letter My dear Miss Lawson A fortnight later he received a letter without the first line of usual address This seemed to him significant and he too omitted the first line and in signing changed the yours truly to yours always They wrote to each other two or three times a week and Alfred had frequent appointments with Mildred She wished to consult him about various things and made various pretexts for asking him to come and see her Her flirtations had hitherto been conducted by the aid of books and pictures But in Alfred s case books and pictures were not possible pretexts he knew nothing about either he played several instruments but could not talk music and her attempts to play his accompaniments seemed to estrange them Gardening and tennis she had to fall back upon and tennis meant the invitation of the young men and women of the neighbourhood and this did not coincide with Mildred s ideas her flirtations were severely private she was not herself in the presence of many people But she had to make the best of things and having set the young people of the neighbourhood playing their game she walked about the grounds with Alfred She had tried on several occasions to allude to the past the slightest allusion would precipitate a conclusion and destroy the sentiment of distrust that separated and rendered their companionship uncomfortable But Alfred persistently avoided all allusion to the past He was very attentive and clearly preferred her to other girls but their conversation was strictly formal and Mildred could not account for this discrepancy If he cared for her no longer why did he pay her so much attention If he did care for her why did he not tell her so The wall of formality with which he opposed her puzzled and irritated her Often she thought it would be well to abandon the adventure but at least in her flirtations she had not failed She recalled the number of her victims the young poets who used to come to see Helene none had ever hesitated between them She had only to hold up her little finger to get any one of them away from Helene It was strange that Alfred remained cold she knew he was not cold she remembered the storm of their interview when she broke off her engagement five years ago He had grown stouter he still wore a long black frock coat and now looked like a policeman His commonplace good looks had changed to a ponderous regularity of feature But Alfred was instinctively a gentleman and he made no allusion to her painting that might lead Mildred to suppose that he thought that she had failed That a young girl like Mildred should have chosen to live with such people as the Delacours worse still to have wasted a large part of her fortune in their shocking paper was a matter which he avoided as carefully as she would the Divorce Court in the presence of a man whose wife has just left him As for marrying Mildred he didn t know what to think She was a pretty woman and for him something of the old charm still lingered But his practical mind saw the danger of taking so flighty a minded person into the respectability of a British home He had loved her he still liked her he didn t mind admitting that but he was no longer a fool about her She had spent her money nearly all of it and he couldn t afford to marry a fortuneless girl She would be an heiress if her brother died and he might die at any moment he suffered from heart disease Alfred liked Harold and did not wish his death but if Harold did go off suddenly Alfred saw no reason why he should not ask Mildred to marry him He liked her as well as any other girl he thought he would make her a good husband he would be able to manage her better than any other man he was sure of that because he understood her She was a queer one but he thought they d get along all right But all this was in the future so long as Harold lived he d keep on just as he was if she met a man she liked better she could have him He had got on very well without her for the last five years there was no hurry he could afford to wait if she couldn t She had thrown him over to go to Paris to paint she had come back a failure and now she wanted him to marry because it suited her convenience She could wait Sometimes his mood was gentler If she did throw me over it wasn t for any other fellow she always had odd ideas It was because she was clever I never cared for any girl as I did for her By Jove I think I d sooner marry her than any one else I wish she hadn t spent all her money on that damned socialistic paper At the thought of the paper Alfred s face clouded and he remembered that Harold had gone into the house to get him a cigar he was longing for a smoke Mildred was standing at a little distance talking to a group of players who had just finished a set and he was about to ask her where her brother was when he thought he would go and look for Harold himself He passed up the lawn and entered the house by one of the bow windows He examined the pictures in the drawing room as do those to whom artistic work conveys no sense of merit He paid three hundred for that at the Academy I hear It does not look much a woman standing by a tree I suppose it is very good it must be good but I think one might find a better way of spending three hundred pounds And that landscape cost a hundred and fifty a lake and a few rushes not a figure in it I should have made the fellow put some figures in it before I paid all that money The frames are very handsome I wonder where that fellow has got to He must be worth six thousand a year people say eight but I always make a rule to deduct If he has six thousand a year he ought surely to give his only sister ten thousand pounds But that cigar I am dying for a smoke Where is he What s he doing all this while I ll try the smoking room The door was open and the first thing Alfred saw was Harold sitting in a strange crumpled up attitude on the sofa He sat with his back to the light and the room was lit only by one window But even so Alfred could distinguish the strange pallor Harold he called Harold Receiving no answer he stepped forward hastily and took the dead man by the shoulders Harold The cold of the dead hand answered him and Alfred said He s dead Then afraid of mistake he shook the corpse and looked into the glassy eyes and the wide open mouth By Jove He is dead there can be no doubt Heart disease He must have fallen just as he was opening the cigar box He was alive a quarter of an hour ago Perhaps he s not dead a couple of minutes Dead a couple of minutes or dead a thousand years it is all the same I must call some one I had better ring He laid his hand on the bell and then paused I hadn t thought of that She is an heiress now she is there s no doubt No one knows except me No one saw me enter the house no one I might slip out and propose to her I know she will accept me If I don t propose now my chance will be lost perhaps for ever You can t propose to a girl immediately after her brother s death particularly if his death makes her an heiress Then after the funeral she may go away She will probably go to London I wouldn t give two pence for my chance New influences Besides a girl with six thousand a year sees things in a very different light to a girl who has nothing or next to nothing even if it is the same girl I shall lose her if I don t propose now By Jove What a chance If I could only get out of this room without being seen Hateful room Curious place to choose to die in Appropriate too dark gloomy like a grave I won t have it as a smoking room I ll put the smoking room somewhere else I wish that butler would stop moving about and get back to his pantry Gad supposing he were to catch me I might be had up for murder Awful I had better ring the bell If I do I shall lose six thousand a year A terrible game to play but it is worth it Here comes the butler Alfred slipped behind the door and the servant passed up the passage without entering the room By heavens what a fool I am What have I done If I had been caught behind that door it would have gone hard with me There would have been nothing for it but to have told the truth that having accidentally found the brother dead I was anxious to turn the discovery to account by proposing to the sister I daresay I would be believed improbable that I had murdered him How still he does lie Suppose he were only shamming Oh he is dead enough I wish I were out of this room Everything seems quiet now I mustn t peep I must walk boldly out and take my chance Not a sound Alfred walked into the wide passage He avoided the boarded places selected the rugs and carpets to walk on and so made his way into the drawing room and hence on to the lawn Then he slipped down a secluded path and returned to the tennis players from a different side Where have you been I went for a stroll round the grounds I thought you would not like my cigar that was all Did Harold give you a cigar No I have not seen him Let s go into the smoking room and get one No thank you I really don t care to smoke I d sooner talk to you But you can do both Alfred did not reply and they walked down the pathway in silence Good Heavens he thought that cigar If she insists on going to the smoking room I must say something or she ll want to go and fetch a cigar But I can t think of anything How difficult it is to keep one s wits about one after what has happened Do let me fetch you a cigar No I assure you Miss Lawson that I do not want to smoke Let s play tennis Would you like to No I don t think I should I ve no racquet come for a walk instead I ll lend you my racquet You said you d like to play with me So I should another time but now come and walk round the garden with me I am so sorry I can t I have promised to play in this set it will look so rude if I leave my guests Never mind being rude it won t matter for once Do this for me Mildred looked up wistfully then she said Ethel and Mary do you play mister Bates and Miss Shield I will play in the next set I am a little tired The girls looked round knowingly and Mildred and Alfred Stanby walked towards the conservatories XXI Mildred sat in the long drawing room writing Not at the large writing table in front of the window but at an old English writing desk which had been moved from the corner where it had stood for generations She bent over the little table The paper shaded lamp shed a soft and mellow light upon her vaporous hair whitening the square white hands till they seemed to be part of the writing paper Once or twice she stopped writing and dashed tears from her eyes with a quick and passionate gesture and amid the rich shadows and the lines of light floating up the tall red curtains the soft Carlo Dolce like picture of the weary and weeping girl was impressive and beautiful The marble clock at length struck twelve short tingling sounds Mildred closed the blotting book Then she closed the ink stand and went up the high staircase to her room A sensation of chilliness of loneliness was about her and when she came to her door she entered her room abruptly as if she feared the dead man And standing in the middle of her room watching the yellow flame of the candle she thought of him She could see him pale and stark covered by a sheet the watchers on either side She would like to go to him but she feared the lonely passage And she sat watching the bright sky and without belief or even hope she wondered if Harold s spirit were far beyond those stars sitting with God in some auroral heaven amid aureoled saints and choirs of seraphim But this dream did not detain her thoughts They turned into remembrances of a kind hearted city man who went to town every day by the ten minutes past nine train who had taken the world as he found it and who unlike her had never sought to be what he was not Then her thoughts moved away from herself and she feared that she had been a great trial to him But regrets were vain there was no use regretting he was gone she would hear no more of the ten minutes past nine He would go to the city no more and in a few years he would be forgotten by every one but her How unutterably sad how unspeakably sad how unthinkingly sad it all seemed and oh how commonplace In a few years she too would be forgotten in a few years they would lie in the same ground forgotten it would be the same as if they had not lived at all How sad how infinitely sad how unthinkingly sad and yet how common place But what would happen in the few years that would intervene before she joined him in the earth What She had four thousand a year to dispose of as she pleased to do with as she liked but this fortune meant nothing to her She had always had as much money as she had wanted His purse had always been hers Money did not bring happiness at least it had not brought her happiness And less now than ever would it bring her happiness for she desired nothing she had lived her life there was nothing for her to do she had tried and failed She had tried everything except marriage Should she try that She had promised Alfred that she would marry him He had proposed to her that afternoon One man dying another proposing to marry That was life Every day the same situation At this very moment the same and the same will continue till the end of time What is it that forces us to live There is nothing to live for except trouble and misery and yet we must live What forces us to live What makes us live Enigma Nature whatever that may be forces us to live wills that we should live And I too like millions of others must live But how am I to live How am I to fill my life If we live we must find something to live for Take a studio and paint bad pictures I couldn t Go back to Paris and start a salon I wonder Then the desire to weep overcame her and so as to be able to surrender herself wholly to grief and tears she took off her gown and released herself of her stays She put on an old wrapper and threw herself upon the floor She threw herself over to this side and that when she got to her feet her pocket handkerchief was soaked and she stood perplexed and a little ashamed of this display of grief For she was quite conscious of its seeming artificiality Yet it was all quite real to her only not quite real as she would have had it be She had wept for herself and not for him But no it was not so she had wept for them both And she had taken off her gown not because she was afraid of spoiling it no such thought had crossed her brain she did not care if she spoilt her dress or fifty dresses like it no it was not on account of the dress but because she felt that she could find a fuller expression of grief in a loose wrapper than in a tight dress That was the truth she could not help things if they did seem a little incongruous It was not her fault she was quite sincere though her grief to a third person might seem a little artificial It was impossible to regret her brother more than she did She would never forget him no not if they buried him ever so deep She had been his little sister a long while they had been children together Since father and mother died they had been alone in the world They had not understood each other very well they were very different but that had not prevented them loving each other very dearly She did not know until this evening how dearly she loved him She sat down by the window took a pensive attitude and abandoned herself to the consideration of the pitifulness of life She could see her life from end to end Her father had died when she was quite a child but she preserved a distinct impression of his death She and her mother had come to pray by the bedside for a last time The face of the corpse was covered with a handkerchief and the nurse had warned her mother not to remove the handkerchief But in a paroxysm of grief her mother had snatched the handkerchief away and Mildred had been shocked by the altered face Though she had hidden her face in her hands the dead man s face had looked through and she had felt nothing but disgust Her mother s illness had been protracted she and Harold had known that she was going to die for at least six months before and they had come to talk about it as they would of the coming of summer or the approach of winter They had got so accustomed to the thought that they used to find themselves making plans as to where they should go for a change when all was over But when the day came Harold s resignation broke down he was whelmed in grief for days and weeks He had said to her Mildred if I had to remain here all day I should go mad it is my business in the city that keeps me alive Her mother was a simple old lady full of love for her children Mildred had despised her mother she had despised herself for her want of love and she had envied Harold his sincere love for his mother He had never but she had always been aware of her mother s absurdity and therefore could not grieve quite so sincerely as Harold She had known all the while that her mother s death did not matter much Very soon she would be forgotten even by Harold He could not always grieve for her She would become a faint memory occupying less and less of their thoughts exercising no perceptible influence upon their lives Mildred had always feared that she was without a heart and the suspicion that she was heartless had always troubled her In the course of their love quarrels Morton had told her that her failure in painting was owing to her having no heart She had felt that he was right She had not loved painting for its own sake but for the notoriety that she had hoped it would have brought her She had never been carried away She had tried to be religious she had changed her religion But she had never believed There was no passion in her heart for God and she had accepted literature just as she had accepted art She had cared for literature only in proportion as literature helped her to social success She had had to do something literature was something the Delacours were something their newspaper was something and the time in which her articles had appeared on the front page with her name at the bottom was the happiest in her life She was some one in the Delacours household she was the pretty English girl who wrote French so well She was some one no one knew exactly what a mysterious something a thing apart a thing in itself and for which there was no match She remembered the thrill of pleasure she had felt when some one said Je suis sur Mademoiselle quil n a fas une Francaise qui occupe la mime position a Londres que vous occupez a Paris Self had been her ruin she had never been able to get away from self no not for a single moment of her life All her love stories had been ruined and disfigured by self assertion not a great unconscious self in other words an instinct but an extremely conscious irritable mean and unworthy self She knew it all she was not deceived She could no more cheat herself than she could change herself that wretched self was as present in her at this moment as it had ever been she was as much a slave to herself as she had ever been and knowledge of her fault helped her nothing in its correction She could not change herself she would have to bear the burden of herself to the end Even now when she ought to be absorbed in grief for her brother s death she was thinking of herself of how she should live for live she must she did not know why she did not know how She had tried everything and failed and marriage stared her in the face as the only solution of the difficulty of her life She had promised Alfred Stanby to marry him that afternoon Should she keep that promise Could she keep that promise A thought fell into her mind Did Alfred know of her brother s death when he proposed to her She had heard something about a cigar Harold had gone to the house to fetch one A few minutes after she had seen Alfred walking towards the house Had he gone to the smoking room found Harold dead on the sofa and come and proposed to her It is my money and not myself that has tempted him back she cried and she looked down the long line of her lovers She had given her money to M Delacour But no he had loved her whatever the others might think she knew that was so She could have had the Comte de la Ferriere and how many others rich men too men to whom money was no consideration But she had come back to Sutton to be married for her money and to whom an old discarded lover XXII As she tossed to and fro the recollections of the day turned in her brain ticking loudly and she could see each event as distinctly as the figures on the dial of a great clock She saw the girls playing tennis and Alfred walking towards the house She did not see him enter the house it is true but she had met him coming from the house They had walked to the end of the garden and had sat down under the elms not very far from the spot where she had rejected him five years before His hesitations had amused her At last he had taken her hand and had asked her to marry him There had been something strange in his manner Something had struck her at the time but the impression passed in the pride of seeing him fall a prey to her enchantment But it was her money that he was thinking of all the while She wondered if she was accusing him unjustly and this led her into a long analysis of his character But all this thinking leads nowhere she cried throwing herself over in her hot bed The mere probability that a man should marry me for my money would poison my whole life But I shall have to marry some one I m weary of my present life and marriage is the only way of changing it I cannot live alone I d have to take a companion that would be odious I am not suited to marriage but from marriage there did not seem to be any escape All girls must marry rich and poor alike there seems no escape though it is impossible to say why I have tried all my life to find escape from marriage and here I am back at the same point Everything comes back to the same point in the end But whom am I to marry Alfred No I could not marry a man whom I suspected was marrying me for my money But how is one ever to know She thought of Morton and the remembrance of their life at Barbizon came upon her actively as the odour of the lilies He had loved her for herself he had only thought of her He had always been nice and she didn t know why she had spoken against him it wasn t her fault Nor did she know why she had run away from Barbizon Ah those nights at Barbizon those yellow moons shining upon the forest upon the mist in the fields and along the verge of the forest Ah how the scent of the fields and the forest used to fill their rooms at night sweet influences wonderful influences which she would never forget This present night reminded her of the Barbizon nights And as she got out of bed the sweetness of the syringa mingled with the sweetness of her body She took a scarf from her wardrobe and wound it about her because she feared a chill and because she wished to look well as she stood in front of the soft night calling upon her lover Come she said I m waiting for you Come oh my lover and you ll find me no longer cold I m a Juliet burning for Romeo s kisses My lover my husband come I have lived too long on the surface of things I want to know life to drink of life and with you Your Juliet awaits you delay not Romeo come now this very instant or come not at all for to morrow instead of living fire you may find dead ashes She held her arms to the night and the scents of night mingled with the passion of her bosom But a wind rustled the leaves in the garden and drawing the scarf tightly about her she said Should I have turned from him if he had come I wonder Why should the idea transport and the reality extinguish Why cannot I live in natural instinct I can I will Morton shall come back He has not married Rose Turner I should have heard of it if he had I ve only to hold up my finger and he will come back But if I did get him back and he did propose how do I know that it would not be for my money A love once dead cannot be revived nothing ever happens twice She crept back to her bed cold and despondent The passing passion she had felt for Morton was but a passing sensation of the summer night as transient as the snatches of perfume which the night wind carried into the room Again she cared for nothing in the world She did not know what was going to become of her the burden of life seemed so unbearable she felt so unhappy She lay quite still with her eyes wide open seeing the questions go round like the hands of a clock the very words sounded as loud and distinct in her brain as the ticking of a clock Her nerves were shattered and life grew terribly distinct in the insomnia of the hot summer night She threw herself over and over in her burning bed until at last her soul cried out of its lucid misery Give me a passion for God or man but give me a passion I cannot live without one JOHN NORTON I missus Norton walked with her quiet decisive step to the window and holding the gold rimmed glasses to her eyes she looked into the landscape The day was grimy with clouds mist had risen and it hung out of the branches of the elms like a grey veil She was a woman of forty five tall strongly built her figure setting to the squareness of middle age Her complexion was flushed and her cold grey eyes were close together above a long thin nose Her fashionably cut silk fitted perfectly the skirt was draped with grace and precision of style and the glossy shawl with the long soft fringe fell gracefully over her shoulders Surely she thought he cannot have been foolish enough to have walked over the downs such a day as this then raising her glasses again she looked out at the smallest angle with the wall of the house so that she should get sight of a vista through which any one coming from Shoreham would have to pass At that moment a silhouette appeared on the sullen sky missus Norton moved precipitately from the window and rang the bell James she said mister Hare has been going in for one of his long walks He is coming across the park I am sure he has walked over the downs if so he must be wet through Have a fire lighted and put out a pair of slippers for him Here is the key of mister Norton s wardrobe let mister Hare have what he wants And having detached a key from one of the many bunches which filled her basket missus Norton went herself to open the door to her visitor He was however still some distance away and it was not until he climbed the iron fence which separated the park from the garden grounds that the figure grew into its individuality into a man of about fifty about the medium height inclined to stoutness His white neck tie proclaimed him a parson and the grey mud with which his boots were bespattered told of his long walk You are quite right Lizzie you are quite right he said I shouldn t have done it Had I known what a state the roads were in I wouldn t have attempted it If you don t know what these roads are like in winter by this time you never will I never saw them in the state they are now such a slush of chalk and clay was never seen What can you expect after a month of heavy rain You are wringing wet Yes I was caught in a heavy shower as I was crossing over by Fresh Combe bottom I am certainly not in a fit state to come into your dining room I should think not indeed I really believe if I were to allow it you would sit the whole afternoon in your wet clothes You ll find everything ready for you in John s room I ll give you ten minutes I ll tell them to bring up lunch in ten minutes Stay will you have a glass of wine before going upstairs I am afraid of spoiling your carpet Yes indeed not one step further I ll fetch it for you When the parson had drunk the wine and was following the butler upstairs missus Norton returned to the dining room with the empty glass in her hand She placed it on the chimney piece she stirred the fire and her thoughts flowed pleasantly as she dwelt on the kindness of her old friend They had known each other since they were children and had lived for twenty years separated only by a strip of downland He only got my note this morning she mused I wonder if he will be able to persuade John to return home And now maturing her plans for getting her boy back she stood by the black mantelpiece her head leaning on her hand She uttered an exclamation when mister Hare entered What she said you haven t changed your things and I told you you would find a suit of John s clothes I must insist My dear Lizzie no amount of insistence would get me into a pair of John s trousers I am thirteen stone and a half and he is not much over ten Ah I had forgotten but what are you to do Something must be done you will catch your death of cold if you remain in your wet clothes You are wringing wet No I assure you I am not My feet were a little wet but I have changed my stockings and shoes And now tell me Lizzie what there is for lunch he said speaking rapidly to silence missus Norton who he saw was going to protest again There is chicken and some curried rabbit but I am afraid you will suffer for it if you remain the whole of the afternoon in those wet clothes I really cannot I will not allow it My dear Lizzie my dear Lizzie cried the parson laughing all over his rosy skinned and sandy whiskered face I must beg of you not to excite yourself Give me a wing of that chicken James I ll take a glass of sherry and while I am eating you shall explain the matter you are minded to consult me on and I will advise you to the best of my power and then start on my walk across the hills What you mean to say you are going to walk home We shall have another downpour presently I cannot come to much harm so long as I am walking whereas if I drove home in your carriage I might catch a chill It is at least ten miles to Shoreham by the road while across the hills it is not more than six Six it is eight if it is a yard Well perhaps it is but tell me I am curious to hear what you want to talk to me about Something about John is it not Of course it is what else have I to think about what else concerns middle aged people like you and me but our children Of course I want to talk to you about John Something must be done things cannot go on as they are Why it is nearly two years since he has been home Why does he not come and live at his own beautiful place Why does he not take up his position in the county He is not a magistrate Why does he not marry he is the last there is no one to follow him Do you think he ll never marry I m afraid not Does he give any reason He says that he s afraid that a woman might prove a disturbing influence in his life And what did you say to that I told him that he was the last and that it was his duty to marry I don t think that women present any attraction to him In a way that is a matter of congratulation I would much sooner he were wild like other young men Young men get over those kind of faults but he ll never get over his mister Hare looked as if he thought these opinions were of a doubtful orthodoxy He is quite different he said from other young men I never remember having seen him pay any woman the least attention When he speaks of women it is only to sneer He does that to annoy me Do you think so I was afraid it was owing to a natural dislike The conversation paused for a moment and then mister Hare said Have you had any news of him lately Yes he wrote yesterday but he did not speak of coming home What did he say He said he was meditating a book on the works of bishops and monks who wrote Latin in the early centuries He has put up a thirteenth century window in the chapel and he wants me to go up to London to make inquiries about organs He is prepared to go as far as a thousand pounds Did you ever hear of such a thing Those Jesuits are encouraging him Of course it would just suit them if he became a priest nothing would suit them better the whole property would fall into their hands Now what I want you to do my dear friend is to go to Stanton College to morrow or next day as soon as you possibly can and to talk to John You must tell him how unwise it is to spend fifteen hundred pounds in one year building organs and putting up windows His intentions are excellent but his estate won t bear such extravagances and everybody here thinks he is such a miser I want you to tell him that he should marry Just fancy what a terrible thing it would be if the estate passed away to distant relatives to those terrible cousins of ours This is very serious Yes it is very serious If it weren t very serious I should not have put you to the trouble of coming over here to day There was no trouble I was glad of the walk But I don t see how I am to advise you in this matter I don t want advice It is John who wants advice Will you go to Stanton College and talk to him What am I to say Tell him it is his duty to return home to settle down and marry I don t think John would listen to me it would not be prudent to speak to him in that way He is not the sort of man who allows himself to be driven But I might suggest that he should come home He certainly should come home for Christmas Very well Lizzie that s what I ll say I have not seen him for five years The last time he was here I was away I don t think it would be a bad notion to suggest that the Jesuits are after his money that they are endeavouring to inveigle him into the priesthood in order that they may get hold of his property No no you must not say such a thing I will not have you say anything against his religion I was very wrong to suggest such a thing I am sure no such idea ever entered the Jesuits heads Perhaps I am wrong to send you But I want you to try to get him to come home Try to get him to come home for Christmas II In large serpentine curves the road wound through a wood of small beech trees so small that in the November dishevelment the plantations were like brushwood and lying behind the wind swept opening were gravel walks and the green spaces of the cricket field with a solitary divine reading his breviary The drive turned and turned again in great sloping curves more divines were passed and then there came a terrace with a balustrade and a view of the open country The high red walls of the college faced bleak terraces a square tower squatted in the middle of the building and out of it rose the octagon of the bell tower and in the tower wall was the great oak door studded with great nails How Birmingham the whole place does look thought mister Hare as he laid his hand on an imitation mediaeval bell pull Is mister John Norton at home he asked when the servant came Will you give him my card and say that I should like to see him On entering mister Hare found himself in a tiled hall around which was built a staircase in varnished oak There was a quadrangle and from three sides latticed windows looked on greensward on the fourth there was an open corridor with arches to imitate a cloister All was strong and barren and only about the varnished staircase was there any sign of comfort There the ceiling was panelled in oak and the banisters the cocoa nut matting the bit of stained glass and the religious prints suggested a mock air of hieratic dignity And the room mister Hare was shown into continued this impression Cabinets in carved oak harmonised with high backed chairs glowing with red Utrecht velvet and a massive table on which lay a folio edition of saint Augustine s City of God and the Epistolae Consolitoriae of saint Jerome The bell continued to clang and through the latticed windows mister Hare watched the divines hurrying along the windy terrace and the tramp of the boys going to their class rooms could be heard in passages below Then a young man entered He was thin and he was dressed in black His face was Roman the profile especially was what you might expect to find on a Roman coin a high nose a high cheekbone a strong chin and a large ear The eyes were prominent and luminous and the lower part of the face was expressive of resolution and intelligence but the temples retreated rapidly to the brown hair which grew luxuriantly on the top of the head The mouth was large the lips were thick dim in colour undefined in shape The hands were large powerful and grasping they were earthly hands they were hands that could take and could hold and their materialism was curiously opposed to the ideality of the eyes an ideality that touched the confines of frenzy The shoulders were square and carried well back the head was round with close cut hair the straight falling coat was buttoned high and the fashionable collar with a black satin cravat beautifully tied and relieved with a rich pearl pin set another unexpected detail to an aggregate of apparently irreconcilable characteristics And how do you do my dear mister Hare Who would have expected to see you here I am so glad These words were spoken frankly and cordially and there was a note of mundane cheerfulness in the voice which did not quite correspond with the sacerdotal elegance of this young man Then he added quickly as if to save himself from asking the reason of this very unexpected visit You ll stay and dine I ll show you over the college you have never been here before Now I come to reckon it up I find I have not seen you for nearly five years It must be very nearly that I missed you the last time you were at Thornby Place and that was three years ago Three years It sounds very shocking doesn t it to have a beautiful place in Sussex and not to live there The conversation paused a moment and then John said But you did not travel two hundred miles to see Stanton College You have I fear messages for me from my mother It is at her request I am here Quite so You re here to advise me to return home and accept the marriage state It is only natural that your mother should wish you to marry Her determination to get me married is one of the reasons why I am here My mother will not recognise my right to live my life in my own fashion When she learns to respect my opinions I will return home I wish you would impress that upon her I wish you would try to get her to understand that I will tell your mother what you say It would be well for her to know why you choose to live here I agree with you that no one but ourselves can determine what duties we should accept Ah if you would only explain that to my mother You have expressed my feelings exactly I have no pity for those who take up burdens and then say they are not fitted to carry them And now that disagreeable matter is settled come and I will show you over the college The two men descended the staircase into the long stony corridor There were pictures along the walls of the corridor pictures of upturned faces and clasped hands and these drew words of commiseration for the artistic ignorance of the college authorities from John s lips And they actually believe that that dreadful monk with the skull is a real Ribera The chapel is on the right the refectory on the left Come let us see the chapel I am anxious to hear what you think of my window It ought to be very handsome it cost five hundred did it not No not quite so much as that John answered abruptly and then passing through the communion rails they stood under the multi coloured glory of three bishops mister Hare felt that a good deal of rapture was expected of him but in his efforts to praise he felt that he was exposing his ignorance John called his attention to the transparency of the green watered skies and turning their backs on the bishops the blue ceiling with the gold stars was declared all things considered to be in excellent taste The benches in the body of the church were for the boys the carved chairs set along both walls between the communion rails and the first steps of the altar were for the divines The president and vice president knelt facing each other The priests deacons and sub deacons followed according to their rank There were slenderer benches and these were for the choir and from the great gold lectern the leader conducted the singing The side altar with the Turkey carpet spread over the steps was saint George s and further on in an addition made lately there were two more altars dedicated respectively to the Virgin and saint Joseph The maid servants kneel in that corner I have often suggested that they should be moved out of sight Why would you remove them out of sight You will not deny their right to hear Mass Of course not But it seems to me that they would be better away They present a temptation where there are a number of young men about I have noticed that some of the young men look round when the maid servants come into church I have overheard remarks too I know not what attraction they can find in such ugliness It is beastly Maid servants are not attractive but if they were princesses you would dislike them equally The severest moralists are those who have never known the pain of temptation Perhaps the severest moralists are those who have conquered their temptations Then you have been tempted John s face assumed a thoughtful expression and he said I m not going to tell you my inmost soul This I can say if I have had temptations I have conquered them They have passed away The conversation paused and in a silence which was pregnant with suggestion they went up to the organ loft and he depreciated the present instrument and enlarged upon some technical details anent the latest modern improvements in keys and stops He would play his setting of saint Ambrose s hymn Veni redemptor gentium if mister Hare would go to the bellows and feeling as if he were being turned into ridicule mister Hare took his place at the handle In the sacristy the consideration of the censers candle sticks chalices and albs took some time and John was a little aggressive in his explanation of Catholic ceremonial and its grace and comeliness compared with the stiffness and materialism of the Protestant service Handsome lads of sixteen were chosen for acolytes the torch bearers were selected from the smallest boys the office of censer was filled by himself and he was also the chief sacristan and had charge of the altar plate and linen and the vestments In answer to mister Hare who asked him if he did not weary of the narrowness of ecclesiastical life John said that when the desire of travel came upon him he had to consult no one s taste or convenience but his own merely to pack his portmanteau Last year he had been through Russia and had enjoyed his stay in Constantinople And while speaking of the mosques he said that he had had an ancestor who had fought in the crusades Perhaps it was from him he had inherited his love and comprehension of Byzantine art he did not say so but it might be so one of the mysteries of atavism Who shall say where they end You would have liked to have fought in the crusades Yes I think that I should have made a good knight The hardships they underwent were no doubt quite extraordinary But I am strong my bones are heavy my chest is deep I can bear a great deal of fatigue Then laughing lightly he said You can t imagine me as a knight on the way to the Grail Why not I think you would have acquitted yourself very well The crusades were once as real in life as tennis parties are to day and I think infinitely more beautiful You would not have fought in the tournaments for a lady love Perhaps not I should have fought for the Grail like Parsifal I was at Bayreuth last year But Bayreuth is no longer what it was Popular innovations have been introduced into the performances Would you believe it the lovely music in the cupola written by Wagner for boys voices is now sung by women Surely a woman s voice is finer than a boy s It is more powerful of course but it has not the same quality the timbre is so much grosser Besides women s voices are opposed to the ecclesiastical spirit How closely you do run your hobby No in art I have no prejudices I recognise the beauty of a woman s voice in its proper place in opera It is as inappropriate to have Palestrina sung by women as it would be to have Brunnhilde and Isolde sung by boys at least so it seems to me I was at Cologne last year that is the only place where you can hear Palestrina I was very lucky I heard the great Mass the Mass of Pope Marcellus Wagner s music in the cupola is very lovely but it does not compare with Palestrina From the sacristy they went to the boys library and while affecting to take an interest in the books mister Hare continued to encourage John to talk of himself Did he never feel lonely No I do not know what it is to feel lonely In the morning I write I ride in the afternoon I read in the evening I read a great deal literature and music But when you go abroad you go alone do you feel no need of a companion Do you never make acquaintances when you go abroad People don t interest me I am interested in things much more than in people in pictures in music in sculpture When I m abroad I like the streets I like to see people moving about I like to watch the spectacle of life but I do not care to make acquaintances As I grow older it seems to me that a process of alienation is going on between me and others They stopped on the landings of the staircases they lingered in the passages and speaking of his admiration of the pagan world John said It knew how to idealise it delighted in the outward form but it raised it invested it with a sense of aloofness You know what I mean He looked inquiringly at mister Hare and gesticulating with his fingers said You know what I mean A beyond Yes that s the word a beyond There must be a beyond In Wagner there is none That is his weakness He is too perfect Never since the world began did an artist realise himself so completely He achieved all he desired therefore something is wanting A beyond is wanting I do not say that I have changed my opinion regarding Wagner I still admire him but I no longer accept his astonishing ingenuities for inspiration No I m not afraid to say it I bar nearly the whole first act of Parsifal For instance Gurnemanz s long narrative into which is introduced all the motives of the opera is merely beautiful musical handicraft and I cannot accept handicraft however beautiful for inspiration I rank much higher the entrance of Kundry her evocation of Arabia That is a real inspiration The over praised choruses are beautiful but again I have to make reservations These choruses are you know divided into three parts The chorus of the knights is ordinary enough the chorus of the young men I like better but I can only give my unqualified admiration to the chorus of the children Again the chorus of the young girls in the second act is merely beautiful writing and there is no real inspiration until we get to the great duet between Kundry and Parsifal The moment Kundry calls to Parsifal Parsifal Remain those are the words I think Wagner inspiration begins then he is profound then he says interesting things John opened the door of his room In the centre of the floor was an oak table a table made of sharp slabs of oak laid upon a frame that was evidently of ancient design probably early German a great gold screen sheltered a high canonical chair with elaborate carvings and on a reading stand close by lay the manuscript of a Latin poem The parson looked round for a seat but the chairs were like cottage stools on high legs and the angular backs looked terribly knife like Shall I get you a pillow from the next room Personally I cannot bear upholstery I cannot conceive anything more hideous than a padded armchair All design is lost in that infamous stuffing Stuffing is a vicious excuse for the absence of design If upholstery were forbidden by law to morrow in ten years we should have a school of design Then the necessity of composition would be imperative I daresay there is a good deal in what you say but tell me don t you find these chairs very uncomfortable Don t you think that you would find a good comfortable arm chair very useful for reading purposes No I should feel far more uncomfortable on a cushion than I do on this bit of hard oak Our ancestors had an innate sense of form that we have not Look at these chairs nothing can be plainer a cottage stool is hardly more simple and yet they are not offensive to the eye I had them made from a picture by Albert Durer mister Hare smoked in silence uncertain how far John was in earnest how far he was assuming an attitude of mind Presently he walked over to the book cases There were two one was filled with learned looking volumes bearing the names of Latin authors and the parson who prided himself on his Latinity was surprised and a little nettled to find so much ignorance proved upon him With Tertullian saint Jerome and saint Augustine he was acquainted but of Lactantius Hibernicus Exul Angilbert he was obliged to admit he knew nothing even the names were unknown to him In the book case on the opposite side of the room there were complete editions of Landor and Swift then came two large volumes on Leonardo da Vinci Raising his eyes the parson read through the titles Browning s works Tennyson in a cheap seven and six edition Swinburne Pater Rossetti Morris two novels by Rhoda Broughton Dickens Thackeray Fielding and Smollett the complete works of Balzac Gautier s Emaux et Camees Salammbo L Assommoir Carlyle Newman Byron Shelley Keats and the dramatists of the Restoration At the end of a long silence mister Hare said glancing once again at the Latin authors and walking towards the fire Tell me John are those the books you are writing about Supposing you explain to me in a few words the line you are taking Your mother tells me that you intend to call your book the History of Christian Latin Yes I had thought of using that title but I am afraid it is a little too ambitious To write the history of a literature extending over at least eight centuries would entail an appalling amount of reading and besides only a few say a couple of dozen writers out of some hundreds are of the slightest literary interest and very few indeed of any real aesthetic value Ah he said as his eye lighted on a certain name here is Marbodius a great poet how well he understood women Listen to this Femina dulce malum pariter favus atque venenum Melle linens gladium cor confodit et sapientum Quis suasit primo vetitum gustare parenti Femina Quis partem natas vitiare coegit Femina Quis fortem spoliatum crine peremit Femina Quis justi sacrum caput ense recidit Femina quae matris cumulavit crimine crimen Incestum gravem graviori caede notavit Chimeram Cui non immerito fertur data forma triformis Nam pars prima leo pars ultima cauda draconis Et mediae partes nil sunt nisi fervidus ignis Well of course that quite carries out your views of women And now tell me what I am to say to your mother Will you come home for Christmas I suppose I must I suppose it would seem unkind if I didn t I wonder why I dislike the place I cannot think of it without a revulsion of feeling I won t argue that point with you but I think you ought to come home Why come home Come home and marry my neighbour s daughter one of those Austin girls for instance Fancy my settling down to live with one them and undertaking to look after her all my life walking after her carrying a parasol and a shawl Don t you see the ludicrous side I always see a married man carrying a parasol and a shawl a parasol and a shawl the symbols of his office John laughed loudly The swinging of a censer and the chanting of Latin responses are equally absurd if Do you think so Ritual is surely not the whole of religion No But we were speaking of several rituals and Catholic ritual seems to me more dignified than that of the shawl and parasol The social life of the nineteenth century that is to say drawing rooms filled with half dressed women present no attraction for me You and my mother think because I do not wish to marry and spend some small part of my time in this college that I intend to become a priest Marry and bring up children or enter the Church There is nothing between so you say having regard for my Catholicism But there is an intermediate state the onlooker However strange it may seem to you I do assure you that no man in the world has less vocation for the priesthood than I I am merely an onlooker the world is my monastery I am an onlooker Is not that a very selfish attitude My attitude is this There is a mystery No one denies that An explanation is necessary and I accept the explanation offered by the Roman Catholic Church I obey Her in all her instruction for the regulation of life I shirk nothing I omit nothing I allow nothing to come between me and my religion Whatever the Church says I believe and so all responsibility is removed from me But this is an attitude of mind which you as a Protestant cannot sympathise with I know my dear John I know your life is not a dissolute one but your mother is very anxious remember you are the last Is there no chance of your ever marrying I fear I am not suited to married life There is a better and a purer life to lead an inner life coloured and permeated with feelings and tones that are intensely our own He who may live this life shrinks from any adventitious presence that might jar it Maybe it certainly would take too long to discuss I should miss my train But tell me are you coming home for Christmas Yes yes I have some estate business to see to I shall be home for Christmas As for your train will find out all about your train presently you must stay to dinner III I was very much alarmed my dear John about your not sleeping mister Hare told me you said that you went two or three nights without closing your eyes and that you had to have recourse to sleeping draughts Not at all mother I never took a sleeping draught but twice in my life Well you don t sleep well and I am sure it is those college beds But you will be far more comfortable here You are in the best bedroom in the house the one in front of the staircase the bridal chamber and I have selected the largest and softest feather bed in the house My dear mother if there is one thing more than another I dislike it is a feather bed I should not be able to close my eyes I beg of you to have it taken away missus Norton s face flushed I cannot understand John it is absurd to say that you cannot sleep on a feather bed mister Hare told me you complained of insomnia and there is no surer way of losing your health It is owing to the hardness of those college mattresses whereas in a feather bed There is no use in our arguing that point mother I say I cannot sleep on a feather bed But you have not tried one I don t believe you ever slept on a feather bed in your life Well I am not going to begin now We haven t another bed aired and it is really too late to ask the servants to change your room Well then I shall be obliged to sleep at the hotel in Henfield You should not speak to your mother in that way I will not have it There you see we are quarrelling already I did wrong to come home It was not to please me that you came home You were afraid if you didn t you mightn t find another tenant for the Beeding farm You were afraid you might have it on your hands It was self interest that brought you home Don t try to make me believe it wasn t Then the conversation drifted into angry discussion You are not even a J P but there will be no difficulty about that you must make application to the Lord Lieutenant You have not seen any of the county people for years We ll have the carriage out some day this week and we ll pay a round of visits We ll do nothing of the kind I have no time for visiting I must get on with my book I hope to finish my study of saint Augustine before I leave here I have my books to unpack and a great deal of reading to get through I have done no more than glance at the Anglo Latin Literature died in France with Gregory of Tours at the end of the sixth century with saint Gregory the Great in Italy at the commencement of the seventh century in Spain about the same time And then the Anglo Saxons became the representatives of the universal literature All this is most important I must re read saint Aldhelm Now sir we have had quite enough of that and I would advise you not to go on with any of that nonsense here you will be turned into dreadful ridicule That s just why I wish to avoid them Just fancy my having to listen to them What is the use of growing wheat when we are only getting eight pounds ten a load But we must grow something and there is nothing else but wheat We must procure a certain amount of straw or we d have no manure I don t believe in the fish manure But there is market gardening and if we kept shops at Brighton we could grow our own stuff and sell it at retail price And then there is a great deal to be done with flowers Now sir that will do that will do How dare you speak to me so I will not allow it And then relapsing into an angry silence missus Norton drew her shawl about her shoulders Why will she continue to impose her will upon mine Why has she not found out by this time the uselessness of her effort She hopes at last to wear me down She wants me to live the life she has marked out for me to live to take up my position in the county and above all to marry and give her an heir to the property I see it all that is why she wanted me to spend Christmas with her that is why she has Kitty Hare here to meet me How cunning how mean women are a man would not do that Had I known it I have a mind to leave to morrow I wonder if the girl is in the little conspiracy And turning his head he looked at her Tall and slight a grey dress pale as the wet sky fell from her waist outward in the manner of a child s frock There was a lightness there was brightness in the clear eyes The intense youth of her heart was evanescent it seemed constantly rising upwards like the breath of a spring morning The face sharpened to a tiny chin and the face was pale although there was bloom on the cheeks The forehead was shadowed by a sparkling cloud of brown hair the nose was straight and each little nostril was pink tinted The ears were like shells There was a rigidity in her attitude She laughed abruptly perhaps a little nervously and the abrupt laugh revealed the line of tiny white teeth Thin arms fell straight to the translucent hands and there was a recollection of Puritan England in look and in gesture Her picturesqueness calmed John s ebullient discontent he decided that she knew nothing of and was not an accomplice in his mother s scheme And for the sake of his guest he strove to make himself agreeable during dinner but it was clear that he missed the hierarchy of the college table The conversation fell repeatedly missus Norton and Kitty spoke of making syrup for bees and their discussion of the illness of poor doctor who would no longer be able to get through the work of the parish single handed and would require a curate was continued till the ladies rose from the table Nor did matters mend in the library The room seemed to him intolerably uncomfortable and ugly and he went to the billiard room to smoke a cigar It was not clear to him that he would be able to spend two months in Thornby Place If every evening passed like the present it were a modern martyrdom But had they removed the feather bed He went upstairs The feather bed had been removed But the room was draped with many curtains pale curtains covered with walking birds and falling petals a sort of Indian pattern There was a sofa at the foot of the bed and a toilet table hung out its skirts in the light of the fire He thought of his ascetic college bed of the great Christ upon the wall of the prie dieu with the great rosary hanging To lie in this great bed seemed ignoble and he could not rid his mind of the distasteful feminine influences which had filled the day and which now haunted the night After breakfast next morning missus Norton stopped John as he was going upstairs to unpack his books Now she said you must go out for a walk with Kitty Hare and I hope you will make yourself agreeable I want you to see the new greenhouse I have put up she ll show it to you And I told the bailiff to meet you in the yard I thought you would like to see him I wish mother you would not interfere in my business had I wanted to see Burns I should have sent for him If you don t want to see him he wants to see you There are some cottages on the farm that must be put into repair at once As for interfering in your business I don t know how you can talk like that were it not for me the whole place would be falling to pieces Quite true I know you save me a great deal of expense but really Really what You won t go out to walk with Kitty Hare I did not say I wouldn t but I must say that I am very busy just now I had thought of doing a little reading for I have an appointment with my solicitor in the afternoon That man charges you two hundred pounds a year for collecting the rents now if you were to do it yourself you would save the money and it would give you something to do Something to do I have too much to do as it is But if I am going out with Kitty I may as well go at once Where is she I saw her go into the library a moment ago It was preferable to go for a walk with Kitty than to continue the interview with his mother John seized his hat and called Kitty Kitty Kitty Presently she appeared and they walked towards the garden talking She told him she had been at Thornby Place the whole time the greenhouse was being built and when they opened the door they were greeted by Sammy He sprang instantly on her shoulder This is my cat she said I ve fed him since he was a little kitten isn t he sweet The girl s beauty appeared on the brilliant flower background and the boyish slightness of her figure led John to think of a statuette done in a period of Greek decadence Others he thought would only see her as a somewhat too thin example of English maidenhood I see her quite differently And when her two tame rooks alighted at her feet he said I wonder how you can let them come near you Why not don t you like birds No they frighten me there s something electric about birds Poor little things they fell out of the nest before they could fly and I brought them up You don t care for pets I don t like birds I couldn t sit in a room with a large bird There s something in the sensation of feathers I can t bear Don t like birds Why that seems as if you said that you didn t like flowers And while the young squire talked to his bailiff Kitty fed her rooks They cawed and flew to her hand for the scraps of meat The coachman came to speak about oats and straw They went to the stables Kitty adored horses and it amused John to see her pat them and her vivacity and light heartedness rather pleased him than otherwise Nevertheless during the whole of the following week the ladies held little communication with John In the morning he went out with his bailiffs to inspect farms and consult about possible improvement and necessary repairs He had appointments with his solicitor There were accounts to be gone through He never paid a bill without verifying every item At four o clock he came in to tea his head full of calculations of such complex character that even his mother could not follow the different statements to his satisfaction When she disagreed with him he took up the Epistles of saint Columban of Bangor the Epistola ad Sethum or the celebrated poem Epistola ad Fedolium written when the saint was seventy two and continued his reading making copious notes in a pocket book IV On the morning of the meet of the hounds he was called an hour earlier He drank a cup of tea and ate a piece of dry toast in a back room The dining room was full of servants who laid out a long table rich with comestibles and glittering with glass missus Norton and Kitty were upstairs dressing He wandered into the drawing room and viewed the dead cumbrous furniture the two cabinets bright with brass and veneer He stood at the window staring It was raining The yellow of the falling leaves was hidden in grey mist This weather will keep many away so much the better there will be too many as it is I wonder who this can be A melancholy brougham passed up the drive There were three old maids all looking sweetly alike one was a cripple who walked with crutches and her smile was the best and the gayest imaginable smile How little material welfare has to do with our happiness thought John There is one whose path is the narrowest and she is happier and better than I And then the three sweet old maids talked with their cousin of the weather and they all wondered a sweet feminine wonderment if he would see a girl that day whom he would marry Presently the house was full of people The passage was full of girls a few men sat at breakfast at the end of the long table Some red coats passed The huntsman stopped in front of the house the dogs sniffed here and there the whips trotted their horses and drove them back Get together get together get back there Woodland Beauty come up here The hounds rolled on the grass and leaned their fore paws on the railings willing to be caressed Now John try and make yourself agreeable go over and talk to some of the young ladies Why do you dress yourself in that way Have you no other coat You look like a young priest Look at that young man over there how nicely dressed he is I wish you would let your moustache grow it would improve you immensely With these and similar remarks whispered to him missus Norton continued to exasperate her son until the servants announced that lunch was ready Take in missus So and so she said to John who would fain have escaped from the melting glances of the lady in the long seal skin He offered her his arm with an air of resignation and set to work valiantly to carve a large turkey As soon as the servants had cleared away after one set another came and although the meet was a small one John took six ladies in to lunch About half past three the men adjourned to the billiard room to smoke The numerous girls followed and with their arms round each other s waists and interlacing fingers they grouped themselves about the room At five the huntsmen returned and much to his annoyance John had to furnish them with a change of clothes There was tea in the drawing room and soon after the visitors began to take their leave The wind blew very coldly the roosting rooks rose out of the branches and the carriages rolled into the night but still a remnant of visitors stood on the steps talking to John He felt very ill and now a long sharp pain had grown through his left side and momentarily it became more and more difficult to exchange polite words and smiles The footmen stood waiting by the open door the horses champed their bits the green of the park was dark and a group of girls moved about the loggia wheels grated on the gravel all were gone The butler shut the door and John went to the library fire There his mother found him She saw that something was seriously the matter He was helped up to bed and the doctor sent for For more than a week he suffered He lay bent over unable to straighten himself as if a nerve had been wound up too tightly in the left side He was fed on gruel and beef tea the room was kept very warm it was not until the twelfth day that he was taken out of bed You have had a narrow escape the doctor said to John who well wrapped up lay back looking very pale and weak before a blazing fire It was lucky I was sent for Twenty four hours later I would not have answered for your life I was delirious was I not Yes you cursed and swore fearfully at us when we rolled you up in the mustard plaster It was very hot and must have burnt you It has scarcely left a bit of skin on me But did I use very bad language I suppose I could not help it I was delirious was I not Yes slightly I remember and if I remember right I used very bad language But people when they are delirious do not know what they say Is not that so doctor If they are really delirious they do not remember but you were only slightly delirious you were maddened by the pain occasioned by the pungency of the plaster Yes but do you think I knew what I was saying You must have known what you were saying because you remember what you said But could I be held accountable for what I said Accountable Well I hardly know what you mean You were certainly not in the full possession of your senses Your mother missus Norton was very much shocked but I told her that you were not accountable for what you said Then I could not be held accountable I did not know what I was saying I don t think you did exactly people in a passion don t know what they say Ah yes but we are answerable for sins committed in the heat of passion we should restrain our passion we were wrong in the first instance in giving way to passion But I was ill it was not exactly passion And I was very near death I had a narrow escape doctor Yes I think I can call it a narrow escape The voices ceased The curtains were rosy with lamp light and conscience awoke in the languors of convalescent hours I stood on the verge of death The whisper died away John was still very weak and he had not strength to think with much insistence but now and then remembrance surprised him suddenly like pain it came unexpectedly he knew not whence or how but he could not choose but listen Was he responsible for those words He could remember them all now each like a burning arrow lacerated his bosom and he pulled them to and fro He could now distinguish the instantaneous sensation of wrong that had flashed on his excited mind in the moment of his sinning Then he could think no more and in the twilight of contrition he dreamed vaguely of God s great goodness of penance of ideal atonements And as strength returned remembrance of his blasphemies grew stronger and fiercer and often as he lay on his pillow his thoughts passing in long procession his soul would leap into intense suffering I stood on the verge of death with blasphemies on my tongue I might have been called to confront my Maker with horrible blasphemies in my heart and on my tongue but He in His Divine goodness spared me He gave me time to repent Am I answerable O my God for those dreadful words that I uttered against Thee because I suffered a little pain against Thee who once died on the cross to save me O God Lord in Thine infinite mercy look down on me on me Vouchsafe me Thy mercy O my God for I was weak My sin is loathsome I prostrate myself before Thee I cry aloud for mercy Then seeing Christ amid His white million of youths beautiful singing saints gold curls and gold aureoles lifted throats and form of harp and dulcimer he fell prone in great bitterness on the misery of earthly life His happiness and ambitions appeared to him less than the scattering of a little sand on the sea shore Joy is passion passion is suffering we cannot desire what we possess therefore desire is rebellion prolonged indefinitely against the realities of existence when we attain the object of our desire we must perforce neglect it in favour of something still unknown and so we progress from illusion to illusion The winds of folly and desolation howl about us the sorrows of happiness are the worst to bear and the wise soon learn that there is nothing to dream of but the end of desire God is the one ideal the Church the one shelter from the incurable misery of life The life of the cloister is far from the meanness of life And oh the voices of chanting boys the cloud of incense and the Latin hymn afloat on the tumult of the organ In such religious aestheticisms the soul of John Norton had long slumbered but now it awoke in remorse and pain and repulsing its habitual exaltations as if they were sins he turned to the primal idea of the vileness of this life and its sole utility in enabling man to gain heaven A pessimist he admitted himself to be so far as this world was concerned But the manifestations of modern pessimism were checked by constitutional mysticity Schopenhauer when he overstepped the line ruled by the Church was repulsed From him John Norton s faith had suffered nothing the severest and most violent shocks had come from another side a side which none would guess so complex and contradictory are the involutions of the human brain Hellenism Greek culture and ideal academic groves young disciples Plato and Socrates the august nakedness of the Gods were equal or almost equal in his mind with the lacerated bodies of meagre saints and his heart wavered between the temple of simple lines and the cathedral of a thousand arches Once there had been a sharp struggle but Christ not Apollo had been the victor and the great cross in the bedroom of Stanton College overshadowed the beautiful slim body in which Divinity seemed to circulate like blood and this photograph was all that now remained of much youthful anguish and much temptation A fact to note is that his sense of reality had always remained in a rudimentary state it was as it were diffused over the world and mankind For instance his belief in the misery and degradation of earthly life and the natural bestiality of man was incurable but of this or that individual he had no opinion he was to John Norton a blank sheet of paper to which he could not affix even a title His childhood had been one of tumult and sorrow the different and dissident ideals growing up in his heart and striving for the mastery had torn and tortured him and he had long lain as upon a mental rack Ignorance of the material laws of existence had extended even into his sixteenth year and when bit by bit the veil fell and he understood he was filled with loathing of life and mad desire to wash himself free of its stain and it was this very hatred of natural flesh that had precipitated a perilous worship of deified flesh But the Gothic cathedral had intervened he had been taken by the beauty of its architecture and the beauty of its Gregorian chant But now he realised if not in all its truth at least in part that his love of God had only taken the form of a gratification of the senses a sensuality higher but as intense as those which he so much reproved His life had been but a sin an abomination And as a woman rising from a bed of small pox shrinks from destroying the fair remembrance of her face by pursuing the traces of the disease through every feature he hid his face in his hands and called for forgiveness for escape from the endless record of his conscience He saw the Hell which awaits him who blasphemes To the verge of that Hell he had drifted He pictured himself lost in eternal torment The Christ he saw had grown pitiless He saw Christ standing in judgment amid a white million of youths Too weak to think clearly he sat dreaming The blazing fire decorated the darkness and the twilight shed upon curtains purfled with birds and petals He sat his head resting on his large strong fingers pining for sharp edged mediaeval tables and antique lamps The soft diffused light of the paper shaded lamp jarred his intimate sense of things However dim the light of his antique lamps their beautiful shapes were always an admonition and took his thoughts back to the age he loved an age of temples and disciples Recollection of Plato floated upon his weak brain and he remembered that the great philosopher had said that there were men who were half women and that these men must perforce delight in the society of women That there were men too who were wholly men and that these perforce could find neither pleasure nor interest away from their own sex He had always felt himself to be wholly male and this was why the present age so essentially the age of women was repellent to him His thoughts floated from Greece to Palestine and looking into the blaze he saw himself bearing the banner of the Cross into the land of the infidel fighting with lance and sword for the Sepulchre He saw the Saracen and trembling with aspiration he heard the great theme of salvation to the Saviour sung by the basses by the tenors by the altos it was held by a divine boy s voice for four bars high up in the cupola and the belief theme in harp arpeggios rained down like manna on the bent heads of the knights Awaking a little his thoughts returned to the consideration of his present condition He had been ill death had been by his bedside and in that awful moment he had blasphemed He could conceive nothing more terrible and he thanked God for his great mercy If worldly life was a peril he must fly from that peril the salvation of his soul must be his first consideration His thoughts lapsed into dreams dreams of aisle and cloister arches and legended panes Palms rose in great curls like the sky and beautiful harmonies of voices were gathered together grouped and single voices now the white of the treble now the purple of the bass and these the souls of the carven stone like birds hovering like birds in swift flight like birds poising floated from the arches Then the organ intoned the massive Gregorian and the chant of the mass moved amid the opulence of gold vestments the Latin responses filled the ear and at the end of long abstinences the holy oil came like a bliss that never dies In the ecstasy of ordination it seemed to him that the very savour and spirit of God had descended upon him V missus Norton flung her black shawl over her shoulders rattled her keys and scolded the servants at the end of the long passage Kitty as she watered the flowers in the greenhouse often wondered why John had chosen to become a priest and grieve his mother One morning as she stood watching the springtide she saw him walking up the drive the sky was bright with summer hours and the beds were catching flower beneath the evergreen oaks She ran to missus Norton who was attending to the canaries in the bow window Look look missus Norton John is coming up the drive it is he look John said missus Norton seeking for her glasses nervously yes so it is let s run and meet him But no let s take him rather coolly I believe half his eccentricity is only put on because he wishes to astonish us We won t ask him any questions we ll just wait and let him tell his own story How do you do mother said the young man kissing missus Norton with less reluctance than usual You must forgive me for not having answered your letters It really was not my fault And how do you do Kitty Have you been keeping my mother company ever since It is very good of you I am afraid you must think me a very undutiful son But what is the news One of the rooks is gone Is that all What about the ball at Steyning I hear it was a great success Oh it was delightful You must tell me about it after dinner Now I must go round to the stables and tell Walls to fetch my things from the station Are you going to be here for some time said missus Norton with an indifferent air Yes I think so that is to say for a couple of months six weeks I have some arrangements to make but I will speak to you about all that after dinner With these words John left the room and he left his mother agitated and frightened What can he mean by having arrangements to make she asked Kitty could of course suggest no explanation and the women waited the pleasure of the young man to speak his mind He seemed however in no hurry to do so and the manner in which he avoided the subject aggravated his mother s uneasiness At last she said unable to bear the suspense any longer Have you had a quarrel with the Jesuits Not exactly a quarrel but the order is so entirely opposed to the monastic spirit What I mean is well their worldliness is repugnant to me fashionable friends confidences meddling in family affairs dining out letters from ladies who need consolation I don t mean anything wrong pray don t misunderstand me I merely mean to say that I hate their meddling in family affairs Their confessional is a kind of marriage bureau they have always got some plan on for marrying this person to that and I must say I hate all that sort of thing If I were a priest I would disdain to but perhaps I am wrong to speak like that Yes it is very wrong of me and before Kitty you must not think I am speaking against the principles of religion I am only speaking of matters of And have you given up your rooms in Stanton College Not yet that is to say nothing is settled definitely but I do not think I shall go back there at least not to live And do you still think of becoming a priest On that point I am not certain I am not yet quite sure that I have a vocation for the priesthood I would wish the world to be my monastery Be that as it may I intend altering the house a little here and there you know how repugnant this mock Italian architecture is to my feelings For the present I am determined only on a few alterations I have them all in my head The billiard room that addition of yours can be turned into a chapel And the casements of the dreadful bow window might be removed and instead of the present flat roof a sloping tiled roof might be carried up against the wall of the house The cloisters would come at the back of the chapel His mother bit her thin lips and her face tightened in an expression of settled grief Kitty was sorry for missus Norton but Kitty was too young to understand and her sorrow evaporated in laughter She listened to John s explanations of the architectural changes as to a fairy tale Her innocent gaiety attracted her to him and as they walked about the grounds after breakfast he spoke to her about pictures and statues of a trip he intended to take to Italy and Spain and he did not seem to care to be reminded that this jarred with his project for immediate realisation of Thornby Priory Leaning their backs against the iron railing which divided the greensward from the park John and Kitty looked at the house From this view it really is not so bad though the urns and loggia are so intolerably out of keeping with the landscape But when I have made certain alterations it will harmonise with the downs and the flat flowing country so English with its barns and cottages and rich agriculture and there will be then a charming recollection of old England the England of the monastic ages before the but I forgot I must not speak to you on that subject Do you think the house will look prettier than it does now missus Norton says that it will be impossible to alter Italian architecture into Gothic Mother does not know what she is talking about I have it all down in my pocket book I have various plans I admit it is not easy but last night I fancy I hit on an idea I shall of course consult an architect although really I don t see there is any necessity for so doing but just to be on the safe side for in architecture there are many practical difficulties and to be on the safe side I will consult an experienced man regarding the practical working out of my design I made this drawing last night John produced a large pocket book But oh how pretty will it be really like that Yes exclaimed John delighted it will be exactly like that The billiard room can be converted into a chapel by building a new high pitched roof Oh John why should you do away with the billiard room why shouldn t the monks play billiards You played on the day of the meet I am not a monk yet The conversation paused a moment and then John continued That dreadful addition of my mother s cannot remain in its present form it is hideous but it can be converted very easily into a chapel It will not be difficult A high pitched timber roof throwing out an apse at the end and putting in mullioned and traceried windows filled with stained glass And the cloister you are speaking about where will that be The cloister will come at the back of the chapel and an arched and vaulted ambulatory will be laid round the house Later on I shall add a refectory and put a lavatory at one end of the ambulatory But don t you think John you may become tired of being a monk and then the house will have to be built back again No the house will be from every point of view a better house when my alterations are carried into effect And as for my becoming a monk that is in the main an idea of my mother s Monastic life I admit presents great attractions for me but that does not mean that I shall become a monk My mother does not understand an impersonal admiration for anything She cannot understand that it is impossible to become a monk unless you have a vocation It is all a question of vocation Later in the day missus Norton stopped John as he was hurrying to his room She was much excited by the news just received of the engagement of one of the Austin girls She approved of the match and spoke enthusiastically of the girl s beauty I could never see it It never appealed to me in the least But no woman does You never think a woman good looking Yes I do But you never can understand an impersonal admiration for anything You say I do not appreciate beauty in women because I do not marry You say I am determined on becoming a monk because I admire monastic life But are you going to become a monk I am not sure that I should not prefer the world to be my monastery Now you are talking nonsense Now you are beginning to be rude mother We were discussing the question of beauty in women Well what fault I should like to know do you find with Lucy John laughed and after a moment s hesitation he said Her face is a pretty oval but it conveys nothing to my mind her eyes are large and soft but there is no no John gesticulated with his fingers No what No beyond No what No suggestiveness in her face no strangeness she seems to me too much like a woman I think a woman ought to be like a woman You would not like a man to be like a woman would you That s different Women are often beautiful but their beauty is not of the highest type You admit that Kitty is a pretty girl Well she s not nearly so womanly in face or figure as Lucy Her figure is slight even to boyishness She s like a little antique statue done in a period of decadence She has the far away look in the eyes which we find in antique sculpture and which is so attractive to me But you don t understand I understand very well I understand you far better than you think missus Norton answered angrily She was angered by what she deemed her son s affectations and by the arrival of the architect before whom John was to lay his scheme for the reconstruction of the house mister Egerton seemed to think John s architecture somewhat wild but he promised to see what could be done to overcome the difficulties he foresaw and in a week he forwarded John several drawings for his consideration Judged by comparison with John s dreams the practical architecture of the experienced man seemed altogether lacking in expression and in poetry of proportion and comparing them with his own cherished project John hung over the billiard table where the drawings were laid out He could think of nothing but his monastery his Latin authors were forgotten he drew facades and turrets on the cloth during dinner and he went up to his room not to bed but to reconsider the difficulties that rendered the construction of a central tower an impossibility Once again he takes up the architect s notes The interior would be so constructed as to make it impossible to carry up the central tower The outer walls would not be strong enough to take the large gables and roof Although the chapel could be done easily the ambulatory would be of no use as it would lead probably from the kitchen offices Would have to reduce work on front facade to putting in new arched entrance Buttresses would take the place of pilasters The bow window could remain The roof to be heightened somewhat The front projection would throw the front rooms into almost total darkness But why not a light timber lantern tower thought John Yes that would get over the difficulty Now if we could only manage to keep my front If my design for the front cannot be preserved I might as well abandon the whole thing And then His face contracted in an expression of anger He rose from the table and looked round the room The room seemed to him a symbol the voluptuous bed the corpulent arm chair the toilet table shapeless with muslin of the hideous laws of the world and the flesh ever at variance and at war and ever defeating the indomitable aspirations of the soul John ordered his room to be changed and in the face of much opposition from his mother who declared that he would never be able to sleep there and would lose his health he selected a narrow room at the end of the passage He would have no carpet He placed a small iron bed against the wall two plain chairs a screen to keep off the draught from the door a small basin stand such as you might find in a ship s cabin and a prie dieu were all the furniture he permitted himself Oh what a relief he murmured Now there is line there is definite shape That formless upholstery frets my eye as false notes grate on my ear and becoming suddenly conscious of the presence of God he fell on his knees and prayed He prayed that he might be guided aright in his undertaking and that if it were conducive to the greater honour and glory of God he might be permitted to found a monastery and that he might be given strength to surmount all difficulties VI Either of two things I must alter the architecture of this house or I must return to Stanton College Don t talk nonsense do you think I don t know you you are boring yourself because Kitty is upstairs in bed and cannot walk about with you I do not know how you contrive mother always to say the most disagreeable things the marvellous way in which you pitch on what will at the moment wound me most is truly wonderful I compliment you on your skill but I confess I am at a loss to understand why you should as if by right expect me to remain here to serve as a target for the arrows of your scorn John walked out of the room During dinner mother and son spoke very little and he retired early about ten o clock to his room He was in high dudgeon but the white walls the prie dieu the straight narrow bed were pleasant to see His room was the first agreeable impression of the day He picked up a drawing from the table it seemed to him awkward and slovenly He sharpened his pencil cleared his crow quill pens got out his tracing paper and sat down to execute a better But he had not finished his outline sketch before he leaned back in his chair and as if overcome by the insidious warmth of the fire lapsed into firelight attitudes and meditations Nibbling his pencil s point he looked into the glare Wavering light and wavering shade flickered fast over the Roman profile flowed fitfully fitfully as his thoughts Now his thoughts pursued architectural dreams and now he thought of himself of his unhappy youth of how he had been misunderstood of his solitary life a bitter unsatisfactory life and yet a life not wanting in an ideal a glorious ideal He thought how his projects had always met with failure with disapproval above all failure and yet and yet he felt he almost knew there was something great and noble in him His eyes brightened he slipped into thinking of schemes for a monastic life and then he thought of his mother s hard disposition and how she misunderstood him What would the end be Would he succeed in creating the monastery he dreamed of so fondly To reconstruct the ascetic life of the Middle Ages that would be something worth doing that would be a great ideal that would make meaning in his life If he failed what should he do then His life as it was was unbearable he must come to terms with life That central tower how could he manage it and that built out front Was it true as the architect said that it would throw all the front rooms into darkness Without this front his design would be worthless What a difference it made Kitty had approved of it For a woman she was strangely beautiful She appealed to him as no other woman ever had Other women with their gross display of sex disgusted him but Kitty with her strange enigmatic eyes appealed to him like well like an antique statuette That was how she appealed to him as an exquisite work of art His mother had said that he found Thornby Place dull when she was ill that he missed her that that it was because she was not there that he had found the day so wearisome But this was because his mother could only understand men and women in one relation she had no feeling for art for that remoteness from life which is art and which was everything to him His thoughts paused and returned slowly to his architectural projects But Kitty was in them all he saw her in decorations for the light timber lantern roof and she flitted through the ambulatory which was to be constructed at the back of the house Soon he was absorbed in remembrance of her looks and laughter of their long talks of the monastery the neighbours the pet rooks Sammy the great yellow cat and the greenhouses He remembered the pleasure he had taken in these conversations Was it then true that he thought of her as men think of women was there some alloy of animal passion in his admiration for her beauty He asked himself this question and remembered with shame some involuntary thoughts which had sprung upon him and which when he listened he still could hear in the background of his mind and listening he grew frightened and fled like a lonely traveller from the sound of wolves Pausing in his mental flight he asked himself what this must lead to To a coarse affection to marriage to children to general domesticity And contrasted with this The dignified and grave life of the cloister the constant sensation of lofty and elevating thought a high ideal the communion of learned men the charm of headship Could he abandon this No a thousand times no This was what was real in him this was what was true to his nature The thoughts he deplored were accidental He could not be held accountable for them He had repulsed them and trembling and pale with passion John fell on his knees and prayed for grace But prayer was thin upon his lips and he could only beg that the temptation might pass from him In the morning he said I shall be strong VII But if in the morning he were strong Kitty was more beautiful than ever They walked towards the tennis seat with its red striped awning They listened to the feeble cawing of young rooks swinging on the branches They watched the larks nestle in and fly out of the golden meadow It was May time and the air was bright with buds and summer bees She was dressed in white and the shadow of the straw hat fell across her eyes when she raised her face He was dressed in black and the clerical frock coat buttoned by one button at the throat fell straight They sat under the red striped awning of the tennis seat The large grasping hands holding the polished cane contrasted with the reedy translucent hands laid upon the white folds The low sweet breath of the May time breathed within them and their hearts were light hers was only conscious of the May time but his was awake with unconscious love and he yielded to her to the perfume of the garden to the absorbing sweetness of the moment He was no longer John Norton His being was part of the May time it had gone forth and had mingled with the colour of the fields and sky with the life of the flowers with all vague scents and sounds How beautiful the day is he said speaking slowly Is it not all light and colour And you in your white dress with the sunlight on your hair seem more blossom like than any flower I wonder what flower I should compare you to Shall I say a rose No not a rose nor a lily nor a violet you remind me rather of a tall delicate pale carnation Why John I never heard you speak like that before I thought you never paid compliments The transparent green of the limes shivered the young rooks cawed feebly and the birds flew out of and nestled with amorous wings in the golden meadow Kitty had taken off her straw hat the sunlight caressed the delicate plenitudes of the bent neck the delicate plenitudes bound with white cambric cambric swelling gently over the bosom into the narrow of the waist cambric fluting to the little wrist reedy translucid hands cambric falling outwards and flowing like a great white flower over the greensward over the mauve stocking and the little shoe set firmly The ear like a rose leaf a fluff of light hair trembling on the curving nape and the head crowned with thick brown gold And her pale marmoreal eyes were haunted by a yearning look which he had always loved and which he had hitherto only found in some beautiful relics of antiquity She seemed to him purged as a Greek statue of all life s grossness and as the women of Botticelli and Mantegna she seemed to him to live in a long afternoon of unchanging aspiration And it seemed to him that he thought of her as impersonally as he thought of these women and the fact that she participated in the life of the flesh neither concerned him nor did it matter That she lived in the flesh instead of in marble was an accident He smiled at the paradox for he had recovered from the fears of overnight and was certain that even the longing to strain her in his arms was only part of the impulse which compels our lips to the rose which buries our hands in the earth when we lie at length which fills our souls with longing for white peaks and valleys when the great clouds tower and shine And that evening as he sat in his study his thoughts suddenly said She is the symbol of my inner life Surprised and perplexed he sought the meaning of the words He was forced to admit that her beauty had penetrated his soul But was it not natural for him to admire all beautiful things especially things on a certain plane of idea He had admired other women in what then did his admiration for this woman differ from that which others had drawn from him In his admiration for other women there had always been a sense of repulsion this feeling of repulsion seemed to be absent from his admiration for Kitty He hardly perceived any sex in her she was sexless as a work of art as the women of the first Italian painters as some Greek statues Then by natural association of idea his mind was carried back to early youth to struggles with himself and to temptations which he had conquered and the memory of which he was always careful to keep out of mind In that critical time he had felt that it was essential for him to come to terms with life And the terms he had discovered were strictest adhesion to the rules laid down by the Catholic Church for the conduct of life He had lived within these rules and had received peace Now for the first time that peace was seriously assailed His thoughts continued their questioning and he found himself asking if sufficient change had come into his nature to allow him to accept marriage But before answer could be given an opposing thought asked if this girl were more than a mere emissary of Satan and with that thought all that was mediaeval in him arose Femina dulce mahim pariter favus atque venenum Not sweet evil he said determined to outdo the monk in denunciation but the vilest of evils not honeycomb and venom but filth and venom Though as fair as roses the beginning the end is gall and wormwood heartache and misery are the end of love Why then do we seek passion when we may find happiness only in calm He had known the truth as if by instinct from the first No life was possible for him except an ascetic life But he had no vocation for the priesthood True that in a moment of weakness after a severe illness he had returned to Stanton College with the intention of taking orders but with renewal of health the truth had come home to him that he was as unfitted to the priesthood as he was for marriage or nearly so The path of his life lay between the church and the world he must remain in the world though he never could be of the world he could only view the world as a spectator as a passing pageant it interested him and with art and literature and music for necessary distraction and the fixed resolve to save his soul nothing really mattered but that he hoped to achieve his destiny VIII We play billiards here on Sunday but you would think it wrong to do so But to day is not Sunday No I was only speaking in a general way Yet I often wonder how you can feel satisfied with the protection your Church affords you against the miseries and trials of the world A Protestant may believe pretty nearly as little or as much as he likes whereas in our Church everything is defined we know what we must believe to be saved There is a sense of security in the Catholic Church which the Protestant has not Do you think so That is because you do not know our Church replied Kitty who was a little astonished at this sudden outburst I feel quite happy and safe I know that our Lord Jesus Christ died on the Cross to save us and we have the Bible to guide us Yes but the Bible without the interpretation of the Church is may lead to error For instance John stopped abruptly Seized with a sudden scruple of conscience he asked himself if he in his own house had a right to strive to undermine the faith of the daughter of his own friend Go on cried Kitty laughing I know the Bible better than you and if I break down I will ask father And as if to emphasise her intention she hit her ball which was close under the cushion as hard as she could John hailed the rent in the cloth as a deliverance for in the discussion as to how it could be repaired the religious question was forgotten And this idyll was lived about the beautiful Italian house with its urns and pilasters through the beautiful English park with its elms now with the splendour of summer upon them in the pleasure grounds with their rosery and the fountain where the rose leaves float and the woodpigeons come at eventide to drink in the greenhouse with its live glare of geraniums where the great yellow cat so soft and beautiful springs on Kitty s shoulder rounds its back and purring insists on caresses in the large clean stables where the horses munch the corn lazily and look round with round inquiring eyes and the rooks croak and flutter and strut about Kitty s feet One morning he said as they went into the garden You must sometimes feel a little lonely here when I am away all alone here with mother Oh dear no we have lots to do I look after the pets in the morning I feed the cats and the rooks and I see that the canaries have fresh water and seed And then the bees take up a lot of our time We have twenty two hives missus Norton says she ought to make five pounds a year on each Sometimes we lose a swarm or two and then missus Norton is cross We were out for hours with the gardener the other day but we could do no good we could not get them out of that elm tree You see that long branch leaning right over the wall well it was on that branch that they settled and no ladder was tall enough to reach them and when Bill climbed the tree and shook them out they flew right away And in the afternoon we go out for drives we pay visits You never pay visits you never go and call on your neighbours Oh yes I do I went the other day to see your father Ah yes but that is only because he talks to you about Latin authors No I assure you it isn t Once I have finished my book I shall never look at them again Well what will you do I don t know it depends on circumstances What circumstances said Kitty innocently The words Whether you will or will not have me rose to John s lips but all power to speak them seemed to desert him he had grown suddenly as weak as snow and in an instant the occasion had passed On another occasion they were walking in the park I never would have believed John that you would care to go out for a walk with me And why Kitty Kitty laughed her short sudden laugh was strange and sweet and John s heart was beating Well she said without the faintest hesitation or shyness we always thought you hated girls I know I used to tease you when you came home for the first time when you used to think of nothing but the Latin authors What do you mean Kitty laughed again You promise not to tell I promise This was their first confidence You told your mother when I came when you were sitting by the fire reading that the flutter of my skirts disturbed you No Kitty I m sure you never disturbed me or at least for a long time I wish my mother would not repeat conversations it is most unfair Mind you promised not to repeat what I have told you If you do you will get me into an awful scrape I promise The conversation came to a pause Kitty looked up and overtaken by a sudden nervousness John said We had better make haste the storm is coming on we shall get wet through And he made no further attempt to screw his courage up to the point of proposing but asked himself if his powerlessness was a sign from God that he was abandoning his true vocation for a false one He knew that he would not propose If he did he would break his engagement when it came to the point of marriage He was as unfitted for marriage as he was for the priesthood He had deceived himself about the priesthood as he was now deceiving himself about marriage No not deceiving himself for at the bottom of his heart he could hear the truth Then why did he continue this it was no better than a comedy an unworthy comedy from which he did not seem to be able to disentangle himself he could not say why He could not understand himself his brain was on fire and he knelt down to pray but when he prayed the thought of bringing a soul home to the fold tempted him like a star and he asked himself if Kitty had not in some of their conversations shown leanings toward Catholicism If this were so would it be right to desert her in a critical moment IX He had not proposed when mister Hare wrote for his daughter and Kitty returned to Henfield John at first thought that this absence was the solution of his difficulty but he could not forget her and it became one of his pleasures to start early in the morning and having spent a long day with her to return home across the downs What a beautiful walk you will have mister Norton But are you not tired Seven miles in the morning and seven in the evening But I have had the whole day to rest in What a lovely evening Let s all walk a little way with him said Kitty I should like to said the elder Miss Austin but we promised father to be home for dinner The one sure way of getting into his black books is to keep his dinner waiting and he wouldn t dine without us Well good bye dear said Kitty I shall walk as far as the burgh The Miss Austins turned into the trees that encircled Leywood Kitty and John faced the hill and ascending they soon stood tiny specks upon the evening hours Speaking of the Devil s Dyke Kitty said What you mean to say you never heard the legend You a Sussex man I have lived very little in Sussex and I used to hate the place I am only just beginning to like it But tell me the legend Very well let s try and find a place where we can sit down The grass is full of that horrid prickly gorse Here s a nice soft place there is no gorse here Now tell me the legend You do astonish me said Kitty seating herself on the spot that had been chosen for her You never heard of the legend of saint Cuthman Won t you cross the poor gipsy s palm with a bit of silver my pretty gentleman and she ll tell you your fortune and that of your pretty lady Kitty uttered a startled cry and turning they found themselves facing a strong black eyed girl What do you think Kitty would you like to have your fortune told Kitty laughed It would be rather fun she said And she listened to the usual story of a handsome young gentleman who would woo her win her and give her happiness and wealth John threw the girl a shilling She withdrew They watched her passing through the furze What nonsense they talk you don t believe that there s anything in what they say said Kitty raising her eyes John s eyes were fixed upon her He tried to answer her question which he had only half heard But he could not form an intelligible sentence There was a giddiness in his brain which he had never felt before he trembled and the victim of an impulse which forced him toward her he threw his arms about her and kissed her violently Oh don t cried the girl let me go oh John how could you and disengaging herself from his arms she looked at him The expression of deep sorrow and regret on his face surprised her more even than his kiss She said What is the matter John Why did you She did not finish the sentence Do not ask me I do not know I cannot explain a sudden impulse for which I am hardly accountable You are so beautiful he said taking her hand gently that the temptation to kiss you I don t know I suppose it is natural desire to kiss what is beautiful But you ll forget this you will never mention it I humbly beg your pardon John sat looking into space and seeing how troubled he was Kitty excused the kiss I m sure I forgive you John There was no great harm I believe young men often kiss girls The Austin girls do I know they have told me so I shouldn t have cried out so if you hadn t taken me by surprise I forgive you John I know you didn t mean it you meant nothing His face frightened her You must never do so again It is not right but we have known each other always I don t think it was a sin I don t think that father or missus Norton would think it But they must never know You promise me Kitty I am grateful to you for what you have said in my excuse I daresay the Austin girls do kiss young men but because they do so it does not follow that it is right No girl should kiss a man unless she intends to marry him But said Kitty laughing if he kisses her by force what is she to do For she failed to perceive that to snatch a kiss was as important as John seemed to think But he told her that she must not laugh that she must try to forgive him It is unpardonable he said for I cannot marry you We are not of the same religion But you don t want to marry me John to marry just because you kissed me People kiss every year under the mistletoe but they don t marry each other It is as you like Kitty But forced on by his conscience he said We might obtain a dispensation You know nothing of our Church if you did you might become a convert I wish you would consider the question It is so simple we surrender our own wretched understanding and are content to accept the Church as wiser than we Once man throws off restraint there is no happiness there is only misery One step leads to another if he would be logical he must go on and before long for the descent is very rapid indeed he finds himself in an abyss of darkness and doubt a terrible abyss indeed where nothing exists and life has lost all meaning The Reformation was the thin end of the wedge it was the first denial of authority and you see what it has led to modern scepticism and modern pessimism I don t know what that means but I heard missus Norton say you were a pessimist I was but I saw in time where it was leading me and I crushed it out I used to be a Republican too but I saw what liberty meant and what were its results and I gave it up So you gave up all your ideas for Catholicism John hesitated he seemed a little startled but he answered I would give up anything for my Church And did it cost you much to give up your ideas Yes I have suffered But now I am happy and my happiness would be complete if God would grant you grace to believe But I do believe I believe in our Lord Jesus who died to save us Is not that enough There was no wind on the down And still as a reflection in a glass the grey barren land rolled through the twilight Beyond it the circling sea and the girl s figure distinct on a golden hour John watched a moment and then hastened homeward He was overpowered by fear of the future he trembled with anticipation and prayed that accident might lead him out of the difficulty into which a chance moment had betrayed him X When she rose from the ground she saw a tall gaunt figure passing away like a shadow What a horrible man he attacked me ill treated me what for Her thoughts turned aside He should be put in prison If father knew it or John knew it he would be put in prison and for a very long time Why did he attack me Perhaps to rob me yes to rob me of course to rob me To rob her and of what of her watch where was it It was gone The watch was gone But had she lost it Should she go back and see if she could find it Oh impossible see the place again impossible search among the gorse impossible Then as her thoughts broke away she thought of how she had escaped being murdered How thankful she ought to be But somehow she was not thankful She was conscious of a horror of returning of returning to where she would see men and women s faces I cannot go home thought the girl and acting in direct contradiction to her thoughts she walked forward Her parasol where was it It was broken She brushed herself she picked bits of furze from her dress She held each away from her and let it drop in a silly vacant way all the while running the phrases over in her mind He threw me down and ill treated me my frock is ruined what a state it is in I had a narrow escape of being murdered I will tell them that that will explain I had a narrow escape of being murdered But presently she grew conscious that these thoughts were fictitious thoughts and that there was a thought a real thought lying in the background of her mind which she dared not face and failing to do so she walked on hurriedly she almost ran as if to force out of sight the thought that for a moment threatened to define itself Suddenly she stopped there were some children playing by the farm gate They did not know that she was by and she listened to their childish prattle XI The front door was open she heard her father calling But she felt she could not see him she must hide from his sight and dashing upstairs she double locked her door The sky was still flushed there was light upon the sea but the room was dim and quiet Her room she had lived in many years had seen it under all aspects then why did she look with strained eyes Why did she shrink Nothing has been changed There is her little narrow bed and her little book case full of novels and prayer books there is her work basket by the fireplace by the fireplace closed in with curtains that she herself embroidered above her pillow there is a crucifix there are photographs of the Miss Austins and pictures of pretty children cut from the Christmas numbers on the walls She started at the sight of these familiar objects and trembled in the room which she had thought of as a haven of refuge Why She didn t know something that is at once remembrance and suspicion filled her mind and she asked if this was her room She sighed and approaching her bedside raised her hands to her neck It was the instinctive movement of undressing But she did not unbutton her collar Resuming her walk she picked up a blossom that had fallen from the fuchsia She walked to and fro Then she threw herself on her bed and closed her eyes She slept and then the moonlight showed her face convulsed She is the victim of a dream Something follows her she knows not what She dare not look round She falls over great leaves She falls into the clefts of ruined tombs and her hands as she attempts to rise are laid on sleeping snakes they turn to attack her they glide away and disappear in moss and inscriptions Before her the trees extend in complex colonnades silent ruins are grown through with giant roots and about the mysterious entrances of the crypts there lingers yet the odour of ancient sacrifices The stem of a rare column rises amid the branches the fragment of an arch hangs over and is supported by a dismantled tree trunk And through the torrid twilight of the approaching storm the cry of the hyena is heard The claws of the hyena are heard upon the crumbling tombs and the suffocating girl strives with her last strength to free herself from the thrall of the great lianas But there comes a hirsute smell she turns with terrified eyes to plead but meets only dull liquorish eyes and the breath of the obscene animal is hot on her face She sprang from her bed Was there any one in her room No only the moonlight But the forest the wild animal was it then only a dream the girl thought It was only a dream a horrible dream but after all only a dream Then a voice within her said But all was not a dream there was something that was worse than the dream She walked to and fro and when she lay down her eyelids strove against sleep But sleep came again and her dream was of a brown and yellow serpent She saw it from afar rearing its tawny hide scenting its prey She takes refuge in the rosery How will she save herself By plucking roses and building a wall between her and it So she collects huge bouquets armfuls of beautiful flowers garlands and wreaths The flower wall rises and hoping to combat the fury of the beast with purity she goes whither snowy blossoms bloom in clustering millions She gathers them in haste her arms and hands stream with blood but she pays no heed and as the snake surmounts one barricade she builds another But the reptile leans over the roses The long thin neck is upon her she feels the horrid strength of the coils as they curl and slip about her drawing her whole life into one knotted and loathsome embrace Then she knows not how but while the roses fall in a red and white rain about her she escapes from the stench of the scaly hide from the strength of the coils And without any transition in place or time she finds herself listening to the sound of rippling water There is an iron drinking cup close to her hand She seems to recognise the spot It is Shoreham There are the streets she knows so well the masts of the vessels the downs But something darkens the sunlight the tawny body of the snake oscillates the people cry to her to escape She flies along the streets like the wind she seems to pass She calls for help Sometimes the crowds are stationary as if frozen into stone sometimes they follow the snake and attack it with sticks and knives One man with colossal shoulders wields a great sabre it flashes about him like lightning Will he kill it He turns chases a dog and disappears The people too have disappeared She is now flying along a wild plain covered with coarse grass and wild poppies The snake is near her and there is no one to whom she can call for help But the sea is in front of her She will escape down the rocks there is still a chance The descent is sheer but somehow she retains foothold Then the snake drops she feels its weight upon her and with a shriek she awakes The moon hung over the sea the sea flowed with silver the world was as chill as an icicle The roses the snake the cliff s edge was it then only a dream the girl thought It was only a dream a terrible dream but after all only a dream Then a voice within her said But all was not a dream there was something that was worse than the dream She uttered a low cry she moaned She drew herself up on her bed and lay with her face buried in the pillow Again she fought against sleep but sleep came again and in overpowering dream she lay as if dead And she sees herself dead All her friends are about her crowning her with flowers beautiful garlands of white roses They dress her in a long white robe white as the snowiest cloud in heaven and it lies in long straight plaits about her limbs like the robes of those who lie in marble in cathedral aisles It falls over her feet her hands are crossed over her breast and all praise in low but ardent words the excessive whiteness of the garment For none but she sees that there is a black spot upon the robe which they believe to be immaculate She would warn them of their error but she cannot and when they avert their faces to wipe away their tears the stain might be easily seen but as they continue their last offices folds or flowers fall over the stain and hide it from view It is great pain to her to find herself unable to tell them of their error for she well knows that when she is placed in the tomb and the angels come that they will not fail to perceive the stain and seeing it they will not fail to be shocked and sorrowful and seeing it they will turn away weeping saying She is not for us alas she is not for us And Kitty who is conscious of this fatal oversight the results of which she so clearly foresees is grievously afflicted and she makes every effort to warn her friends of their error But there is one amid the mourners who knows that she is endeavouring to tell of the black stain And this one whose face she cannot readily distinguish maliciously and with diabolical ingenuity withdraws the attention of the others so that they do not see it And so it befell her to be buried in the stained robe And she is taken away amid flowers and white cloths to a white tomb where incense is burning and where the walls are hung with votive wreaths and things commemorative of virginal life But upon all these upon the flowers and images alike there is some small stain which none sees but she and the one in shadow the one whose face she cannot recognise And although she is nailed fast in her coffin she sees these stains vividly and the one whose face she cannot recognise sees them too And this is certain for the shadow of the face is stirred by laughter The mourners go the evening darkens the wild sunset floats for a while through the western heavens the cemetery becomes a deep green and in the wind that blows out of heaven the cypresses rock like things sad and mute Then the blue night comes with stars in her tresses and out of those stars angels float softly their white feet hanging out of blown folds their wings pointing to the stars And from out of the earth out of the mist but whence and how it is impossible to say there come other angels dark of hue and foul smelling But the white angels carry swords and they wave these swords and the scene is reflected in them as in a mirror the dark angels cower in a corner of the cemetery but they do not utterly retire The tomb mysteriously opens and the white angels enter the tomb And the coffin is opened and the girl trembles lest the angels should discover the stain she knew of But lo to her great joy they do not see it and they bear her away through the blue night through the stars of heaven And it is not until one whose face she cannot recognise and whose presence among the angels of heaven she cannot comprehend steals away one of the garlands with which she is entwined that the fatal stain becomes visible Then relinquishing their burden the angels break into song and the song they sing is one of grief it travels through the spaces of heaven she listens to its wailing echoes as she falls as she falls towards the sea where the dark angels are waiting for her and as she falls she leans with reverted neck and strives to see their faces and as she nears them she distinguishes one Save me save me she cried and bewildered and dazed with the dream she stared on the room now chill with summer dawn Again she murmured It was only a dream it was only a dream again a sort of presentiment of happiness spread like light through her mind and again the voice within her said But all was not a dream there was something that was worse than the dream And with despair in her heart she sat watching the cold sky turn to blue the delicate bright blue of morning and the garden grow into yellow and purple and red She did not weep nor did she moan She sat thinking She dwelt on the remembrance of the hills and the tramp with strange persistency and yet no more now than before did she attempt to come to conclusions with her thought it was vague she would not define it she brooded over it sullenly and obtusely Sometimes her thoughts slipped away from it but with each returning a fresh stage was marked in the progress of her nervous despair And so the hours went by At eight o clock the maid knocked at the door Kitty opened it mechanically and she fell into the woman s arms weeping sobbing The sight of the female face brought relief it interrupted the jarred and strained sense of the horrible the secret affinities of sex quickened within her The woman s presence filled Kitty with the feelings that the harmlessness of a lamb or a soft bird inspires XII But what is it Miss what is it Are you ill Why Miss you haven t taken your things off you haven t been to bed No I lay down I have had frightful dreams that is all But you must be ill Miss you look dreadful Miss Shall I tell mister Hare Perhaps the doctor had better be sent for No no pray say nothing about me Tell my father that I did not sleep that I am going to lie down for a little while that he is not to expect me for breakfast I really think Miss that it would be as well for you to see the doctor No no no I am going to lie down and I am not to be disturbed Shall I fill the bath Miss Shall I leave the hot water here Miss Bath hot water Kitty repeated the words over as if she were striving to grasp a meaning but which eluded her Soon after the maid returned with a tray The trivial jingle of the cups and plates was another suffering added to the ever increasing stress of mind Her dress was torn it was muddy there were bits of furze sticking to it She picked these off and as she did so accurate remembrance and simple recollection of facts returned to her and the succession was so complete that the effect was equivalent to a re enduring of the crime and with a foreknowledge of it as if to sharpen its horror and increase the sense of the pollution The vague hills the vague sea the sweet glow of evening she saw it all again And as if afraid that her brain now strained like a body on the rack would suddenly snap she threw up her arms and began to take off her dress as if she would hush thought in abrupt movements In a moment she was in stays and petticoat The delicate and almost girlish arms were disfigured by great bruises Great black and blue stains were spreading through the skin Kitty lifted up her arm she looked at it in surprise then in horror she rushed to the door where her dressing gown was hanging and wrapped herself in it tightly hid herself in it so that no bit of her flesh could be seen XIII The day grew into afternoon She awoke from a dreamless sleep of about an hour and still under its soothing influence she pinned up her hair settled the ribbons of her dressing gown and went downstairs She found her father and John in the drawing room Oh here is Kitty they exclaimed But what is the matter dear Why are you not dressed said mister Hare But what is the matter Are you ill said John and he extended his hand No no tis nothing she replied and avoiding the outstretched hand with a shudder she took the seat furthest away from her father and lover They looked at her in amazement and she at them in fear and trembling She was conscious of two very distinct sensations one the result of reason the other of madness She was not ignorant of the causes of each although she was powerless to repress one in favour of the other She knew she was looking at and talking to her dear kind father and that the young man sitting next him was John Norton the son of her dear friend missus Norton she knew he was the young man who loved her and whom she was going to marry At the same time she seemed to see that her father s kind benign countenance was not a real face but a mask which he wore over another face and which should the mask slip and she prayed that it might not would prove as horrible and revolting as But the mask that John wore was as nothing it was the veriest make believe And she could not but doubt now but that the face she had known him so long by was a fictitious face and as the hallucination strengthened she saw his large mild eyes grow small and that vague dreamy look turn to the dull liquorish look the chin came forward the brows contracted the large sinewy hands were oh so like Then reason asserted itself the vision vanished and she saw John Norton as she had always seen him But was she sure that she did Yes yes but her head seemed to be growing lighter and she did not appear to be able to judge things exactly as she should a sort of new world seemed to be slipping like a painted veil between her and the old John and mister Hare looked at her John at length rose and he said My dear Kitty I am afraid you are not well She strove to allow him to take her hand but she could not overcome the instinctive feeling which caused her to shrink from him Don t come near me I cannot bear it she cried don t come near me I beg of you More than this she could not do and giving way utterly she shrieked and rushed from the room She rushed upstairs She stood in the middle of the floor listening to the silence her thoughts falling about her like shaken leaves It was as if a thunderbolt had destroyed the world and left her alone in a desert The furniture of the room the bed the chairs the books she loved seemed to have become as grains of sand and she forgot all connection between them and herself She pressed her hands to her forehead and strove to separate the horror that crowded upon her But all was now one horror the lonely hills were in the room the grey sky the green furze the tramp she was again fighting furiously with him and her lover and her father and all sense of the world s life grew dark in the storm of madness A step was heard on the stairs her quick ears caught the sound and she rushed to the door to lock it But she was too late John held it fast Kitty Kitty he cried for God s sake tell me what is the matter Save me save me she cried and she forced the door against him with her whole strength He was however determined on questioning her on seeing her and he passed his head and shoulders into the room Save me save me help help she cried retreating from him Kitty Kitty what do you mean Say say Save me oh mercy mercy Let me go and I will never say I saw you I will not tell anything Let me go she cried retreating towards the window For heaven s sake Kitty take care the window the window But Kitty heard nothing knew nothing was conscious of nothing but a mad desire to escape The window was lifted high high above her head and her face distorted with fear she stood amid the soft greenery of the Virginia creeper Save me she cried The white dress passed through the green leaves and John heard a dull thud XIV 
6497_234100_000003_000000	train-clean-360	mister Hare stood looking at his dead daughter John Norton sat by the window 
none	none	His brain was empty everything was far away 
6497_234100_000003_000002	train-clean-360	He saw things moving moving but they were all far away 
none	none	He could not re knit himself with the weft of life the thread that had made him part of it had been snapped 
6497_234100_000003_000004	train-clean-360	He knew that Kitty had thrown herself out of the window and was dead 
none	none	The word shocked him but there was no sense of realisation to meet it 
6497_234100_000003_000006	train-clean-360	She had walked with him on the hills she had accompanied him as far as the burgh she had waved her hand to him before they walked quite out of each other s sight 
6497_234100_000003_000007	train-clean-360	Now she was dead 
6497_234100_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Had he loved her 
none	none	Why was there neither burning grief nor tears 
6497_234100_000004_000002	train-clean-360	He envied the hard sobbing father s grief the father who held his dead daughter s hand and showed a face on which was printed so deeply the terror of the soul s emotion that John felt a supernatural awe creep upon him felt that his presence was a sort of sacrilege 
6497_234100_000004_000003	train-clean-360	He crept downstairs 
none	none	He went into the drawing room and looked about for the place he had last seen her in She usually sat on that sofa how often had he seen her sitting there And now he should not see her any more 
6497_234100_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Only three days ago she had been sitting in that basket chair 
none	none	How well he remembered her words her laughter 
6497_234100_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Shadow like is human life one moment it is here the next it is gone 
none	none	Her work basket the very ball of wool which he had held for her to wind the novel which she had lent to him and which he had forgotten to take away 
6497_234100_000005_000005	train-clean-360	He would never read it now or perhaps he should read it in memory of her of her whom yesterday he had parted with on the hills her little Puritan look her external girlishness her golden brown hair and the sudden laugh so characteristic of her 
6497_234100_000005_000006	train-clean-360	She had lent him this book she who was now but clay 
6497_234100_000006_000000	train-clean-360	He took up his hat and set forth to walk home across the downs all the while thinking thinking over what had happened 
none	none	He had asked her to be his wife 
6497_234100_000006_000002	train-clean-360	She had consented and alarmed at the prospect of the new duties he had contracted he had returned home 
none	none	These newly contracted duties had stirred his being to its very depth the chance appearance of a gipsy girl without the aid of that circumstance he felt he would never have spoken had set his life about with endless eventuality he could not see to the end the future he had indefinitely plighted and his own intimate and personal life had been abandoned for ever 
6497_234100_000006_000004	train-clean-360	He had exchanged it for the life of the hearth of the family that private life private and yet so entirely impersonal which he had hitherto loathed 
6497_234100_000006_000005	train-clean-360	He had often said he had no pity for those who accepted burdens and then complained that they had not sufficient strength to carry them 
6497_234100_000006_000006	train-clean-360	Such had been his theory he must now make his theory and practice coincide 
6497_234100_000007_000000	train-clean-360	He had walked up and down his study his mind aflame he had sat in his arm chair facing the moonlight considering a question to him so important so far reaching that his mind at moments seemed as if like to snap to break but which was accepted by nine tenths of humanity without a second thought as lightly as the most superficial detail of daily life 
6497_234100_000007_000001	train-clean-360	But how others acted was not his concern he must consider his own competence to bear the burden the perilous burden he had asked and which had been promised to him 
6497_234100_000008_000000	train-clean-360	He must not adventure into a life he was not fitted for he must not wreck another s life in considering himself he was considering her their interests were mutual they were identical there was no question of egotism 
none	none	But this marriage question had been debated a thousand times in the last six months it had haunted his thought it had become his daily companion his familiar spirit Under what new aspect could he consider this question It faced him always with the same unmovable mysterious eyes in which he read nothing which told him nothing of what he longed to know He only knew that he had desired this girl as a wife 
6497_234100_000008_000005	train-clean-360	A desire had come he knew not whence and he asked himself if it were a passing weakness of the flesh or if this passion abided in him if it had come at last to claim satisfaction 
6497_234100_000008_000006	train-clean-360	On this point he was uncertain this was nature s secret 
none	none	In the midst of his stress of mind his eyes had wandered over his books they had been caught by the colour of a small thin volume and obeying an instinct he had taken the volume down He knew it well a few hundred small pages containing the wisdom of a great Greek philosopher Epictetus and John had often before turned to this sage discourse for relief in his mental depressions and despair of life The subject for the good and wise man is his master faculty as the body is for the physician and the trainer and the soil is the subject for the husbandman 
6497_234100_000010_000001	train-clean-360	And the work of the good and wise man is to use appearances according to Nature 
none	none	For it is the nature of every soul to consent to what is good and reject what is evil and to hold back about what is uncertain and thus to be moved to pursue the good and avoid the evil and neither way for what is neither good nor evil In the light of these words John s mind grew serene as a landscape on which the moon is shining and he asked himself why he had hesitated if marriage were the state which he was destined to fulfil If a habit affects us against that must we endeavour to find some remedy And what remedy is to be found against a habit 
6497_234100_000012_000002	train-clean-360	The contrary habit 
6497_234100_000013_000000	train-clean-360	A temptation of the flesh had come upon him he had yielded to it instead of opposing it with the contrary habit of chastity 
6497_234100_000013_000001	train-clean-360	For chastity had never afflicted him it had ever been to him a source of strength and courage 
none	none	Chastity had brought him peace of mind but the passion to which he had in a measure yielded had robbed him of his peace of mind and had given him instead weakness and agitation of spirit and flesh 
6497_234100_000013_000003	train-clean-360	The last six months had been the unhappiest of his life 
none	none	Nothing in this world he thought is worth our peace of mind and love robs us of that therefore it must be maleficent And this passion which has caused me so much trouble what is it 
6497_234100_000013_000006	train-clean-360	A passing emotion of which I am ashamed of which I would speak to no one 
none	none	An emotion which man shares with the lowest animals but which his higher nature teaches him to check and subject Then he remembered that this emotion might come upon him again 
6497_234100_000013_000008	train-clean-360	But each time he thought I shall be able to control it better than the last and it will grow weaker and weaker until at last it will pass and to return no more 
none	none	But he had proposed to Kitty and had been accepted and for some solution of this material difficulty he had to fall back upon the argument that he had no right to wreck another s life that in considering his interests he was considering hers And he had stood in the dawn light pondering a means of escape from a position into which a chance circumstance had led him 
6497_234100_000015_000000	train-clean-360	He had gone to bed hoping to find counsel in the night and in the morning he had waked firm in his resolve and had gone to Shoreham in the intention of breaking his engagement 
none	none	But instead he had witnessed a cruel and terrible suicide the reason of which was hidden from him Possibly none would ever know the reason 
6497_234100_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Perhaps it were better so the reasons that prompted suicide were better unrevealed 
6497_234100_000016_000000	train-clean-360	And now as he returned home after the tragedy about midway in his walk across the downs the thought came upon him that the breaking off of his engagement might have been sufficient reason in an affected mind for suicide 
6497_234100_000016_000001	train-clean-360	But this was not so 
6497_234100_000016_000002	train-clean-360	He knew it was not so

6497_234100_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 She was here with me yesterday he said 
none	none	And he looked down the landscape now wrapped in a white mist The hills were like giants sleeping the long distance vanished in mysterious moonlight He could see Brighton nearer was Southwick and further away past the shadowy shore was Worthing 
6497_234100_000018_000000	train-clean-360	He sat down by the blown hawthorn bush that stands by the burgh 
none	none	A ship sailed across the rays of the moon and he said Illusion illusion so is it always with him who places his trust in life Ah life life what hast thou for giving save deceptions Why did I leave my life of contemplation and prayer to enter into that of desire Did I not know that there was no happiness save in calm and contemplation and foolish is he who places his happiness in the things of this world But what had befallen her She was mad when she threw herself out of the window to escape from him 
6497_234100_000020_000002	train-clean-360	But how had she become mad 
none	none	Yesterday he had looked back and had seen her walking away and waving her parasol a slight happy figure on the gold tinted sky What had happened 
6497_234100_000020_000005	train-clean-360	By what strange alienation of the brain by what sudden snapping of the sense had madness come 
6497_234100_000020_000006	train-clean-360	Something must have happened Did madness fall like that 
6497_234100_000020_000007	train-clean-360	like a bolt from the blue 
none	none	If so she must have always been mad and walking home the slight thread of sense half worn through had suddenly snapped He knew that she liked him 
6497_234100_000020_000010	train-clean-360	Had she guessed that when it came to the point that he would not that he might not have been able to marry her 
6497_234100_000020_000011	train-clean-360	If so he was in a measure responsible 
none	none	Ah why had he ventured upon a path which he must have known he was not fitted to walk in XV Next morning John and missus Norton drove to the Rectory and without asking for mister Hare they went to her room The windows were open Annie and Mary Austin sat by the bedside watching The blood had been washed out of the beautiful hair and she lay very white and fair amid the roses her friends had brought her She lay as she had lain in one of her terrible dreams quite still the slender body covered by a sheet From the feet the linen curved and marked the inflections of the knees there were long flowing folds low lying like the wash of retiring water And beautiful indeed were the rounded shoulders the neck the calm and bloodless face the little nose and the drawing of the nostrils the extraordinary waxen pallor the eyelids laid like rose leaves upon the eyes that death has closed for ever An Ascension lily lay within the arm in the pale hand Candles were burning and the soft smell of wax mixed with the perfume of the roses For there were roses everywhere great snowy bouquets and long lines of scattered blossoms and single roses there and here and the petals falling were as tears shed for the beautiful dead and the white flowerage vied with the pallor and the immaculate stillness of the dead When they next saw her she was in her coffin It was almost full of white blossoms jasmine Eucharis lilies white roses and in the midst of the flowers the hands lay folded and the face was veiled with some delicate filmy handkerchief For the funeral there were crosses and wreaths of white flowers roses and stephanotis And the Austin girls and their cousins who had come from Brighton and Worthing carried loose flowers Down the short drive through the iron gate through the farm gate the bearers staggering a little under the weight of lead the little cortege passed two by two A broken hearted lover a grief stricken father and a dozen sweet girls their eyes and cheeks streaming with tears Kitty their girl friend was dead The word dead rang in their hearts in answer to the mournful tolling of the bell The little by way along which they went the little green path leading over the hill was strewn with blossoms fallen from the bier and the fingers of the weeping girls The old church was all in white great lilies in vases wreaths of stephanotis and above all roses great garlands of white roses had been woven and they hung along and across A blossom fell a sob sounded in the stillness An hour of roses an hour of sorrow and the coffin sank out of sight a snow drift of delicate bloom descended into the earth XVI John wandered through the green woods and fields into the town He stood by the railway gates He saw the people coming and going in and out of the public houses and he watched the trains that whizzed past A train stopped He took a ticket and went to Brighton He walked through the southern sunlight of the town The brown sails of the fishing boats waved in translucid green and the white field of the sheer cliff and all the roofs gables spires balconies and the green of the verandahs were exquisitely indicated and elusive in the bright air and the beach was loud with acrobats and comic minstrels and nurse maids lay on the pebbles reading novels children with their clothes tied tightly about them were busy building sand castles But he saw not these things on his mind was engraved a little country cemetery graves yews a square impressive spire He heard not the laughter and the chatter of the beach but the terrible words Earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust and the dread responsive rattle given back by the coffin lid And these his soul cried are the true realities death and after death Heaven or Hell Then he wondered at the fate that had led him from his calm student life He had come to Thornby Place with the intention of founding a monastery instead he had fallen in love the word shocked him and he asked himself if he had ever thought of her more as a wife than as a sister if he could have been her husband He feared that he had adventured perilously near to a life of which he could nowise sustain or fulfil to a life for which he knew he was nowise suited and which might have lost him his soul He never could have married her no not when it came to the point He thought of the wedding breakfast the cake the speeches the congratulations and of the woman with whom he would have gone away of the honeymoon of the bridal chamber He knew now that he could not have fulfilled the life of marriage If those things had happened he would have had to tell her ah when it was too late that he was mistaken that he could not in any real sense of the word be her husband They could not have lived together They would have had to part His life and hers would have been irretrievably ruined and then John remembered the story of Abelard and Heloise A new Abelard a new Heloise The romance of the idea interested him Then returning suddenly to reality he asked himself what had happened to Kitty what was the cause of her madness Something had occurred Once again as he remembered the blithe innocence of her smiling eyes when they parted on the hill and he recalled with terror the trembling forlorn half crazy girl that had sat opposite him in the drawing room next day He remembered the twitch of her lips the averted eyes and the look of mad fear that had crept over her face her flight from him her cries for help and her desperate escape through the window His thoughts paused and then like a bolt from the blue a thought fell into his mind No he cried not that He tried to shake himself free from the thought it was not to be shaken off That was the explanation It could only be that ah it was that that and nothing but that And as he viewed the delicate elusive externality of the southern town he remembered that he had kissed her he had kissed her by force My God then the difference between us is only one of degree and the vilest humanity claims kinship of instinct with me He clasped his hands across his eyes and feeling himself on the brink of madness he cried out to God to save him and he longed to speak the words that would take him from the world Life was not for him He had learnt his lesson Thornby Place should soon be Thornby Abbey and in the divine consolation of religion John Norton hoped to find escape from the ignominy of life AGNES LAHENS I A grey winter morning filtered through lace curtains into drawing rooms typical of a fashionable London neighbourhood and a moderate income There was neither excess of porcelain nor of small tables nor of screens Two large vases hinted at some vulgarity of taste a grand piano in the back room suggested a love of music and missus Lahens had but to sing a few notes to leave no doubt that she had bestowed much care on the cultivation of her voice But method only disguised its cracks and thinness as powder and rouge did the fading and withering of her skin She was like her voice Lord Chadwick stood behind her following the music bar by bar and with an interest and a pleasure that did not concord with his appearance For there was nothing in his appearance to indicate that his intelligence was on a higher plane than that of the mess room His appearance seemed to fluctuate between the mess room and the company promoter s office He was a good looking solicitor he was a good looking officer the eyes were attractive the nose was too large but it was well shaped a heavy military moustache curled over his cheeks and as he stood nodding his head delighted with the music the seeming commonness of his appearance wore away Her song finished missus Lahens got up from the piano She was tall and well made perhaps too full in the bosom perhaps too wide in the hips and perhaps the smallness of the waist was owing to her stays Her figure suggested these questions She wore a fashionable lilac blue silk pleated over the bosom and round her waist a chatelaine to which was attached a number of trinkets a purse of gold net a pencil case some rings a looking glass and small gold boxes jewelled probably containing powder Her hair was elaborately arranged as if by the hairdresser and she exhaled a faint odour of heliotrope as she crossed the room She was still a handsome woman she once had been beautiful but too obviously beautiful to be really beautiful there was nothing personal or distinguished in her face it was made of too well known shapes the long ordinary clear cut nose and the eyes forehead cheeks and chin proportioned according to the formula of the casts in vestibules That she was slightly declassee was clear in the first glance And she represented all that the word could be made to mean liaisons familiarity with fashionable restaurants and the latest French literature Lord Chadwick saw that she was out of temper and wondered what was the cause He had not yet spoken to her she was singing when he came into the room So laying his hand on her shoulder he said What is the matter Olive But it was some time before he could get an answer At last she said I had an unpleasant scene with the Major this morning I am glad it is no more than that and Lord Chadwick threw himself into an arm chair What further eccentricity has he been guilty of Does he want to sweep the crossing or to wait at table in the crossing sweeper s clothes He has bought an old overcoat from the butler And wants to wear it at lunch No he s got a new suit I insisted on that It came home last night He had to give way for I told him that if he would come down to lunch he must come decently dressed otherwise he would do Agnes a great deal of harm But you couldn t persuade him to stick to his type writing and keep out of the way No and I thought it better not to try Agnes return home has excited him dreadfully and he fancies that it is his duty to watch over her to protect her from my friends Then I suppose we shall never get rid of him He ll be here all day night and day Good Heavens I don t say that I hope that this new idea of his is only a freak He will soon tire of his task of censor of morals Meanwhile we are to be most guarded in our conversation And as for you What has he got against me and Lord Chadwick looked at missus Lahens About me he repeated Nonsense I don t mean that he s jealous but he thinks that we should not continue to see one another Does he give any reason Agnes is coming home to day I shall have to take her into society He says that society will not stand it unless our relations are broken off Society has stood it for the last seven years society will stand anything except the Divorce Court and there s no danger of that The Major s very queer I don t know what s the matter with him I never saw him go on as he did this morning He says that the girl shall not be sacrificed if he can help it You don t think he ll make a row do you Are you afraid Of what For your sake I shouldn t like a row Afraid of a madman like that But he can do nothing I don t see what he can do That s what he said himself He says he can do nothing you should have seen him walking up and down the room dressed in a suit of clothes out of a rag shop yellow grey things two sizes too big for him he has to roll up the ends of the trousers He had no collar on and to keep his neck warm he had tied an old pink scarf round his throat He couldn t walk either way above a couple of yards for the roof slants down almost to the floor he knocked his head against the roof but he did not mind he went on talking half to me half to himself He sent for you then Yes that he d like to see me upstairs I told my maid to say that he was to come down to my room but she brought back word that the Major couldn t come down would I go up to him So I had to go up to his garret You never saw such a place At last I got tired of listening to him I couldn t stand there in the cold any longer I was catching cold But you haven t told me what he said The usual thing that it was the loss of his money that had brought him where he was that if he only had a little money if he could only keep himself he would take his daughter away to live with him He didn t know what would become of her in this house Oh he did go on At last he burst into tears he threw himself at my feet and said he d forgive me everything if I d only think of my daughter What did you say I said the best way to consider his daughter s interests was by avoiding all scandal and wearing proper clothes And he promised he would wear the new suit Yes he promised he would He said that he knew all I said was true That it wasn t my fault that a woman couldn t be expected to respect a man who couldn t keep her that he felt the shame of his position in the house that it had broken his heart that if he had lost his money it was not his fault that the world was full of rogues you know you ve heard him go on I should think I had I don t know how I put up with him Very often it is as much as I can do to prevent myself from running out of the room missus Lahens looked at her lover angrily You don t think what I have to put up with You come here when you like you go away when you like Men are always the same they only think of themselves You don t think of me you do not remember what I have put up with for your sake of the sacrifices I have made for you I should have left him years ago when he lost his money if it hadn t been for fear of compromising you He never would have divorced you He d have been left without a cent if he had and he couldn t have got anything out of me Whatever my husband s faults are he s not mercenary There are many who think more of money and its advantages than he Now what are you angry about Olive and Lord Chadwick laid his hand on her shoulder I don t like unjust accusations not even against my husband The Major is a fool but he is not dishonourable he is the most honourable man that comes to this house It was not on account of my money that he did not divorce me On account of you then Partly strange as that may seem to you and on account of his daughter Lord Chadwick did not answer The conversation was taking a disagreeable turn and as he looked into the fire he thought how he might change it So Agnes returns home to day Yes her father insisted She poor dear begged and prayed to be allowed to become a nun but he would not listen to her any more than he would to me There was no use arguing You know what the Major is you are never sure when he ll turn on you If I opposed him he might come down some evening when there was a party and inform my guests that I kept my daughter imprisoned in a convent that I wouldn t let her out No I daren t oppose him on this point Agnes must come home for a while But the experiment won t succeed I daresay you think so too But for all that I m right as time will prove A mother knows more about her own daughter than any one else and I tell you that Agnes is no more fitted for the world than I am for a convent I shall have to drag her about for a season or two She won t succeed and she ll be wretchedly unhappy I shall be put to any amount of trouble and expense that will be all And then I don t know Even if I did give you up I don t see what would be gained All I could do would be to ask you not to come to the house any more That is nonsense Of course it is nonsense Can I go back on my whole life can I change all my friends If I did I should only collect more exactly like them and without knowing I was doing it Lie low for a month or so and then pursue the same old way With the best intentions in the world we cannot change ourselves But you don t intend to give me up Olive Do you want me to Reggie No dearest we ve held together a long time seven years we cannot give each other up We can t give each other up said missus Lahens It never shall be broken off unless you break it off Lord Chadwick asked himself if he desired to break with her He looked at her and thought that he had never seen her look so old but he could not imagine his life without her Apart from her there was nothing for him His name had been mixed up in questionable city transactions his wife had divorced him and he was over forty Notwithstanding his title he d find it difficult to marry a girl with money he couldn t marry one without Besides he loved Olive as well as a man could love a woman whose lover he has been for seven years missus Lahens looked at him and wondered what there was in him that attached her so firmly They had once loved each other passionately All that was over now But still she loved him He was all she had in the world To live with her husband without Reggie no she could not think of it Even if she did Agnes would profit nothing by it Every one knew of their liaison No one talked about it any more it had been in a way accepted and for them to separate would only serve to set Mayfair gossiping again I know I appear selfish she said not to want to see my daughter must seem selfish But I am not selfish Reggie I ve never been selfish where you have been concerned have I I at least can t accuse you of selfishness Olive You ve always been a good friend to me There was my bankruptcy Do not speak of it I only did for you what you would have done for me I have been very unlucky I was cursed with a husband who was a fool and who lost all his money no one can say he s in his right mind They say that I have driven him out of his mind but that is not so you know that it is not so I ve not driven you out of your mind There never was such a fool as my husband He has acted as stupidly about his daughter as he did about his money First he takes her away from me I m not good enough for her this house isn t good enough for her he shuts her up in a convent and never has her home for fear she should hear or see anything that was not pious and good Then when she wants to become a nun and her mind is made up and her character is formed he insists that she shall come home and that I shall give up my lover and bring her into society But not into the society that comes to my house but into some other society some highly respectable society that neither he nor I knows anything about And to make my task the more easy he insists on living in a servant s room buying the butler s overcoat and running down the street whistling for cabs and carrying my trunks on his shoulder There never was such madness God knows how it will all end She turned her head slightly when her husband entered the room and without getting off the arm of Lord Chadwick s chair said Doesn t he look well in that suit of clothes Reggie The Major was a short man shorter by nearly two inches than his wife or Lord Chadwick His hair had once been red it was now faded and the tall forehead showed bald amid a slight gleaning His beard and moustaches were thick unkempt and full of grey hair The nose was small and aquiline and the eyes shallow and pale blue wore a silly and vacant stare The skin was coloured everywhere alike a sort of conventional tone of flesh colour seemed to have been poured over the face forehead and neck His short thick hands were covered with reddish hair They fidgeted at the trousers and waistcoat too tightly strained across his little round stomach and he did not desist till his wife said I hope you will have finished dressing before our guests arrive Whom have you asked Not the tall thin man who Why not You surely don t think he is a fit companion for Agnes Companion for Agnes no but I don t intend every one that comes here to lunch as a companion for Agnes I m sick of hearing of that girl I ve heard of nothing else for the last week the people she should meet what we should say and not say before her If we aren t good enough for her she should have remained in the convent But what fault may I ask do you find with Moulton Only what you ve told me Am I not right Reggie Oh Reggie will agree with you he hates Moulton I don t like the man The truth is that he sent a note asking if he might come and I knew if I refused he d have nothing to eat You ought to be able to judge Moulton more fairly for it is want of money that has reduced him to his present position He was born a gentleman and his uncle only allows him fifteen shillings a week This pays for his lodging one room which costs five shillings a week another five shillings a week goes for current expenses a cup of tea in the morning and a few omnibus fares the remaining five shillings goes towards his clothes So every day he finds himself face to face with the problem where he shall lunch where he shall dine He s good looking women like him and any little present they make him is welcomed I can assure you He said the other day Look at my boot there s a hole in it I shall be laid up with a cold You don t know what it is to be ill in a room for which you pay five shillings a week What could I do but to tell him that he might order a pair at my shoemaker s And he ordered a pair that cost three pounds said Lord Chadwick Yes I did think that he might have chosen a cheaper pair But you re rather hard on him said missus Lahens he s not the only man in London who takes money from women I wonder he doesn t go to Mashonaland or to Canada said the Major If every one who could not make his living here went to Mashonaland or Canada the London drawing rooms would be pretty empty You mean that for me Olive said the Major I would go to morrow to Mashonaland if I were as young as Moulton At that moment a youngish looking man about five and thirty came into the room quickly Notwithstanding the wintry weather he was clad in a light grey summer suit he wore a blue shirt and a blue linen tie neatly tied and pinned missus Lahens the Major and Reggie glanced at the boots which had cost three pounds and missus Lahens thought how carefully that grey summer suit was folded and laid away in the tiny chest of drawers which stood next the wall by the little window mister Moulton was clean shaved His features were long and regular a high Socratic forehead suggested an intelligence which his conversation did not confirm His manners were stagey and there was a hollow cordiality in the manner in which he said How do you do and shook hands Immediately his blue superficial glassy eyes were turned to missus Lahens and he studied her figure in her new gown and whispered that he had never seen her looking better So there he is and in his new clothes Curious little fellow he is said Moulton eyeing the Major Did he offer much resistance You don t seem torn at all Not a scratch I did all I could to dissuade him but I know suffering from daughter on the brain Tell me shall we see much of him Will he come down every day to lunch and what about dinner I hope not I think not he has his typewriting to attend to At all events the mystery is cleared up I don t think I ever was believed when I said that I had once spoken to him on the stairs Do you hear that Major mister Moulton says that he doesn t think he ever was believed when he said that he had once spoken to you on the staircase Major do you hear Yes dear I hear But I am talking to Reggie about Miss Lahens By the way mister Moulton my daughter Miss Lahens is coming home to day so I hope that you ll be guarded in your conversation and will say nothing that a young girl may not hear I shall be very pleased to see Agnes again said Moulton If I had thought of it I would have read up the lives of the saints I beg mister Moulton that you do not speak disrespectfully of Miss Lahens Perhaps there is nothing in your conversation that is fit for her to hear Moulton looked at missus Lahens then taking in the situation he said If I have the pleasure of talking to Miss Lahens I shall confine my conversation to those subjects with which she is familiar I shall acquit myself better than you I think Major I have a sister who is a nun I know a good deal about convents I m glad to hear it said the Major I wanted you to know that my daughter has been very strictly brought up My dear Major said missus Lahens you had better write on a piece of paper My daughter Miss Lahens comes home from school to day and my guests at lunch are particularly requested to be guarded in their conversation You can put it up where every one can see it then there can be no mistake The only disadvantage of this will be that at the end of the week Agnes will be the talk of the town If Lilian Dare were to hear you she would But you haven t asked her Why not she s received everywhere Not where there are young girls You know how she got her money Oh yes we ve all heard that story said missus Lahens and before the Major could reply the servant announced Miss Lahens and Father White Who is Father White whispered Moulton I haven t the least idea said missus Lahens II Agnes wore a jacket made of some dark material she held a little fur muff in her hand and under a black straw hat her blue eyes smiled and when she caught sight of her mother she uttered a happy cry missus Lahens looked at Agnes curiously at this thin girl for though Agnes face was round and rosy her waist was slender and her hands and hips and bosom and missus Lahens was unconsciously affected by the contrast that her own regular and painted features and her long life of social adventure presented to this pretty dovelike girl this pale conventual rose without instinct of the world and into whose guileless mind no knowledge of the world would apparently ever enter Oh father how are you I did not see you the room is so dark Agnes kissed her father and with her right hand in her mother s left hand and her left hand in her father s left she looked at her parents overcome by her affection for them But suddenly remembering she said But I haven t introduced you to Father White How rude of me Father White was good enough to see me home The Mother Abbess was afraid I should get into a wrong train or get run over in the streets The little priest came forward shyly His black cloth trousers were too short and did not hide his clumsy laced boots His features were small and regular and his light brown hair grew thick on his little round head which he carried on one side He was young seven or eight and twenty and so good looking that some unhappy romantic passion suggested itself as the cause of his long black coat and penitential air I m sure that we re very much obliged to you for your kindness Father White said missus Lahens I was going to London and the Mother Abbess asked me to take charge of Miss Lahens and surrender her safe into your hands Won t you sit down Father White said missus Lahens I want to talk to you about Agnes I hope you will stop to lunch I wish you would Thank you but I m afraid I cannot I have an engagement to lunch with the Dominicans I m sorry but you can spare me a few minutes said missus Lahens leading him away Lord Chadwick came forward and shook hands with Agnes I m afraid you ve forgotten me Agnes It is nearly five years No I haven t at least not quite It was in the country at the cottage in Surrey You re the gentleman who used to go out driving with mother Yes you re right so far I used to go out driving with missus Lahens You used to come too And very often you used to speak French to mother I never could understand why I used to think and think And do you remember any of the things he used to say in French said mister Moulton No I didn t understand French then But you do now Yes Our school is one of the best we are taught everything I m sorry for that There ll be nothing for us to teach you For you to teach me said Agnes looking at him inquiringly At that moment the servant announced mister Harding The Major went forward and welcomed him cordially You see you ve lost your bet Moulton whispered to Harding We were very sorry to lose her said Father White and she was sorry to leave but it would not be right for her to take vows to enter a severe order until she has seen the world and had opportunities of knowing if she has a vocation On that point I shall be very firm with her you can rely on me missus Lahens I m afraid that she will never care for society I m afraid that this experience will not prove of much avail She ll return to the convent I shall be sorry to lose her She s indeed a good girl and if she finds that she has a vocation Now you are speaking about me said Agnes I can hear the word vocation missus Lahens smiled and was about to reply when the servant announced Miss Lilian Dare Lilian was a red blonde her rich chestnut hair fell over her ears like wings and she was showily dressed in an expensive French gown which did not suit her which made her seem older than she was So you have come alone Yes dear Lady Duckle was not feeling well this morning she sends you her love and begs you ll excuse her Oh yes we ll excuse her But tell me Lilian said missus Lahens taking the girl aside how do you like living with her It is delightful you don t know what it means to me to get away from home all those brothers and sisters that hateful suburb You must never speak of it again Islington where is that you must say if Islington should happen in the conversation which is not likely I always told you that you d have to throw your family over We want you not your family Chaperons nowadays are a make believe Lady Duckle will suit you very well she ll feel ill when you don t want her when you do she ll be all there She s an honest old thing and will do all that s required of her for the money you pay her Thirty pounds a month that s it isn t it dear The servant announced Lady Castlerich Lady Castlerich disguised her seventy years under youthful gowns and an extraordinary yellow wig She wore a large black hat trimmed with black ostrich plumes it became her she looked quite handsome and her cracked and tremulous voice was as full of sympathy as her manner was of high breeding She seemed very fond of Lilian and was soon engaged in conversation with her You mustn t disappoint me my dear you must come to my shootin party on the twenty fifth and dear Lady Duckle I hope she ll come too though she is rather a bore I shall have plenty of beaux for you there is my neighbour Lord Westhorpe he s young and handsome a beautiful place charmin my dear And if you don t like him there s my old lover Appletown you know my dear all that is a long while ago I said to Appletown more than ten years ago Appletown this must end I am an old woman You ve no idea the look he gave me Florence he said don t call yourself an old woman I can t bear it You ll never be an old woman at least not in my eyes Charmin wasn t it no one but a nice man could speak like that So we ve always remained friends Appletown has his rooms at Morelands and he does as he likes He likes you dear he told me so I ve got a telegram from him I ll show it to you after lunch The servant announced mister Herbert saint Clare a fastidiously dressed man He was tall and thin and his eyes were pale and agreeable his beard was close clipped he played with his eye glass and shook hands absent mindedly Oh mister saint Clare I m enchanted with your last song said Lady Castlerich Every one is talking of it it is quite the rage charmin I wish I had had it ten years ago my voice is gone now You still sing charmingly Lady Castlerich not much voice is required if the singer is a musician You re very kind and the old lady laughed with pleasure and missus Lahens smiled satirically and whispered Oh you fibber saint Clare I m not fibbing he answered she sings the old Italian airs charmingly Soon after lunch was announced and missus Lahens once more asked Father White to stay He begged her to excuse him and she went into the diningroom leaving him in the passage with Agnes Good bye my dear child I shall see you next week I will write telling you when I m coming and you ll tell me what you think of the world The convent is only for those who have a vocation You can serve God in the world as well as elsewhere I wonder said Agnes and she looked doubtfully into the priest s eyes I wonder I confess I m a little curious At present I do not understand at all Of course the convent is very different from the world said Father White You learnt to understand the convent now you must learn to understand the life of the world Must I Why must I So that you may be sure that you have a vocation Good bye dear child The Lord be with you Agnes went into the dining room and she noticed that every one was listening to her father who was talking of the success her mother had had at a concert She had sung two songs by Gounod and Cherubino s Ave Maria He declared that he had never seen anything like it He wished every one had been there His wife was in splendid voice It was a treat and the public thought so too Agnes listened and was touched by her father s admiration and love for her mother But very soon she perceived that the others were listening superciliously Suddenly missus Lahens intervened My dear Major you re talking too much remember your promise The Major said not another word and Agnes felt sorry for her father She remembered him far back in her childhood always a little weak and kind always devoted to her mother always praising her always attending on her always carrying her music reminding her of something she had forgotten and running to fetch it Looking at him now after many years she remembered that she used to see more of him than she did of her mother He used to come to see her in the nursery and she remembered how they used to go out together and sit on the stairs so that they might hear mother who was singing in the drawing room She remembered that she used to ask her father why they could not go to the drawing room He used to answer that mother had visitors She used to hear men s voices and then mother would call her father down to wish them good bye Her memories of her mother were not so distinct She never saw her mother except on the rare occasions when she was admitted to the drawing room she remembered her standing in long shining dresses with long trains curled around her feet which she kicked aside when she advanced to receive some visitor or she remembered her mother on the stairs a bouquet in her hand a diamond star in her hair the front door was open and the lamps of the brougham gleamed in the dark street Then her mother would kiss her and tell her she must be a good girl and go to sleep when she went to bed There had never seemed to be but one person in the house and that was mother Where was mother going to the theatre to a dinner party to the opera and the phrase When shall the carriage come to fetch mother had fixed itself on her memory And in her mother s bedroom the largest and handsomest room in the house she remembered the maid opening large wardrobes putting away soft white garments laces green silk and pink petticoats more beautiful than the dresses that covered them The large white dressing table strewn with curious ivories the uses of which she could not imagine had likewise fixed itself on her memory She remembered the hand glasses the scattered jewellery the scent bottles and the little boxes of powder and rouge and the pencil with which her mother darkened her eyebrows and eyelids For missus Lahens had always been addicted to the use of cosmetics therefore the paint on her mother s face did not shock Agnes as it might otherwise have done But she could not but notice that it had increased Her mother s mouth seemed to her now like a red wound Ashamed of the involuntary comment Agnes repelled all criticism and threw herself into the belief that all her mother did was right that she was the best and most beautiful woman in London that to be her daughter was the highest privilege Her thoughts were entirely with her parents and she had hardly spoken to the men on either side of her mister Moulton had asked her if she were glad to come home if she rejoiced in the prospect of balls and parties if she were sorry to leave her favourite nun She had answered his questions briefly and he had returned to his exchange of gallantries with Lady Castlerich who he hoped would invite him to Morelands Agnes did not quite like him She liked mister saint Clare better saint Clare had asked her if she sang and when she told him that she was leading soprano in the convent choir he had talked agreeably until Miss Dare said Now mister saint Clare leave off flirting with Agnes Her remark made every one laugh and in the midst of the laughter missus Lahens said So my little girl is coming out of her shell Out of cell said mister Moulton laughing Out of her what asked Lady Castlerich You don t know Lady Castlerich that my Agnes wanted to become a nun to enter a convent where they get up at four o clock in the morning to say matins Oh how very dreadful said Lady Castlerich Agnes must come to my shootin party Father White the priest you saw here just now brought her home Fortunately he took our side and he told Agnes she must see the world it would be time enough a year hence to think if she had a vocation Mother dear he said six months What are you tired of us already Agnes No mother but Agnes hung down her head Agnes must come to my shootin party we must find a young man for her there is mister Moulton or would you like mister saint Clare better I hope mister Moulton you ll be able to come to Morelands on the twenty fifth mister Moulton said that nothing would give him more pleasure and feeling that Lady Castlerich intended that his charms should for ever obliterate Agnes conventual aspiration he leaned towards her and asked her if she knew Yorkshire Morelands was in Yorkshire His conversation was however interrupted by Lady Castlerich who said in her clear cracked voice We must put Agnes in the haunted room amid the tapestries No no don t frighten her whispered the Major But father I am not so easily frightened as that Who haunts the tapestry room A nun dear so they say Morelands was a monastery once a nunnery I mean The monastery was opposite That was convenient giggled mister Moulton And why does the nun haunt the tapestries Ah my dear that I can t tell you Perhaps the nun was a naughty nun suggested mister Moulton Are there no naughty nuns in your convent Oh no not in my convent all the sisters are very good you cannot imagine how good they are said Agnes and she looked out of eyes so pale and so innocent that he almost felt ashamed But what a strange idea that was of yours Agnes said Miss Dare across the table to want to shut yourself up for ever among a lot of women with nothing else to do but to say prayers You think like that because you do not know convent life There is I assure you plenty to do plenty to think about Fancy they hardly ever speak only at certain hours said missus Lahens It is the getting up at four o clock in the morning that seems to me the worst part said Miss Dare The monotony said saint Clare must be terrible always the same faces never seeing anything new knowing that you will never see anything else Agnes listened to these objections eagerly The nuns are not sad at all she said If you saw them playing at ball in the garden you would see that they were quite as happy as those who live in the world I don t know if you are sad in the world I don t know the world but I can assure you that there is no sadness in the convent Agnes paused and looked round Every one was listening and it was with difficulty she was induced to speak again Then in answer to her mother s questions she said We have our occupations and our interests They would seem trivial enough to you but they interest us and we are happy There must be said Lilian satisfaction in having something definite to do to know where you are going and what you are striving for We don t know what we are striving for or where we are going And the trouble we give ourselves Say what you will it is something to be spared all that Yet if we asked the ordinary man said Harding what he d do if he had ten thousand a year he would answer that he would do nothing But he may not The only man who does nothing is the man who suddenly acquires ten thousand a year he tries to live on his income he doesn t he dies of it And those who are born rich asked Moulton They work hard enough and their work is the hardest of all their work is amusement For by some strange misunderstanding all the most tedious and unsatisfactory means of distraction are termed amusement betting gambling travelling dinner parties love making Whereas the valid and sufficient form of distraction earning your livelihood by the sweat of your brow is designated by the unpleasant word Labour But if you are fortunate in love you re happy said old Lady Castlerich I think I have made my lovers happy Harding laughed Happy for how long That depends Love is not a joy that lasts for ever the old lady added with a chuckle But did no woman make you happy mister Harding asked Lilian and she fixed her round prominent eyes upon him The woman who gives most happiness gives most pain The man who leaves an adoring mistress at midnight suffers most A few minutes of distracted happiness as he drives home He falls asleep thanking God that he will see her at midday But he awakes dreading a letter putting him off He listens for the footstep of a messenger boy If she doesn t disappoint him She will disappoint him sooner or later I have never disappointed you said Lilian still looking at Harding But you have not been to see me No I ve not been to see you she replied and played distractedly with some dried fruit on her plate These are confessions said Lady Castlerich laughing Confessions of missed opportunities said Moulton So then your creed is that love cannot endure said Lord Chadwick The love that endures is the heaviest burden of all Harding replied incautiously A silence fell over the lunch table and all feared to raise their eyes lest they should look at missus Lahens and Lord Chadwick I suppose you are right said missus Lahens It is not well that anything should outlive its day But sometimes it happens so But look she exclaimed laughing nervously how Agnes is listening to saint Clare Those two were made for each other Celibacy and Work Which is Celibacy and which is Work I think Olive said the Major that you are rather hard upon the girl You forget that she has only just come from school and doesn t understand My dear Major said missus Lahens and her voice was full of contempt for her husband is it you or I who has to take Agnes into society As I told you before Agnes will have to accept society as it is She won t find her convent in any drawing room I know and the sooner she makes up her mind on that point the better for her and the better for us Society will listen for five minutes said Lilian to tales of conventual innocence And be interested in them said Lord Chadwick as in an account of the last burlesque With this difference said Moulton that society will go to the burlesque but not to the convent Agnes glanced at her mother seeing very distinctly the painted worldly face That her mother should speak so cruelly to her cut her to the heart and she longed to rush from the room from all these cruel hateful people another word and she would have been unable to refrain but in the few seconds which had appeared an eternity to Agnes the conversation suddenly changed Lilian Dare had returned to the idea expressed by Harding that he had only found happiness in work and this was saint Clare s opportunity to speak of the opera he was writing In the first act barbarians are making a raft What are they making the raft for asked Lady Castlerich To get to the other side of a lake They have no women and they hope to rob the folk on the other side of theirs saint Clare explained the various motives he was to employ the motive of aspiration or the woman motive was repeated constantly on the horns during the building of the raft saint Clare sang the motive It was with this motive that he began the prelude Then came two variations on the motive and then the motive of jealousy saint Clare was eager to explain the combinations of instruments he intended to employ and the effect of his trumpets at a certain moment but the servant was handing round coffee and liqueurs and the story of what happened to the women who were carried off on the raft had to be postponed saint Clare looked disappointed But he was in a measure consoled when Lady Castlerich told him that they d go through the opera together when he came to stay with her for her shooting party Won t you sing something Lilian said missus Lahens as they went upstairs No dear I d sooner not but you will I d sooner sing a little later I don t know where my music is it has been all put away But do you sing saint Clare will accompany you Do to please me and missus Lahens sat down in a distant corner She had said that very morning as she painted her face before the glass I am an old woman or nearly How many more years Three at most then I shall be like Lady Castlerich And the five minutes she had spent looking into an undyed and unpainted old age had frightened her She had hated the world she had worshipped so long She had hated all things and wished herself out of sight of all things That she who had been so young so beautiful so delightful to men should become old ugly and undesirable That she should one day be like Lady Castlerich That such things should happen to others were well enough that they should happen to her seemed an unspeakable and revolting cruelty And it was at that moment that her husband had sent for her He had told her she must give up her lover for her daughter s sake Should she do this Could she do this She did not know But this she did know that the present was not the time to speak to her of it Give him up hand him over to that horrid missus Priestly who was trying all she could to get him Whatever else might be that should not be She loved her daughter and would do her duty by her daughter but they must not ask too much of her She had lost her temper she had said things that she regretted saying but what matter what did the poor Major matter a poor mad thing like him These were the thoughts that filled missus Lahens mind while Lilian sang The purity of Lilian s voice was bitterness to missus Lahens and it was bitterness to remember that saint Clare loved that face For no one now loved her face except perhaps Chad and they wanted her to give him up It was the knowledge that the time of her youth was at an end that forced missus Lahens to say that Lilian sang out of tune and to revive an old scandal concerning her Surely mother said Agnes all you say did not happen to the young girl who has just left the room III Through the house in Grosvenor Street men were always coming and going Quite a number of men seemed to have acquired the right of taking their meals there When Lord Chadwick absented himself he explained his enforced absence from the table and Agnes noticed that while Lord Chadwick addressed her mother openly as Olive mister Moulton did so surreptitiously in a whisper or when none but their intimate friends were present They rarely assembled less than six or seven to lunch after lunch they went to the drawing room and the eternal discussion on the relations of the sexes was only interrupted by the piano saint Clare played better than Lord Chadwick but missus Lahens preferred Lord Chadwick to accompany her He followed her voice always making the most of it At five o clock the ladies had tea very often the men chose brandies and sodas cigarettes were permitted and in these influences all the scandals of the fair ran glibly from the tongue and surprising were the imaginations of missus Lahens scandalous brain The reserve that Agnes innocence imposed on the wit of the various narratives and on the philosophy of the comments often became painfully irksome and on noticing Harding s embarrassments missus Lahens would suggest that Agnes went to her room Agnes gladly availed herself of the permission and without the slightest admission to herself that she hated the drawing room Such admission would be to impugn her mother s conduct and Agnes was far too good a little girl to do that She preferred to remember that she liked her own room her mother let her have a fire there all day it was a very comfortable room and she was never lonely when she was alone She had her books and there were the dear sisters she had left to think about Besides she would meet the men again at dinner so it would be just as well to save her little store of conversation She did not want to appear more foolish and ignorant than she could help After dinner missus Lahens and Lilian Dare went off somewhere in a hansom They often went to the theatre Sometimes Agnes went with them She had been twice to the theatre She had been thrilled by a melodrama and pleased by an operetta But the rest of the party mother mister Moulton Lilian and mister saint Clare had declared that both pieces were very bad very dull But they were all anxious to see a comedy about which every one was talking they were certain that they would be amused by it and there was some discussion whether Agnes should be taken Agnes instantly withdrew from the discussion She did not care to go she felt she was not wanted and she even suspected that she would not like the play So it was just as well that she was not going But after dinner it was decided that she was to go Lord Chadwick was with them Agnes had never seen him more attentive to her mother and mister saint Clare was absorbed in Lilian She had Agnes heard her mother say succeeded in making him so jealous that he had asked her to marry him But missus Lahens did not think that Lilian would marry him nowadays girls in society did not often marry their lovers they knew that the qualities that charm in a lover are out of place in a husband Agnes sat in the back of the box and wondered why Lilian s refusal to marry saint Clare had made no difference in his affection nor in hers they seemed as intimate as ever and Agnes could hear them planning a rendezvous Lilian was going south but saint Clare was to meet her in Paris Agnes wondered a thought she did not like crossed her mind she put it instantly aside and bent her attention on the play There was a great deal in it that she did not understand or that she only understood vaguely She did seem to wish to understand it But the others listened greedily as well they might for the conversation on the stage was like the conversation in the Grosvenor Street drawing room as like as if a phonograph was repeating it I should not make such a fuss if I heard that my dear Major had Agnes did not hear the rest of the sentence If I were to revenge myself on you Lilian You had better not Besides there is nothing to revenge Isn t there said saint Clare and his face grew suddenly grave You are my first and you ll be my last Agnes heard her whisper and she saw saint Clare look at her incredulously You don t believe me Well I don t care what you believe and she turned her back on him and listened to the play And when the play was done Agnes went home in a hansom sitting between her mother and Lord Chadwick saint Clare and Lilian followed in another hansom and the two hansoms drew up together in Grosvenor Street After the theatre there was always supper and Agnes knew that they would sit talking till one or two in the morning She was not hungry she was tired she asked if she might go to her room they were all glad to excuse her and she ran up to her room and closed the door She threw off her opera cloak hastily and then stood looking into the fire Suddenly her brain filled with thoughts which she could not repress and involuntary sensation crowded upon her There was the vivid sensation of her mother s painted face there was the sensation of her father his strange clothes his shy pathetic face She preferred to think of her father and she asked herself why he did not go to the theatre with them why he did not appear oftener at meals His food was generally taken to him Where did he live Up that narrow flight of stairs She had seen him run up those stairs in strange haste as if he didn t wish to be seen like a servant an under servant whose presence in the front of the house is discrepant Suddenly Agnes felt that she was very unhappy and she unlaced her bodice quickly The action of unlacing distracted her thoughts She would not go to bed yet She took a chair and sat down in front of the fire thinking The convent appeared to her clear and distinct in all its quiet life of happy devotion and innocent recreation She remembered the pleasure she used to take in the work of the sacristy in laying out the vestments for the priest for Father White and in the games at ball in the garden with those dear nuns She remembered them all and seen through the tender atmosphere of sorrow they seemed dearer than ever they had done before How happy she had been with them she did not expect ever to be so happy again The world was so lonely so indifferent She was very unhappy And her life seemed so fragile that the least touch would break it Her tears flowed as from a crystal and they did not cease until the silence in the street allowed her to hear her father s quick steps pacing it She could hear his steps coming from Grosvenor Square Her poor father Every night it was the same ceaseless pacing to and fro She had heard her mother say that he sometimes walked till three in the morning She had watched him a night or two ago out of her window It was freezing hard and he had on only an old grey suit of clothes buttoned tightly and a comforter round his neck Her father s subordination in the house was one of the mysteries which confronted Agnes She did not understand but she knew by instinct that her father was not happy and her unhappiness went out to his She pitied him she longed to make him happier Others might think him strange but she understood him Their talk was strange to her not his Last Sunday he had taken her to mass and they had walked in the park afterwards and he had been happy until they met mister Moulton A little later they had met her mother and Lord Chadwick mister saint Clare and Miss Lilian Dare had come to lunch She had seen no more of her father that day She had hoped that Father White would come and see her but he had not come she had sat in her room alone and after dinner her mother had scolded her because she did not talk to Lord Chiselhurst an old man who had talked to her in a loud rasping voice He was overpowering her strength had given way she had fainted and she had been carried out of the room When she opened her eyes saint Clare was standing by her She was glad it was he and not Lord Chiselhurst who had carried her out But they would not let her back to the convent before six months She had been a week at home and it had seemed a century The time would never pass She did not think she would be able to endure it for six months Her father did not like her to go back Was it not her duty to remain by him He was as unhappy as she and she was very unhappy Tears streamed down her cheeks and she cried until her tears were interrupted by the sound of her father s latchkey She listened to his footsteps as he came upstairs When he arrived on her landing instead of going to the end of the passage and up the staircase he stopped it seemed as if he were hesitating about something Agnes wondered and hoped he was coming to see her A moment after he knocked Is that you father Yes Then wait a moment She slipped her arms into her dressing gown and opened the door to him It is nice and snug here he said coming towards the fire nice and snug But bitterly cold in the street I could not keep warm yet I walked at the rate of five miles an hour I ran round Grosvenor Square but the moment I stopped running I began to get cold again I couldn t keep up the circulation anyhow Then sit down and warm yourself father No thank you I like standing up best I ll just stop a minute I hope I am not in the way tell me if I am In the way father what do you mean Nothing dear I only thought Well I ll just get the cold out of my bones before I go up to my room It is cold up there I can tell you The girl s keen passionate eyes looking out of a grief worn face and a figure so thin that she looked tall contrasted with the little fat man dressed in the yellow tweed suit buttoned across his rounding stomach To see them together by the fire in the bedroom made a strange and moving picture For the figures seemed united by mysterious analogies and the fragments of bread and cheese which the Major held in his old blued fingers were significant I could hear them singing in the drawing room he said when I came in so I stepped into the dining room One feels a bit hungry after walking How did you like the play dear Pretty well father she answered and she strove to check the tears which rose to her eyes You ve been grieving Agnes What have you been grieving for for your convent tell me dear I can t bear to see you unhappy No father don t think of me Not think of you Agnes Of whom should I think then Tell me all everything If you re not happy here you shall go back I won t see you unhappy It is my fault only I thought that you had better come home and see the world first I had thought that we might have altered things here just for your sake But you father you re not happy here you would be still more unhappy if I went back to the convent That is true isn t it Yes that is true dear but you must not think about me There s no use thinking about me I m not worth thinking about Don t say that father you mustn t speak like that and unable to control her feelings any longer Agnes threw herself into her father s arms And she did not speak until she perceived that her father was weeping with her What are you weeping for father For you dear because you re not happy There are other reasons she said looking inquiringly and tenderly No dear there s nothing else now in the world for me to grieve for You must go back to the convent if you re not happy But you father It will be hard to lose you things may change You must have patience wait a little while will you Of course father as long as you like but you ll come down and talk to me here Yes I should have come oftener but I know that I m not clever my conversation isn t amusing so I stick at my work up there You live up there Yes you ve not seen my room a little room under the slates something like a monk s cell I ve often thought of going into a monastery I daresay it is from me that you get the taste You live up there father your room is up there May I go up and see you sometimes I shan t be disturbing you at your work shall I No I should think not just fancy you wishing to come to see me and up there too When may I come father When are you least busy You can come now May I We mustn t make any noise all the servants are asleep and he held the candle higher for her to see the last steps and he pushed open a door It is here It was a little loft under the roof and the roof slanted so rapidly that it was possible to stand upright only in one part of the room There was in one corner a truckle bed which Agnes could hardly believe her father slept in and in the midst of the uncarpeted floor stood the type writing machine the working of which the Major at once explained to Agnes He told her how much he had already earned and entered into a calculation of the number of hours he would have to work before he could pay off the debt he had incurred in buying the machine His wife had advanced him the money to buy it she must be paid back When that was done he would be able to see ahead and he looked forward to the time when he would be independent There were other debts but the first debt was the heaviest His wife had advanced the money for the clothes he had worn at the luncheon party and there was the furniture of his room But that could not be much the bed well that little iron framework he had borrowed it it had come from the kitchen maid s room She had wanted a larger bed But father dear you ve hardly any bedclothes Yes I have dear I have that overcoat and I sleep very well under it too I bought it from the butler I paid him ten shillings for it and I made the ten shillings by copying The money ought to have gone to your mother but I had to have something to cover me it is very cold up here and I thought I had better keep her waiting than contract a new debt But what is mother s is yours father Ah I ve heard people say that but it isn t true How did you lose your money father The Major told her how he had been robbed Then it was not your fault father And the man who robbed you you say is now A great swell and very highly thought of Agnes saw the coarse clothes the common boots and the rough comforter And her eyes wandered round the room the bare miserable little attic garret in which he lived And with that type writing machine she thought he is trying to redeem himself from the disrespect he has fallen into because he was robbed of his money It must be getting very late father I had better go to my room But father you are not comfortable here sleep in my room let me sleep here Let you sleep here my daughter sleep up here among the servants He stayed a few minutes in her room and while warming his hands he said Everything in the world is dependent on money We can preserve neither our own nor the respect of others if we have nothing I have tried It wasn t to be done IV

none	none	She had never seen a type writing machine at work before and admired the nimbleness with which his fingers struck the letters and the dexterity with which he passed fresh sheets of paper under the roller When he had finished and was gathering the sheets together she said How clever you are
6497_234106_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I think I picked it up pretty quickly

6497_234106_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Agnes did not answer for a long while at last she said 
6497_234106_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 There s something father dear that I must speak to you about Mother thinks I ought to marry Lord Chiselhurst that I ought to make up to him and catch him if I can

6497_234106_000021_000007	train-clean-360	She said if that were so she really didn t see why I left the convent 
6497_234106_000022_000000	train-clean-360	She was too intent on what she was saying to notice the light which flashed in the Major s eyes 
none	none	I said Mother I never wanted to leave the convent it was you who wanted me home No she said it was not I it was your father But now that you are here I should like you to make a good marriage Then she turned and kissed me 
6497_234106_000023_000001	train-clean-360	I don t want to say anything against mother she loves me I m sure but we re so different I shall never understand mother I shall never get on in society

6497_234106_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 But father you re not listening 
6497_234106_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Listen to me I ve only you 
6497_234106_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I m thinking 
none	none	Of what Of many things
6497_234106_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Poor father you have a great deal to think of and I come interrupting your work 
6497_234106_000029_000001	train-clean-360	How selfish I am 
6497_234106_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 No dear you re not selfish 
none	none	I m very glad you told me 
6497_234106_000030_000002	train-clean-360	So you think you ll never get on in society 
6497_234106_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think I m suited for society 
none	none	I m afraid you think that all society is like our drawing room How was it father that our drawing room came to be what it is
6497_234106_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 A great deal of it is my fault dear 
6497_234106_000034_000001	train-clean-360	When I lost my money I got disheartened and little by little I lost control 
none	none	One day I was told that as I paid for nothing I had no right to grumble 
6497_234106_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Your mother said in reply to some question about me that I was merely an expense I believe the phrase was considered very clever it went the round of society and eventually was put into a play 
6497_234106_000034_000004	train-clean-360	And that is why I told you that money is everything that it is difficult to be truthful honourable or respectable if you have no money a little will do but you must have a little if you haven t you aren t respectable you re nothing you become like me a mere expense I ve borne it for your sake dearest 
none	none	For my sake father what do you mean
6497_234106_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind best not to ask 
none	none	My dearest daughter I would bear it all over again for your sake But it is maddening work it goes to the head at last It makes one feel as if something was giving way there he said touching his forehead it does indeed But father you mustn t bear this any longer not for my sake father no not for my sake you must find some way out of it I have found a way out of it 
6497_234106_000038_000001	train-clean-360	It took me a long while but I have found the way there it is he said pointing to the type writing machine 
none	none	They don t suspect anything not they the fools they don t know what is hanging over their heads 
6497_234106_000038_000003	train-clean-360	I ll tell you Agnes but you must not breathe a word of it to any one if you did they would take the machine from me for they d like me to remain a mere expense 
6497_234106_000038_000004	train-clean-360	As long as I m that they can do what they like but as soon as I gain an independence as soon as I am able to pay for my meals he whispered I mean to put my house in order But you mustn t breathe a word 
none	none	I ll never do anything father you ask me not to do
6497_234106_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall be able to sweep out all those you don t like 
none	none	There are too many men hanging about here
6497_234106_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Tell me father do you like Lord Chadwick The Major s face changed expression 
none	none	Have I said anything to wound you she said pressing his hand No dear 
6497_234106_000042_000001	train-clean-360	You asked me if I liked Lord Chadwick 
6497_234106_000042_000002	train-clean-360	I was thinking Somehow it seems to me that I rather like him though I have no reason to do so 
6497_234106_000042_000003	train-clean-360	He thinks me crazy but so do others I know that my conversation bores him he always tries to get away from me yet somehow it seems to me that I do like him 
6497_234106_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Is he a fast man father is he like Lord Chiselhurst 
none	none	He is much the same as the other men that come here 
6497_234106_000044_000001	train-clean-360	I don t think he s a bad man no worse than other men 
6497_234106_000044_000002	train-clean-360	Is he kind to you dear tell me that do you like him 
6497_234106_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes father he and mister saint Clare are the men I like best here 
6497_234106_000045_000001	train-clean-360	But why is he here so much father he s no relation 
6497_234106_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 He has dined and lunched here every day for the last ten years 
6497_234106_000046_000001	train-clean-360	He s been an expense too 
6497_234106_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Mother said he is so poor that she has often to lend him money 
none	none	He should have spent some of the money she lent him on a type writing machine and striven as I do to make an independence 
6497_234106_000048_000001	train-clean-360	When I ve got together a little independence when I can pay for my meals and my clothes you shall see none that you dislike shall ever come here dearest 
6497_234106_000048_000002	train-clean-360	I ll put my house in order 
6497_234106_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 But that will take a long time father in the meantime 
6497_234106_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 What dear 
6497_234106_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Mother will want me to marry 
6497_234106_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 They shall not force you to marry they shall not ask you to do anything you do not like 
6497_234106_000052_000001	train-clean-360	Lord Chiselhurst ought to be ashamed a man of his age to want to marry a young girl like you 
6497_234106_000052_000002	train-clean-360	I will go and tell him so 
6497_234106_000053_000000	train-clean-360	The Major stood up he was pale and Agnes noticed that his lips trembled 
none	none	No father she said do not go to him I do not know that he wants to marry me it is only mother s idea she may be mistaken
6497_234106_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 You shall not be persecuted by his attentions 
none	none	Lord Chiselhurst is a gentleman father 
6497_234106_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Whatever his faults may be I feel sure when he sees that I do not want him that he will cease to think of me 
6497_234106_000056_000002	train-clean-360	Lord Chiselhurst is not the worst 
6497_234106_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Who then is the worst 
6497_234106_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Who is it that you wish me to rid you of 
6497_234106_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t wish you to be violent father but you might hint to mister Moulton that I do not wish 
6497_234106_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 That man he too is merely an expense 
6497_234106_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 I am sure father that it is not right of him to put his arms round me he tried to kiss me 
none	none	I was alone in the drawing room 
6497_234106_000060_000002	train-clean-360	And he speaks in a way that I do not like I don t know 
none	none	I don t like him he frightens me
6497_234106_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Frightens you 
6497_234106_000061_000001	train-clean-360	That fellow that fellow 
6497_234106_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes he asks me questions 
none	none	He never shall do so again Is he in the drawing room
6497_234106_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but father you cannot speak to him now there are people in the drawing room 
none	none	I don t care who s there No father no I beg of you Mother will never forgive me Father you mustn t make a scene Father you cannot go to the drawing room in those clothes and in desperate resolve Agnes threw herself between the Major and the door pressing him back with both hands
6497_234106_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 They think me a sheep I have been a sheep too long but they shall see that even the sheep will turn to save its lamb from the butcher I ll go to them yes and in these clothes Agnes let me go 
6497_234106_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 I want you to speak to mister Moulton 
6497_234106_000068_000001	train-clean-360	But not now this is not the time 
none	none	He tried to push past her but she resisted him and sat down in front of his type writing machine pale and exhausted the sweat pearling his bald forehead She tried to calm him and to induce him to understand the scandal he would make if he were to go down to the drawing room dressed as he was But her words did not seem to reach the Major s brain 
6497_234106_000070_000002	train-clean-360	He only muttered that the time had come to put his house in order 
6497_234106_000070_000003	train-clean-360	Agnes answered Father for my sake not now But he must obey the idea which pierced his brain and before she could prevent him he slipped past her and opened the door 
6497_234106_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh father don t for my sake please 
6497_234106_000072_000000	train-clean-360	His lips moved but he did not speak 
6497_234106_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 I will not make a scene he said at last 
none	none	Father
6497_234106_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 I will not make a scene but I must do something 
6497_234106_000075_000001	train-clean-360	I promise you that I will not make a scene but I must go down to the drawing room in these clothes 
6497_234106_000075_000002	train-clean-360	In these clothes he repeated 
none	none	There was something in his look which conveyed a sense of the inevitable and Agnes watched him descend the stairs She followed slowly catching at the banisters leaning against the wall 
6497_234106_000075_000005	train-clean-360	She noticed that his step was heavy and irresolute and hoped he would refrain 
none	none	But he went on step after step V He had intended to turn the entire crew out of the house but Agnes had induced him to relinquish this idea and as no fresh idea had taken its place he entered the drawing room with no more than a vague notion that he should parade his old clothes and reprove the conversation Olive I ve come down for a cup of tea I don t mind giving you a cup said missus Lahens but I think you might have taken the trouble to change your clothes that s hardly a costume to receive ladies in Look at him Lady Castlerich that s what I ve to put up with Lady Castlerich will excuse my clothes You know Lady Castlerich that I m very poor Some years ago I lost my money and since then I ve been merely an expense It is most humiliating to have to ask your wife for twopence to take the omnibus My dear Major said Harding what on earth is the matter with you You ve been working too hard But by the way I forgot to tell you I ve just finished a novel which I shall be glad if you ll copy it for me You haven t shown me your machine Come I shall be very glad to have your work to do Harding but I can t talk to you about it just at present You must excuse me I ve an explanation to make Oh do not think of going dear Lady Castlerich do not let my costume frighten you away These are my working clothes The last money I took from my wife was sixteen pounds to buy a type writing machine I made five shillings last week four shillings went towards paying for the machine When I am clear of that debt I shall make enough to pay for my room and my meals I had always intended then to put my house in order But my dear Major said Lady Castlerich trying to get past him your house is charmin the drawing room is perfectly charmin I don t know a more charmin room The room is well enough it is what one hears in the room Hears in the room Major I m sure our conversation has been most agreeable You ll agree with me that it is a little hard that my daughter should have to sit in her bedroom all day But we should be charmed to have her here expostulated the old lady She was here just now but she ran away Yes she ran away from the conversation Ran away from the conversation Major Now what were we talking about Olive I don t know He s in one of his mad humours pay no attention to him Lady Castlerich said missus Lahens Perhaps you were talking about your lovers Lady Castlerich said the Major I m sure I couldn t have been for the fact is I don t remember I really must be going said Harding goodbye missus Lahens And now Major come with me and we ll talk about the typing of the novel Later on Harding later on I ve to speak about my daughter There s so much she doesn t understand You know Lady Castlerich she has been very strictly brought up How very strange I must really be going Good bye Major charmin afternoon I m sure I hope he said turning to Lilian that I can congratulate you on your engagement My engagement With whom mister saint Clare What makes you think that We are not engaged we re merely friends It was given out that you were engaged mister Harding said it was physically impossible for you to see more than you did of each other My dear Major said Harding you re mistaken I never said such a thing I assure you Physically impossible giggled Lady Castlerich That s good But won t you see me to my carriage mister Harding Did you say physically impossible The Major looked round uncertain whom to address next Catching mister Moulton who was stealing past him by the arm he said You too understand how humiliating it is to be a mere expense Why don t you buy a type writing machine Perhaps I shall the first money I get mister Moulton answered and disengaging his arm he hurried away leaving the Major alone with his wife She sat in her arm chair looking into the fire The Major waited expecting her to speak but she said not a word I want to talk to you Olive To hear what I have to say about your conduct I suppose I have nothing to say I m not clever like you and don t say the right thing but something had to be done and I did it as best I could You re madder than I thought you were Something had to be done Something had to be done What do you mean But it doesn t matter Yes it does Olive I want you to understand that Agnes must be saved Saved Yes saved from this drawing room you know that it is a pollution for one like her I remember said missus Lahens turning suddenly that you said something about putting your house in order I didn t understand what you meant Did you mean this house Yes But you forget that this is my house So you intend to rescue Agnes from this drawing room You can go both of you I ll have both of you put out of doors You ll not turn your daughter out of doors If my drawing room is not good enough for her let her go back to the convent You took her from me years ago you never thought I was good enough for your daughter There was Chadwick I begged of you to break with him for the sake of your daughter You might have done that I made sacrifices for her I endured this house I accepted your lover Accepted my lover You did not expect a woman to be faithful to a man like you You didn t think that possible did you What was I to do what can a man do who is dependent on his wife for his support Besides there was more than myself to consider there was Agnes had I divorced you she would have suffered Of course you never thought of yourself of this house I daresay you look upon yourself quite as a hero Well upon my word missus Lahens laughed I don t think I thought of myself I daresay the world put the worst construction on my conduct But you can t say that I took much advantage of the fact that you were willing to let me live in the house I gave up my room I live in the meanest room the kitchen maid complained about it she left it there was no use for it What I eat does not cost you much I eat very little Of course I know that that little is too much Meantime I m trying to create a little independence And meantime you shall respect my drawing room But the mischief is done you have insulted my friends you have forced them out of my house The story will be all over Mayfair to morrow It will be said that the sheep has turned at last Nothing is to be gained by keeping you any longer But Agnes Agnes will remain with me You don t propose to take her with you do you I couldn t support her at least not yet awhile not even if Harding gave me the novel he was speaking of to copy Support her Harding give you his novel to copy You poor fool you could not spell the words True that is my difficulty But Agnes cannot remain here without me That is impossible To remain here seeing your friends in this drawing room things to go on as they are that child Olive you must see that that is impossible It would be worse than before If I refuse to have you here any longer you ve no one but yourself to thank Olive remember that she is our child we owe her something I have suffered a great deal for her sake you know I have Do you now suffer something You ll be better for it you ll be happier I am in a way happier for what I have suffered You mean if I consent to let you stay here I was not thinking of that that is not enough Not enough Well what is enough But I cannot listen said missus Lahens speaking half to herself I m keeping him waiting What a fright I shall be Our evening will be spoilt Where are you going I m going to dine with Chad if you wish to know You shall not go to Lord Chadwick said the Major walking close to his wife missus Lahens turned from the glass You shall not go repeated the Major Go at your peril They stood looking at each other a moment with hatred in their eyes Then with tears in his voice the Major said For our daughter s sake give him up She already suspects and it makes her so unhappy She is so good so innocent Think of what a shock it would be to her if she were to discover the truth Give up Chadwick for her sake You ll never regret One day or other it will have to end if you let it end now you ll repair the past Her innocence her goodness Had I married another man I might have been a virtuous woman The world asks too much virtue from women If I had not had Chad I should have gone mad long ago He s been very good to me why should I give him up For why What has my daughter done for me that I should give up all I have in the world and what purpose would be served if I did So that she should preserve her illusions a few months longer That is all If she remain in the world she must learn what the world is If she doesn t want to learn what the world is the sooner she goes back to the convent the better And now I must go I m late You shall not go You shall see no more of Lord Chadwick You shall receive no more of your infamous friends My daughter s mind shall not be polluted Don t talk nonsense Major Let me go or I shall have you turned out of the house I don t want to but you ll force me to Now let me go The Major took his wife by the throat and repeated his demand Say that this adultery shall cease or else Or else you ll kill me Father Agnes had stolen downstairs She had waited a few moments on the threshold before she entered the room necessity ordained and she stood pale and courageous between her parents missus Lahens sat down on the ottoman and when the servant arrived with the lamp Agnes saw that her mother notwithstanding her paint was like death The servant looked under the lamp s shade and turned up the wicks he drew the curtains and at last the wide mahogany door swept noiselessly over the carpet and the three were alone I m sorry Agnes that you were present just now Such a scene never happened before I assure you A point arose between us and I m afraid we both forgot ourselves It would be better if you went upstairs I see said missus Lahens that you understand each other It is I who had better go No mother don t go I would not have you think that that oh how am I to say it missus Lahens looked at her daughter a strange look it was of surprise and inquiry Mother I have been but an apple of discord thrown between you But indeed it was not my fault Mother dear it was not my fault For a moment it seemed as if missus Lahens were going to take her daughter in her arms But some thought or feeling checked the impulse and she said Talk to your father Agnes I cannot stay You shall not go said the Major laying his hand on her arm You shall not go to Lord Chadwick Oh father oh father I beg of you It is with gentleness and love that we overcome our troubles Let mother go if she wants to go The Major took his hand from his wife s arm and missus Lahens said You re a good girl Agnes I wish you had always remained with me If your father had not taken you from me I might She left the room hurriedly and a few moments after they heard her drive away in a cab Father I know everything You overheard Yes father As your voices grew more angry I crept downstairs I heard about Lord Chadwick You must have patience you must be gentle Agnes I have been patient I have been gentle That was my mistake Perhaps father it would have been better if you had acted differently at first a long time ago But I m sure that the present is no time for anger I know that it was on my account that it was to save me that you that you you know what I mean You re right Agnes My mistake began long ago But you must not judge me harshly You do not know you cannot realise what my position has been in this house I could do nothing When a man has lost his money I do not judge you father nor mother either It is not for me to judge I am ignorant of the world and wish to remain ignorant of it I always felt that it would be best so now I am sure of it Agnes it is too soon for you to judge This house She s gone to meet that man but she shall not She shall not I swear it That man I ll take him by the throat I ought to have done so long ago but it is not too late Father let us say a prayer together I have not said one with you since I was a little child Will you kneel down with me and say a prayer for mother She stretched out her hand to him and they knelt down together in the drawing room Agnes said Oh my God we offer up an our Our Father and Hail Mary that thou may saint give us all grace to overcome temptation The Major repeated the prayers after his daughter and when they rose from their knees Agnes said Father I never asked a favour of you before You ll not refuse me this The Major looked at his daughter tenderly You will never again be violent You promise me this father I shall be miserable if you don t You promise me this father You cannot refuse me It is my first request and my last The Major s face was full of tears There were none on Agnes face but her eyes shone with anticipation and desire Promise she said promise I promise And when the temptation comes you ll remember your promise to me Yes Agnes I ll remember The strain that the extortion of the promise had put upon her feelings had exhausted the girl she then pressed her hands to her eyes and dropped on the ottoman For a long while father and daughter sat opposite each other without speaking At last the Major said I must go out I cannot stop here But father remember you are not going to mother No only for a trot round the Square She pressed her hand to her forehead she felt her eyes they were dry and burning and it was not until the servant announced Father White that her tears flowed VI Then you ve heard said Agnes coming forward and taking the priest s hand How did you hear Did you meet father No my dear child I ve heard nothing I did not meet your father I was in London to day for the first time since I last saw you I ought to have called earlier but I was detained I m afraid I m late it must be getting late It must be getting near your dinner hour I see that you know nothing and that I shall have to tell you all Yes my dear child tell me everything Agnes sat on the ottoman Father White took a chair near her Tell me everything I see you ve been weeping You re not happy at home then Oh Father happy if you only knew if you only knew I cannot tell you Then seeing in the priest s arrival a means of escape from the danger of her position between her father and mother she cried You must take me back to the convent to night I cannot meet mother when she comes home Something dreadful might happen Father White you must take me back to the convent say that you will say that you will My dear child you are agitated calm yourself What has happened Tell me It is too long a story it is too dreadful I cannot tell it all to you now Later I ll tell you Take me back to the convent I cannot meet mother I cannot But what has your mother done has she been cruel to you has she struck you Struck me if that were all that would be nothing The priest s face turned a trifle paler He felt that something dreadful had happened The girl was overcome her nerves had given way and she could hardly speak It were not well to insist that she should be put to the torture of a complete narrative Where is your father he said Major Lahens will tell me he knows I suppose all about it Calm yourself Agnes Tell me where your father is that will be sufficient Father is walking round the Square But don t leave me don t I cannot remain in this room alone she said looking round with a frightened air I ll wait till he comes in He may not come in for hours Perhaps he ll never come back anything may happen If he s walking round the Square he can be sent for No Father White I ll be calm I ll tell you I must tell you but you ll not desert me you ll not leave me here to meet mother Don t you think my dear child that it would be better that I should see your father that he should tell me No I d sooner tell you myself Father could not explain To morrow or after in the convent I ll tell you I ll tell you and the Mother Abbess You must see Agnes that I cannot take you away from your father s house without his permission It is not father s house Well your mother s house That is quite different I see that I must tell you of course I must Surely Agnes it would be better to postpone telling me till to morrow you re tired you ve been crying you ll be able to tell me better in the morning I ll call here early to morrow morning No you must take me back to the convent to night I cannot remain here You ll agree with me that I cannot when I tell you all Agnes looked at Father White she was no longer crying she had regained her self possession in the necessity of the moment and she began with hardly a tremble In her voice Mother is not is not I m afraid she is not But how am I to accuse my own mother I m sure now my dear child that I was right when I suggested that I should speak to Major Lahens Because you don t know the circumstances nor do you know my father No it must be I I must tell you There was a note of conviction in Agnes voice which silenced further protestation and Father White listened You see this house and everything here belongs to mother It is she who pays for everything Father lost all his money some years ago he was cheated out of it in the city The loss of his money preyed upon his mind he could not stand the humiliation of asking his wife as he puts it for twopence to take the omnibus Mother did not care for father she cared for some one else and that of course made father s dependence still more humiliating It preyed on his mind and he lives in the house like a servant in a little room under the roof that the kitchen maid would not sleep in He has a type writing machine up there and he makes a few shillings a week by copying he bought the butler s old overcoat It is very sad to see him up there at work and to hear him talk I must tell you that the people who come here are not good people I don t think that they can be very nice the conversation in this drawing room I m sure is not There is a man who comes here whom I don t like at all a mister Moulton He says things that are not nice and he tried to kiss me the other day I was afraid of him and mother used to leave me alone with him I had difficulty in getting away from him so I asked father to speak I thought that father when he met him alone would tell him not to talk as he did but father got so angry that notwithstanding all I could do to prevent him he went down in his old clothes to the drawing room and I suppose insulted every one Anyhow they all went away I felt that something was happening so I listened on the stairs Father and mother were talking violently and when he grasped mother s throat I rushed between them That is the whole story A very terrible story So you see that it is impossible for me to remain here I cannot meet mother after what has happened You must take me to the convent to night Say that you will Father White Have you not thought my child that it may be your duty to remain here as mediator as peace maker Father has promised me that he will never raise his hand to mother again I made him understand that it was by gentleness and patience she must be won back All the more reason that you should remain here to watch and encourage the good work you have begun But Father White I feel that I have done all that I can do My prayers must do the rest But your presence in this house would be an influence for good and would check again as it did to day these unhappy outbursts of violence Father has promised me never to resort to violence again my presence is the temptation to do so things might happen things would be sure to happen that would force him to forget his promise He might kill mother that is the way these things end He has borne with a great deal he has said nothing people think that he feels nothing he may think so himself but something is all the while growing within him and the day comes when he will stand it no longer when he will kill mother Very little suffices I very nearly sufficed I must go Father you must take me away Agnes spoke out of the fulness of her instinct and Father White wondered for such knowledge of life seemed very strange in one of Agnes age and ignorance I understand my child As you say it is difficult for you to remain here But I cannot take you away without consulting your father Father will not oppose my returning to the convent I have spoken to him He knows how unhappy I am But I cannot take you away without his authority I did not intend to leave without bidding father good bye We can stop the cab as we go round the Square But your clothes are not packed They will lend me all I want at the convent my clothes can be sent after me Father you must take me away I cannot remain here and meet mother after what happened My mission here is ended prayer will do the rest I want to go to the convent so that I shall be free to pray for mother Unable to resist the intensity of the girl s will Father White answered that he would wait for her while she went upstairs to get her hat and jacket As he paced the room he tried to think but he could not catch a single thread of thought He was merely aware of the horrible position that this dear good and innocent girl had so unexpectedly found herself thrust into and of the good sense and resource she had displayed in her time of trial No doubt she is right he thought she cannot remain here She must go back to the convent at least for the present But once she goes back she will never again be persuaded to leave it So much the better another soul for God and joy everlasting The door opened Agnes wore the same dress as she had arrived in the same little black fur jacket and her hands were in the same little muff They went downstairs without speaking and Father White called a four wheeled cab As they got in he said You know that I cannot possibly take you away without first obtaining your father s authority We shall meet him as we go round the Square Tell the cabman to drive slowly I ll keep watch this side you keep watch that side we can t miss him I m to drive round the Square till you see a gentleman walking Yes and then we ll stop you said Father White Suddenly Agnes cried There is father there Father White poked his umbrella through the window and Agnes screamed and she had to scream her loudest so absorbed was the Major Father White called to see me I ve asked him to take me back to the convent You ll let me go father I shall be happier there than at home The Major did not answer and the priest said If you ll allow me Major Lahens I d like to have a few minutes conversation with you He got out of the cab and Agnes waited anxiously She could hear them talking and she prayed that she might sleep at the convent that night At last the Major came to the cab door and said If you wish Agnes to go back to the convent with Father White you can I ll work hard and make some money and then you ll come and live with me Yes father Remember you ll always be in my thoughts It is good of you to let me go indeed it is You must try not to miss me too much and you ll often come and see me Yes dear And father dear you ll remember your promise Yes dear Good bye She kissed her father on the forehead and burst into tears The cab jangled on the priest did not speak and gradually through the girl s grief there grew remembrance of the road leading to the convent And though they were still five miles away or more she saw the gate at the corner of the lane the porteress too She saw the quiet sedate nuns hastening down the narrow passages towards their chapel She saw them playing with their doves like innocent children she saw them chase the ball down the gravel walks and across the swards She saw her life from end to end from the moment when the porteress would open the door to the time when she would be laid in the little cemetery at the end of the garden where the nuns go to rest THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of
