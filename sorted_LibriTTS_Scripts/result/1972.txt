2930-5059-0001	train-other-500	and I was indignant that the name of my own people formerly famous and distinguished should sink into oblivion and like smoke be dissipated

has also a vast many promontories and castles innumerable built of brick and stone Its inhabitants consist of four different people the Scots the Picts the Saxons and the ancient Britons eight Three considerable islands belong to it one on the south opposite the Armorican shore called Wight another between Ireland and Britain called Eubonia or Man and another directly north beyond the Picts named Orkney and hence it was anciently a proverbial expression in reference to its kings and rulers He reigned over Britain and its three islands Inis gueith or Gueith six It is fertilized by several rivers which traverse it in all directions to the east and west to the south and north but there are two pre eminently distinguished among the rest the Thames and the Severn which formerly like the two arms of Britain bore the ships employed in the conveyance of riches acquired by commerce The Britons were once very populous and exercised extensive dominion from sea to sea ten Respecting the period when this island became inhabited subsequently to the flood I have seen two distinct relations According to the annals of the Roman history the Britons deduce their origin both from the Greeks and Romans On the side of the mother from Lavinia the daughter of Latinus king of Italy and of the race of Silvanus the son of Inachus the son of Dardanus who was the son of Saturn king of the Greeks and who having possessed himself of a part of Asia built the city of Troy Dardanus was the father of Troius who was the father of Priam and Anchises Anchises was the father of Aeneas who was the father of Ascanius and Silvius and this Silvius was the son of Aeneas and Lavinia the daughter of the king of Italy From the sons of Aeneas and Lavinia descended Romulus and Remus who were the sons of the holy queen Rhea and the founders of Rome Brutus was consul when he conquered Spain and reduced that country to a Roman province He afterwards subdued the island of Britain whose inhabitants were the descendants of the Romans from Silvius Posthumus He was called Posthumus because he was born after the death of Aeneas his father and his mother Lavinia concealed herself during her pregnancy he was called Silvius because he was born in a wood Hence the Roman kings were called Silvan and the Britons from Brutus and rose from the family of Brutus The whole of this as far as the end of the paragraph is omitted in several MSS Aeneas after the Trojan war arrived with his son in Italy and Having vanquished Turnus married Lavinia the daughter of king Latinus who was the son of Faunus the son of Picus the son of Saturn After the death of Latinus Aeneas obtained the kingdom Of the Romans and Lavinia brought forth a son who was named Silvius Ascanius founded Alba and afterwards married And Lavinia bore to Aeneas a son named Silvius but Ascanius one married a wife who conceived and became pregnant And Aeneas having been informed that his daughter in law was pregnant ordered his son to send his magician to examine his wife whether the child conceived were male or female The magician came and examined the wife and pronounced it to be a son who should become the most valiant among the Italians and the most beloved of all men two In consequence of this prediction the magician was put to death by Ascanius but it happened that the mother of the child dying at its birth he was named Brutus ad after a certain interval agreeably to what the magician had foretold whilst he was playing with some others he shot his father with an arrow not intentionally but by accident three He was for this cause expelled from Italy and came to the islands of the Tyrrhene sea when he was exiled on account of the death of Turnus slain by Aeneas He then went among the Gauls and built the city of the Turones called Turnis four At length he came to this island named from him Britannia dwelt there and filled it with his own descendants and it has been inhabited from that time to the present period one Other MSS Silvius two V R Who should slay his father and mother and be hated by all mankind three V R He displayed such superiority among his play fellows that they seemed to consider him as their chief four Tours eleven Aeneas reigned over the Latins three years Ascanius thirty three years after whom Silvius reigned twelve years and Posthumus thirty nine years the latter from whom the kings of Alba are called Silvan was brother to Brutus who governed Britain at the time Eli the high priest judged Israel and when the ark of the covenant was taken by a foreign people But Posthumus his brother reigned among the Latins V R Thirty seven twelve After an interval of not less than eight hundred years came the Picts and occupied the Orkney Islands whence they laid waste many regions and seized those on the left hand side of Britain where they still remain keeping possession of a third part of Britain to this day See Bede s Eccles Hist thirteen Long after this the Scots arrived in Ireland from Spain The first that came was Partholomus one with a thousand men and women these increased to four thousand but a mortality coming suddenly upon them they all perished in one week The second was Nimech the son of two who according to report after having been at sea a year and a half and having his ships shattered arrived at a port in Ireland and continuing there several years returned at length with his followers to Spain After these came three sons of a Spanish soldier with thirty ships each of which contained thirty wives and having remained there during the space of a year there appeared to them in the middle of the sea a tower of glass the summit of which seemed covered with men to whom they often spoke but received no answer At length they determined to besiege the tower and after a year s preparation advanced towards it with the whole number of their ships and all the women one ship only excepted which had been wrecked and in which were thirty men and as many women but when all had disembarked on the shore which surrounded the tower the sea opened and swallowed them up Ireland however was peopled to the present period from the family remaining in the vessel which was wrecked Afterwards other came from Spain and possessed themselves of various parts of Britain one V R Partholomaeus or Bartholomaeus two A blank is here in the MS Agnomen is found in some of the others fourteen Last of all came one Hoctor one who continued there and whose descendants remain there to this day Istoreth the son of Istorinus with his followers held Dalrieta Buile had the island Eubonia and other adjacent places The sons of Liethali two obtained the country of the dimetae where is a city called Menavia three and the province Guiher and Cetgueli four which they held till they were expelled from every part of Britain by Cunedda and his sons one V R Damhoctor Clamhoctor and Elamhoctor two V R Liethan Bethan Vethan three saint David s four Guiher probably the Welsh district Gower Cetgueli is Caer Kidwelly in Carmarthenshire fifteen According to the most learned among the Scots if any one desires to learn what I am now going to state Ireland was a desert and uninhabited when the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea in which as we read in the Book of the Law the Egyptians who followed them were drowned At that period there lived among this people with a numerous family a Scythian of noble birth who had been banished from his country and did not go to pursue the people of God The Egyptians who were left seeing the destruction of the great men of their nation and fearing lest he should possess himself of their territory took counsel together and expelled him Thus reduced he wandered forty two years in Africa and arrived with his family at the altars of the Philistines by the Lake of Osiers Then passing between Rusicada and the hilly country of Syria they travelled by the river Malva through Mauritania as far as the Pillars of Hercules and crossing the Tyrrhene Sea landed in Spain where they continued many years having greatly increased and multiplied Thence a thousand and two years after the Egyptians were lost in the Red Sea they passed into Ireland and the district of Dalrieta At that period Brutus who first exercised the consular office reigned over the Romans and the state which before was governed by regal power was afterwards ruled during four hundred and forty seven years by consuls tribunes of the people and dictators North western part of Antrim in Ulster The Britons came to Britain in the third age of the world and in the fourth the Scots took possession of Ireland The Britons who suspecting no hostilities were unprovided with the means of defence were unanimously and incessantly attacked both by the Scots from the west and by the Picts from the north A long interval after this the Romans obtained the empire of the world sixteen From the first arrival of the Saxons into Britain to the fourth year of king Mermenus are computed four hundred and twenty eight years from the nativity of our Lord to the coming of saint Patrick among the Scots four hundred and five years from the death of saint Patrick to that of saint Bridget forty years and from the birth of Columeille one to the death of saint Bridget four years two one V R Columba two Some MSS add the beginning of the calculation is twenty three cycles of nineteen years from the incarnation of our Lord to the arrival of saint Patrick in Ireland and they make four hundred thirty eight years And from the arrival of saint Patrick to the cycle of nineteen years in which we live are twenty two cycles which make four hundred twenty one years seventeen I have learned another account of this Brutus from the ancient books of our ancestors After the deluge the three sons of Noah severally occupied three different parts of the earth Shem extended his borders into Asia Ham into Africa and Japheth in Europe This proves the tradition of Brutus to be older than Geoffrey or Tyssilio unless these notices of Brutus have been interpolated in the original work of Nennius The first man that dwelt in Europe was Alanus with his three sons Hisicion Armenon and Neugio Hisicion had four sons Francus Romanus Alamanus and Brutus Armenon had five sons Gothus Valagothus Cibidus Burgundus and Longobardus Neugio had three sons Vandalus Saxo and Boganus From Hisicion arose four nations the Franks the Latins the Germans and Britons from Armenon the Gothi Balagothi Cibidi Burgundi and Longobardi from Neugio the Bogari Vandali Saxones and Tarinegi The whole of Europe was subdivided into these tribes Alanus is said to have been the son of Fethuir Fethuir the son of Ogomuin who was the son of Thoi Thoi was the son of Boibus Boibus of Semion Semion of Mair Mair of Ecthactus Ecthactus of Aurthack Aurthack of Ethec Ethec of Ooth Ooth of Aber Aber of Ra Ra of Esraa Esraa of Hisrau Hisrau of Bath Bath of Jobath Jobath of Joham Joham of Japheth Japheth of Noah Noah of Lamech Lamech of Mathusalem Mathusalem of Enoch Enoch of Jared Jared of Malalehel Malalehel of Cainan Cainan of Enos Enos of Seth Seth of Adam and Adam was formed by the living God We have obtained this information respecting the original inhabitants of Britain from ancient tradition This genealogy is different in almost all the MSS eighteen The Britons were thus called from Brutus Brutus was the son of Hisicion Hisicion was the son of Alanus Alanus was the son of Rhea Silvia Fhea Silvia was the daughter of Numa Pompilius Numa was the son of Ascanius Ascanius of Eneas Eneas of Anchises Anchises of Troius Troius of Dardanus Dardanus of Flisa Flisa of Juuin Juuin of Japheth but Japheth had seven sons from the first named Gomer descended the Galli from the second Magog the Scythi and Gothi from the third Madian the Medi from the fourth Juuan the Greeks from the fifth Tubal arose the Hebrei Hispani and Itali from the sixth Mosoch sprung the Cappadoces and from the seventh named Tiras descended the Thraces these are the sons of Japheth the son of Noah the son of Lamech nineteen The Romans having obtained the dominion of the world sent legates or deputies to the Britons to demand of them hostages and tribute which they received from all other countries and islands but they fierce disdainful and haughty treated the legation with contempt Some MSS add I will now return to the point from which I made this digression Then Julius Caesar the first who had acquired absolute power at Rome highly incensed against the Britons sailed with sixty vessels to the mouth of the Thames where they suffered shipwreck whilst he fought against Dolobellus the proconsul of the British king who was called Belinus and who was the son of Minocannus who governed all the islands of the Tyrrhene Sea and thus Julius Caesar returned home without victory having had his soldiers Slain and his ships shattered twenty But after three years he again appeared with a large army and three hundred ships at the mouth of the Thames where he renewed hostilities In this attempt many of his soldiers and horses were killed for the same consul had placed iron pikes in the shallow part of the river and this having been effected with so much skill and secrecy as to escape the notice of the Roman soldiers did them considerable injury thus Caesar was once more compelled to return without peace or victory The Romans were therefore a third time sent against the Britons and under the command of Julius defeated them near a place called Trinovantum London forty seven years before the birth of Christ and five thousand two hundred and twelve years from the creation Julius was the first exercising supreme power over the Romans who invaded Britain in honour of him the Romans decreed the fifth month to be called after his name He was assassinated in the Curia in the ides of March and Octavius Augustus succeeded to the empire of the world He was the only emperor who received tribute from the Britons according to the following verse of Virgil Purpurea intexti tollunt aulaea Britanni twenty one The second after him who came into Britain was the emperor Claudius who reigned forty seven years after the birth of Christ He carried with him war and devastation and though not without loss of men he at length conquered Britain He next sailed to the Orkneys which he likewise conquered and afterwards rendered tributary No tribute was in his time received from the Britons but it was paid to British emperors He reigned thirteen years and eight months His monument is to be seen at Moguntia among the Lombards where he died in his way to Rome twenty two After the birth of Christ one hundred and sixty seven years king Lucius with all the chiefs of the British people received baptism in consequence of a legation sent by the Roman emperors and pope Evaristus V R Eucharistus A marginal note in the Arundel MS adds He is wrong because the first year of Evaristus was A D seventy nine whereas the first year of Eleutherius whom he ought to have named was A D one hundred sixty one Usher says that in one MS of Nennius he found the name of Eleutherius twenty three Severus was the third emperor who passed the sea to Britain where to protect the provinces recovered from barbaric incursions he ordered a wall and a rampart to be made between the Britons the Scots and the Picts extending across the island from sea to sea in length one hundred and thirty three miles and it is called in the British language Gwal Moreover he ordered it to be made between the Britons and the Picts and Scots for the Scots from the west and the Picts from the north unanimously made war against the Britons but were at peace among themselves Not long after Severus dies in Britain Or the Wall One MS here adds The above mentioned Severus constructed it of rude workmanship in length one hundred thirty two miles i e from Penguaul which village is called in Scottish Cenail in English Peneltun to the mouth of the river Cluth and Cairpentaloch where this wall terminates but it was of no avail The emperor Carausius afterwards rebuilt it and fortified it with seven castles between the two mouths he built also a round house of polished stones on the banks of the river Carun Carron he likewise erected a triumphal arch on which he inscribed his own name in memory of his victory twenty four The fourth was the emperor and tyrant Carausius who incensed at the murder of Severus passed into Britain and attended by the leaders of the Roman people severely avenged upon the chiefs and rulers of the Britons the cause of Severus This passage is corrupt the meaning is briefly given in the translation twenty five The fifth was Constantius the father of Constantine the Great He died in Britain his sepulchre as it appears by the inscription on his tomb is still seen near the city named Cair segont near Carnarvon Upon the pavement of the above mentioned city he sowed three seeds of gold silver and brass that no poor person might ever be found in it It is also called Minmanton V R Mirmantum Mirmantun Minmanto Minimantone The Segontium of Antoninus situated on a small river named Seiont near Carnarvon twenty six Maximianus one was the sixth emperor that ruled in Britain It was in his time that consuls two began and that the appellation of Caesar was discontinued at this period also saint Martin became celebrated for his virtues and miracles and held a conversation with him one This is an inaccuracy of Nennius Maximus and Maximianus were one and the same person or rather no such person as Maximianus ever reigned in Britain two Geoffrey of Monmouth gives the title of consul to several British generals who lived after this time It is not unlikely that the town name and dignity still lingered in the provinces after the Romans were gone particularly as the cities of Britain maintained for a time a species of independence twenty seven The seventh emperor was Maximus He withdrew from Britain with all his military force slew Gratian the king of the Romans and obtained the sovereignty of all Europe Unwilling to send back his warlike companions to their wives children and possessions in Britain he conferred upon them numerous districts from the lake on the summit of Mons Jovis to the city called Cant Guic and to the western Tumulus that is to Cruc Occident These are the Armoric Britons and they remain there to the present day In consequence of their absence Britain being overcome by foreign nations the lawful heirs were cast out till God interposed with his assistance We are informed by the tradition of our ancestors that seven emperors went into Britain though the Romans affirm there were nine This district in modern language extended from the great saint Bernard in Piedmont to Cantavic in Picardy and from Picardy to the western coast of France twenty eight Thus aggreeably to the account given by the Britons the Romans governed them four hundred and nine years After this the Britons despised the authority of the Romans equally refusing to pay them tribute or to receive their kings nor durst the Romans any longer attempt the government of a country the natives of which massacred their deputies twenty nine We must now return to the tyrant Maximus Gratian with his brother Valentinian reigned seven years Ambrose bishop of Milan was then eminent for his skill in the dogmata of the Catholics Valentinianus and Theodosius reigned eight years At that time a synod was held at Constantinople attended by three hundred and fifty of the fathers and in which all heresies were condemned Jerome the presbyter of Bethlehem was then universally celebrated Whilst Gratian exercised supreme dominion over the world Maximus in a sedition of the soldiers was saluted emperor in Britain and soon after crossed the sea to Gaul At Paris by the treachery of Mellobaudes his master of the horse Gratian was defeated and fleeing to Lyons was taken and put to death Maximus afterwards associated his son victor in the government Martin distinguished for his great virtues was at this period bishop of Tours After a considerable space of time Maximus was divested of royal power by the consuls Valentinianus and Theodosius and sentenced to be beheaded at the third mile stone from Aquileia in the same year also his son Victor was killed in Gaul by Arbogastes five thousand six hundred and ninety years from the creation of the world thirty Thrice were the Roman deputies put to death by the Britons and yet these when harassed by the incursions of the barbarous nations viz Of the Scots and Picts earnestly solicited the aid of the Romans To give effect to their entreaties ambassadors were sent who made their entrance with impressions of deep sorrow having their heads covered with dust and carrying rich presents to expiate the murder of the deputies They were favourably received by the consuls and swore submission to the Roman yoke with whatever severity it might be imposed The Romans therefore came with a powerful army to the assistance of the Britons and having appointed over them a ruler and settled the government returned to Rome and this took place alternately during the space of three hundred and forty eight years The Britons however from the oppression of the empire again massacred The Roman deputies and again petitioned for succour Once more the Romans undertook the government of the Britons and assisted them in repelling their neighbours and after having exhausted the country of its gold silver brass honey and costly vestments and having besides received rich gifts they returned in great triumph to Rome thirty one After the above said war between the Britons and Romans the assassination of their rulers and the victory of Maximus who slew Gratian and the termination of the Roman power in Britain they were in alarm forty years Vortigern then reigned in Britain In his time the natives had cause of dread not only from the inroads of the Scots and Picts but also from the Romans and their apprehensions of Ambrosius These words relate evidently to some cause of dispute between the Romans Ambrosius and Vortigern Vortigern is said to have been sovereign of the Dimetae and Ambrosius son to the king of the Damnonii The latter was half a Roman by descent and naturally supported the Roman interest the former was entirely a Briton and as naturally seconded by the original Britons In the meantime three vessels exiled from Germany arrived in Britain They were commanded by Horsa and Hengist brothers and sons of Wihtgils Wihtgils was the son of Witta Witta of Wecta Wecta of Woden Woden of Frithowald Frithowald of Frithuwulf Frithuwulf of Finn Finn of Godwulf Godwulf of Geat who as they say was the son of a god not one of the omnipotent God and our Lord Jesus Christ who before the beginning of the world was with the Father and the Holy Spirit company eternal and of the same substance and who in compassion to human nature disdained not to assume the form of a servant but the offspring of one of their idols and whom blinded by some demon they worshipped according to the custom of the heathen Vortigern received them as friends and delivered up to them the island which is in their language called Thanet and by the Britons Ruym two Gratianus Aequantius at that time reigned in Rome The Saxons were received by Vortigern four hundred and forty seven years after the passion of Christ and three according to the tradition of our ancestors from the period of their first arrival in Britain to the first year of the reign of king Edmund five hundred and forty two years and to that in which we now write which is the fifth of his reign five hundred and forty seven years one V R not the God of gods the Amen the Lord of Hosts but one of their idols which they worshipped two Sometimes called Ruoichin Ruith in or river island separated from the rest of Kent and the mainland of Britain by the estuary of the Wantsum which though now a small brook was formerly navigable for large vessels and in Bede s time was three stadia broad and fordable only at two places three The rest of this sentence is omitted in some of the MSS thirty two At that time saint Germanus distinguished for his numerous virtues came to preach in Britain by his ministry many were saved but many likewise died unconverted Of the various miracles which God enabled him to perform I shall here mention only a few I shall first advert to that concerning an iniquitous and tyrannical king named Benlli The holy man informed of his wicked conduct hastened to visit him for the purpose of remonstrating him When the man of God with his attendants arrived at the gate of the city they were respectfully received by the keeper of it who came out and saluted them Him they commissioned to communicate their intention to the king who returned a harsh answer declaring with an oath that although they remained there a year they should not enter the city While waiting for an answer the evening came on and they knew not where to go At length came one of the king s servants who bowing himself before the man of God announced the words of the tyrant inviting them at the same time to his own house to which they went and were kindly received It happened however that he had no cattle except one cow and a calf the latter of which urged by generous hospitality to his guests he killed dressed and set before them But holy saint Germanus ordered his companions not to break a bone of the calf and the next morning it was found alive uninjured and standing by its mother King of Powys V R Benli in the district of Ial in Derbyshire in the district of Dalrieta Belinus Beluni and Benty thirty three Early the same day they again went to the gate of the city to solicit audience of the wicked king and whilst engaged in fervent prayer they were waiting for admission a man covered with sweat came out and prostrated himself before them Then saint Germanus addressing him said Dost thou believe in the Holy Trinity To which the man having replied I do believe he baptized and kissed him saying Go in peace within this hour thou shalt die the angels of God are waiting for thee in the air with them thou shalt ascent to that God in whom thou has believed He overjoyed entered the city and being met by the prefect was seized bound and conducted before the tyrant who having passed sentence upon him he was immediately put to death for it was a law of this wicked king that whoever was not at his labour before sun rising should be beheaded in the citadel In the meantime saint Germanus with his attendants waited the whole day before the gate without obtaining admission to the tyrant thirty four The man above mentioned however remained with them Take care said saint Germanus to him that none of your friends remain this night within these walls Upon this he hastily entered the city brought out his nine sons and with them retired to the house where he had exercised such generous hospitality Here saint Germanus ordered them to continue fasting and when the gates were shut Watch said he and whatever shall happen in the citadel turn not thither your eyes but pray without ceasing and invoke the protection of the true God And behold early in the night fire fell from heaven and burned the city together with all those who were with the tyrant so that not one escaped and that citadel has never been rebuilt even to this day thirty five The following day the hospitable man who had been converted by the preaching of saint Germanus was baptized with his sons and all the inhabitants of that part of the country and saint Germanus blessed him saying a king shall not be wanting of thy seed for ever The name of this person is Catel Drunlue from henceforward thou shalt be a king all the days of thy life Thus was fulfilled the prophecy of the Psalmist He raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the needy out of the dunghill And agreeably to the prediction of saint Germanus from a servant he became a king all his sons were kings and from their offspring the whole country of Powys has been governed to this day Or Cadell Deyrnllug prince of the Vale Royal and the upper part of Powys thirty six After the Saxons had continued some time in the island of Thanet Vortigern promised to supply them with clothing and provision on condition they would engage to fight against the enemies of his country But the barbarians having greatly increased in number the Britons became incapable of fulfilling their engagement and when the Saxons according to the promise they had received claimed a supply of provisions and clothing the Britons replied Your number is increased your assistance is now unneccessary you may therefore return home for we can no longer support you and hereupon they began to devise means of breaking the peace between them thirty seven But Hengist in whom united craft and penetration perceiving he had to act with an ignorant king and a fluctuating people incapable of opposing much resistance replied to Vortigern We are indeed few in number but if you will give us leave we will send to our country for an additional number of forces with whom we will fight for you and your subjects Vortigern assenting to this proposal messengers were despatched to Scythia where selecting a number of warlike troops they returned with sixteen vessels bringing with them the beautiful daughter of Hengist And now the Saxon chief prepared an entertainment to which he invited the king his officers and Ceretic his interpreter having previously enjoined his daughter to serve them so profusely with wine and ale that they might soon become intoxicated This plan succeeded and Vortigern at the instigation of the devil and enamoured with the beauty of the damsel demanded her through the medium of his interpreter of the father promising to give for her whatever he should ask Then Hengist who had already consulted with the elders who attended him of the Oghgul one race demanded for his daughter the province called in English Centland in British Ceint Kent This cession was made without the knowledge of the king Guoyrancgonus two who then reigned in Kent and who experienced no inconsiderable share of grief from seeing his kingdom thus clandestinely fraudulently and imprudently resigned to foreigners Thus the maid was delivered up to the king who slept with her and loved her exceedingly one V R Who had come with him from the island of Oghgul Oehgul or Tingle Angul According to Gunn a small island in the duchy of Sleswick in Denmark now called Angel of which Flensburg is the metropolis Hence the origin of the Angles two V R Gnoiram cono Goiranegono Guiracgono Malmesbury Gorongi Camden Guorong supposed to mean governor or viceroy thirty eight Hengist after this said to Vortigern I will be to you both a father and an adviser despise not my counsels and you shall have no reason to fear being conquered by any man or any nation whatever for the people of my country are strong warlike and robust if you approve I will send for my son and his brother both valiant men who at my invitation will fight against the Scots and you can give them the countries in the north near the wall called Gual one The incautious sovereign having assented to this Octa and Ebusa arrived with forty ships In these they sailed round the country of the Picts laid waste the Orkneys and took possession of many regions even to the Pictish confines two one Antoninus s wall two Some MSS add beyond the Frenesic Fresicum or Fresic sea i e which is between us and the Scotch The sea between Scotland and Ireland Camden translates it beyond the Frith Langhorne says Solway Frith But Hengist continued by degrees sending for ships from his own country so that some islands whence they came were left without inhabitants and whilst his people were increasing in power and number they came to the above named province of Kent thirty nine In the meantime Vortigern as if desirous of adding to the evils he had already occasioned married his own daughter by whom he had a son When this was made known to saint Germanus he came with all the British clergy to reprove him and whilst a numerous assembly of the ecclesiastics and laity were in consultation the weak king ordered his daughter to appear before them and in the presence of all to present her son to saint Germanus and declare that he was the father of the child The immodest woman obeyed and saint Germanus taking the child said I will be a father to you my son nor will I dismiss you till a razor scissors and comb are given to me and it is allowed you to give them to your carnal father The child obeyed saint Germanus and going to his father Vortigern said to him Thou art my father shave and cut the hair of my head The king blushed and was silent and without replying to the child arose in great anger and fled from the presence of saint Germanus execrated and condemned by the whole synod one V R Immodest is omitted in some MSS forty But soon after calling together his twelve wise men to consult what was to be done they said to him Retire to the remote boundaries of your kingdom there build and fortify a city one to defend yourself for the people you have received are treacherous they are seeking to subdue you by stratagem and even during your life to seize upon all the countries subject to your power how much more will they attempt after your death The king pleased with this advice departed with his wise men and travelled through many parts of his territories in search of a place convenient for the purpose of building a citadel Having to no purpose travelled far and wide they came at length to a province called Guenet two and having surveyed the mountains of Heremus three they discovered on the summit of one of them a situation adapted to the construction of a citadel Upon this the wise men said to the king Build here a city for in this place it will ever be secure against the barbarians Then the king sent for artificers carpenters stone masons and collected all the materials requisite to building but the whole of these disappeared in one night so that nothing remained of what had been provided for the constructing of the citadel Materials were therefore from all parts procured a second and third time and again vanished as before leaving and rendering every effort ineffectual Vortigern inquired of his wise men the cause of this opposition to his undertaking and of so much useless expense of labour They replied You must find a child born without a father put him to death and sprinkle with his blood the ground on which the citadel is to be built or you will never accomplish your purpose one V R You shall find a fortified city in which you may defend yourself two V R Guined Guoienet Guenez North Wales three V R Heremi Heriri or Eryri signifying eagle rocks the mountains of Snowdon in Carnarvonshire The spot alluded to is supposed to be Dinas Emrys or the fortress of Ambrosius forty one In consequence of this reply the king sent messengers throughout Britain in search of a child born without a father After having inquired in all the provinces they came to the field of Aelecti one in the district of Glevesing two where a party of boys were playing at ball And two of them quarrelling one said to the other O boy without a father no good will ever happen to you Upon this the messengers diligently inquired of the mother and the other boys whether he had had a father Which his mother denied saying In what manner he was conceived I know not for I have never had intercourse with any man and then she solemnly affirmed that he had no mortal father The boy was therefore led away and conducted before Vortigern the king one V R Elleti Electi Gleti Supposed to be Bassalig in Monmouthshire two The district between the Usk and Rumney in Monmouthshire forty two A meeting took place the next day for the purpose of putting him to death Then the boy said to the king Why have your servants brought me hither That you may be put to death replied the king and that the ground on which my citadel is to stand may be sprinkled with your blood without which I shall be unable to build it Who said the boy instructed you to do this My wise men answered the king Order them hither returned the boy this being complied with he thus questioned them By what means was it revealed to you that this citadel could not be built unless the spot were previously sprinkled with my blood Speak without disguise and declare who discovered me to you then turning to the king I will soon said he unfold to you every thing but I desire to question your wise men and wish them to disclose to you what is hidden under this pavement they acknowledging their ignorance there is said he a pool come and dig they did so and found the pool Now continued he tell me what is in it but they were ashamed and made no reply I said the boy can discover it to you there are two vases in the pool they examined and found it so continuing his questions What is in the vases they were silent there is a tent in them said the boy separate them and you shall find it so this being done by the king s command there was found in them a folded tent The boy going on with his questions asked the wise men what was in it But they not knowing what to reply There are said he two serpents one white and the other red unfold the tent they obeyed and two sleeping serpents were discovered consider attentively said the boy what they are doing The serpents began to struggle with each other and the white one raising himself up threw down the other into the middle of the tent and sometimes drove him to the edge of it and this was repeated thrice At length the red one apparently the weaker of the two recovering his strength expelled the white one from the tent and the latter being pursued through the pool by the red one disappeared Then the boy asking the wise men what was signified by this wonderful omen and they expressing their ignorance he said to the king I will now unfold to you the meaning of this mystery The pool is the emblem of this world and the tent that of your kingdom the two serpents are two dragons the red serpent is your dragon but the white serpent is the dragon of the people who occupy several provinces and districts of Britain even almost from sea to sea at length however our people shall rise and drive away the Saxon race from beyond the sea whence they originally came but do you depart from this place where you are not permitted to erect a citadel I to whom fate has allotted this mansion shall remain here whilst to you it is incumbent to seek other provinces where you may build a fortress What is your name asked the king I am called Ambrose in British Embresguletic returned the boy and in answer to the king s question What is your origin he replied A Roman consul was my father Then the king assigned him that city with all the western Provinces of Britain and departing with his wise men to the sinistral district he arrived in the region named Gueneri where he built a city which according to his name was called Cair Guorthegirn An ancient scholiast adds He then built Guasmoric near Lugubalia Carlisle a city which in English is called Palmecaster Some difference of opinion exists among antiquaries respecting the site of vortigern s castle or city Usher places it at Gwent Monmouthshire which name he ways was taken from Caer Went near Chepstow This appears to agree with Geoffrey s account See Usher s Britan Eccles cap v p twenty three According to others supposed to be the city from the ruins of which arose the castle of Gurthrenion in Radnorshire Camden s Britannia p four hundred seventy nine Whitaker however says that Cair Guorthegirn was the Maridunum of the Romans and the present Caermarthen Hist Of Manchester book ii c one See also Nennius sec forty seven forty three At length Vortimer the son of Vortigern valiantly fought against Hengist Horsa and his people drove them to the isle of Thanet and thrice enclosed them within it and beset them on the Western side The Saxons now despatched deputies to Germany to solicit large reinforcements and an additional number of ships having obtained these they fought against the kings and princes of Britain and sometimes extended their boundaries by victory and sometimes were conquered and driven back forty four Four times did Vortimer valorously encounter the enemy one the first has been mentioned the second was upon the river Darent the third at the Ford in their language called Epsford though in ours Set thirgabail two there Horsa fell and Catigern the son of Vortigern the fourth battle he fought was near the stone three on the shore of the Gallic sea where the Saxons being defeated fled to their ships one Some MSS here add This Vortimer the son of Vortigern in a synod held at Guartherniaun after the wicked king on account of the incest committed with his daughter fled from the face of Germanus and the British clergy would not consent to his father s wickedness but returning to saint Germanus and falling down at his feet he sued for pardon and in atonement for the calumny brought upon Germanus by his father and sister gave him the land in which the forementioned bishop had endured such abuse to be his for ever Whence in memory of saint Germanus it received the name Guarenniaun Guartherniaun Gurthrenion Gwarth Ennian which signifies a calumny justly retorted since when he thought to reproach the bishop he covered himself with reproach two According to Langhorne Epsford was afterwards called in the British tongue Saessenaeg habail or the slaughter of the Saxons three V R The Stone of Titulus thought to be Stone in Kent or Larger stone in Suffolk After a short interval Vortimer died before his decease anxious for the future prosperity of his country he charged his friends to inter his body at the entrance of the Saxon port viz upon the rock where the Saxons first landed for though said he they may inhabit other parts of Britain yet if you follow my commands they will never remain in this island They imprudently disobeyed this last injunction and neglected to bury him where he had appointed Rapin says he was buried at Lincoln Geoffrey at London forty five After this the barbarians became firmly incorporated and were assisted by foreign pagans for Vortigern was their friend on account of the daughter of Hengist whom he so much loved that no one durst fight against him in the meantime they soothed the imprudent king and whilst practising every appearance of fondness were plotting with his enemies And let him that reads understand that the Saxons were victorious and ruled Britain not from their superior prowess but on account of the great sins of the Britons God so permitting it For what wise man will resist the wholesome counsel of God The Almighty is the King of kings and the Lord of lords ruling and judging every one according to his own pleasure After the death of Vortimer Hengist being strengthened by new accessions collected his ships and calling his leaders together consulted by what stratagem they might overcome Vortigern and his army with insidious intention they sent messengers to the king with offers of peace and perpetual friendship unsuspicious of treachery the monarch after advising with his elders accepted the proposals V R Of his wife and no one was able manfully to drive them off because they had occupied Britain not from their own valour but by God s permission forty six Hengist under pretence of ratifying the treaty prepared an entertainment to which he invited the king the nobles and military officers in number about three hundred speciously concealing his wicked intention he ordered three hundred Saxons to conceal each a knife under his feet and to mix with the Britons and when said he they are sufficiently inebriated c cry out Nimed eure Saxes then let each draw his knife and kill his man but spare the king on account of his marriage with my daughter for it is better that he should be ransomed than killed The VV RR Of this section are too numerous to be inserted The king with his company appeared at the feast and mixing with the Saxons who whilst they spoke peace with their tongues cherished treachery in their hearts each man was placed next to his enemy After they had eaten and drunk and were much intoxicated Hengist suddenly vociferated Nimed eure Saxes and instantly his adherents drew their knives and rushing upon the Britons each slew him that sat next to him and there was slain three hundred of the nobles of Vortigern The king being a captive purchased his redemption by delivering up the three provinces of East South and Middle Sex besides other districts at the option of his betrayers forty seven saint Germanus admonished Vortigern to turn to the true God and abstain from all unlawful intercourse with his daughter but the unhappy wretch fled for refuge to the province Guorthegirnaim so called from his own name where he concealed himself with his wives but saint Germanus followed him with all the British clergy and upon a rock prayed for his sins during forty days and forty nights A district of Radnorshire forming the present hundred of Rhaiadr The Blessed man was unanimously chosen commander against the Saxons And then not by the clang of trumpets but by praying singing hallelujah and by the cries of the army to God the enemies were routed and driven even to the sea V R This paragraph is omitted in the MSS Again Vortigern ignominiously flew from saint Germanus to the kingdom of the Dimetae where on the river Towy he built a castle which he named Cair Guothergirn The saint as usual followed him there and with his clergy fasted and prayed to the Lord three days and as many nights On the third night at the third hour fire fell suddenly from heaven and totally burned the castle Vortigern the daughter of Hengist his other wives and all the inhabitants both men and women miserably perished such was the end of this unhappy king as we find written in the life of saint Germanus The Tobias of Ptolemy forty seven Others assure us that being hated by all the people of Britain for having received the Saxons and being publicly charged by saint Germanus and the clergy in the sight of God he betook himself to flight and that deserted and a wanderer he sought a place of refuge till broken hearted he made an ignominious end Some accounts state that the earth opened and swallowed him up on the night his castle was burned as no remains were discovered the following morning either of him or of those who were burned with him He had three sons the eldest was Vortimer who as we have seen fought four times against the Saxons and put them to flight the second Categirn who was slain in the same battle with Horsa the third was Pascent who reigned in the two provinces Builth and Guorthegirnaim one after the death of his father These were granted him by Ambrosius who was the great king among the kings of Britain The fourth was Faustus born of an incestuous marriage with his daughter who was brought up and educated by saint Germanus He built a large monastery on the banks of the river Renis called after his name and which remains to the present period two one In the northern part of the present counties of Radnor and Brecknock two V R The MSS add and he had one daughter who was the mother of saint Faustus forty nine This is the genealogy of Vortigern which goes back to Fernvail one who reigned in the kingdom of Guorthegirnaim two and was the son of Teudor Teudor was the son of Pascent Pascent of Guoidcant Guoidcant of Moriud Moriud of Eltat Eltat of Eldoc

greatly increased in Britain both in strength and numbers And Octa after the death of his father Hengist came from the sinistral part of the island to the kingdom of Kent and from him have proceeded all the kings of that province to the present period V R All this to the word Amen in other MSS is placed after the legend of saint Patrick Then it was that the magnanimous Arthur with all the kings and military force of Britain fought against the Saxons And though there were many more noble than himself yet he was twelve times chosen their commander and was as often conqueror The first battle in which he was engaged was at the mouth of the river Gleni one The second third fourth and fifth were on another river by the Britons called Duglas two in the region Linuis The sixth on the river Bassas three The seventh in the wood Celidon which the Britons call Cat Coit Celidon four The eighth was near Gurnion castle five where Arthur bore the image of the Holy Virgin six mother of God upon his shoulders and through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ and the holy Mary put the Saxons to flight and pursued them the whole day with great slaughter seven The ninth was at the City of Legion eight which is called Cair Lion The tenth was on the banks of the river Trat Treuroit nine The eleventh was on the mountain Breguoin which we call Cat Bregion ten The twelfth was a most severe contest when Arthur penetrated to the hill of Badon eleven In this engagement nine hundred and forty fell by his hand alone no one but the Lord affording him assistance In all these engagements the Britons were successful For no strength can avail against the will of the Almighty one Supposed by some to be the Glem in Lincolnshire but most probably the Glen in the northern part of Northumberland two Or

to be in Cornwall or Binchester in Durham but most probably the Roman station of Garionenum near Yarmouth in Norfolk six V R The image of the cross of Christ and of the perpetual virgin saint Mary seven V R For Arthur proceeded to Jerusalem and there made a cross to the size of the Saviour s cross and there it was consecrated and for three successive days he fasted watched and prayed before the Lord s cross that the Lord would give him the victory by this sign over the heathen which also took place and he took with him the image of saint Mary the fragments of which are still preserved in

Somersetshire or Edinburgh eleven Bath The more the Saxons were vanquished the more they sought for new supplies of Saxons from Germany so that kings commanders and military bands were invited over from almost every province And this practice they continued till the reign of Ida who was the son of Eoppa he of the Saxon race was the first king in Bernicia and in Cair Ebrauc York When Gratian Aequantius was consul at rome because then the whole world was governed by the Roman consuls the Saxons were received by Vortigern in the year of our Lord four hundred and forty seven and to the year in which we now write five hundred and forty seven And whosoever shall read herein may receive instruction the Lord Jesus Christ affording assistance who company eternal with the Father and the Holy Ghost lives and reigns for ever and ever Amen In those days Saint Patrick was captive among the Scots His master s name was Milcho to whom he was a swineherd for seven years When he had attained the age of seventeen he gave him his liberty By the divine impulse he applied himself to reading of the Scriptures and afterwards went to Rome where replenished with the Holy Spirit he continued a great while studying the sacred mysteries of those writings During his continuance there Palladius the first bishop was sent by pope Celestine to convert the Scots the Irish But tempests and signs from God prevented his landing for no one can arrive in any country except it be allowed from above altering therefore his course from Ireland he came to Britain and died in the land of the Picts At Fordun in the district of Mearns in Scotland Usher fifty one The death of Palladius being known the Roman patricians Theodosius and Valentinian then reigning pope Celestine sent Patrick to convert the Scots to the faith of the Holy Trinity Victor the angel of God accompanying admonishing and assisting him and also the bishop Germanus Germanus then sent the ancient Segerus with him as a venerable and praiseworthy bishop to king Amatheus one who lived near and who had prescience of what was to happen he was consecrated bishop in the reign of that king by the holy pontiff two assuming the name of Patrick having hitherto been known by that of Maun Auxilius Isserninus and other brothers were ordained with him to inferior degrees one V R Germanus sent the elder Segerus with him to a wonderful man

degree from Matheorex and the holy bishop fifty two Having distributed benedictions and perfected all in the name of the Holy Trinity he embarked on the sea which is between the Gauls and the Britons and after a quick passage arrived in Britain where he preached for some time Every necessary preparation being made and the angel giving him warning he came to the Irish Sea And having filled the ship with foreign gifts and spiritual treasures by the permission of God he arrived in Ireland where he baptized and preached fifty three From the beginning of the world to the fifth year of king Logiore when the Irish were baptized and faith in the unity of the individual Trinity was published to them are five thousand three hundred and thirty years fifty four Saint Patrick taught the gospel in foreign nations for the space of forty years Endued with apostolical powers he gave sight to the blind cleansed the lepers gave hearing to the deaf cast out devils raised nine from the dead redeemed many captives of both sexes at his own charge and set them free in the name of the Holy Trinity He taught the servants of God and he wrote three hundred and sixty five canonical and other books relating to the catholic faith He founded as many churches and consecrated the same number of bishops strengthening them with the Holy Ghost He ordained three thousand presbyters and converted and baptized twelve thousand persons in the province of Connaught And in one day baptized seven kings who were the seven sons of Amalgaid one He continued fasting forty days and nights on the summit of the mountain Eli that is Cruachan Aichle two and preferred three petitions to God for the Irish that had embraced the faith The Scots say the first was that he would receive every repenting sinner even at the latest extremity of life the second that they should never be exterminated by barbarians and the third that as Ireland three will be overflowed with water seven years before the coming of our Lord to judge the quick and the dead the crimes of the people might be washed away through his intercession and their souls purified at the last day He gave the people his benediction from the upper part of the mountain and going up higher that he might pray for them and that if it pleased God he might see the effects of his labours there appeared to him an innumerable flock of birds of many coulours signifying the number of holy persons of both sexes of the Irish nation who should come to him as their apostle at the day of judgment to be presented before the tribunal of Christ After a life spent in the active exertion of good to mankind saint Patrick in a healthy old age passed from this world to the Lord and changing this life for a better with the saints and elect of God he
