EPILOGUE two hundred twenty two THE BRASS BOTTLE CHAPTER I HORACE VENTIMORE RECEIVES A COMMISSION This day six weeks just six weeks ago Horace Ventimore said half aloud to himself and pulled out his watch Half past twelve what was I doing at half past twelve As he sat at the window of his office in Great Cloister Street Westminster he made his thoughts travel back to a certain glorious morning in August which now seemed so remote and irrecoverable At this precise time he was waiting on the balcony of the Hotel de la Plage the sole hostelry of saint Luc en Port the tiny Normandy watering place upon which by some happy inspiration he had lighted during a solitary cycling tour waiting until She should appear He could see the whole scene the tiny cove with the violet shadow of the cliff sleeping on the green water the swell of the waves lazily lapping against the diving board from which he had plunged half an hour before he remembered the long swim out to the buoy the exhilarated anticipation with which he had dressed and climbed the steep path to the hotel terrace For was he not to pass the whole remainder of that blissful day in Sylvia Futvoye s society Were they not to cycle together there were of course others of the party but they did not count to cycle over to Veulettes to picnic there under the cliff and ride back always together in the sweet scented dusk over the slopes between the poplars or the cornfields glowing golden against a sky of warm purple Now he saw himself going round to the gravelled courtyard in front of the hotel with a sudden dread of missing her There was nothing there but the little low cart with its canvas tilt which was to convey Professor Futvoye and his wife to the place of rendezvous There was Sylvia at last distractingly fair and fresh in her cool pink blouse and cream coloured skirt how gracious and friendly and generally delightful she had been throughout that unforgettable day which was supreme amongst others only a little less perfect and all now fled for ever They had had drawbacks it was true Old Futvoye was perhaps the least bit of a bore at times with his interminable disquisitions on Egyptian art and ancient Oriental character writing in which he seemed convinced that Horace must feel a perfervid interest as indeed he thought it politic to affect The Professor was a most learned archaeologist and positively bulged with information on his favourite subjects but it is just possible that Horace might have been less curious concerning the distinction between Cuneiform and Aramaean or Kufic and Arabic inscriptions if his informant had happened to be the father of anybody else However such insincerities as these are but so many evidences of sincerity So with self tormenting ingenuity Horace conjured up various pictures from that Norman holiday of his the little half timbered cottages with their faded blue shutters and the rushes growing out of their thatch roofs the spires of village churches gleaming above the bronze green beeches the bold headlands their ochre and yellow cliffs contrasting grimly with the soft ridges of the turf above them the tethered black and white cattle grazing peacefully against a background of lapis lazuli and malachite sea and in every scene the sensation of Sylvia s near presence the sound of her voice in his ears And now He looked up from the papers and tracing cloth on his desk and round the small panelled room which served him as an office at the framed plans and photographs the set squares and T squares on the walls and felt a dull resentment against his surroundings From his window he commanded a cheerful view of a tall mouldering wall once part of the Abbey boundaries surmounted by chevaux de frise above whose rust attenuated spikes some plane trees stretched their yellowing branches She would have come to care for me Horace s thoughts ran on disjointedly I could have sworn that that last day of all and her people didn t seem to object to me Her mother asked me cordially enough to call on them when they were back in town When I did When he had called there had been a difference not an unusual sequel to an acquaintanceship begun in a Continental watering place It was difficult to define but unmistakable a certain formality and constraint on missus Futvoye s part and even on Sylvia s which seemed intended to warn him that it is not every friendship that survives the Channel passage So he had gone away sore at heart but fully recognising that any advances in future must come from their side They might ask him to dinner or at least to call again but more than a month had passed and they had made no sign No it was all over he must consider himself dropped After all he told himself with a short and anything but mirthful laugh it s natural enough missus Futvoye has probably been making inquiries about my professional prospects It s better as it is What earthly chance have I got of marrying unless I can get work of my own It s all I can do to keep myself decently I ve no right to dream of asking any one to say nothing of Sylvia to marry me I should only be rushing into temptation if I saw any more of her She s not for a poor beggar like me who was born unlucky Well whining won t do any good let s have a look at Beevor s latest performance He spread out a large coloured plan in a corner of which appeared the name of William Beevor Architect and began to study it in a spirit of anything but appreciation Beevor gets on he said to himself Heaven knows that I don t grudge him his success He s a good fellow though he does build architectural atrocities and seem to like em Who am I to give myself airs He s successful I m not Yet if I only had his opportunities what wouldn t I make of them Let it be said here that this was not the ordinary self delusion of an incompetent Ventimore really had talent above the average with ideals and ambitions which might under better conditions have attained recognition and fulfilment before this But he was not quite energetic enough besides being too proud to push himself into notice and hitherto he had met with persistent ill luck So Horace had no other occupation now but to give Beevor whose offices and clerk he shared such slight assistance as he might require and it was by no means cheering to feel that every year of this enforced semi idleness left him further handicapped in the race for wealth and fame for he had already passed his twenty eighth birthday If Miss Sylvia Futvoye had indeed felt attracted towards him at one time it was not altogether incomprehensible Horace Ventimore was not a model of manly beauty models of manly beauty are rare out of novels and seldom interesting in them but his clear cut clean shaven face possessed a certain distinction and if there were faint satirical lines about the mouth they were redeemed by the expression of the grey blue eyes which were remarkably frank and pleasant He was well made and tall enough to escape all danger of being described as short fair haired and pale without being unhealthily pallid in complexion and he gave the impression of being a man who took life as it came and whose sense of humour would serve as a lining for most clouds that might darken his horizon There was a rap at the door which communicated with Beevor s office and Beevor himself a florid thick set man with small side whiskers burst in I say Ventimore you didn t run off with the plans for that house I m building at Larchmere did you Because ah I see you re looking over them Sorry to deprive you but Thanks old fellow take them by all means I ve seen all I wanted to see Well I m just off to Larchmere now Want to be there to check the quantities and there s my other house at Fittlesdon I must go on afterwards and set it out so I shall probably be away some days I m taking Harrison down too You won t be wanting him eh Ventimore laughed I can manage to do nothing without a clerk to help me Your necessity is greater than mine Here are the plans I m rather pleased with em myself you know said Beevor that roof ought to look well eh Good idea of mine lightening the slate with that ornamental tile work along the top You saw I put in one of your windows with just a trifling addition I was almost inclined to keep both gables alike as you suggested but it struck me a little variety one red brick and the other parged would be more out of the way Oh much agreed Ventimore knowing that to disagree was useless Not mind you continued Beevor that I believe in going in for too much originality in domestic architecture The average client no more wants an original house than he wants an original hat he wants something he won t feel a fool in I ve often thought old man that perhaps the reason why you haven t got on you don t mind my speaking candidly do you Not a bit said Ventimore cheerfully Candour s the cement of friendship Dab it on Well I was only going to say that you do yourself no good by all those confoundedly unconventional ideas of yours If you had your chance to morrow it s my belief you d throw it away by insisting on some fantastic fad or other These speculations are a trifle premature considering that there doesn t seem the remotest prospect of my ever getting a chance at all I got mine before I d set up six months said Beevor The great thing however he went on with a flavour of personal application is to know how to use it when it does come Well I must be off if I mean to catch that one o clock from Waterloo You ll see to anything that may come in for me while I m away won t you and let me know Oh by the way the quantity surveyor has just sent in the quantities for that schoolroom at Woodford do you mind running through them and seeing they re right And there s the specification for the new wing at Tusculum Lodge you might draft that some time when you ve nothing else to do You ll find all the papers on my desk Thanks awfully old chap And Beevor hurried back to his own room where for the next few minutes he could be heard bustling Harrison the clerk to make haste then a hansom was whistled for there were footsteps down the old stairs the sounds of a departing vehicle on the uneven stones and after that silence and solitude It was not in Nature to avoid feeling a little envious Beevor had work to do in the world even if it chiefly consisted in profaning sylvan retreats by smug or pretentious villas it was still work which entitled him to consideration and respect in the eyes of all right minded persons And nobody believed in Horace as yet he had never known the satisfaction of seeing the work of his brain realised in stone and brick and mortar no building stood anywhere to bear testimony to his existence and capability long after he himself should have passed away It was not a profitable train of thought and to escape from it he went into Beevor s room and fetched the documents he had mentioned at least they would keep him occupied until it was time to go to his club and lunch He had no sooner settled down to his calculations however when he heard a shuffling step on the landing followed by a knock at Beevor s office door More work for Beevor he thought what luck the fellow has I d better go in and explain that he s just left town on business But on entering the adjoining room he heard the knocking repeated this time at his own door and hastening back to put an end to this somewhat undignified form of hide and seek he discovered that this visitor at least was legitimately his and was in fact no other than Professor Anthony Futvoye himself The Professor was standing in the doorway peering short sightedly through his convex glasses his head protruded from his loosely fitting great coat with an irresistible suggestion of an inquiring tortoise To Horace his appearance was more welcome than that of the wealthiest client for why should Sylvia s father take the trouble to pay him this visit unless he still wished to continue the acquaintanceship It might even be that he was the bearer of some message or invitation So although to an impartial eye the Professor might not seem the kind of elderly gentleman whose society would produce any wild degree of exhilaration Horace was unfeignedly delighted to see him Extremely kind of you to come and see me like this sir he said warmly after establishing him in the solitary armchair reserved for hypothetical clients Not at all I m afraid your visit to Cottesmore Gardens some time ago was somewhat of a disappointment A disappointment echoed Horace at a loss to know what was coming next I refer to the fact which possibly however escaped your notice explained the Professor scratching his scanty patch of grizzled whisker with a touch of irascibility that I myself was not at home on that occasion Indeed I was greatly disappointed said Horace though of course I know how much you are engaged It s all the more good of you to spare time to drop in for a chat just now I ve not come to chat mister Ventimore I never chat I wanted to see you about a matter which I thought you might be so obliging as to But I observe you are busy probably too busy to attend to such a small affair It was clear enough now the Professor was going to build and had decided could it be at Sylvia s suggestion to entrust the work to him But he contrived to subdue any self betraying eagerness and reply as he could with perfect truth that he had nothing on hand just then which he could not lay aside and that if the Professor would let him know what he required he would take it up at once So much the better said the Professor so much the better Both my wife and daughter declared that it was making far too great a demand upon your good nature but as I told them I am much mistaken I said if mister Ventimore s practice is so extensive that he cannot leave it for one afternoon Evidently it was not a house Could he be needed to escort them somewhere that afternoon Even that was more than he had hoped for a few minutes since He hastened to repeat that he was perfectly free that afternoon In that case said the Professor beginning to fumble in all his pockets was he searching for a note in Sylvia s handwriting in that case you will be conferring a real favour on me if you can make it convenient to attend a sale at Hammond s Auction Rooms in Covent Garden and just bid for one or two articles on my behalf Whatever disappointment Ventimore felt it may be said to his credit that he allowed no sign of it to appear Of course I ll go with pleasure he said if I can be of any use I knew I shouldn t come to you in vain said the Professor I remembered your wonderful good nature sir in accompanying my wife and daughter on all sorts of expeditions in the blazing hot weather we had at saint Luc when you might have remained quietly at the hotel with me Not that I should trouble you now only I have to lunch at the Oriental Club and I ve an appointment afterwards to examine and report on a recently discovered inscribed cylinder for the Museum which will fully occupy the rest of the afternoon so that it s physically impossible for me to go to Hammond s myself and I strongly object to employing a broker when I can avoid it Where did I put that catalogue Ah here it is This was sent to me by the executors of my old friend General Collingham who died the other day I met him at Nakada when I was out excavating some years ago He was something of a collector in his way though he knew very little about it and of course was taken in right and left Most of his things are downright rubbish but there are just a few lots that are worth securing at a reasonable figure by some one who knew what he was about But my dear Professor remonstrated Horace not relishing this responsibility I m afraid I m as likely as not to pick up some of the rubbish I ve no special knowledge of Oriental curios At saint Luc said the Professor you impressed me as having for an amateur an exceptionally accurate and comprehensive acquaintance with Egyptian and Arabian art from the earliest period If this were so Horace could only feel with shame what a fearful humbug he must have been However I ve no wish to lay too heavy a burden on you and as you will see from this catalogue I have ticked off the lots in which I am chiefly interested and made a note of the limit to which I am prepared to bid so you ll have no difficulty Very well said Horace I ll go straight to Covent Garden and slip out and get some lunch later on Well perhaps if you don t mind The lots I have marked seem to come on at rather frequent intervals but don t let that consideration deter you from getting your lunch and if you should miss anything by not being on the spot why it s of no consequence though I don t say it mightn t be a pity In any case you won t forget to mark what each lot fetches and perhaps you wouldn t mind dropping me a line when you return the catalogue or stay could you look in some time after dinner this evening and let me know how you got on that would be better Horace thought it would be decidedly better and undertook to call and render an account of his stewardship that evening There remained the question of a deposit should one or more of the lots be knocked down to him and as he was obliged to own that he had not so much as ten pounds about him at that particular moment the Professor extracted a note for that amount from his case and handed it to him with the air of a benevolent person relieving a deserving object Don t exceed my limits he said for I can t afford more just now and mind you give Hammond your own name not mine If the dealers get to know I m after the things they ll run you up And now I don t think I need detain you any longer especially as time is running on I m sure I can trust you to do the best you can for me Till this evening then A few minutes later Horace was driving up to Covent Garden behind the best looking horse he could pick out The Professor might have required from him rather more than was strictly justified by their acquaintanceship and taken his acquiescence too much as a matter of course but what of that After all he was Sylvia s parent Even with my luck he was thinking I ought to succeed in getting at least one or two of the lots he s marked and if I can only please him something may come of it And in this sanguine mood Horace entered Messrs Hammond s well known auction rooms CHAPTER II A CHEAP LOT In spite of the fact that it was the luncheon hour when Ventimore reached Hammond s Auction Rooms he found the big skylighted gallery where the sale of the furniture and effects of the late General Collingham was proceeding crowded to a degree which showed that the deceased officer had some reputation as a connoisseur The narrow green baize tables below the auctioneer s rostrum were occupied by professional dealers one or two of them women who sat paper and pencil in hand with much the same air of apparent apathy and real vigilance that may be noticed in the Casino at Monte Carlo Around them stood a decorous and businesslike crowd mostly dealers of various types On a magisterial looking bench sat the auctioneer conducting the sale with a judicial impartiality and dignity which forbade him even in his most laudatory comments the faintest accent of enthusiasm The October sunshine striking through the glazed roof re gilded the tarnished gas stars and suffused the dusty atmosphere with palest gold But somehow the utter absence of excitement in the crowd the calm methodical tone of the auctioneer and the occasional mournful cry of Lot here gentlemen from the porter when any article was too large to move all served to depress Ventimore s usually mercurial spirits For all Horace knew the collection as a whole might be of little value but it very soon became clear that others besides Professor Futvoye had singled out such gems as there were also that the Professor had considerably under rated the prices they were likely to fetch Ventimore made his bids with all possible discretion but time after time he found the competition for some perforated mosque lantern engraved ewer or ancient porcelain tile so great that his limit was soon reached and his sole consolation was that the article eventually changed hands for sums which were very nearly double the Professor s estimate Several dealers and brokers despairing of a bargain that day left murmuring profanities most of those who remained ceased to take a serious interest in the proceedings and consoled themselves with cheap witticisms at every favourable occasion The sale dragged slowly on and what with continual disappointment and want of food Horace began to feel so weary that he was glad as the crowd thinned to get a seat at one of the green baize tables by which time the skylights had already changed from livid grey to slate colour in the deepening dusk A couple of meek Burmese Buddhas had just been put up and bore the indignity of being knocked down for nine and sixpence the pair with dreamy inscrutable simpers Horace only waited for the final lot marked by the Professor an old Persian copper bowl inlaid with silver and engraved round the rim with an inscription from Hafiz The limit to which he was authorised to go was two pounds ten but so desperately anxious was Ventimore not to return empty handed that he had made up his mind to bid an extra sovereign if necessary and say nothing about it However the bowl was put up and the bidding soon rose to three pounds ten four pounds four pounds ten five pounds five guineas for which last sum it was acquired by a bearded man on Horace s right who immediately began to regard his purchase with a more indulgent eye Ventimore had done his best and failed there was no reason now why he should stay a moment longer and yet he sat on from sheer fatigue and disinclination to move Now we come to Lot two hundred fifty four gentlemen he heard the auctioneer saying mechanically a capital Egyptian mummy case in fine con No I beg pardon I m wrong This is an article which by some mistake has been omitted from the catalogue though it ought to have been in it Everything on sale to day gentlemen belonged to the late General Collingham We ll call this No two hundred fifty three a Antique brass bottle Very curious One of the porters carried the bottle in between the tables and set it down before the dealers at the farther end with a tired nonchalance It was an old squat pot bellied vessel about two feet high with a long thick neck the mouth of which was closed by a sort of metal stopper or cap there was no visible decoration on its sides which were rough and pitted by some incrustation that had formed on them and been partially scraped off As a piece of bric a brac it certainly possessed few attractions and there was a marked tendency to guy it among the more frivolous brethren What do you call this sir inquired one of the auctioneer with the manner of a cheeky boy trying to get a rise out of his form master Is it as unique as the others You re as well able to judge as I am was the guarded reply Any one can see for himself it s not modern rubbish Make a pretty little ornament for the mantelpiece remarked a wag Is the top made to unscrew or what sir asked a third Seems fixed on pretty tight I can t say Probably it has not been removed for some time It s a goodish weight said the chief humorist after handling it What s inside of it sir sardines I don t represent it as having anything inside it said the auctioneer If you want to know my opinion I think there s money in it Ow much Don t misunderstand me gentlemen When I say I consider there s money in it I m not alluding to its contents I ve no reason to believe that it contains anything I m merely suggesting the thing itself may be worth more than it looks Ah it might be that without urting itself Well well don t let us waste time Look upon it as a pure speculation and make me an offer for it some of you Come Tuppence ap ny cried the comic man affecting to brace himself for a mighty effort Pray be serious gentlemen We want to get on you know Anything to make a start Five shillings It s not the value of the metal but I ll take the bid Six Look at it well It s not an article you come across every day of your lives The bottle was still being passed round with disrespectful raps and slaps and it had now come to Ventimore s right hand neighbour who scrutinised it carefully but made no bid That s all right you know he whispered in Horace s ear That s good stuff that is If I was you I d ave that Seven shillings eight nine bid for it over there in the corner said the auctioneer If you think it s so good why don t you have it yourself Horace asked his neighbour Me Oh well it ain t exactly in my line and getting this last lot pretty near cleaned me out I ve done for to day I ave All the same it is a curiosity dunno as I ve seen a brass vawse just that shape before and it s genuine old though all these fellers are too ignorant to know the value of it So I don t mind giving you the tip Horace rose the better to examine the top As far as he could make out in the flickering light of one of the gas stars which the auctioneer had just ordered to be lit there were half erased scratches and triangular marks on the cap that might possibly be an inscription If so might there not be the means here of regaining the Professor s favour which he felt that as it was he should probably forfeit justly or not by his ill success He could hardly spend the Professor s money on it since it was not in the catalogue and he had no authority to bid for it but he had a few shillings of his own to spare Why not bid for it on his own account as long as he could afford to do so If he were outbid as usual it would not particularly matter Thirteen shillings the auctioneer was saying in his dispassionate tones Horace caught his eye and slightly raised his catalogue while another man nodded at the same time Fourteen in two places Horace raised his catalogue again I won t go beyond fifteen he thought Fifteen It s against you sir Any advance on fifteen Sixteen this very quaint old Oriental bottle going for only sixteen shillings After all thought Horace I don t mind anything under a pound for it And he bid seventeen shillings Eighteen cried his rival a short cheery cherub faced little dealer whose neighbours adjured him to sit quiet like a good little boy and not waste his pocket money Nineteen said Horace Pound answered the cherubic man A pound only bid for this grand brass vessel said the auctioneer indifferently All done at a pound Horace thought another shilling or two would not ruin him and nodded A guinea For the last time You ll lose it sir said the auctioneer to the little man Go on Tommy Don t you be beat Spring another bob on it Tommy his friends advised him ironically but Tommy shook his head with the air of a man who knows when to draw the line One guinea and that s not half its value Gentleman on my left said the auctioneer more in sorrow than in anger and the brass bottle became Ventimore s property He paid for it and since he could hardly walk home nursing a large metal bottle without attracting an inconvenient amount of attention directed that it should be sent to his lodgings at Vincent Square But when he was out in the fresh air walking westward to his club he found himself wondering more and more what could have possessed him to throw away a guinea when he had few enough for legitimate expenses on an article of such exceedingly problematical value CHAPTER III AN UNEXPECTED OPENING Ventimore made his way to Cottesmore Gardens that evening in a highly inconsistent not to say chaotic state of mind The thought that he would presently see Sylvia again made his blood course quicker while he was fully determined to say no more to her than civility demanded At one moment he was blessing Professor Futvoye for his happy thought in making use of him at another he was bitterly recognising that it would have been better for his peace of mind if he had been left alone Sylvia and her mother had no desire to see more of him if they had they would have asked him to come before this No doubt they would tolerate him now for the Professor s sake but who would not rather be ignored than tolerated The more often he saw Sylvia the more she would make his heart ache with vain longing whereas he was getting almost reconciled to her indifference he would very soon be cured if he didn t see her Why should he see her He need not go in at all He had merely to leave the catalogue with his compliments and the Professor would learn all he wanted to know On second thoughts he must go in if only to return the bank note But he would ask to see the Professor in private Most probably he would not be invited to join his wife and daughter but if he were he could make some excuse They might think it a little odd a little discourteous perhaps but they would be too relieved to care much about that When he got to Cottesmore Gardens and was actually at the door of the Futvoyes house one of the neatest and demurest in that retired and irreproachable quarter he began to feel a craven hope that the Professor might be out in which case he need only leave the catalogue and write a letter when he got home reporting his non success at the sale and returning the note And as it happened the Professor was out and Horace was not so glad as he thought he should be The maid told him that the ladies were in the drawing room and seemed to take it for granted that he was coming in so he had himself announced He would not stay long just long enough to explain his business there and make it clear that he had no wish to force his acquaintance upon them He found missus Futvoye in the farther part of the pretty double drawing room writing letters and Sylvia more dazzlingly fair than ever in some sort of gauzy black frock with a heliotrope sash and a bunch of Parma violets on her breast was comfortably established with a book in the front room and seemed surprised if not resentful at having to disturb herself I must apologise he began with an involuntary stiffness for calling at this very unceremonious time but the fact is the Professor I know all about it interrupted missus Futvoye brusquely while her shrewd light grey eyes took him in with a cool stare that was humorously observant without being aggressive We heard how shamefully my husband abused your good nature Really it was too bad of him to ask a busy man like you to put aside his work and go and spend a whole day at that stupid auction Oh I d nothing particular to do I can t call myself a busy man unfortunately said Horace with that frankness which scorns to conceal what other people know perfectly well already Ah well it s very nice of you to make light of it but he ought not to have done it after so short an acquaintance too And to make it worse he has had to go out unexpectedly this evening but he ll be back before very long if you don t mind waiting There s really no need to wait said Horace because this catalogue will tell him everything and as the particular things he wanted went for much more than he thought I wasn t able to get any of them I m sure I m very glad of it said missus Futvoye for his study is crammed with odds and ends as it is and I don t want the whole house to look like a museum or an antiquity shop I d all the trouble in the world to persuade him that a great gaudy gilded mummy case was not quite the thing for a drawing room But please sit down mister Ventimore Thanks stammered Horace but but I mustn t stay If you will tell the Professor how sorry I was to miss him and and give him back this note which he left with me to cover any deposit I I won t interrupt you any longer He was as a rule imperturbable in most social emergencies but just now he was seized with a wild desire to escape which to his infinite mortification made him behave like a shy schoolboy Nonsense said missus Futvoye I am sure my husband would be most annoyed if we didn t keep you till he came I really ought to go he declared wistfully enough We mustn t tease mister Ventimore to stay mother when he so evidently wants to go said Sylvia cruelly Well I won t detain you at least not long I wonder if you would mind posting a letter for me as you pass the pillar box I ve almost finished it and it ought to go to night and my maid Jessie has such a bad cold I really don t like sending her out with it It would have been impossible to refuse to stay after that even if he had wished It would only be for a few minutes Sylvia might spare him that much of her time He should not trouble her again So missus Futvoye went back to her bureau and Sylvia and he were practically alone She had taken a seat not far from his and made a few constrained remarks obviously out of sheer civility He returned mechanical replies with a dreary wonder whether this could really be the girl who had talked to him with such charming friendliness and confidence only a few weeks ago in Normandy And the worst of it was she was looking more bewitching than ever her slim arms gleaming through the black lace of her sleeves and the gold threads in her soft masses of chestnut hair sparkling in the light of the shaded lamp behind her The slight contraction of her eyebrows and the mutinous downward curve of her mouth seemed expressive of boredom What a dreadfully long time mamma is over that letter she said at last I think I d better go and hurry her up Please don t unless you are particularly anxious to get rid of me I thought you seemed particularly anxious to escape she said coldly And as a family we have certainly taken up quite enough of your time for one day That is not the way you used to talk at saint Luc he said At saint Luc Perhaps not But in London everything is so different you see Very different When one meets people abroad who who seem at all inclined to be sociable she continued one is so apt to think them pleasanter than they really are Then one meets them again and and wonders what one ever saw to like in them And it s no use pretending one feels the same because they generally understand sooner or later Don t you find that I do indeed he said wincing though I don t know what I ve done to deserve that you should tell me so Oh I was not blaming you You have been most angelic I can t think how papa could have expected you to take all that trouble for him still you did though you must have simply hated it But good heavens don t you know I should be only too delighted to be of the least service to him or to any of you You looked anything but delighted when you came in just now you looked as if your one idea was to get it over as soon as you could You know perfectly well you re longing now for mother to finish her letter and set you free Do you really think I can t see that If all that is true or partly true said Horace can t you guess why I guessed how it was when you called here first that afternoon Mamma had asked you to and you thought you might as well be civil perhaps you really did think it would be pleasant to see us again but it wasn t the same thing Oh I saw it in your face directly you became conventional and distant and horrid and it made me horrid too and you went away determined that you wouldn t see any more of us than you could help That s why I was so furious when I heard that papa had been to see you and with such an object All this was so near the truth and yet missed it with such perverse ingenuity that Horace felt bound to put himself right Perhaps I ought to leave things as they are he said but I can t It s no earthly use I know but may I tell you why it really was painful to me to meet you again I thought you were changed that you wished to forget and wished me to forget only I can t that we had been friends for a short time And though I never blamed you it was natural enough it hit me pretty hard so hard that I didn t feel anxious to repeat the experience Did it hit you hard said Sylvia softly Perhaps I minded too just a very little However she added with a sudden smile that made two enchanting dimples in her cheeks it only shows how much more sensible it is to have things out Now perhaps you won t persist in keeping away from us I believe said Horace gloomily still determined not to let any direct avowal pass his lips it would be best that I should keep away Her half closed eyes shone through their long lashes the violets on her breast rose and fell I don t think I understand she said in a tone that was both hurt and offended There is a pleasure in yielding to some temptations that more than compensates for the pain of any previous resistance Come what might he was not going to be misunderstood any longer If I must tell you he said I ve fallen desperately hopelessly in love with you Now you know the reason It doesn t seem a very good reason for wanting to go away and never see me again Does it Not when I ve no right to speak to you of love But you ve done that I know he said penitently I couldn t help it But I never meant to It slipped out I quite understand how hopeless it is Of course if you are so sure as all that you are quite right not to try Sylvia You can t mean that that you do care after all Didn t you really see she said with a low happy laugh How stupid of you And how dear He caught her hand which she allowed to rest contentedly in his Oh Sylvia Then you do you do But my God what a selfish brute I am For we can t marry It may be years before I can ask you to come to me You father and mother wouldn t hear of your being engaged to me Need they hear of it just yet Horace Yes they must I should feel a cur if I didn t tell your mother at all events Then you shan t feel a cur for we ll go and tell her together And Sylvia rose and went into the farther room and put her arms round her mother s neck Mother darling she said in a half whisper it s really all your fault for writing such very long letters but but we don t exactly know how we came to do it but Horace and I have got engaged somehow You aren t very angry are you I think you re both extremely foolish said missus Futvoye as she extricated herself from Sylvia s arms and turned to face Horace From all I hear mister Ventimore you re not in a position to marry at present Unfortunately no said Horace I m making nothing as yet But my chance must come some day I don t ask you to give me Sylvia till then And you know you like Horace mother pleaded Sylvia And I m ready to wait for him any time Nothing will induce me to give him up and I shall never never care for anybody else So you see you may just as well give us your consent I m afraid I ve been to blame said missus Futvoye I ought to have foreseen this at saint Luc Sylvia is our only child mister Ventimore and I would far rather see her happily married than making what is called a grand match Still this really does seem rather hopeless I am quite sure her father would never approve of it Indeed it must not be mentioned to him he would only be irritated So long as you are not against us said Horace you won t forbid me to see her I believe I ought to said missus Futvoye but I don t object to your coming here occasionally as an ordinary visitor Only understand this until you can prove to my husband s satisfaction that you are able to support Sylvia in the manner she has been accustomed to there must be no formal engagement I think I am entitled to ask that of you She was so clearly within her rights and so much more indulgent than Horace had expected for he had always considered her an unsentimental and rather worldly woman that he accepted her conditions almost gratefully After all it was enough for him that Sylvia returned his love and that he should be allowed to see her from time to time It s rather a pity said Sylvia meditatively a little later when her mother had gone back to her letter writing and she and Horace were discussing the future it s rather a pity that you didn t manage to get something at that sale It might have helped you with papa Well I did get something on my own account he said though I don t know whether it is likely to do me any good with your father And he told her how he had come to acquire the brass bottle And you actually gave a guinea for it said Sylvia when you could probably get exactly the same thing only better at Liberty s for about seven and sixpence Nothing of that sort has any charms for papa unless it s dirty and dingy and centuries old This looks all that I only bought it because though it wasn t down on the catalogue I had a fancy that it might interest the Professor Oh cried Sylvia clasping her pretty hands if only it does Horace If it turns out to be tremendously rare and valuable I do believe dad would be so delighted that he d consent to anything Ah that s his step outside he s letting himself in Now mind you don t forget to tell him about that bottle The Professor did not seem in the sweetest of humours as he entered the drawing room Sorry I was obliged to be from home and there was nobody but my wife and daughter here to entertain you But I am glad you stayed yes I m rather glad you stayed So am I sir said Horace and proceeded to give his account of the sale which did not serve to improve the Professor s temper He thrust out his under lip at certain items in the catalogue I wish I d gone myself he said that bowl a really fine example of sixteenth century Persian work going for only five guineas I d willingly have given ten for it There there I thought I could have depended on you to use your judgment better than that If you remember sir you strictly limited me to the sums you marked Nothing of the sort said the Professor testily my marginal notes were merely intended as indications no more You might have known that if you had secured one of the things at any price I should have approved Horace had no grounds for knowing anything of the kind and much reason for believing the contrary but he saw no use in arguing the matter further and merely said he was sorry to have misunderstood No doubt the fault was mine said the Professor in a tone that implied the opposite Still making every allowance for inexperience in these matters I should have thought it impossible for any one to spend a whole day bidding at a place like Hammond s without even securing a single article But dad put in Sylvia mister Ventimore did get one thing on his own account It s a brass bottle not down in the catalogue but he thinks it may be worth something perhaps And he d very much like to have your opinion Tchah said the Professor Some modern bazaar work most probably He d better have kept his money What was this bottle of yours like now eh Horace described it H m Seems to be what the Arabs call a kum kum probably used as a sprinkler or to hold rose water Hundreds of em about commented the Professor crustily It had a lid riveted or soldered on said Horace the general shape was something like this And he made a rapid sketch from memory which the Professor took reluctantly and then adjusted his glasses with some increase of interest Ha the form is antique certainly And the top hermetically fastened eh That looks as if it might contain something You don t think it has a genie inside like the sealed jar the fisherman found in the Arabian Nights cried Sylvia What fun if it had By genie I presume you mean a Jinnee which is the more correct and scholarly term said the Professor Female Jinneeyeh and plural Jinn No I do not contemplate that as a probable contingency But it is not quite impossible that a vessel closed as mister Ventimore describes may have been designed as a receptacle for papyri or other records of archaeological interest which may be still in preservation I should recommend you sir to use the greatest precaution in removing the lid don t expose the documents if any too suddenly to the outer air and it would be better if you did not handle them yourself I shall be rather curious to hear whether it really does contain anything and if so what I will open it as carefully as possible said Horace and whatever it may contain you may rely upon my letting you know at once He left shortly afterwards encouraged by the radiant trust in Sylvia s eyes and thrilled by the secret pressure of her hand at parting He had been amply repaid for all the hours he had spent in the close sale room His luck had turned at last he was going to succeed he felt it in the air as if he were already fanned by Fortune s pinions Still thinking of Sylvia he let himself into the semi detached old fashioned house on the north side of Vincent Square where he had lodged for some years It was nearly twelve o clock and his landlady missus Rapkin and her husband had already gone to bed Ventimore went up to his sitting room a comfortable apartment with two long windows opening on to a trellised verandah and balcony a room which as he had furnished and decorated it himself to suit his own tastes had none of the depressing ugliness of typical lodgings It was quite dark for the season was too mild for a fire and he had to grope for the matches before he could light his lamp After he had done so and turned up the wicks the first object he saw was the bulbous long necked jar which he had bought that afternoon and which now stood on the stained boards near the mantelpiece It had been delivered with unusual promptitude Somehow he felt a sort of repulsion at the sight of it It s a beastlier looking object than I thought he said to himself disgustedly A chimney pot would be about as decorative and appropriate in my room What a thundering ass I was to waste a guinea on it I wonder if there really is anything inside it It is so infernally ugly that it ought to be useful The Professor seemed to fancy it might hold documents and he ought to know Anyway I ll find out before I turn in He grasped it by its long thick neck and tried to twist the cap off but it remained firm which was not surprising seeing that it was thickly coated with a lava like crust I must get some of that off first and then try again he decided and after foraging downstairs he returned with a hammer and chisel with which he chipped away the crust till the line of the cap was revealed and an uncouth metal knob that seemed to be a catch This he tapped sharply for some time and again attempted to wrench off the lid Then he gripped the vessel between his knees and put forth all his strength while the bottle seemed to rock and heave under him in sympathy The cap was beginning to give way very slightly one last wrench and it came off in his hand with such suddenness that he was flung violently backwards and hit the back of his head smartly against an angle of the wainscot He had a vague impression of the bottle lying on its side with dense volumes of hissing black smoke pouring out of its mouth and towering up in a gigantic column to the ceiling he was conscious too of a pungent and peculiarly overpowering perfume I ve got hold of some sort of infernal machine he thought and I shall be all over the square in less than a second And just as he arrived at this cheerful conclusion he lost consciousness altogether He could not have been unconscious for more than a few seconds for when he opened his eyes the room was still thick with smoke through which he dimly discerned the figure of a stranger who seemed of abnormal and almost colossal height But this must have been an optical illusion caused by the magnifying effects of the smoke for as it cleared his visitor proved to be of no more than ordinary stature He was elderly and indeed venerable of appearance and wore an Eastern robe and head dress of a dark green hue He stood there with uplifted hands uttering something in a loud tone and a language unknown to Horace Ventimore being still somewhat dazed felt no surprise at seeing him missus Rapkin must have let her second floor at last to some Oriental He would have preferred an Englishman as a fellow lodger but this foreigner must have noticed the smoke and rushed in to offer assistance which was both neighbourly and plucky of him Awfully good of you to come in sir he said as he scrambled to his feet I don t know what s happened exactly but there s no harm done I m only a trifle shaken that s all By the way I suppose you can speak English Assuredly I can speak so as to be understood by all whom I address answered the stranger Dost thou not understand my speech Perfectly now said Horace But you made a remark just now which I didn t follow would you mind repeating it I said Repentance O Prophet of God I will not return to the like conduct ever Ah said Horace I dare say you were rather startled So was I when I opened that bottle Tell me was it indeed thy hand that removed the seal O young man of kindness and good works I certainly did open it said Ventimore though I don t know where the kindness comes in for I ve no notion what was inside the thing I was inside it said the stranger calmly CHAPTER IV AT LARGE So you were inside that bottle were you said Horace blandly How singular He began to realise that he had to deal with an Oriental lunatic and must humour him to some extent Fortunately he did not seem at all dangerous though undeniably eccentric looking His hair fell in disorderly profusion from under his high turban about his cheeks which were of a uniform pale rhubarb tint his grey beard streamed out in three thin strands and his long narrow eyes opal in hue and set rather wide apart and at a slight angle had a curious expression part slyness and part childlike simplicity Dost thou doubt that I speak truth I tell thee that I have been confined in that accursed vessel for countless centuries how long I know not for it is beyond calculation I should hardly have thought from your appearance sir that you had been so many years in bottle as all that said Horace politely but it s certainly time you had a change May I if it isn t indiscreet ask how you came into such a very uncomfortable position But probably you have forgotten by this time Forgotten said the other with a sombre red glow in his opal eyes Wisely was it written Let him that desireth oblivion confer benefits but the memory of an injury endureth for ever I forget neither benefits nor injuries An old gentleman with a grievance thought Ventimore And mad into the bargain Nice person to have staying in the same house with one Know O best of mankind continued the stranger that he who now addresses thee is Fakrash el Aamash one of the Green Jinn And I dwelt in the Palace of the Mountain of the Clouds above the City of Babel in the Garden of Irem which thou doubtless knowest by repute I fancy I have heard of it said Horace as if it were an address in the Court Directory Delightful neighbourhood I had a kinswoman Bedeea el Jemal who possessed incomparable beauty and manifold accomplishments And seeing that though a Jinneeyeh she was of the believing Jinn I despatched messengers to Suleyman the Great the son of Daood offering him her hand in marriage But a certain Jarjarees the son of Rejmoos the son of Iblees may he be for ever accursed looked with favour upon the maiden and going secretly unto Suleyman persuaded him that I was preparing a crafty snare for the King s undoing And of course you never thought of such a thing said Ventimore By a venomous tongue the fairest motives may be rendered foul was the somewhat evasive reply Thus it came to pass that Suleyman on whom be peace listened unto the voice of Jarjarees and refused to receive the maiden Moreover he commanded that I should be seized and imprisoned in a bottle of brass and cast into the Sea of El Karkar there to abide the Day of Doom Too bad really too bad murmured Horace in a tone that he could only hope was sufficiently sympathetic But now by thy means O thou of noble ancestors and gentle disposition my deliverance hath been accomplished and if I were to serve thee for a thousand years regarding nothing else even thus could I not requite thee and my so doing would be a small thing according to thy desserts Pray don t mention it said Horace only too pleased if I ve been of any use to you In the sky it is written upon the pages of the air He who doth kind actions shall experience the like Am I not an Efreet of the Jinn Demand therefore and thou shalt receive Poor old chap thought Horace he s very cracked indeed He ll be wanting to give me a present of some sort soon and of course I can t have that My dear mister Fakrash he said aloud I ve done nothing nothing at all and if I had I couldn t possibly accept any reward for it What are thy names and what calling dost thou follow I ought to have introduced myself before let me give you my card and Ventimore gave him one which the other took and placed in his girdle That s my business address I m an architect if you know what that is a man who builds houses and churches mosques you know in fact anything when he can get it to build A useful calling indeed and one to be rewarded with fine gold In my case Horace confessed the reward has been too fine to be perceived In other words I ve never been rewarded because I ve never yet had the luck to get a client And what is this client of whom thou speakest Oh well some well to do merchant who wants a house built for him and doesn t care how much he spends on it There must be lots of them about but they never seem to come in my direction Grant me a period of delay and if it be possible I will procure thee such a client Horace could not help thinking that any recommendation from such a quarter would hardly carry much weight but as the poor old man evidently imagined himself under an obligation which he was anxious to discharge it would have been unkind to throw cold water on his good intentions My dear sir he said lightly if you should come across that particular type of client and can contrive to impress him with the belief that I m just the architect he s looking out for which between ourselves I am though nobody s discovered it yet if you can get him to come to me you will do me the very greatest service I could ever hope for But don t give yourself any trouble over it It will be one of the easiest things that can be said his visitor that is and here a shade of rather pathetic doubt crossed his face provided that anything of my former power yet remains unto me Well never mind sir said Horace if you can t I shall take the will for the deed First of all it will be prudent to learn where Suleyman is that I may humble myself before him and make my peace Yes said Horace gently I would I should make a point of that sir Not now you know He might be in bed To morrow morning This is a strange place that I am in and I know not yet in what direction I should seek him But till I have found him and justified myself in his sight and had my revenge upon Jarjarees mine enemy I shall know no rest Well but go to bed now like a sensible old chap said Horace soothingly anxious to prevent this poor demented Asiatic from falling into the hands of the police Plenty of time to go and call on Suleyman to morrow I will search for him even unto the uttermost ends of the earth That s right you re sure to find him in one of them Only don t you see it s no use starting to night the last trains have gone long ago As he spoke the night wind bore across the square the sound of Big Ben striking the quarters in Westminster Clock Tower and then after a pause the solemn boom that announced the first of the small hours To morrow thought Ventimore I ll speak to missus Rapkin and get her to send for a doctor and have him put under proper care the poor old boy really isn t fit to go about alone I will start now at once insisted the stranger for there is no time to be lost Oh come said Horace after so many thousand years a few hours more or less won t make any serious difference And you can t go out now they ve shut up the house Do let me take you upstairs to your room sir Not so for I must leave thee for a season O young man of kind conduct But may thy days be fortunate and the gate never cease to be repaired and the nose of him that envieth thee be rubbed in the dust for love for thee hath entered into my heart and if it be permitted unto me I will cover thee with the veils of my protection As he finished this harangue the speaker seemed to Ventimore s speechless amazement to slip through the wall behind him At all events he had left the room somehow and Horace found himself alone He rubbed the back of his head which began to be painful He can t really have vanished through the wall he said to himself That s too absurd The fact is I m over excited this evening and no wonder after all that s happened The best thing I can do is to go to bed at once Which he accordingly proceeded to do CHAPTER V CARTE BLANCHE When Ventimore woke next morning his headache had gone and with it the recollection of everything but the wondrous and delightful fact that Sylvia loved him and had promised to be his some day Her mother too was on his side why should he despair of anything after that There was the Professor to be sure but even he might be brought to consent to an engagement especially if it turned out that the brass bottle and here Horace began to recall an extraordinary dream in connection with that extremely speculative purchase of his He had dreamed that he had forced the bottle open and that it proved to contain not manuscripts but an elderly Jinnee who alleged that he had been imprisoned there by the order of King Solomon What he wondered could have put so grotesque a fancy into his head and then he smiled as he traced it to Sylvia s playful suggestion that the bottle might contain a genie as did the famous jar in the Arabian Nights and to her father s pedantic correction of the word to Jinnee Upon that slight foundation his sleeping brain had built up all that elaborate fabric a scene so vivid and a story so circumstantial and plausible that in spite of its extravagance he could hardly even now persuade himself that it was entirely imaginary The psychology of dreams is a subject which has a fascinating mystery even for the least serious student As he entered the sitting room where his breakfast awaited him he looked round half expecting to find the bottle lying with its lid off in the corner as he had last seen it in his dream Of course it was not there and he felt an odd relief The auction room people had not delivered it yet and so much the better for he had still to ascertain if it had anything inside it and who knew that it might not contain something more to his advantage than a maundering old Jinnee with a grievance several thousands of years old Breakfast over he rang for his landlady who presently appeared missus Rapkin was a superior type of her much abused class She was scrupulously clean and neat in her person her sandy hair was so smooth and tightly knotted that it gave her head the colour and shape of a Barcelona nut she had sharp beady eyes nostrils that seemed to smell battle afar off a wide thin mouth that apparently closed with a snap and a dry whity brown complexion suggestive of bran But if somewhat grim of aspect she was a good soul and devoted to Horace in whom she took almost a maternal interest while regretting that he was not what she called serious minded enough to get on in the world Rapkin had wooed and married her when they were both in service and he still took occasional jobs as an outdoor butler though Horace suspected that his more staple form of industry was the consumption of gin and water and remarkably full flavoured cigars in the basement parlour Shall you be dining in this evening sir inquired missus Rapkin I don t know Don t get anything in for me I shall most probably dine at the club said Horace and missus Rapkin who had a confirmed belief that all clubs were hotbeds of vice and extravagance sniffed disapproval By the way he added if a kind of brass pot is sent here it s all right I bought it at a sale yesterday Be careful how you handle it it s rather old There was a vawse come late last night sir I don t know if it s that it s old fashioned enough Then will you bring it up at once please I want to see it missus Rapkin retired to reappear presently with the brass bottle I thought you d have noticed it when you come in last night sir she explained for I stood it in the corner and when I see it this morning it was layin o one side and looking that dirty and disrespectable I took it down to give it a good clean which it wanted it It certainly looked rather the better for it and the marks or scratches on the cap were more distinguishable but Horace was somewhat disconcerted to find that part of his dream was true the bottle had been there I hope I ve done nothing wrong said missus Rapkin observing his expression I only used a little warm ale to it which is a capital thing for brass work and gave it a scrub with Vitrolia soap but it would take more than that to get all the muck off of it It is all right so long as you didn t try to get the top off said Horace Why the top was off it sir I thought you d done it with the ammer and chisel when you got ome said his landlady staring I found them ere on the carpet Horace started Then that part was true too Oh ah he said I believe I did I d forgotten That reminds me Haven t you let the room above to to an Oriental gentleman a native you know wears a green turban That I most certainly ave not mister Ventimore said missus Rapkin with emphasis nor wouldn t Not if his turbin was all the colours of the rainbow for I don t old with such Why there was Rapkin s own sister in law let her parlour floor to a Horiental a Parsee he was or one o them Hafrican tribes and reason she ad to repent of it for all his gold spectacles Whatever made you fancy I should let to a blackamoor Oh I thought I saw somebody about er answering that description and I wondered if Never in this ouse sir missus Steggars next door but one might let to such for all I can say to the contrary not being what you might call particular and her rooms more suitable to savage notions but I ve enough on my hands mister Ventimore attending to you not keeping a girl to do the waiting as why should I while I m well able to do it better myself As soon as she relieved him of her presence he examined the bottle there was nothing whatever inside it which disposed of all the hopes he had entertained from that quarter It was not difficult to account for the visionary Oriental as an hallucination probably inspired by the heavy fumes for he now believed in the fumes which had doubtless resulted from the rapid decomposition of some long buried spices or similar substances suddenly exposed to the air If any further explanation were needed the accidental blow to the back of his head together with the latent suggestion from the Arabian Nights would amply provide it So having settled these points to his entire satisfaction he went to his office in Great Cloister Street which he now had entirely to himself and was soon engaged in drafting the specification for Beevor on which he had been working when so fortunately interrupted the day before by the Professor The work was more or less mechanical and could bring him no credit and little thanks but Horace had the happy faculty of doing thoroughly whatever he undertook and as he sat there by his wide open window he soon became entirely oblivious of all but the task before him So much so that even when the light became obscured for a moment as if by some large and opaque body in passing he did not look up immediately and when he did was surprised to find the only armchair occupied by a portly person who seemed to be trying to recover his breath I beg your pardon said Ventimore I never heard you come in His visitor could only wave his head in courteous deprecation under which there seemed a suspicion of bewildered embarrassment He was a rosy gilled spotlessly clean elderly gentleman with white whiskers his eyes just then slightly protuberant were shrewd but genial he had a wide jolly mouth and a double chin He was dressed like a man who is above disguising his prosperity he wore a large pear shaped pearl in his crimson scarf and had probably only lately discarded his summer white hat and white waistcoat My dear sir he began in a rich throaty voice as soon as he could speak my dear sir you must think this is a most unceremonious way of ah dropping in on you of invading your privacy Not at all said Horace wondering whether he could possibly intend him to understand that he had come in by the window I m afraid there was no one to show you in my clerk is away just now No matter sir no matter I found my way up as you perceive The important I may say the essential fact is that I am here Quite so said Horace and may I ask what brought you What brought The stranger s eyes grew fish like for the moment Allow me I I shall come to that in good time I am still a little as you can see He glanced round the room You are I think an architect mister ah mister um Ventimore is my name said Horace and I am an architect Ventimore to be sure he put his hand in his pocket and produced a card Yes it s all quite correct I see I have the name here And an architect mister Ventimore so I I am given to understand of immense ability I m afraid I can t claim to be that said Horace but I may call myself fairly competent Competent Why of course you re competent Do you suppose sir that I a practical business man should come to any one who was not competent he said with exactly the air of a man trying to convince himself against his own judgment that he was acting with the utmost prudence Am I to understand that some one has been good enough to recommend me to you inquired Horace Certainly not sir certainly not I need no recommendation but my own judgment I ah have a tolerable acquaintance with all that is going on in the art world and I have come to the conclusion mister eh ah Ventimore I repeat the deliberate and unassisted conclusion that you are the one man living who can do what I want Delighted to hear it said Horace genuinely gratified When did you see any of my designs Never mind sir I don t decide without very good grounds It doesn t take me long to make up my mind and when my mind is made up I act sir I act And to come to the point I have a small commission unworthy I am quite aware of your ah distinguished talent which I should like to put in your hands Is he going to ask me to attend a sale for him thought Horace I m hanged if I do I m rather busy at present he said dubiously as you may see I m not sure whether I ll put the matter in a nutshell sir in a nutshell My name is Wackerbath Samuel Wackerbath tolerably well known if I may say so in City circles Horace of course concealed the fact that his visitor s name and fame were unfamiliar to him I ve lately bought a few acres on the Hampshire border near the house I m living in just now and I ve been thinking as I was saying to a friend only just now as we were crossing Westminster Bridge I ve been thinking of building myself a little place there just a humble unpretentious home where I could run down for the weekend and entertain a friend or two in a quiet way and perhaps live some part of the year Hitherto I ve rented places as I wanted em old family seats and ancestral mansions and so forth very nice in their way but I want to feel under a roof of my own I want to surround myself with the simple comforts the ah unassuming elegance of an English country home And you re the man I feel more convinced of it with every word you say you re the man to do the job in style ah to execute the work as it should be done Here was the long wished for client at last And it was satisfactory to feel that he had arrived in the most ordinary and commonplace course for no one could look at mister Samuel Wackerbath and believe for a moment that he was capable of floating through an upper window he was not in the least that kind of person I shall be happy to do my best said Horace with a calmness that surprised himself Could you give me some idea of the amount you are prepared to spend Well I m no Croesus though I won t say I m a pauper precisely and as I remarked before I prefer comfort to splendour I don t think I should be justified in going beyond well say sixty thousand Sixty thousand exclaimed Horace who had expected about a tenth of that sum Oh not more than sixty thousand I see I mean on the house itself explained mister Wackerbath there will be outbuildings lodges cottages and so forth and then some of the rooms I should want specially decorated Altogether before we are finished it may work out at about a hundred thousand I take it that with such a margin you could ah run me up something that in a modest way would take the shine out of I mean to say eclipse anything in the adjoining counties I certainly think said Horace that for such a sum as that I can undertake that you shall have a home which will satisfy you And he proceeded to put the usual questions as to site soil available building materials the accommodation that would be required and so on You re young sir said mister Wackerbath at the end of the interview but I perceive you are up to all the tricks of the I should say versed in the minutiae of your profession You would like to run down and look at the ground eh Well that s only reasonable and my wife and daughters will want to have their say in the matter no getting on without pleasing the ladies hey Now let me see To morrow s Sunday Why not come down by the eight point forty five a m to Lipsfield I ll have a trap or a brougham and pair or something waiting for you take you over the ground myself bring you back to lunch with us at Oriel Court and talk the whole thing thoroughly over Then we ll send you up to town in the evening and you can start work the first thing on Monday That suit you Very well then We ll expect you to morrow With this mister Wackerbath departed leaving Horace as may be imagined absolutely overwhelmed by the suddenness and completeness of his good fortune He was no longer one of the unemployed he had work to do and better still work that would interest him give him all the scope and opportunity he could wish for With a client who seemed tractable and to whom money was clearly no object he might carry out some of his most ambitious ideas Moreover he would now be in a position to speak to Sylvia s father without fear of a repulse His commission on Lsixty thousand would be Lthree thousand and that on the decorations and other work at least as much again probably more In a year he could marry without imprudence in two or three years he might be making a handsome income for he felt confident that with such a start he would soon have as much work as he could undertake He was ashamed of himself for ever having lost heart What were the last few years of weary waiting but probation and preparation for this splendid chance which had come just when he really needed it and in the most simple and natural manner He loyally completed the work he had promised to do for Beevor who would have to dispense with his assistance in future and then he felt too excited and restless to stay in the office and after lunching at his club as usual he promised himself the pleasure of going to Cottesmore Gardens and telling Sylvia his good news It was still early and he walked the whole way as some vent for his high spirits enjoying everything with a new zest the dappled grey and salmon sky before him the amber russet and yellow of the scanty foliage in Kensington Gardens the pungent scent of fallen chestnuts and acorns and burning leaves the blue grey mist stealing between the distant tree trunks and then the cheery bustle and brilliancy of the High Street Finally came the joy of finding Sylvia all alone and witnessing her frank delight at what he had come to tell her of feeling her hands on his shoulders and holding her in his arms as their lips met for the first time If on that Saturday afternoon there was a happier man than Horace Ventimore he would have done well to dissemble his felicity for fear of incurring the jealousy of the high gods When missus Futvoye returned as she did only too soon to find her daughter and Horace seated on the same sofa she did not pretend to be gratified This is taking a most unfair advantage of what I was weak enough to say last night mister Ventimore she began I thought I could have trusted you I shouldn t have come so soon he said if my position were what it was only yesterday But it s changed since then and I venture to hope that even the Professor won t object now to our being regularly engaged And he told her of the sudden alteration in his prospects Well said missus Futvoye you had better speak to my husband about it The Professor came in shortly afterwards and Horace immediately requested a few minutes conversation with him in the study which was readily granted The study to which the Professor led the way was built out at the back of the house and crowded with Oriental curios of every age and kind the furniture had been made by Cairene cabinet makers and along the cornices of the book cases were texts from the Koran while every chair bore the Arabic for Welcome in a gilded firework on its leather back the lamp was a perforated mosque lantern with long pendent glass tubes like hyacinth glasses a mummy case smiled from a corner with laboured bonhomie Well began the Professor as soon as they were seated so I was not mistaken there was something in the brass bottle after all then Let s have a look at it whatever it is For the moment Horace had almost forgotten the bottle Oh he said I I got it open but there was nothing in it Just as I anticipated sir said the Professor I told you there couldn t be anything in a bottle of that description it was simply throwing money away to buy it I dare say it was but I wished to speak to you on a much more important matter and Horace briefly explained his object Dear me said the Professor rubbing up his hair irritably dear me I d no idea of this no idea at all I was under the impression that you volunteered to act as escort to my wife and daughter at saint Luc purely out of good nature to relieve me from what to a man of my habits in that extreme heat would have been an arduous and distasteful duty I was not wholly unselfish I admit said Horace I fell in love with your daughter sir the first day I met her only I felt I had no right as a poor man with no prospects to speak to her or you at that time A very creditable feeling but I ve yet to learn why you should have overcome it So for the third time Ventimore told the story of the sudden turn in his fortunes I know this mister Samuel Wackerbath by name said the Professor one of the chief partners in the firm of Akers and Coverdale the great estate agents a most influential man if you can only succeed in satisfying him Oh I don t feel any misgivings about that sir said Horace I mean to build him a house that will be beyond his wildest expectations and you see that in a year I shall have earned several thousands and I need not say that I will make any settlement you think proper when I marry When you are in possession of those thousands remarked the Professor dryly it will be time enough to talk of marrying and making settlements Meanwhile if you and Sylvia choose to consider yourselves engaged I won t object only I must insist on having your promise that you won t persuade her to marry you without her mother s and my consent Ventimore gave this undertaking willingly enough and they returned to the drawing room missus Futvoye could hardly avoid asking Horace in his new character of fiance to stay and dine which it need not be said he was only too delighted to do There is one thing my dear er Horace said the Professor solemnly after dinner when the neat parlourmaid had left them at dessert one thing on which I think it my duty to caution you If you are to justify the confidence we have shown in sanctioning your engagement to Sylvia you must curb this propensity of yours to needless extravagance Papa cried Sylvia What could have made you think Horace extravagant Really said Horace I shouldn t have called myself particularly so Nobody ever does call himself particularly extravagant retorted the Professor but I observed at saint Luc that you habitually gave fifty centimes as a pourboire when twopence or even a penny would have been handsome And no one with any regard for the value of money would have given a guinea for a worthless brass vessel on the bare chance that it might contain manuscripts which as any one could have foreseen it did not But it s not a bad sort of bottle sir pleaded Horace If you remember you said yourself the shape was unusual Why shouldn t it be worth all the money and more To a collector perhaps said the Professor with his wonted amiability which you are not No I can only call it a senseless and reprehensible waste of money Well the truth is said Horace I bought it with some idea that it might interest you Then you were mistaken sir It does not interest me Why should I be interested in a metal jar which for anything that appears to the contrary may have been cast the other day at Birmingham But there is something said Horace a seal or inscription of some sort engraved on the cap Didn t I mention it You said nothing about an inscription before replied the Professor with rather more interest What is the character Arabic Persian Kufic I really couldn t say it s almost rubbed out queer little triangular marks something like birds footprints That sounds like Cuneiform said the Professor which would seem to point to a Phoenician origin And as I am acquainted with no Oriental brass earlier than the ninth century of our era I should regard your description as a priori distinctly unlikely However I should certainly like to have an opportunity of examining the bottle for myself some day Whenever you please Professor When can you come Why I m so much occupied all day that I can t say for certain when I can get up to your office again My own days will be fairly full now said Horace and the thing s not at the office but in my rooms at Vincent Square Why shouldn t you all come and dine quietly there some evening next week and then you could examine the inscription comfortably afterwards you know Professor and find out what it really is Do say you will He was eager to have the privilege of entertaining Sylvia in his own rooms for the first time No no said the Professor I see no reason why you should be troubled with the entire family I may drop in alone some evening and take the luck of the pot sir Thank you papa put in Sylvia but I should like to come too please and hear what you think of Horace s bottle And I m dying to see his rooms I believe they re fearfully luxurious I trust observed her father that they are far indeed from answering that description If they did I should consider it a most unsatisfactory indication of Horace s character There s nothing magnificent about them I assure you said Horace Though it s true I ve had them done up and all that sort of thing at my own expense but quite simply I couldn t afford to spend much on them But do come and see them I must have a little dinner to celebrate my good fortune it will be so jolly if you ll all three come If we do come stipulated the Professor it must be on the distinct understanding that you don t provide an elaborate banquet Plain simple wholesome food well cooked such as we have had this evening is all that is necessary More would be ostentatious My dear dad protested Sylvia in distress at this somewhat dictatorial speech Surely you can leave all that to Horace Horace my dear understands that in speaking as I did I was simply treating him as a potential member of my family Here Sylvia made a private little grimace No young man who contemplates marrying should allow himself to launch into extravagance on the strength of prospects which for all he can tell said the Professor genially may prove fallacious On the contrary if his affection is sincere he will incur as little expense as possible put by every penny he can save rather than subject the girl he professes to love to the ordeal of a long engagement In other words the truest lover is the best economist I quite understand sir said Horace good temperedly it would be foolish of me to attempt any ambitious form of entertainment especially as my landlady though an excellent plain cook is not exactly a cordon bleu So you can come to my modest board without misgivings Before he left a provisional date for the dinner was fixed for an evening towards the end of the next week and Horace walked home treading on air rather than hard paving stones and striking the stars with his uplifted head The next day he went down to Lipsfield and made the acquaintance of the whole Wackerbath family who were all enthusiastic about the proposed country house The site was everything that the most exacting architect could desire and he came back to town the same evening having spent a pleasant day and learnt enough of his client s requirements and what was even more important those of his client s wife and daughters to enable him to begin work upon the sketch plans the next morning He had not been long in his rooms at Vincent Square and was still agreeably engaged in recalling the docility and ready appreciation with which the Wackerbaths had received his suggestions and rough sketches their compliments and absolute confidence in his skill when he had a shock which was as disagreeable as it was certainly unexpected For the wall before him parted like a film and through it stepped smiling benignantly the green robed figure of Fakrash el Aamash the Jinnee CHAPTER VI EMBARRAS DE RICHESSES Ventimore had so thoroughly convinced himself that the released Jinnee was purely a creature of his own imagination that he rubbed his eyes with a start hoping that they had deceived him Stroke thy head O merciful and meritorious one said his visitor and recover thy faculties to receive good tidings For it is indeed I Fakrash el Aamash whom thou beholdest I I m delighted to see you said Horace as cordially as he could Is there anything I can do for you Nay for hast thou not done me the greatest of all services by setting me free To escape out of a bottle is pleasant And to thee I owe my deliverance It was all true then he had really let an imprisoned Genius or Jinnee or whatever it was out of that bottle He knew he could not be dreaming now he only wished he were However since it was done his best course seemed to be to put a good face on it and persuade this uncanny being somehow to go away and leave him in peace for the future Oh that s all right my dear sir he said don t think any more about it I I rather understood you to say that you were starting on a journey in search of Solomon I have been and returned For I visited sundry cities in his dominions hoping that by chance I might hear news of him but I refrained from asking directly lest thereby I should engender suspicion and so Suleyman should learn of my escape before I could obtain an audience of him and implore justice Oh I shouldn t think that was likely said Horace If I were you I should go straight back and go on travelling till I did find Suleyman Well was it said Pass not any door without knocking lest haply that which thou seekest should be behind it Exactly said Horace Do each city thoroughly house by house and don t neglect the smallest clue If at first you don t succeed try try try again as one of our own poets teaches Try try try again echoed the Jinnee with an admiration that was almost fatuous Divinely gifted truly was he who composed such a verse He has a great reputation as a sage said Horace and the maxim is considered one of his happiest efforts Don t you think that as the East is rather thickly populated the less time you lose in following the poet s recommendation the better It may be as thou sayest But know this O my son that wheresoever I may wander I shall never cease to study how I may most fitly reward thee for thy kindness towards me For nobly it was said If I be possessed of wealth and be not liberal may my head never be extended My good sir said Horace do please understand that if you were to offer me any reward for for a very ordinary act of courtesy I should be obliged to decline it But didst thou not say that thou wast sorely in need of a client That was so at the time said Horace but since I last had the pleasure of seeing you I have met with one who is all I could possibly wish for I am indeed rejoiced to hear it returned the Jinnee for thou showest me that I have succeeded in performing the first service which thou hast demanded of me Horace staggered under this severe blow to his pride for the moment he could only gasp You you sent him to me I and no other said the Jinnee beaming with satisfaction for while unseen of men I was circling in air resolved to attend to thy affair before beginning my search for Suleyman on whom be peace it chanced that I overheard a human being of prosperous appearance say aloud upon a bridge that he desired to erect for himself a palace if he could but find an architect So perceiving thee afar off seated at an open casement I immediately transported him to the place and delivered him into thy hands But he knew my name he had my card in his pocket said Horace I furnished him with the paper containing thy names and abode lest he should be ignorant of them Well look here mister Fakrash said the unfortunate Horace I know you meant well but never do a thing like that again If my brother architects came to know of it I should be accused of most unprofessional behaviour I d no idea you would take that way of introducing a client to me or I should have stopped it at once It was an error said Fakrash No matter I will undo this affair and devise some other and better means of serving thee No no he said for Heaven s sake leave things alone you ll only make them worse Forgive me my dear mister Fakrash I m afraid I must seem most ungrateful but but I was so taken by surprise And really I am extremely obliged to you For though the means you took were were a little irregular you have done me a very great service It is naught said the Jinnee compared to those I hope to render so great a benefactor But indeed you mustn t think of trying to do any more for me urged Horace who felt the absolute necessity of expelling any scheme of further benevolence from the Jinnee s head once and for all You have done enough Why thanks to you I am engaged to build a palace that will keep me hard at work and happy for ever so long Are human beings then so enamoured of hard labour asked Fakrash in wonder It is not thus with the Jinn I love my work for its own sake said Horace and then when I have finished it I shall have earned a very fair amount of money which is particularly important to me just now And why my son art thou so desirous of obtaining riches Because said Horace unless a man is tolerably well off in these days he cannot hope to marry Fakrash smiled with indulgent compassion How excellent is the saying of one of old He that adventureth upon matrimony is like unto one who thrusteth his hand into a sack containing many thousands of serpents and one eel Yet if Fate so decree he may draw forth the eel And thou art comely and of an age when it is natural to desire the love of a maiden Therefore be of good heart and a cheerful eye and it may be that when I am more at leisure I shall find thee a helpmate who shall rejoice thy soul Please don t trouble to find me anything of the sort said Horace hastily with a mental vision of some helpless and scandalised stranger being shot into his dwelling like coals I assure you I would much rather win a wife for myself in the ordinary way as thanks to your kindness I have every hope of doing before long Is there already some damsel for whom thy heart pineth If so fear not to tell me her names and dwelling place and I will assuredly obtain her for thee But Ventimore had seen enough of the Jinnee s Oriental methods to doubt his tact and discretion where Sylvia was concerned No no of course not I spoke generally he said It s exceedingly kind of you but I do wish I could make you understand that I am overpaid as it is You have put me in the way to make a name and fortune for myself If I fail it will be my own fault And at all events I want nothing more from you If you mean to find Suleyman on whom be peace you must go and live in the East altogether for he certainly isn t over here you must give up your whole time to it keep as quiet as possible and don t be discouraged by any reports you may hear Above all never trouble your head about me or my affairs again O thou of wisdom and eloquence said Fakrash this is most excellent advice I will go then but may I drink the cup of perdition if I become unmindful of thy benevolence And raising his joined hands above his head as he spoke he sank feet foremost through the carpet and was gone Thank Heaven thought Ventimore he s taken the hint at last I don t think I m likely to see any more of him I feel an ungrateful brute for saying so but I can t help it I can not stand being under any obligation to a Jinnee who s been shut up in a beastly brass bottle ever since the days of Solomon who probably had very good reasons for putting him there Horace next asked himself whether he was bound in honour to disclose the facts to mister Wackerbath and give him the opportunity of withdrawing from the agreement if he thought fit On the whole he saw no necessity for telling him anything the only possible result would be to make his client suspect his sanity and who would care to employ an insane architect Then if he retired from the undertaking without any explanations what could he say to Sylvia What would Sylvia s father say to him There would certainly be an end to his engagement After all he had not been to blame the Wackerbaths were quite satisfied He felt perfectly sure that he could justify their selection of him he would wrong nobody by accepting the commission while he would only offend them injure himself irretrievably and lose all hope of gaining Sylvia if he made any attempt to undeceive them And Fakrash was gone never to return So on all these considerations Horace decided that silence was his only possible policy and though some moralists may condemn his conduct as disingenuous and wanting in true moral courage I venture to doubt whether any reader however independent straightforward and indifferent to notoriety and ridicule would have behaved otherwise in Ventimore s extremely delicate and difficult position Some days passed every working hour of which was spent by Horace in the rapture of creation To every man with the soul of an artist in him there comes at times only too seldom in most cases a revelation of latent power that he had not dared to hope for And now with Ventimore years of study and theorising which he had often been tempted to think wasted began to bear golden fruit He designed and drew with a rapidity and originality a sense of perfect mastery of the various problems to be dealt with and a delight in the working out of mass and detail so intoxicating that he almost dreaded lest he should be the victim of some self delusion His evenings were of course spent with the Futvoyes in discovering Sylvia in some new and yet more adorable aspect Altogether he was very much in love very happy and very busy three states not invariably found in combination And as he had foreseen he had effectually got rid of Fakrash who was evidently too engrossed in the pursuit of Solomon to think of anything else And there seemed no reason why he should abandon his search for a generation or two for it would probably take all that time to convince him that that mighty monarch was no longer on the throne It would have been too brutal to tell him myself thought Horace when he was so keen on having his case reheard And it gives him an object poor old buffer and keeps him from interfering in my affairs so it s best for both of us Horace s little dinner party had been twice postponed till he had begun to have a superstitious fear that it would never come off but at length the Professor had been induced to give an absolute promise for a certain evening On the day before after breakfast Horace had summoned his landlady to a consultation on the menu Nothing elaborate you know missus Rapkin said Horace who though he would have liked to provide a feast of all procurable delicacies for Sylvia s refection was obliged to respect her father s prejudices Just a simple dinner thoroughly well cooked and nicely served as you know so well how to do it I suppose sir you would require Rapkin to wait As the ex butler was liable to trances on these occasions during which he could do nothing but smile and bow with speechless politeness as he dropped sauce boats and plates Horace replied that he thought of having someone in to avoid troubling mister Rapkin but his wife expressed such confidence in her husband s proving equal to all emergencies that Ventimore waived the point and left it to her to hire extra help if she thought fit Now what soup can you give us he inquired as missus Rapkin stood at attention and quite unmollified After protracted mental conflict she grudgingly suggested gravy soup which Horace thought too unenterprising and rejected in favour of mock turtle Well then fish he continued how about fish missus Rapkin dragged the depths of her culinary resources for several seconds and finally brought to the surface what she called a nice fried sole Horace would not hear of it and urged her to aspire to salmon she substituted smelts which he opposed by a happy inspiration of turbot and lobster sauce The sauce however presented insuperable difficulties to her mind and she offered a compromise in the form of cod which he finally accepted as a fish which the Professor could hardly censure for ostentation Next came the no less difficult questions of entree or no entree of joint and bird What s in season just now said Horace let me see and glanced out of the window as he spoke as though in search of some outside suggestion Camels by Jove he suddenly exclaimed Camels mister Ventimore sir repeated missus Rapkin in some bewilderment and then remembering that he was given to untimely flippancy she gave a tolerant little cough I ll be shot if they aren t camels said Horace What do you make of em missus Rapkin Out of the faint mist which hung over the farther end of the square advanced a procession of tall dust coloured animals with long delicately poised necks and a mincing gait Even missus Rapkin could not succeed in making anything of them except camels What the deuce does a caravan of camels want in Vincent Square said Horace with a sudden qualm for which he could not account Most likely they belong to the Barnum Show sir suggested his landlady I did hear they were coming to Olympia again this year Why of course cried Horace intensely relieved It s on their way from the Docks at least it isn t out of their way Or probably the main road s up for repairs That s it they ll turn off to the left at the corner See they ve got Arab drivers with them Wonderful how the fellows manage them It seems to me sir said missus Rapkin that they re coming our way they seem to be stopping outside Don t talk such infernal I beg your pardon missus Rapkin but why on earth should Barnum and Bailey s camels come out of their way to call on me It s ridiculous you know said Horace irritably Ridicklous it may be sir she retorted but they re all layin down on the road opposite our door as you can see and them niggers is making signs to you to come out and speak to em It was true enough One by one the camels which were apparently of the purest breed folded themselves up in a row like campstools at a sign from their attendants who were now making profound salaams towards the window where Ventimore was standing I suppose I d better go down and see what they want he said with rather a sickly smile They may have lost the way to Olympia I only hope Fakrash isn t at the bottom of this he thought as he went downstairs But he d come himself at all events he wouldn t send me a message on such a lot of camels As he appeared on the doorstep all the drivers flopped down and rubbed their flat black noses on the curbstone For Heaven s sake get up said Horace angrily This isn t Hammersmith Turn to the left into the Vauxhall Bridge Road and ask a policeman the nearest way to Olympia Be not angry with thy slaves said the head driver in excellent English We are here by command of Fakrash el Aamash our lord whom we are bound to obey And we have brought thee these as gifts My compliments to your master said Horace between his teeth and tell him that a London architect has no sort of occasion for camels Say that I am extremely obliged but am compelled to decline them O highly born one explained the driver the camels are not a gift but the loads which are upon the camels Suffer us therefore since we dare not disobey our lord s commands to carry these trifling tokens of his good will into thy dwelling and depart in peace Horace had not noticed till then that every camel bore a heavy burden which the attendants were now unloading Oh if you must he said not too graciously only do look sharp about it there s a crowd collecting already and I don t want to have a constable here He returned to his rooms where he found missus Rapkin paralysed with amazement It s it s all right he said I d forgotten it s only a few Oriental things from the place where that brass bottle came from you know They ve left them here on approval Seems funny their sending their goods ome on camels sir doesn t it said missus Rapkin Not at all funny said Horace they they re an enterprising firm their way of advertising One after another a train of dusky attendants entered each of whom deposited his load on the floor with a guttural grunt and returned backward until the sitting room was blocked with piles of sacks and bales and chests whereupon the head driver appeared and intimated that the tale of gifts was complete I wonder what sort of tip this fellow expects thought Horace a sovereign seems shabby but it s all I can run to I ll try him with that But the overseer repudiated all idea of a gratuity with stately dignity and as Horace saw him to the gate he found a stolid constable by the railings This won t do you know said the constable these ere camels must move on or I shall ave to interfere It s all right constable said Horace pressing into his hand the sovereign the head driver had rejected they re going to move on now They ve brought me a few presents from from a friend of mine in the East By this time the attendants had mounted the kneeling camels which rose with them and swung off round the square in a long swaying trot that soon left the crowd far behind staring blankly after the caravan as camel after camel disappeared into the haze I shouldn t mind knowin that friend o yours sir said the constable open hearted sort o gentleman I should think Very said Horace savagely and returned to his room which missus Rapkin had now left His hands shook though not with joy as he untied some of the sacks and bales and forced open the outlandish looking chests the contents of which almost took away his breath For in the bales were carpets and tissues which he saw at a glance must be of fabulous antiquity and beyond all price the sacks held golden ewers and vessels of strange workmanship and pantomimic proportions the chests were full of jewels ropes of creamy pink pearls as large as average onions strings of uncut rubies and emeralds the smallest of which would have been a tight fit in an ordinary collar box and diamonds roughly facetted and polished each the size of a coconut in whose hearts quivered a liquid and prismatic radiance On the most moderate computation the total value of these gifts could hardly be less than several hundred millions never probably in the world s history had any treasury contained so rich a store It would have been difficult for anybody on suddenly finding himself the possessor of this immense incalculable wealth to make any comment quite worthy of the situation but surely none could have been more inadequate and indeed inappropriate than Horace s which heartfelt as it was was couched in the simple monosyllable Damn CHAPTER VII GRATITUDE A LIVELY SENSE OF FAVOURS TO COME Most men on suddenly finding themselves in possession of such enormous wealth would have felt some elation Ventimore as we have seen was merely exasperated And although this attitude of his may strike the reader as incomprehensible or absolutely wrong headed he had more reason on his side than might appear at a first view It was undoubtedly the fact that with the money these treasures represented he would be in a position to convulse the money markets of Europe and America bring society to his feet make and unmake kingdoms dominate in short the entire world But then as Horace told himself with a groan it wouldn t amuse me in the least to convulse money markets Do I want to see the smartest people in London grovelling for anything they think they re likely to get out of me As I should be perfectly well aware that their homage was not paid to any personal merit of mine I could hardly consider it flattering And why should I make kingdoms The only thing I understand and care about is making houses Then am I likely to be a better hand at dominating the world than all the others who have tried the experiment I doubt it He called to mind all the millionaires he had ever read or heard of they didn t seem to get much fun out of their riches The majority of them were martyrs to dyspepsia They were often weighed down by the cares and responsibilities of their position the only people who were unable to obtain an audience of them at any time were their friends they lived in a glare of publicity and every post brought them hundreds of begging letters and a few threats their children were in constant danger from kidnappers and they themselves after knowing no rest in life could not be certain that even their tombs would be undisturbed Whether they were extravagant or thrifty they were equally maligned and whatever the fortune they left behind them they could be absolutely certain that in a couple of generations it would be entirely dissipated And the biggest millionaire living concluded Horace is a pauper compared with me But there was another consideration how was he to realise all this wealth He knew enough about precious stones to be aware that a ruby for instance of the true pigeon s blood colour and the size of a melon as most of these rubies were would be worth even when cut considerably over a million but who would buy it I think I see myself he reflected grimly calling on some diamond merchant in Hatton Garden with half a dozen assorted jewels in a Gladstone bag If he believed they were genuine he d probably have a fit but most likely he d think I d invented some dodge for manufacturing them and had been fool enough to overdo the size Anyhow he d want to know how they came into my possession and what could I say That they were part of a little present made to me by a Jinnee in grateful acknowledgment of my having relieved him from a brass bottle in which he d been shut up for nearly three thousand years Look at it how you will it s not convincing I fancy I can guess what he d say And what an ass I should look Then suppose the thing got into the papers Got into the papers Why of course it would get into the papers As if it were possible in these days for a young and hitherto unemployed architect suddenly to surround himself with wondrous carpets and gold vessels and gigantic jewels without attracting the notice of some enterprising journalist He would be interviewed the story of his curiously acquired riches would go the round of the papers he would find himself the object of incredulity suspicion ridicule In imagination he could already see the headlines on the news sheets BOTTLED BILLIONS AMAZING ARABESQUES BY AN ARCHITECT HE SAYS THE JAR CONTAINED A JINNEE SENSATIONAL STORY DIVERTING DETAILS And so on through every phrase of alliterative ingenuity He ground his teeth at the mere thought of it Then Sylvia would come to hear of it and what would she think She would naturally be repelled as any nice minded girl would be by the idea that her lover was in secret alliance with a supernatural being And her father and mother would they allow her to marry a man however rich whose wealth came from such a questionable source No one would believe that he had not made some unholy bargain before consenting to set this incarcerated spirit free he who had acted in absolute ignorance who had persistently declined all reward after realising what he had done No it was too much Try as he might to do justice to the Jinnee s gratitude and generosity he could not restrain a bitter resentment at the utter want of consideration shown in overloading him with gifts so useless and so compromising No Jinnee however old however unfamiliar with the world as it is now had any right to be such a fool And at this above the ramparts of sacks and bales which occupied all the available space in the room appeared missus Rapkin s face I was going to ask you sir before them parcels came she began with a dry cough of disapproval what you would like in the way of ongtray to morrow night I thought if I could find a sweetbread at all reasonable To Horace surrounded as he was by incalculable riches sweetbreads seemed incongruous just then the transition of thought was too violent I can t bother about that now missus Rapkin he said we ll settle it to morrow I m too busy I suppose most of these things will have to go back sir if they re only sent on approval like If he only knew where and how he could send them back I I m not sure he said I may have to keep them Well sir bargain or none I wouldn t have em as a gift myself being so dirty and fusty they can t be no use to anybody not to mention there being no room to move with them blocking up all the place I d better tell Rapkin to carry em all upstairs out of people s way Certainly not said Horace sharply by no means anxious for the Rapkins to discover the real nature of his treasures Don t touch them either of you Leave them exactly as they are do you understand As you please mister Ventimore sir only if they re not to be interfered with I don t see myself how you re going to set your friends down to dinner to morrow that s all And indeed considering that the table and every available chair and even the floor were heaped so high with valuables that Horace himself could only just squeeze his way between the piles it seemed as if his guests might find themselves inconveniently cramped It will be all right he said with an optimism he was very far from feeling we ll manage somehow leave it to me Before he left for his office he took the precaution to baffle any inquisitiveness on the part of his landlady by locking his sitting room door and carrying away the key but it was in a very different mood from his former light hearted confidence that he sat down to his drawing board in Great Cloister Street that morning He could not concentrate his mind his enthusiasm and his ideas had alike deserted him He flung down the dividers he had been using and pushed away the nest of saucers of Indian ink and colours in a fit of petulance It s no good he exclaimed aloud I feel a perfect duffer this morning I couldn t even design a decent dog kennel Even as he spoke he became conscious of a presence in the room and looking round saw Fakrash the Jinnee standing at his elbow smiling down on him more benevolently than ever and with a serene expectation of being warmly welcomed and thanked which made Horace rather ashamed of his own inability to meet it He s a thoroughly good natured old chap he thought self reproachfully He means well and I m a beast not to feel more glad to see him And yet hang it all I can t have him popping in and out of the office like a rabbit whenever the fancy takes him Peace be upon thee said Fakrash Moderate the trouble of thy heart and impart thy difficulties to me Oh they re nothing thanks said Horace feeling decidedly embarrassed I got stuck over my work for the moment and it worried me a little that s all Then thou hast not yet received the gifts which I commanded should be delivered at thy dwelling place Oh indeed I have replied Horace and and I really don t know how to thank you for them A few trifling presents answered the Jinnee and by no means suited to thy dignity yet the best in my power to bestow upon thee for the time being My dear sir they simply overwhelm me with their magnificence They re beyond all price and and I ve no idea what to do with such a superabundance A superfluity of good things is good was the Jinnee s sententious reply Not in my particular case I I quite feel your goodness and generosity but indeed as I told you before it s really impossible for me to accept any such reward Fakrash s brows contracted slightly How sayest thou that it is impossible seeing that these things are already in thy possession I know said Horace but you won t be offended if I speak quite plainly Art thou not even as a son to me and can I be angered at any words of thine Well said Horace with sudden hope honestly then I would very much rather if you re sure you don t mind that you would take them all back again What Dost thou demand that I Fakrash el Aamash should consent to receive back the gifts I have bestowed Are they then of so little value in thy sight They re of too much value If I took such a reward for for a very ordinary service I should never be able to respect myself again This is not the reasoning of an intelligent person said the Jinnee coldly If you think me a fool I can t help it I m not an ungrateful fool at all events But I feel very strongly that I can t keep these gifts of yours So thou wouldst have me break the oath which I swore to reward thee fitly for thy kind action But you have rewarded me already said Horace by contriving that a wealthy merchant should engage me to build him a residence And forgive my plain speaking if you truly desire my happiness as I am sure you do you will relieve me of all these precious gems and merchandise because to be frank they will not make me happy On the contrary they are making me extremely uncomfortable In the days of old said Fakrash all men pursued wealth nor could any amass enough to satisfy his desires Have riches then become so contemptible in mortal eyes that thou findest them but an encumbrance Explain the matter Horace felt a natural delicacy in giving his real reasons I can t answer for other men he said All I know is that I ve never been accustomed to being rich and I d rather get used to it gradually and be able to feel that I owed it as far as possible to my own exertions For as I needn t tell you mister Fakrash riches alone don t make any fellow happy You must have observed that they re apt to well to land him in all kinds of messes and worries I m talking like a confounded copybook he thought but I don t care how priggish I am if I can only get my way Fakrash was deeply impressed O young man of marvellous moderation he cried Thy sentiments are not inferior to those of the Great Suleyman himself on whom be peace Yet even he doth not utterly despise them for he hath gold and ivory and precious stones in abundance Nor hitherto have I ever met a human being capable of rejecting them when offered But since thou seemest sincere in holding that my poor and paltry gifts will not advance thy welfare and since I would do thee good and not evil be it even as thou wouldst For excellently was it said The worth of a present depends not on itself nor on the giver but on the receiver alone Horace could hardly believe that he had really prevailed It s extremely good of you sir he said to take it so well And if you could let that caravan call for them as soon as possible it would be a great convenience to me I mean er the fact is I m expecting a few friends to dine with me to morrow and as my rooms are rather small at the best of times I don t quite know how I can manage to entertain them at all unless something is done It will be the easiest of actions replied Fakrash therefore have no fear that when the time cometh thou wilt not be able to entertain thy friends in a fitting manner And for the caravan it shall set out without delay By Jove though I d forgotten one thing said Horace I ve locked up the room where your presents are they won t be able to get in without the key Against the servants of the Jinn neither bolts nor bars can prevail They shall enter therein and remove all that they brought thee since it is thy desire Very many thanks said Horace And you do really understand that I m every bit as grateful as if I could keep the things You see I want all my time and all my energies to complete the designs for this building which he added gracefully I should never be in a position to do at all but for your assistance On my arrival said Fakrash I heard thee lamenting the difficulties of the task wherein do they consist Oh said Horace it s a little difficult to please all the different people concerned and myself too I want to make something of it that I shall be proud of and that will give me a reputation It s a large house and there will be a good deal of work in it but I shall manage it all right This is a great undertaking indeed remarked the Jinnee after he had asked various by no means unintelligent questions and received the answers But be persuaded that it shall all turn out most fortunately and thou shalt obtain great renown And now he concluded I am compelled to take leave of thee for I am still without any certain tidings of Suleyman You mustn t let me keep you said Horace who had been on thorns for some minutes lest Beevor should return and find him with his mysterious visitor You see he added instructively so long as you will neglect your own much more important affairs to look after mine you can hardly expect to make much progress can you How excellent is the saying replied the Jinnee The time which is spent in doing kindnesses call it not wasted Yes that s very good said Horace feeling driven to silence this maxim if possible with one of his own invention But we have a saying too how does it go Ah I remember It is possible for a kindness to be more inconvenient than an injury Marvellously gifted was he who discovered such a saying cried Fakrash I imagine said Horace he learnt it from his own experience By the way what place were you thinking of drawing I mean trying next for Suleyman I purpose to repair to Nineveh and inquire there Capital said Ventimore with hearty approval for he hoped that this would take the Jinnee some little time Wonderful city Nineveh from all I ve heard though not quite what it used to be perhaps Then there s Babylon you might go on there And if you shouldn t hear of him there why not strike down into Central Africa and do that thoroughly Or South America it s a pity to lose any chance you ve never been to South America yet I have not so much as heard of such a country and how should Suleyman be there Pardon me I didn t say he was there All I meant to convey was that he s quite as likely to be there as anywhere else But if you re going to Nineveh first you d better lose no more time for I ve always understood that it s rather an awkward place to get at though probably you won t find it very difficult I care not said Fakrash though the search be long for in travel there are five advantages I know interrupted Horace so don t stop to describe them now I should like to see you fairly started and you really mustn t think it necessary to break off your search again on my account because thanks to you I shall get on splendidly alone for the future if you ll kindly see that that merchandise is removed Thine abode shall not be encumbered with it for another hour said the Jinnee O thou judicious one in whose estimation wealth is of no value know that I have never encountered a mortal who pleased me as thou hast and moreover be assured that such magnanimity as thine shall not go without a recompense How often must I tell you said Horace in a glow of impatience that I am already much more than recompensed Now my kind generous old friend he added with an emotion that was not wholly insincere the time has come to bid you farewell for ever Let me picture you as revisiting your former haunts penetrating to quarters of the globe for whether you are aware of it or not this earth of ours is a globe hitherto unknown to you refreshing your mind by foreign travel and the study of mankind but never never for a moment losing sight of your main object the eventual discovery of and reconciliation with Suleyman on whom be peace That is the greatest the only happiness you can give me now Good bye and bon voyage May Allah never deprive thy friends of thy presence returned the Jinnee who was apparently touched by this exordium for truly thou art a most excellent young man And stepping back into the fireplace he was gone in an instant Ventimore sank back in his chair with a sigh of relief He had begun to fear that the Jinnee never would take himself off but he had gone at last and for good He was half ashamed of himself for feeling so glad for Fakrash was a good natured old thing enough in his way Only he would overdo things he had no sense of proportion Why thought Horace if a fellow expressed a modest wish for a canary in a cage he s just the sort of old Jinnee to bring him a whole covey of rocs in an aviary about ten times the size of the Crystal Palace However he does understand now that I can t take anything more from him and he isn t offended either so that s all settled Now I can set to work and knock off these plans in peace and quietness But he had not done much before he heard sounds in the next room which told him that Beevor had returned at last He had been expected back from the country for the last day or two and it was fortunate that he had delayed so long thought Ventimore as he went in to see him and to tell him the unexpected piece of good fortune that he himself had met with since they last met It is needless to say that in giving his account he abstained from any mention of the brass bottle or the Jinnee as unessential elements in his story Beevor s congratulations were quite as cordial as could be expected as soon as he fully understood that no hoax was intended Well old man he said I am glad I really am you know To think of a prize like that coming to you the very first time And you don t even know how this mister Wackerbath came to hear of you just happened to see your name up outside and came in I expect Why I dare say if I hadn t chanced to go away as I did and about a couple of paltry two thousand pound houses too Ah well I don t grudge you your luck though it does seem rather It was worth waiting for you ll be cutting me out before long if you don t make a mess of this job I mean you know old chap if you don t go and give your City man a Gothic castle when what he wants is something with plenty of plate glass windows and a Corinthian portico That s the rock I see ahead of you You mustn t mind my giving you a word of warning Oh no said Ventimore but I shan t give him either a Gothic castle or plenty of plate glass I venture to think he ll be pleased with the general idea as I m working it out Let s hope so said Beevor If you get into any difficulty you know he added with a touch of patronage just you come to me Thanks said Horace I will But I m getting on very fairly at present I should rather like to see what you ve made of it I might be able to give you a wrinkle here and there It s awfully good of you but I think I d rather you didn t see the plans till they re quite finished said Horace The truth was that he was perfectly aware that the other would not be in sympathy with his ideas and Horace who had just been suffering from a cold fit of depression about his work rather shrank from any kind of criticism Oh just as you please said Beevor a little stiffly you always were an obstinate beggar I ve had a certain amount of experience you know in my poor little pottering way and I thought I might possibly have saved you a cropper or two But if you think you can manage better alone only don t get bolted with by one of those architectural hobbies of yours that s all All right old fellow I ll ride my hobby on the curb said Horace laughing as he went back to his own office where he found that all his former certainty and enjoyment of his work had returned to him and by the end of the day he had made so much progress that his designs needed only a few finishing touches to be complete enough for his client s inspection Better still on returning to his rooms that evening to change before going to Kensington he found that the admirable Fakrash had kept his promise every chest sack and bale had been cleared away Them camels come back for the things this afternoon sir said missus Rapkin and it put me in a fluster at first for I made sure you d locked your door and took the key But I must have been mistook leastways them Arabs got in somehow I hope you meant everything to go back Quite said Horace I saw the the person who sent them this morning and told him there was nothing I cared for enough to keep And like his impidence sending you a lot o rubbish like that on approval and on camels too declared missus Rapkin I m sure I don t know what them advertising firms will try next pushing I call it Now that everything was gone Horace felt a little natural regret and doubt whether he need have been quite so uncompromising in his refusal of the treasures I might have kept some of those tissues and things for Sylvia he thought and she loves pearls And a prayer carpet would have pleased the Professor tremendously But no after all it wouldn t have done Sylvia couldn t go about in pearls the size of new potatoes and the Professor would only have ragged me for more reckless extravagance Besides if I d taken any of the Jinnee s gifts he might keep on pouring more in till I should be just where I was before or worse off really because I couldn t decently refuse them then So it s best as it is And really considering his temperament and the peculiar nature of his position it is not easy to see how he could have arrived at any other conclusion CHAPTER VIII 
5653-46179-0000	train-other-500	BACHELOR S QUARTERS Horace was feeling particularly happy as he walked back the next evening to Vincent Square He had the consciousness of having done a good day s work
5653-46179-0001	train-other-500	for the sketch plans for mister Wackerbath s mansion were actually completed and despatched to his business address while Ventimore now felt a comfortable assurance that his designs would more than satisfy his client
5653-46179-0002	train-other-500	But it was not that which made him so light of heart That night his rooms were to be honoured for the first time by Sylvia s presence She would tread upon his carpet sit in his chairs comment upon and perhaps even handle
5653-46179-0003	train-other-500	his books and ornaments and all of them would retain something of her charm for ever after
none	none	 If she only came 
5653-46179-0004	train-other-500	For even now he could not quite believe that she really would that some untoward event would not make a point of happening to prevent her as he sometimes doubted whether his engagement was not too sweet and wonderful to be true or at all events to last
5653-46179-0005	train-other-500	As to the dinner his mind was tolerably easy for he had settled the remaining details of the menu with his landlady that morning and he could hope that without being so sumptuous as to excite the Professor s wrath it would still be not altogether unworthy
5653-46179-0006	train-other-500	and what goods could be rare and dainty enough to be set before Sylvia He would have liked to provide champagne but he knew that wine would savour of ostentation in the Professor s judgment so he had contented himself instead with claret
5653-46179-0007	train-other-500	a sound vintage which he knew he could depend upon Flowers he thought were clearly permissible and he had called at a florist s on his way and got some chrysanthemums of palest yellow and deepest terra cotta the finest he could see
5653-46179-0008	train-other-500	Some of them would look well on the centre of the table in an old Nankin blue and white bowl he had the rest he could arrange about the room
none	none	 there would just be time to see to all that before dressing 
5653-46179-0009	train-other-500	Occupied with these thoughts he turned into Vincent Square which looked vaster than ever with the murky haze enclosed by its high railings and under a wide expanse of steel blue sky across which the clouds were driving fast like ships in full sail
none	none	 scudding for harbour before a storm 
5653-46179-0010	train-other-500	Against the mist below the young and nearly leafless trees showed flat black profiles as of pressed seaweed
none	none	 and the sky immediately above the house tops was tinged with a sullen red from miles of lighted streets 
5653-46179-0011	train-other-500	from the river came the long drawn tooting of tugs mingled with the more distant wail and hysterical shrieks of railway engines on the Lambeth lines And now he reached the old semi detached house in which he lodged
5653-46179-0012	train-other-500	and noticed for the first time how the trellis work of the veranda made with the bared creepers and hanging baskets a kind of decorative pattern against the windows which were suffused with a roseate glow that looked warm and comfortable and hospitable
5653-46179-0013	train-other-500	He wondered whether Sylvia would notice it when she arrived
none	none	 He passed under the old wrought iron arch that once held an oil lamp and up a short but rather steep flight of steps which led to a brick porch built out at the side 
5653-46179-0014	train-other-500	Then he let himself in and stood spellbound with perplexed amazement for he was in a strange house In place of the modest passage with the yellow marble wall paper the mahogany hat stand
5653-46179-0015	train-other-500	and the elderly barometer in a state of chronic depression which he knew so well he found an arched octagonal entrance hall with arabesques of blue crimson and gold and richly embroidered hangings the floor was marble
5653-46179-0016	train-other-500	and from a shallow basin of alabaster in the centre a perfumed fountain rose and fell with a lulling patter I must have mistaken the number he thought quite forgetting that his latch key had fitted
5653-46179-0017	train-other-500	and he was just about to retreat before his intrusion was discovered when the hangings parted
none	none	 and missus Rapkin presented herself making so deplorably incongruous a figure in such surroundings and looking so bewildered and woebegone that Horace in spite of his own increasing uneasiness had some difficulty in keeping his gravity Oh mister Ventimore sir she lamented 
5653-46179-0018	train-other-500	whatever will you go and do next I wonder To think of your going and having the whole place done up and altered out of knowledge like this without a word of warning If any halterations were required I do think as me and Rapkin had the right to be consulted
5653-46179-0019	train-other-500	Horace let all his chrysanthemums drop unheeded into the fountain He understood now indeed he seemed in some way to have understood almost from the first only he would not admit it even to himself
5653-46179-0020	train-other-500	The irrepressible Jinnee was at the bottom of this of course He remembered now having made that unfortunate remark the day before about the limited accommodation his rooms afforded
none	none	 Clearly Fakrash must have taken a mental note of it 
5653-46179-0021	train-other-500	and with that insatiable munificence which was one of his worst failings had determined by way of a pleasant surprise to entirely refurnish and redecorate the apartments according to his own ideas It was extremely kind of him
5653-46179-0022	train-other-500	it showed a truly grateful disposition but oh as Horace thought in the bitterness of his soul if he would only learn to let well alone and mind his own business
5653-46179-0023	train-other-500	However the thing was done now and he must accept the responsibility for it since he could hardly disclose the truth Didn t I mention I was having some alterations made he said carelessly They ve got the work done rather sooner than I expected Were
5653-46179-0024	train-other-500	were they long over it I m sure I can t tell you sir having stepped out to get some things I wanted in for to night and Rapkin he was round the corner at his reading room and when I come back it was all done and the workmen gone ome
5653-46179-0025	train-other-500	and how they could have finished such a job in the time beats me altogether for when we ad the men in to do the back kitchen they took ten days over it Well said Horace evading this point however they ve done this they ve done it remarkably well
5653-46179-0026	train-other-500	you ll admit that missus Rapkin That s as may be sir
none	none	 said missus Rapkin with a sniff but it ain t my taste 
5653-46179-0027	train-other-500	nor yet I don t think it will be Rapkin s taste when he comes to see it It was not Ventimore s taste either though he was not going to confess it Sorry for that missus Rapkin he said
none	none	 but I ve no time to talk about it now I must rush upstairs and dress 
5653-46179-0028	train-other-500	Begging your pardon sir but that s a total unpossibility for they ve been and took away the staircase Taken away the staircase Nonsense cried Horace So I think mister Ventimore
none	none	 but it s what them men have done and if you don t believe me come and see for yourself She drew the hangings aside and revealed to Ventimore s astonished gaze a vast pillared hall with a lofty domed roof 
5653-46179-0029	train-other-500	from which hung several lamps diffusing a subdued radiance High up in the wall on his left were the two windows which he judged to have formerly belonged to his sitting room for either from delicacy or inability or simply because it had not occurred to him
5653-46179-0030	train-other-500	the Jinnee had not interfered with the external structure but the windows were now masked by a perforated and gilded lattice which accounted for the pattern Horace had noticed from without The walls were covered with blue and white Oriental tiles
none	none	 and a raised platform of alabaster on which were divans ran round two sides of the hall while the side opposite to him was pierced with horseshoe shaped arches apparently leading to other apartments 
5653-46179-0031	train-other-500	The centre of the marble floor was spread with costly rugs and piles of cushions their rich hues glowing through the gold with which they were intricately embroidered Well said the unhappy Horace scarcely knowing what he was saying
5653-46179-0032	train-other-500	it it all looks very cosy missus Rapkin It s not for me to say sir but I should like to know where you thought of dining Where said Horace Why here of course There s plenty of room There isn t a table left in the house
5653-46179-0033	train-other-500	said missus Rapkin so unless you d wish the cloth laid on the floor Oh there must be a table somewhere said Horace impatiently or you can borrow one Don t make difficulties missus Rapkin Rig up anything you like
5653-46179-0034	train-other-500	Now I must be off and dress He got rid of her and on entering one of the archways discovered a smaller room
none	none	 in cedar wood encrusted with ivory and mother o pearl 
5653-46179-0035	train-other-500	which was evidently his bedroom A gorgeous robe
none	none	 stiff with gold and glittering with ancient gems was laid out for him for the Jinnee had thought of everything 
5653-46179-0036	train-other-500	but Ventimore naturally preferred his own evening clothes mister Rapkin he shouted going to another arch that seemed to communicate with the basement Sir replied his landlord who had just returned from his reading room
5653-46179-0037	train-other-500	and now appeared without a tie and in his shirt sleeves looking pale and wild as was perhaps intelligible in the circumstances As he entered his unfamiliar marble halls he staggered
5653-46179-0038	train-other-500	and his red eyes rolled and his mouth gaped in a cod like fashion They ve been at it ere too seemin ly he remarked huskily
none	none	 There have been a few changes said Horace quietly 
5653-46179-0039	train-other-500	as you can see You don t happen to know where they ve put my dress clothes do you I don t appen to know where they ve put nothink Your dress clothes
none	none	 Why I dunno where they ve bin and put our little parler where me and Maria ave set of a hevenin all these years regular I dunno where they ve put the pantry nor yet the bath room with ot and cold water laid on at my own expense And you arsk me to find your hevenin soot I consider sir I consider that a unwall that a most unwarrant terrible liberty have bin took at my expense 
5653-46179-0040	train-other-500	My good man don t talk rubbish said Horace I m talking to you about what I know and I assert that an Englishman s ome is his cashle
none	none	 and nobody s got the right when his backsh turned to go and make a Ummums of it Not nobody asn t Make a what of it cried Ventimore 
5653-46179-0041	train-other-500	A Ummums that s English ain t it A bloomin Turkish baths Who do you suppose is goin to take apartments furnished in this ere ridic loush style
none	none	 What am I goin to say to my landlord It ll about ruing me this will and after you bein a lodger ere for five year and more 
5653-46179-0042	train-other-500	and regarded by me and Maria in the light of one of the family It s ard it s damned ard Now look here said Ventimore sharply
none	none	 for it was obvious that mister Rapkin s studies had been lightened by copious refreshment 
5653-46179-0043	train-other-500	pull yourself together man and listen to me
none	none	 I respeckfully decline to pull myshelf togerrer f r anybody livin said mister Rapkin with a noble air I shtan ere upon my dignity as a man sir I shay I shtand ere upon Here he waved his hand and sat down suddenly upon the marble floor 
5653-46179-0044	train-other-500	You can stand on anything you like or can said Horace but hear what I ve got to say The the people who made all these alterations went beyond my instructions
none	none	 I never wanted the house interfered with like this 
5653-46179-0045	train-other-500	Still if your landlord doesn t see that its value is immensely improved he s a fool that s all Anyway I ll take care you shan t suffer If I have to put everything back in its former state I will at my own expense
5653-46179-0046	train-other-500	So don t bother any more about that You re a general l man mister Ventimore said Rapkin cautiously regaining his feet There s no mishtaking a general l man I m a general l man Of course you are said Horace genially and I ll tell you how you re going to show it
5653-46179-0047	train-other-500	You re going straight downstairs to get your good wife to pour some cold water over your head and then you will finish dressing see what you can do to get a table of some sort and lay it for dinner and be ready to announce my friends when they arrive and wait afterwards Do you see
5653-46179-0048	train-other-500	That will be all ri mister Ventimore said Rapkin who was not far gone enough to be beyond understanding or obeying You leave it entirely to me I ll unnertake that your friends shall be made comforrable perfelly comforrable
none	none	 I ve lived as butler in the besht the mosht ecxlu 
5653-46179-0049	train-other-500	most arishto you know the sort o fam lies I m tryin to r member and and everything was always all ri and I shall be all ri in a few minutes With this assurance he stumbled downstairs leaving Horace relieved to some extent
none	none	 Rapkin would be sober enough after his head had been under the tap for a few minutes and in any case there would be the hired waiter to rely upon If he could only find out where his evening clothes were 
5653-46179-0050	train-other-500	He returned to his room and made another frantic search but they were nowhere to be found and as he could not bring himself to receive his guests in his ordinary morning costume
none	none	 which the Professor would probably construe as a deliberate slight and which would certainly seem a solecism in missus Futvoye s eyes if not in her daughter s 
5653-46179-0051	train-other-500	he decided to put on the Eastern robes with the exception of a turban which he could not manage to wind round his head Thus arrayed he re entered the domed hall
none	none	 where he was annoyed to find that no attempt had been made as yet to prepare a dinner table and he was just looking forlornly round for a bell when Rapkin appeared He had apparently followed Horace s advice for his hair looked wet and sleek and he was comparatively sober 
5653-46179-0052	train-other-500	This is too bad cried Horace
none	none	 my friends may be here at any moment now and nothing done You don t propose to wait at table like that do you he added as he noted the man s overcoat 
5653-46179-0053	train-other-500	and the comforter round his throat I do not propose to wait in any garments whatsoever said Rapkin I m a goin out I am Very well said Horace then send the waiter up I suppose he s come He come but he went away again I told him as he wouldn t be required
none	none	 You told him that Horace said angrily and then controlled himself 
5653-46179-0054	train-other-500	Come Rapkin be reasonable You can t really mean to leave your wife to cook the dinner and serve it too She ain t intending to do neither she ve left the house already You must fetch her back cried Horace Good heavens man
5653-46179-0055	train-other-500	can t you see what a fix you re leaving me in My friends have started long ago
none	none	 it s too late to wire to them or make any other arrangements 
5653-46179-0056	train-other-500	There was a knock as he spoke at the front door and odd enough was the familiar sound of the cast iron knocker in that Arabian hall There they are
5653-46179-0057	train-other-500	he said and the idea of meeting them at the door and proposing an instant adjournment to a restaurant occurred to him till he suddenly recollected that he would have to change and try to find some money even for that
5653-46179-0058	train-other-500	For the last time Rapkin he cried in despair do you mean to tell me there s no dinner ready Oh said Rapkin there s dinner right enough and a lot o barbarious furriners downstairs a cookin of it that s what broke Maria s art
5653-46179-0059	train-other-500	to see it all took out of her ands after the trouble she d gone to But I must have somebody to wait exclaimed Horace
5653-46179-0060	train-other-500	You ve got waiters enough as far as that goes But if you expect a hordinary Christian man to wait along of a lot o narsty niggers and be at their beck and call you re mistook sir for I m going to sleep the night at my brother in law s and take his advice he bein a doorkeeper at a solicitor s orfice and knowing the law
5653-46179-0061	train-other-500	about this ere business and so I wish you a good hevening and oping your dinner will be to your liking and satisfaction
none	none	 He went out by the farther archway while from the entrance hall Horace could hear voices he knew only too well The Futvoyes had come well at all events it seemed that there would be something for them to eat since Fakrash in his anxiety to do the thing thoroughly had furnished both the feast and attendance himself but who was there to announce the guests Where were these waiters Rapkin had spoken of Ought he to go and bring in his visitors himself These questions answered themselves the next instant for as he stood there under the dome the curtains of the central arch were drawn with a rattle and disclosed a double line of tall slaves in rich raiment their onyx eyes rolling and their teeth flashing in their chocolate hued countenances as they salaamed Between this double line stood Professor and missus Futvoye and Sylvia who had just removed their wraps and were gazing in undisguised astonishment on the splendours which met their view Horace advanced to receive them he felt he was in for it now and the only course left him was to put as good a face as he could on the matter and trust to luck to pull him through without discovery or disaster CHAPTER IX PERSICOS ODI PUER APPARATUS So you ve found your way here at last said Horace as he shook hands heartily with the Professor and missus Futvoye I can t tell you how delighted I am to see you As a matter of fact he was very far from being at ease which made him rather over effusive but he was determined that if he could help it he would not betray the slightest consciousness of anything bizarre or unusual in his domestic arrangements And these said missus Futvoye who was extremely stately in black with old lace and steel embroidery these are the bachelor lodgings you were so modest about Really she added with a humorous twinkle in her shrewd eyes you young men seem to understand how to make yourselves comfortable don t they Anthony They do indeed said the Professor dryly though it manifestly cost him some effort to conceal his appreciation To produce such results as these must if I mistake not have entailed infinite research and considerable expense No said Horace no You you d be surprised if you knew how little I should have imagined retorted the Professor that any outlay on apartments which I presume you do not contemplate occupying for an extended period must be money thrown away But doubtless you know best But your rooms are quite wonderful Horace cried Sylvia her charming eyes dilating with admiration And where where did you get that magnificent dressing gown I never saw anything so lovely in my life She herself was lovely enough in a billowy shimmering frock of a delicate apple green hue her only ornament a deep blue Egyptian scarab with spread wings which was suspended from her neck by a slender gold chain I I ought to apologise for receiving you in this costume said Horace with embarrassment but the fact is I couldn t find my evening clothes anywhere so so I put on the first things that came to hand It is hardly necessary said the Professor conscious of being correctly clad and unconscious that his shirt front was bulging and his long eared white tie beginning to work up towards his left jaw hardly necessary to offer any apology for the simplicity of your costume which is entirely in keeping with the ah strictly Oriental character of your interior I feel dreadfully out of keeping said Sylvia for there s nothing in the least Oriental about me unless it s my scarab and he s I don t know how many centuries behind the time poor dear If you said thousands of years my dear corrected the Professor you would be more accurate That scarab was taken out of a tomb of the thirteenth dynasty Well I m sure he d rather be where he is said Sylvia and Ventimore entirely agreed with her Horace I must look at everything How clever and original of you to transform an ordinary London house into this Oh well you see explained Horace it it wasn t exactly done by me Whoever did it said the Professor must have devoted considerable study to Eastern art and architecture May I ask the name of the firm who executed the alterations I really couldn t tell you sir answered Horace who was beginning to understand how very bad a mauvais quart d heure can be You can t tell me exclaimed the Professor You order these extensive and I should say expensive decorations and you don t know the firm you selected to carry them out Of course I know said Horace only I don t happen to remember at this moment Let me see now Was it Liberty No I m almost certain it wasn t Liberty It might have been Maple but I m not sure Whoever did do it they were marvellously cheap I am glad to hear it said the Professor in his most unpleasant tone Where is your dining room Why I rather think said Horace helplessly as he saw a train of attendants laying a round cloth on the floor I rather think this is the dining room You appear to be in some doubt said the Professor I leave it to them it depends where they choose to lay the cloth said Horace Sometimes in one place sometimes in another There s a great charm in uncertainty he faltered Doubtless said the Professor By this time two of the slaves under the direction of a tall and turbaned black had set a low ebony stool inlaid with silver and tortoiseshell in strange devices on the round carpet when other attendants followed with a circular silver tray containing covered dishes which they placed on the stool and salaamed Your ah groom of the chambers said the Professor seems to have decided that we should dine here I observe they are making signs to you that the food is on the table So it is said Ventimore Shall we sit down But my dear Horace said missus Futvoye your butler has forgotten the chairs You don t appear to realise my dear said the Professor that in such an interior as this chairs would be hopelessly incongruous I m afraid there aren t any said Horace for there was nothing but four fat cushions Let s sit down on these he proposed It it s more fun At my time of life said the Professor irritably as he let himself down on the plumpest cushion such fun as may be derived from eating one s meals on the floor fails to appeal to my sense of humour However I admit that it is thoroughly Oriental I think it s delightful said Sylvia ever so much nicer than a stiff conventional dinner party One may be unconventional remarked her father without escaping the penalty of stiffness Go away sir go away he added snappishly to one of the slaves who was attempting to pour water over his hands Your servant Ventimore appears to imagine that I go out to dinner without taking the trouble to wash my hands previously This I may mention is not the case It s only an Eastern ceremony Professor said Horace I am perfectly well aware of what is customary in the East retorted the Professor it does not follow that such ah hygienic precautions are either necessary or desirable at a Western table Horace made no reply he was too much occupied in gazing blankly at the silver dish covers and wondering what in the world might be underneath nor was his perplexity relieved when the covers were removed for he was quite at a loss to guess how he was supposed to help the contents without so much as a fork The chief attendant however solved that difficulty by intimating in pantomime that the guests were expected to use their fingers Sylvia accomplished this daintily and with intense amusement but her father and mother made no secret of their repugnance If I were dining in the desert with a Sheik sir observed the Professor I should I hope know how to conform to his habits and prejudices Here in the heart of London I confess all this strikes me as a piece of needless pedantry I m very sorry said Horace I d have some knives and forks if I could but I m afraid these fellows don t even understand what they are so it s useless to order any We we must rough it a little that s all I hope that er fish is all right Professor He did not know precisely what kind of fish it was but it was fried in oil of sesame and flavoured with a mixture of cinnamon and ginger and the Professor did not appear to be making much progress with it Ventimore himself would have infinitely preferred the original cod and oyster sauce but that could not be helped now Thank you said the Professor it is curious but characteristic Not any more thank you Horace could only trust that the next course would be more of a success It was a dish of mutton stewed with peaches jujubes and sugar which Sylvia declared was delicious Her parents made no comment Might I ask for something to drink said the Professor presently whereupon a cupbearer poured him a goblet of iced sherbet perfumed with conserve of violets I m very sorry my dear fellow he said after sipping it but if I drink this I shall be ill all next day If I might have a glass of wine Another slave instantly handed him a cup of wine which he tasted and set down with a wry face and a shudder Horace tried some afterwards and was not surprised It was a strong harsh wine in which goatskin and resin struggled for predominance It s an old and I make no doubt a fine wine observed the Professor with studied politeness but I fancy it must have suffered in transportation I really think that with my gouty tendency a little whisky and Apollinaris would be better for me if you keep such occidental fluids in the house Horace felt convinced that it would be useless to order the slaves to bring whisky or Apollinaris which were of course unknown in the Jinnee s time so he could do nothing but apologise for their absence No matter said the Professor I am not so thirsty that I cannot wait till I get home It was some consolation that both Sylvia and her mother commended the sherbet and even appreciated or were so obliging as to say they appreciated the entree which consisted of rice and mincemeat wrapped in vine leaves and certainly was not appetising in appearance besides being difficult to dispose of gracefully It was followed by a whole lamb fried in oil stuffed with pounded pistachio nuts pepper nutmeg and coriander seeds and liberally besprinkled with rose water and musk Only Horace had sufficient courage to attack the lamb and he found reason to regret it Afterwards came fowls stuffed with raisins parsley and crumbled bread and the banquet ended with pastry of weird forms and repellent aspect I hope said Horace anxiously you don t find this Eastern cookery very er unpalatable he himself was feeling distinctly unwell it s rather a change from the ordinary routine I have made a truly wonderful dinner thank you replied the Professor not it is to be feared without intention Even in the East I have eaten nothing approaching this But where did your landlady pick up this extraordinary cooking my dear Horace said missus Futvoye I thought you said she was merely a plain cook Has she ever lived in the East Not exactly in the East exclaimed Horace not what you would call living there The fact is he continued feeling that he was in danger of drivelling and that he had better be as candid as he could this dinner wasn t cooked by her She she was obliged to go away quite suddenly So the dinner was all sent in by by a sort of contractor you know He supplies the whole thing waiters and all I was thinking said the Professor that for a bachelor an engaged bachelor you seemed to maintain rather a large establishment Oh they re only here for the evening sir said Horace Capital fellows more picturesque than the local greengrocer and they don t breathe on the top of your head They re perfect dears Horace remarked Sylvia only well just a little creepy crawly to look at It would ill become me to criticise the style and method of our entertainment put in the Professor acidly otherwise I might be tempted to observe that it scarcely showed that regard for economy which I should have Now Anthony put in his wife don t let us have any fault finding I m sure Horace has done it all delightfully yes delightfully and even if he has been just a little extravagant it s not as if he was obliged to be as economical now you know My dear said the Professor I have yet to learn that the prospect of an increased income in the remote future is any justification for reckless profusion in the present If you only knew said Horace you wouldn t call it profusion It it s not at all the dinner I meant it to be and I m afraid it wasn t particularly nice but it s certainly not expensive Expensive is of course a very relative term But I think I have the right to ask whether this is the footing on which you propose to begin your married life It was an extremely awkward question as the reader will perceive If Ventimore replied as he might with truth that he had no intention whatever of maintaining his wife in luxury such as that he stood convicted of selfish indulgence as a bachelor if on the other hand he declared that he did propose to maintain his wife in the same fantastic and exaggerated splendour as the present it would certainly confirm her father s disbelief in his prudence and economy And it was that egregious old ass of a Jinnee as Horace thought with suppressed rage who had let him in for all this and who was now far beyond all remonstrance or reproach Before he could bring himself to answer the question the attendants had noiselessly removed the tray and stool and were handing round rosewater in a silver ewer and basin the character of which luckily or otherwise turned the Professor s inquisitiveness into a different channel These are not bad really not bad at all he said inspecting the design Where did you manage to pick them up I didn t said Horace they re provided by the the person who supplies the dinner Can you give me his address said the Professor scenting a bargain because really you know these things are probably antiques much too good to be used for business purposes I m wrong said Horace lamely these particular things are are lent by an eccentric Oriental gentleman as a great favour Do I know him Is he a collector of such things You wouldn t have met him he he s lived a very retired life of late I should very much like to see his collection If you could give me a letter of introduction No said Horace in a state of prickly heat it wouldn t be any use His collection is never shown He he s a most peculiar man And just now he s abroad Ah pardon me if I ve been indiscreet but I concluded from what you said that this ah banquet was furnished by a professional caterer Oh the banquet Yes that came from the Stores said Horace mendaciously The the Oriental Cookery Department They ve just started it you know so so I thought I d give them a trial But it s not what I call properly organised yet The slaves were now with low obeisances inviting them to seat themselves on the divan which lined part of the hall Ha said the Professor as he rose from his cushion cracking audibly so we re to have our coffee and what not over there hey Well my boy I shan t be sorry I confess to have something to lean my back against and a cigar a mild cigar will ah aid digestion You do smoke here Smoke said Horace Why of course All over the place Here he said clapping his hands which brought an obsequious slave instantly to his side just bring coffee and cigars will you The slave rolled his brandy ball eyes in obvious perplexity Coffee said Horace you must know what coffee is And cigarettes Well chibouks then hubble bubbles if that s what you call them But the slave clearly did not understand and it suddenly struck Horace that since tobacco and coffee were not introduced even in the East till long after the Jinnee s time he as the founder of the feast would naturally be unaware how indispensable they had become at the present day I m really awfully sorry he said but they don t seem to have provided any I shall speak to the manager about it And unfortunately I don t know where my own cigars are It s of no consequence said the Professor with the sort of stoicism that minds very much I am a moderate smoker at best and Turkish coffee though delicious is apt to keep me awake But if you could let me have a look at that brass bottle you got at poor Collingham s sale I should be obliged to you Horace had no idea where it was then nor could he until the Professor came to the rescue with a few words of Arabic manage to make the slaves comprehend what he wished them to find At length however two of them appeared bearing the brass bottle with every sign of awe and depositing it at Ventimore s feet Professor Futvoye after wiping and adjusting his glasses proceeded to examine the vessel It certainly is a most unusual type of brassware he said as unique in its way as the silver ewer and basin and as you thought there does seem to be something resembling an inscription on the cap though in this dim light it is almost impossible to be sure While he was poring over it Horace seated himself on the divan by Sylvia s side hoping for one of the whispered conversations permitted to affianced lovers he had pulled through the banquet somehow and on the whole he felt thankful things had not gone off worse The noiseless and uncanny attendants whom he did not know whether to regard as Efreets or demons or simply illusions but whose services he had no wish to retain had all withdrawn missus Futvoye was peacefully slumbering and her husband was in a better humour than he had been all the evening Suddenly from behind the hangings of one of the archways came strange discordant sounds barbaric janglings and thumpings varied by yowls as of impassioned cats Sylvia drew involuntarily closer to Horace her mother woke with a start and the Professor looked up from the brass bottle with returning irritation What s this What s this he demanded some fresh surprise in store for us It was quite as much of a surprise for Horace but he was spared the humiliation of owning it by the entrance of some half dozen dusky musicians swathed in white and carrying various strangely fashioned instruments with which they squatted down in a semi circle by the opposite wall and began to twang and drub and squall with the complacent cacophony of an Eastern orchestra Clearly Fakrash was determined that nothing should be wanting to make the entertainment a complete success What a very extraordinary noise said missus Futvoye surely they can t mean it for music Yes they do said Horace it it s really more harmonious than it sounds you have to get accustomed to the er notation When you do it s rather soothing than otherwise I dare say said the poor lady And do they come from the Stores too No said Horace with a fine assumption of candour they don t they come from the Arab Encampment at Earl s Court parties and fetes attended you know But they play here for nothing they they want to get their name known you see very deserving and respectable set of fellows My dear Horace remarked missus Futvoye if they expect to get engagements for parties and so on they really ought to try and learn a tune of some sort I understand Horace whispered Sylvia it s very naughty of you to have gone to all this trouble and expense for of course it has cost you a lot just to please us but whatever dad may say I love you all the better for doing it And her hand stole softly into his and he felt that he could forgive Fakrash everything even even the orchestra But there was something unpleasantly spectral about their shadowy forms which showed in grotesquely baggy and bulgy shapes in the uncertain light Some of them wore immense and curious white head dresses which gave them the appearance of poulticed thumbs and they all went on scraping and twiddling and caterwauling with a doleful monotony that Horace felt must be getting on his guests nerves as it certainly was on his own He did not know how to get rid of them but he sketched a kind of gesture in the air intended to intimate that while their efforts had afforded the keenest pleasure to the company generally they were unwilling to monopolise them any longer and the artists were at liberty to retire Perhaps there is no art more liable to misconstruction than pantomime certainly Ventimore s efforts in this direction were misunderstood for the music became wilder louder more aggressively and abominably out of tune and then a worse thing happened For the curtains separated and heralded by sharp yelps from the performers a female figure floated into the hall and began to dance with a slow and sinuous grace Her beauty though of a pronounced Oriental type was unmistakable even in the subdued light which fell on her her diaphanous robe indicated a faultless form her dark tresses were braided with sequins she had the long lustrous eyes the dusky cheeks artificially whitened and the fixed scarlet smile of the Eastern dancing girl of all time And she paced the floor with her tinkling feet writhing and undulating like some beautiful cobra while the players worked themselves up to yet higher and higher stages of frenzy Ventimore as he sat there looking helplessly on felt a return of his resentment against the Jinnee It was really too bad of him he ought at his age to have known better Not that there was anything objectionable in the performance itself but still it was not the kind of entertainment for such an occasion Horace wished now he had mentioned to Fakrash who the guests were whom he expected and then perhaps even the Jinnee would have exercised more tact in his arrangements And does this girl come from Earl s Court inquired missus Futvoye who was now thoroughly awake Oh dear no said Horace I engaged her at at Harrod s the Entertainment Bureau They told me there she was rather good struck out a line of her own don t you know But perfectly correct she she only does this to support an invalid aunt These statements were as he felt even in making them not only gratuitous but utterly unconvincing but he had arrived at that condition in which a man discovers with terror the unsuspected amount of mendacity latent in his system I should have thought there were other ways of supporting invalid aunts remarked missus Futvoye What is this young lady s name Tinkler said Horace on the spur of the moment Miss Clementine Tinkler But surely she is a foreigner Mademoiselle I ought to have said And Tinkla with an a you know I believe her mother was of Arabian extraction but I really don t know explained Horace conscious that Sylvia had withdrawn her hand from his and was regarding him with covert anxiety I really must put a stop to this he thought You re getting bored by all this darling he said aloud so am I I ll tell them to go And he rose and held out his hand as a sign that the dance should cease It ceased at once but to his unspeakable horror the dancer crossed the floor with a swift jingling rush and sank in a gauzy heap at his feet seizing his hand in both hers and covering it with kisses while she murmured speeches in some tongue unknown to him Is this a usual feature in Miss Tinkla s entertainments may I ask said missus Futvoye bristling with not unnatural indignation I really don t know said the unhappy Horace I can t make out what she s saying If I understand her rightly said the Professor she is addressing you as the light of her eyes and the vital spirit of her heart Oh said Horace she s quite mistaken you know It it s the emotional artist temperament they don t mean anything by it My my dear young lady he added you ve danced most delightfully and I m sure we re all most deeply indebted to you but we won t detain you any longer Professor he added as she made no offer to rise will you kindly explain to them in Arabic that I should be obliged by their going at once The Professor said a few words which had the desired effect The girl gave a little scream and scudded through the archway and the musicians seized their instruments and scuttled after her I am so sorry said Horace whose evening seemed to him to have been chiefly spent in apologies it s not at all the kind of entertainment one would expect from a place like Whiteley s By no means agreed the Professor but I understood you to say Miss Tinkla was recommended to you by Harrod s Very likely sir said Horace but that doesn t affect the case I shouldn t expect it from them Probably they don t know how shamelessly that young person conducts herself said missus Futvoye And I think it only right that they should be told I shall complain of course said Horace I shall put it very strongly A protest would have more weight coming from a woman said missus Futvoye and as a shareholder in the company I shall feel bound No I wouldn t said Horace in fact you mustn t For now I come to think of it she didn t come from Harrod s after all or Whiteley s either Then perhaps you will be good enough to inform us where she did come from I would if I knew said Horace but I don t What cried the Professor sharply do you mean to say you can t account for the existence of a dancing girl who in my daughter s presence kisses your hand and addresses you by endearing epithets Oriental metaphor said Horace She was a little overstrung Of course if I had had any idea she would make such a scene as that Sylvia he broke off you don t doubt me No Horace said Sylvia simply I m sure you must have some explanation only I do think it would be better if you gave it If I told you the truth said Horace slowly you would none of you believe me Then you admit put in the Professor that hitherto you have not been telling the truth Not as invariably as I could have wished Horace confessed So I suspected Then unless you can bring yourself to be perfectly candid you can hardly wonder at our asking you to consider your engagement as broken off Broken off echoed Horace Sylvia you won t give me up You know I wouldn t do anything unworthy of you I m certain that you can t have done anything which would make me love you one bit the less if I knew it So why not be quite open with us Because darling said Horace I m in such a fix that it would only make matters worse In that case said the Professor and as it is already rather late perhaps you will allow one of your numerous retinue to call a four wheeler Horace clapped his hands but no one answered the summons and he could not find any of the slaves in the antechamber I m afraid all the servants have left he explained and it is to be feared he would have added that they were all obliged to return to the contractor by eleven only he caught the Professor s eye and decided that he had better refrain If you will wait here I ll go out and fetch a cab he added There is no occasion to trouble you said the Professor my wife and daughter have already got their things on and we will walk until we find a cab Now mister Ventimore we will bid you good night and good bye For after what has happened you will I trust have the good taste to discontinue your visits and make no attempt to see Sylvia again Upon my honour protested Horace I have done nothing to warrant you in shutting your doors against me I am unable to agree with you I have never thoroughly approved of your engagement because as I told you at the time I suspected you of recklessness in money matters Even in accepting your invitation to night I warned you as you may remember not to make the occasion an excuse for foolish extravagance I come here and find you in apartments furnished and decorated as you informed us by yourself and on a scale which would be prodigal in a millionaire You have a suite of retainers which except for their nationality and imperfect discipline a prince might envy You provide a banquet of hem delicacies which must have cost you infinite trouble and unlimited expense this after I had expressly stipulated for a quiet family dinner Not content with that you procure for our diversion Arab music and dancing of a of a highly recondite character I should be unworthy of the name of father sir if I were to entrust my only daughter s happiness to a young man with so little common sense so little self restraint And she will understand my motives and obey my wishes You re right Professor according to your lights admitted Horace And yet confound it all you re utterly wrong too Oh Horace cried Sylvia if you had only listened to dad and not gone to all this foolish foolish expense we might have been so happy But I have gone to no expense All this hasn t cost me a penny Ah there is some mystery Horace if you love me you will explain here now before it s too late My darling groaned Horace I would like a shot if I thought it would be of the least use Hitherto said the Professor you cannot be said to have been happy in your explanations and I should advise you not to venture on any more Good night once more I only wish it were possible without needless irony to make the customary acknowledgments for a pleasant evening missus Futvoye had already hurried her daughter away and though she had left her husband to express his sentiments unaided she made it sufficiently clear that she entirely agreed with them Horace stood in the outer hall by the fountain in which his drowned chrysanthemums were still floating and gazed in stupefied despair after his guests as they went down the path to the gate He knew only too well that they would never cross his threshold nor he theirs again Suddenly he came to himself with a start I ll try it he cried I can t and won t stand this And he rushed after them bareheaded Professor he said breathlessly as he caught him up one moment On second thoughts I will tell you my secret if you will promise me a patient hearing The pavement is hardly the place for confidences replied the Professor and if it were your costume is calculated to attract more remark than is desirable My wife and daughter have gone on if you will permit me I will overtake them I shall be at home to morrow morning should you wish to see me No to night to night urged Horace I can t sleep in that infernal place with this on my mind Put missus Futvoye and Sylvia into a cab Professor and come back It s not late and I won t keep you long but for Heaven s sake let me tell you my story at once Probably the Professor was not without some curiosity on the subject at all events he yielded Very well he said go into the house and I will rejoin you presently Only remember he added that I shall accept no statement without the fullest proof Otherwise you will merely be wasting your time and mine Proof thought Horace gloomily as he returned to his Arabian halls The only decent proof I could produce would be old Fakrash and he s not likely to turn up again especially now I want him A little later the Professor returned having found a cab and despatched his women folk home Now young man he said as he unwound his wrapper and seated himself on the divan by Horace s side I can give you just ten minutes to tell your story in so let me beg you to make it as brief and as comprehensible as you can It was not exactly an encouraging invitation in the circumstances but Horace took his courage in both hands and told him everything just as it had happened And that s your story said the Professor after listening to the narrative with the utmost attention when Horace came to the end That s my story sir said Horace And I hope it has altered your opinion of me It has replied the Professor in an altered tone it has indeed Yours is a sad case a very sad case It s rather awkward isn t it But I don t mind so long as you understand And you ll tell Sylvia as much as you think proper Yes yes I must tell Sylvia And I may go on seeing her as usual Well will you be guided by my advice the advice of one who has lived more than double your years Certainly said Horace Then if I were you I should go away at once for a complete change of air and scene That s impossible sir you forget my work Never mind your work my boy leave it for a while try a sea voyage go round the world get quite away from these associations But I might come across the Jinnee again objected Horace he s travelling as I told you Yes yes to be sure Still I should go away Consult any doctor and he ll tell you the same thing Consult any Good God cried Horace I see what it is you think I m mad No no my dear boy said the Professor soothingly not mad nothing of the sort perhaps your mental equilibrium is just a trifle it s quite intelligible You see the sudden turn in your professional prospects coupled with your engagement to Sylvia I ve known stronger minds than yours thrown off their balance temporarily of course quite temporarily by less than that You believe I am suffering from delusions I don t say that I think you may see ordinary things in a distorted light Anyhow you don t believe there really was a Jinnee inside that bottle Remember you yourself assured me at the time you opened it that you found nothing whatever inside it Isn t it more credible that you were right then than that you should be right now Well said Horace you saw all those black slaves you ate or tried to eat that unutterably beastly banquet you heard that music and then there was the dancing girl And this hall we re in this robe I ve got on are they delusions Because if they are I m afraid you will have to admit that you re mad too Ingeniously put said the Professor I fear it is unwise to argue with you Still I will venture to assert that a strong imagination like yours over heated and saturated with Oriental ideas to which I fear I may have contributed is not incapable of unconsciously assisting in its own deception In other words I think that you may have provided all this yourself from various quarters without any clear recollection of the fact That s very scientific and satisfactory as far as it goes my dear Professor said Horace but there s one piece of evidence which may upset your theory and that s this brass bottle If your reasoning powers were in their normal condition said the Professor compassionately you would see that the mere production of an empty bottle can be no proof of what it contained or for that matter that it ever contained anything at all Oh I see that said Horace but this bottle has a stopper with what you yourself admit to be an inscription of some sort Suppose that inscription confirms my story what then All I ask you to do is to make it out for yourself before you decide that I m either a liar or a lunatic I warn you said the Professor that if you are trusting to my being unable to decipher the inscription you are deceiving yourself You represent that this bottle belongs to the period of Solomon that is about a thousand years B C Probably you are not aware that the earliest specimens of Oriental metal work in existence are not older than the tenth century of our era But granting that it is as old as you allege I shall certainly be able to read any inscription there may be on it I have made out clay tablets in Cuneiform which were certainly written a thousand years before Solomon s time So much the better said Horace I m as certain as I can be that whatever is written on that lid whether it s Phoenician or Cuneiform or anything else must have some reference to a Jinnee confined in the bottle or at least bear the seal of Solomon But there the thing is examine it for yourself Not now said the Professor it s too late and the light here is not strong enough But I ll tell you what I will do I ll take this stopper thing home with me and examine it carefully to morrow on one condition You have only to name it said Horace My condition is that if I and one or two other Orientalists to whom I may submit it come to the conclusion that there is no real inscription at all or if any that a date and meaning must be assigned to it totally inconsistent with your story you will accept our finding and acknowledge that you have been under a delusion and dismiss the whole affair from your mind Oh I don t mind agreeing to that said Horace particularly as it s my only chance Very well then said the Professor as he removed the metal cap and put it in his pocket you may depend upon hearing from me in a day or two Meantime my boy he continued almost affectionately why not try a short bicycle tour somewhere hey You re a cyclist I know anything but allow yourself to dwell on Oriental subjects It s not so easy to avoid dwelling on them as you think said Horace with rather a dreary laugh And I fancy Professor that whether you like it or not you ll have to believe in that Jinnee of mine sooner or later I can scarcely conceive replied the Professor who was by this time at the outer door any degree of evidence which could succeed in convincing me that your brass bottle had ever contained an Arabian Jinnee However I shall endeavour to preserve an open mind on the subject Good evening to you As soon as he was alone Horace paced up and down his deserted halls in a state of simmering rage as he thought how eagerly he had looked forward to his little dinner party how intimate and delightful it might have been and what a monstrous and prolonged nightmare it had actually proved And at the end of it there he was in a fantastic impossible dwelling deserted by every one his chances of setting himself right with Sylvia hanging on the slenderest thread unknown difficulties and complications threatening him from every side He owed all this to Fakrash Yes that incorrigibly grateful Jinnee with his antiquated notions and his high flown professions had contrived to ruin him more disastrously than if he had been his bitterest foe Ah if he could be face to face with him once more if only for five minutes he would be restrained by no false delicacy he would tell him fairly and plainly what a meddling blundering old fool he was But Fakrash had taken his flight for ever there were no means of calling him back nothing to be done now but go to bed and sleep if he could Exasperated by the sense of his utter helplessness Ventimore went to the arch which led to his bed chamber and drew the curtain back with a furious pull And just within the archway standing erect with folded arms and the smile of fatuous benignity which Ventimore was beginning to know and dread was the form of Fakrash el Aamash the Jinnee CHAPTER X NO PLACE LIKE HOME May thy head long survive said Fakrash by way of salutation as he stepped through the archway You re very good said Horace whose anger had almost evaporated in the relief of the Jinnee s unexpected return but I don t think any head can survive this sort of thing long Art thou content with this dwelling I have provided for thee inquired the Jinnee glancing around the stately hall with perceptible complacency It would have been positively brutal to say how very far from contented he felt so Horace could only mumble that he had never been lodged like that before in all his life It is far below thy deserts Fakrash observed graciously And were thy friends amazed at the manner of their entertainment They were said Horace A sure method of preserving friends is to feast them with liberality remarked the Jinnee This was rather more than Horace s temper could stand You were kind enough to provide my friends with such a feast he said that they ll never come here again How so Were not the meats choice and abounding in fatness Was not the wine sweet and the sherbet like unto perfumed snow Oh everything was er as nice as possible said Horace Couldn t have been better Yet thou sayest that thy friends will return no more for what reason Well you see explained Horace reluctantly there s such a thing as doing people too well I mean it isn t everybody that appreciates Arabian cooking But they might have stood that It was the dancing girl that did for me I commanded that a houri lovelier than the full moon and graceful as a young gazelle should appear for the delight of thy guests She came said Horace gloomily Acquaint me with that which hath occurred for I perceive plainly that something hath fallen out contrary to thy desires Well said Horace if it had been a bachelor party there would have been no harm in the houri but as it happened two of my guests were ladies and they well they not unnaturally put a wrong construction on it all Verily exclaimed the Jinnee thy words are totally incomprehensible to me I don t know what the custom may be in Arabia said Horace but with us it is not usual for a man to engage a houri to dance after dinner to amuse the lady he is proposing to marry It s the kind of attention she d be most unlikely to appreciate Then was one of thy guests the damsel whom thou art seeking to marry She was said Horace and the other two were her father and mother From which you may imagine that it was not altogether agreeable for me when your gazelle threw herself at my feet and hugged my knees and declared that I was the light of her eyes Of course it all meant nothing it s probably the conventional behaviour for a gazelle and I m not reflecting upon her in the least But in the circumstances it was compromising I thought said Fakrash that thou assuredst me that thou wast not contracted to any damsel I think I only said that there was no one whom I would trouble you to procure as a wife for me replied Horace I certainly was engaged though after this evening my engagement is at an end unless that reminds me do you happen to know whether there really was an inscription on the seal of your bottle and what it said I know naught of any inscription said the Jinnee bring me the seal that I may see it I haven t got it by me at this moment said Horace I lent it to my friend the father of this young lady I told you of You see mister Fakrash you got me into I mean I was in such a hole over this affair that I was obliged to make a clean breast of it to him And he wouldn t believe it so it struck me that there might be an inscription of some sort on the seal saying who you were and why Solomon had you confined in the bottle Then the Professor would be obliged to admit that there s something in my story Truly I wonder at thee and at the smallness of thy penetration the Jinnee commented for if there were indeed any writing upon this seal it is not possible that one of thy race should be able to decipher it Oh I beg your pardon said Horace Professor Futvoye is an Oriental scholar he can make out any inscription no matter how many thousands of years old it may be If anything s there he ll decipher it The question is whether anything is there The effect of this speech on Fakrash was as unexpected as it was inexplicable the Jinnee s features usually so mild began to work convulsively until they became terrible to look at and suddenly with a fierce howl he shot up to nearly double his ordinary stature O thou of little sense and breeding he cried in a loud voice how camest thou to deliver the bottle in which I was confined into the hands of this learned man Ventimore startled as he was did not lose his self possession My dear sir he said I did not suppose you could have any further use for it And as a matter of fact I didn t give Professor Futvoye the bottle which is over there in the corner but merely the stopper I wish you wouldn t tower over me like that it gives me a crick in the neck to talk to you Why on earth should you make such a fuss about my lending the seal what possible difference can it make to you even if it does confirm my story And it s of immense importance to me that the Professor should believe I told the truth I spoke in haste said the Jinnee slowly resuming his normal size and looking slightly ashamed of his recent outburst as well as uncommonly foolish The bottle truly is of no value and as for the stopper since it is but lent it is no great matter If there be any legend upon the seal perchance this learned man of whom thou speakest will by this time have deciphered it No said Horace he won t tackle it till to morrow And it s as likely as not that when he does he won t find any reference to you and I shall be up a taller tree than ever Art thou so desirous that he should receive proof that thy story is true Why of course I am Haven t I been saying so all this time Who can satisfy him so surely as I You cried Horace Do you mean to say you really would mister Fakrash you are an old brick That would be the very thing There is naught said the Jinnee smiling indulgently that I would not do to promote thy welfare for thou hast rendered me inestimable service Acquaint me therefore with the abode of this sage and I will present myself before him and if haply he should find no inscription upon the seal or its purport should be hidden from him then will I convince him that thou hast spoken the truth and no lie Horace very willingly gave him the Professor s address Only don t drop in on him to night you know he thought it prudent to add or you might startle him Call any time after breakfast to morrow and you ll find him in To night said Fakrash I return to pursue my search after Suleyman on whom be peace For not yet have I found him If you will try to do so many things at once said Horace I don t see how you can expect much result At Nineveh they knew him not for where I left a city I found but a heap of ruins tenanted by owls and bats They say the lion and the lizard keep the Courts murmured Horace half to himself I was afraid you might be disappointed with Nineveh myself Why not run over to Sheba You might hear of him there Seba of El Yemen the country of Bilkees the Queen beloved of Suleyman said the Jinnee It is an excellent suggestion and I will follow it without delay But you won t forget to look in on Professor Futvoye to morrow will you Assuredly I will not And now ere I depart tell me if there be any other service I may render thee Horace hesitated There is just one he said only I m afraid you ll be offended if I mention it On the head and the eye be thy commands said the Jinnee for whatsoever thou desirest shall be accomplished provided that it lie within my power to perform it Well said Horace if you re sure you don t mind I ll tell you You ve transformed this house into a wonderful place more like the Alhambra I don t mean the one in Leicester Square than a London lodging house But then I am only a lodger here and the people the house belongs to excellent people in their way would very much rather have the house as it was They have a sort of idea that they won t be able to let these rooms as easily as the others Base and sordid dogs said the Jinnee with contempt Possibly said Horace it s narrow minded of them but that s the way they look at it They ve actually left rather than stay here And it s their house not mine If they abandon this dwelling thou wilt remain in the more secure possession Oh shall I though They ll go to law and have me turned out and I shall have to pay ruinous damages into the bargain So you see what you intended as a kindness will only bring me bad luck Come without more words to the statement of thy request said Fakrash for I am in haste All I want you to do replied Horace in some anxiety as to what the effect of his request would be is to put everything here back to what it was before It won t take you a minute Of a truth exclaimed Fakrash to bestow a favour upon thee is but a thankless undertaking for not once but twice hast thou rejected my benefits and now behold I am at a loss to devise means to gratify thee I know I ve abused your good nature said Horace but if you ll only do this and then convince the Professor that my story is true I shall be more than satisfied I ll never ask another favour of you My benevolence towards thee hath no bounds as thou shalt see and I can deny thee nothing for truly thou art a worthy and temperate young man Farewell then and be it according to thy desire He raised his arms above his head and shot up like a rocket towards the lofty dome which split asunder to let him pass Horace as he gazed after him had a momentary glimpse of deep blue sky with a star or two that seemed to be hurrying through the transparent opal scud before the roof closed in once more Then came a low rumbling sound with a shock like a mild earthquake the slender pillars swayed under their horseshoe arches the big hanging lanterns went out the walls narrowed and the floor heaved and rose till Ventimore found himself up in his own familiar sitting room once more in the dark Outside he could see the great square still shrouded in grey haze the street lamps flickering in the wind a belated reveller was beguiling his homeward way by rattling his stick against the railings as he passed Inside the room everything was exactly as before and Horace found it difficult to believe that a few minutes earlier he had been standing on that same site but twenty feet or so below his present level in a spacious blue tiled hall with a domed ceiling and gaudy pillared arches But he was very far from regretting his short lived splendour he burnt with shame and resentment whenever he thought of that nightmare banquet which was so unlike the quiet unpretentious little dinner he had looked forward to However it was over now and it was useless to worry himself about what could not be helped Besides fortunately there was no great harm done the Jinnee had been brought to see his mistake and to do him justice had shown himself willing enough to put it right He had promised to go and see the Professor next day and the result of the interview could not fail to be satisfactory And after this Ventimore thought Fakrash would have the sense and good feeling not to interfere in his affairs again Meanwhile he could sleep now with a mind free from his worst anxieties and he went to his room in a spirit of intense thankfulness that he had a Christian bed to sleep in He took off his gorgeous robes the only things that remained to prove to him that the events of that evening had been no delusion and locked them in his wardrobe with a sense of relief that he would never be required to wear them again and his last conscious thought before he fell asleep was the comforting reflection that if there were any barrier between Sylvia and himself it would be removed in the course of a very few more hours CHAPTER XI A FOOL S PARADISE Ventimore found next morning that his bath and shaving water had been brought up from which he inferred quite correctly that his landlady must have returned Secretly he was by no means looking forward to his next interview with her but she appeared with his bacon and coffee in a spirit so evidently chastened that he saw that he would have no difficulty so far as she was concerned I m sure mister Ventimore sir she began apologetically I don t know what you must have thought of me and Rapkin last night leaving the house like we did It was extremely inconvenient said Horace and not at all what I should have expected from you But possibly you had some reason for it Why sir said missus Rapkin running her hand nervously along the back of a chair the fact is something come over me and come over Rapkin as we couldn t stop here another minute not if it was ever so Ah said Horace raising his eyebrows restlessness eh missus Rapkin Awkward that it should come on just then though wasn t it It was the look of the place somehow said missus Rapkin If you ll believe me sir it was all changed like nothing in it the same from top to bottom Really said Horace I don t notice any difference myself No more don t I sir not by daylight but last night it was all domes and harches and marble fountings let into the floor with parties moving about downstairs all silent and as black as your hat which Rapkin saw them as well as what I did From the state your husband was in last night said Horace I should say he was capable of seeing anything and double of most things I won t deny sir that Rapkin mayn t have been quite hisself as a very little upsets him after he s spent an afternoon studying the papers and what not at the libery But I see the niggers too mister Ventimore and no one can say I ever take more than is good for me I don t suggest that for a moment missus Rapkin said Horace only if the house was as you describe last night how do you account for its being all right this morning missus Rapkin in her embarrassment was reduced to folding her apron into small pleats It s not for me to say sir she replied but if I was to give my opinion it would be as them parties as called ere on camels the other day was at the bottom of it I shouldn t wonder if you were right missus Rapkin said Horace blandly you see you had been exerting yourself over the cooking and no doubt were in an over excited state and as you say those camels had taken hold of your imagination until you were ready to see anything that Rapkin saw and he was ready to see anything you did It s not at all uncommon Scientific people I believe call it Collective Hallucination Law sir said the good woman considerably impressed by this diagnosis you don t mean to say I had that I was always fanciful from a girl and could see things in coffee grounds as nobody else could but I never was took like that before And to think of me leaving my dinner half cooked and you expecting your young lady and her pa and ma Well there now I am sorry Whatever did you do sir We managed to get food of sorts from somewhere said Horace but it was most uncomfortable for me and I trust missus Rapkin I sincerely trust that it will not occur again That I ll answer for it shan t sir And you won t take no notice to Rapkin sir will you Though it was his seein the niggers and that as put it into my ed but I ave spoke to him pretty severe already and he s truly sorry and ashamed for forgetting hisself as he did Very well missus Rapkin said Horace we will understand that last night s hem rather painful experience is not to be alluded to again on either side He felt sincerely thankful to have got out of it so easily for it was impossible to say what gossip might not have been set on foot if the Rapkins had not been brought to see the advisability of reticence on the subject There s one more thing sir I wished for to speak to you about said missus Rapkin that great brass vawse as you bought at an oction some time back I dunno if you remember it I remember it said Horace Well what about it Why sir I found it in the coal cellar this morning and I thought I d ask if that was where you wished it kep in future For though no amount o polish could make it what I call a tasty thing it s neither horniment nor yet useful where it is at present Oh said Horace rather relieved for he had an ill defined dread from her opening words that the bottle might have been misbehaving itself in some way Put it wherever you please missus Rapkin do whatever you like with it so long as I don t see the thing again Very good sir I on y thought I d ask the question said missus Rapkin as she closed the door upon herself Altogether Horace walked to Great Cloister Street that morning in a fairly cheerful mood and amiably disposed even towards the Jinnee With all his many faults he was a thoroughly good natured old devil very superior in every way to the one the Arabian Nights fisherman found in his bottle Ninety nine Jinn out of a hundred thought Horace would have turned nasty on finding benefit after benefit declined with thanks But one good point in Fakrash is that he does take a hint in good part and as soon as he can be made to see where he s wrong he s always ready to set things right And he thoroughly understands now that these Oriental dodges of his won t do nowadays and that when people see a penniless man suddenly wallowing in riches they naturally want to know how he came by them I don t suppose he will trouble me much in future If he should look in now and then I must put up with it Perhaps if I suggested it he wouldn t mind coming in some form that would look less outlandish If he would get himself up as a banker or a bishop the Bishop of Bagdad say I shouldn t care how often he called Only I can t have him coming down the chimney in either capacity But he ll see that himself And he s done me one real service I mustn t let myself forget that He sent me old Wackerbath By the way I wonder if he s seen my designs yet and what he thinks of them He was at his table engaged in jotting down some rough ideas for the decoration of the reception rooms in the projected house when Beevor came in I ve got nothing doing just now he said so I thought I d come in and have a squint at those plans of yours if they re forward enough to be seen yet Ventimore had to explain that even the imperfect method of examination proposed was not possible as he had despatched the drawings to his client the night before Phew said Beevor that s sharp work isn t it I don t know I ve been sticking hard at it for over a fortnight Well you might have given me a chance of seeing what you ve made of it I let you see all my work To tell you the honest truth old fellow I wasn t at all sure you d like it and I was afraid you d put me out of conceit with what I d done and Wackerbath was in a frantic hurry to have the plans so there it was And do you think he ll be satisfied with them He ought to be I don t like to be cock sure but I believe I really do believe that I ve given him rather more than he expected It s going to be a devilish good house though I say it myself Something new fangled and fantastic eh Well he mayn t care about it you know When you ve had my experience you ll realise that a client is a rum bird to satisfy I shall satisfy my old bird said Horace gaily He ll have a cage he can hop about in to his heart s content You re a clever chap enough said Beevor but to carry a big job like this through you want one thing and that s ballast Not while you heave yours at my head Come old fellow you aren t really riled because I sent off those plans without showing them to you I shall soon have them back and then you can pitch into em as much as you please Seriously though I shall want all the help you can spare when I come to the completed designs Um said Beevor you ve got along very well alone so far at least by your own account so I dare say you ll be able to manage without me to the end Only you know he added as he left the room you haven t won your spurs yet A fellow isn t necessarily a Gilbert Scott or a Norman Shaw or a Waterhouse just because he happens to get a sixty thousand pound job the first go off Poor old Beevor thought Horace repentantly I ve put his back up I might just as well have shown him the plans after all it wouldn t have hurt me and it would have pleased him Never mind I ll make my peace with him after lunch I ll ask him to give me his idea for a no hang it all even friendship has its limits He returned from lunch to hear what sounded like an altercation of some sort in his office in which as he neared his door Beevor s voice was distinctly audible My dear sir he was saying I have already told you that it is no affair of mine But I ask you sir as a brother architect said another voice whether you consider it professional or reasonable As a brother architect replied Beevor as Ventimore opened the door I would rather be excused from giving an opinion Ah here is mister Ventimore himself Horace entered to find himself confronted by mister Wackerbath whose face was purple and whose white whiskers were bristling with rage So sir he began So sir and choked ignominiously There appears to have been some misunderstanding my dear Ventimore explained Beevor with a studious correctness which was only a shade less offensive than open triumph I think I d better leave you and this gentleman to talk it over quietly Quietly exclaimed mister Wackerbath with an apoplectic snort quietly I ve no idea what you are so excited about sir said Horace Perhaps you will explain Explain mister Wackerbath gasped why no if I speak just now I shall be ill you tell him he added waving a plump hand in Beevor s direction I m not in possession of all the facts said Beevor smoothly but so far as I can gather this gentleman thinks that considering the importance of the work he intrusted to your hands you have given less time to it than he might have expected As I have told him that is a matter which does not concern me and which he must discuss with you So saying Beevor retired to his own room and shut the door with the same irreproachable discretion which conveyed that he was not in the least surprised but was too much of a gentleman to show it Well mister Wackerbath began Horace when they were alone so you re disappointed with the house Disappointed said mister Wackerbath furiously I am disgusted sir disgusted Horace s heart sank lower still had he deceived himself after all then Had he been nothing but a conceited fool and most galling thought of all had Beevor judged him only too accurately And yet no he could not believe it he knew his work was good This is plain speaking with a vengeance he said I m sorry you re dissatisfied I did my best to carry out your instructions Oh you did sputtered mister Wackerbath That s what you call but go on sir go on I got it done as quickly as possible continued Horace because I understood you wished no time to be lost No one can accuse you of dawdling over it What I should like to know is how the devil you managed to get it done in the time I worked incessantly all day and every day said Horace That s how I managed it and this is all the thanks I get for it Thanks mister Wackerbath well nigh howled You you insolent young charlatan you expect thanks Now look here mister Wackerbath said Horace whose own temper was getting a little frayed I m not accustomed to being treated like this and I don t intend to submit to it Just tell me in as moderate language as you can command what you object to I object to the whole damned thing sir I mean I repudiate the entire concern It s the work of a raving lunatic a place that no English gentleman sir with any self respect or ah consideration for his reputation and position in the county could consent to occupy for a single hour Oh said Horace feeling deathly sick in that case it is useless of course to suggest any modifications Absolutely said mister Wackerbath Very well then there s no more to be said replied Horace You will have no difficulty in finding an architect who will be more successful in realising your intentions mister Beevor the gentleman you met just now he added with a touch of bitterness would probably be just your man Of course I retire altogether And really if any one is the sufferer over this I fancy it s myself I can t see how you are any the worse Not any the worse cried mister Wackerbath when the infernal place is built Built echoed Horace feebly I tell you sir I saw it with my own eyes driving to the station this morning my coachman and footman saw it my wife saw it damn it sir we all saw it Then Horace understood His indefatigable Jinnee had been at work again Of course for Fakrash it must have been what he would term the easiest of affairs especially after a glance at the plans and Ventimore remembered that the Jinnee had surprised him at work upon them and even requested to have them explained to him to dispense with contractors and bricklayers and carpenters and construct the entire building in the course of a single night It was a generous and spirited action but particularly now that the original designs had been found faulty and rejected it placed the unfortunate architect in a most invidious position Well sir said mister Wackerbath with elaborate irony I presume it is you whom I have to thank for improving my land by erecting this precious palace on it I I began Horace utterly broken down and then he saw with emotions that may be imagined the Jinnee himself in his green robes standing immediately behind mister Wackerbath Greeting to you said Fakrash coming forward with his smile of amiable cunning If I mistake not he added addressing the startled estate agent who had jumped visibly thou art the merchant for whom my son here and he laid a hand on Horace s shrinking shoulder undertook to construct a mansion I am said mister Wackerbath in some mystification Have I the pleasure of addressing mister Ventimore senior No no put in Horace no relation He s a sort of informal partner Hast thou not found him an architect of divine gifts inquired the Jinnee beaming with pride Is not the palace that he hath raised for thee by his transcendent accomplishments a marvel of beauty and stateliness and one that Sultans might envy No sir shouted the infuriated mister Wackerbath since you ask my opinion it s nothing of the sort It s a ridiculous tom fool cross between the palm house at Kew and the Brighton Pavilion There s no billiard room and not a decent bedroom in the house I ve been all over it so I ought to know and as for drainage there isn t a sign of it And he has the brass ah I should say the unblushing effrontery to call that a country house Horace s dismay was curiously shot with relief The Jinnee who was certainly very far from being a genius except by courtesy had taken it upon himself to erect the palace according to his own notions of Arabian domestic luxury and Horace taught by bitter experience could sympathise to some extent with his unfortunate client On the other hand it was balm to his smarting self respect to find that it was not his own plans after all which had been found so preposterous and by some obscure mental process which I do not propose to explain he became reconciled and almost grateful to the officious Fakrash And then too he was his Jinnee and Horace had no intention of letting him be bullied by an outsider Let me explain mister Wackerbath he said Personally I ve had nothing to do with this This gentleman wishing to spare me the trouble has taken upon himself to build your house for you without consulting either of us and from what I know of his powers in the direction I ve no doubt that that it s a devilish fine place in its way Anyhow we make no charge for it he presents it to you as a free gift Why not accept it as such and make the best of it Make the best of it stormed mister Wackerbath Stand by and see the best site in three counties defaced by a jimcrack Moorish nightmare like that Why they ll call it Wackerbath s Folly sir I shall be the laughing stock of the neighbourhood I can t live in the beastly building I couldn t afford to keep it up and I won t have it cumbering my land Do you hear I won t I ll go to law cost me what it may and compel you and your Arabian friends there to pull the thing down I ll take the case up to the House of Lords if necessary and fight you as long as I can stand As long as thou canst stand repeated Fakrash gently That is a long time truly O thou litigious one On all fours ungrateful dog that thou art he cried with an abrupt and entire change of manner and crawl henceforth for the remainder of thy days I Fakrash el Aamash command thee It was both painful and grotesque to see the portly and intensely respectable mister Wackerbath suddenly drop forward on his hands while desperately striving to preserve his dignity How dare you sir he almost barked how dare you I say Are you aware that I could summon you for this Let me up I insist upon getting up O contemptible in aspect replied the Jinnee throwing open the door Begone to thy kennel I won t I can t whimpered the unhappy man How do you expect me me to cross Westminster Bridge on all fours What will the officials think at Waterloo where I have been known and respected for years How am I to face my family in in this position Do for mercy s sake let me get up Horace had been too shocked and startled to speak before but now humanity coupled with disgust for the Jinnee s high handed methods compelled him to interfere mister Fakrash he said this has gone far enough Unless you stop tormenting this unfortunate gentleman I ve done with you Never said Fakrash He hath dared to abuse my palace which is far too sumptuous a dwelling for such a son of a burnt dog as he Therefore I will make his abode to be in the dust for ever But I don t find fault yelped poor mister Wackerbath You you entirely misunderstood the the few comments I ventured to make It s a capital mansion handsome and yet homey too I ll never say another word against it I ll yes I ll live in it if only you ll let me up Do as he asks you said Horace to the Jinnee or I swear I ll never speak to you again Thou art the arbiter of this matter was the reply And if I yield it is at thy intercession and not his Rise then he said to the humiliated client depart and show us the breadth of thy shoulders It was this precise moment which Beevor who was probably unable to restrain his curiosity any longer chose to re enter the room Oh Ventimore he began did I leave my I beg your pardon I thought you were alone again Don t go sir said mister Wackerbath as he scrambled awkwardly to his feet his usually florid face mottled in grey and lilac I I should like you to know that after talking things quietly over with your friend mister Ventimore and his partner here I am thoroughly convinced that my objections were quite untenable I retract all I said The house is ah admirably planned most convenient roomy and ah unconventional The the entire freedom from all sanitary appliances is a particular recommendation In short I am more than satisfied Pray forget anything I may have said which might be taken to imply the contrary Gentlemen good afternoon He bowed himself past the Jinnee in a state of deference and apprehension and was heard stumbling down the staircase Horace hardly dared to meet Beevor s eyes which were fixed upon the green turbaned Jinnee as he stood apart in dreamy abstraction smiling placidly to himself I say Beevor said to Horace at last in an undertone you never told me you had gone into partnership He s not a regular partner whispered Ventimore he does odd things for me occasionally that s all He soon managed to smooth your client down remarked Beevor Yes said Horace he s an Oriental you see and he has a a very persuasive manner Would you like to be introduced If it s all the same to you replied Beevor still below his voice I d rather be excused To tell you the truth old fellow I don t altogether fancy the looks of him and it s my opinion he added that the less you have to do with him the better He strikes me as a wrong un old man No no said Horace eccentric that s all you don t understand him Receive news began the Jinnee after Beevor with suspicion and disapproval evident even on his back and shoulders had retreated to his own room Suleyman the son of Daood sleeps with his fathers I know retorted Horace whose nerves were unequal to much reference to Solomon just then So does Queen Anne I have not heard of her But art thou not astounded then by my tidings I have matters nearer home to think about said Horace dryly I must say mister Fakrash you have landed me in a pretty mess Explain thyself more fully for I comprehend thee not Why on earth Horace groaned couldn t you let me build that house my own way Did I not hear thee with my own ears lament thy inability to perform the task Thereupon I determined that no disgrace should fall upon thee by reason of such incompetence since I myself would erect a palace so splendid that it should cause thy name to live for ever And behold it is done It is said Horace And so am I I don t want to reproach you I quite feel that you have acted with the best intentions but oh hang it all can t you see that you ve absolutely wrecked my career as an architect That is a thing that cannot be returned the Jinnee seeing that thou hast all the credit The credit This is England not Arabia What credit can I gain from being supposed to be the architect of an Oriental pavilion which might be all very well for Haroun al Raschid but I can assure you is preposterous as a home for an average Briton Yet that overfed hound remarked the Jinnee expressed much gratification therewith Naturally after he had found that he could not give a candid opinion except on all fours A valuable testimonial that And how do you suppose I can take his money No mister Fakrash if I have to go on all fours myself for it I must say and I will say that you ve made a most frightful muddle of it Acquaint me with thy wishes said Fakrash a little abashed for thou knowest that I can refuse thee naught Then said Horace boldly couldn t you remove that palace dissipate it into space or something Verily said the Jinnee in an aggravated tone to do good acts unto such as thee is but wasted time for thou givest me no peace till they are undone This is the last time urged Horace I promise never to ask you for anything again Not for the first time hast thou made such a promise said Fakrash And save for the magnitude of thy service unto me I would not hearken to this caprice of thine nor wilt thou find me so indulgent on another occasion But for this once and he muttered some words and made a sweeping gesture with his right hand thy desire is granted unto thee Of the palace and all that is therein there remaineth no trace Another surprise for poor old Wackerbath thought Horace but a pleasant one this time My dear mister Fakrash he said aloud I really can t say how grateful I am to you And now I hate bothering you like this but if you could manage to look in on Professor Futvoye What cried the Jinnee yet another request Already Well you promised you d do that before you know said Horace For that matter remarked Fakrash I have already fulfilled my promise You have Horace exclaimed And does he believe now that it s all true about that bottle When I left him answered the Jinnee all his doubts were removed By Jove you are a trump cried Horace only too glad to be able to commend with sincerity And do you think if I went to him now I should find him the same as usual Nay said Fakrash with his weak and yet inscrutable smile that is more than I can promise thee But why asked Horace if he knows all There was the oddest expression in the Jinnee s furtive eyes a kind of elfin mischief combined with a sense of wrong doing like a naughty child whose palate is still reminiscent of illicit jam Because he replied with a sound between a giggle and a chuckle because in order to overcome his unbelief it was necessary to transform him into a one eyed mule of hideous appearance What cried Horace But whether to avoid thanks or explanations the Jinnee had disappeared with his customary abruptness Fakrash shouted Horace mister Fakrash Come back Do you hear I must speak to you There was no answer the Jinnee might be well on his way to Lake Chad or Jericho by that time he was certainly far enough from Great Cloister Street Horace sat down at his drawing table and his head buried in his hands tried to think out this latest complication Fakrash had transformed Professor Futvoye into a one eyed mule It would have seemed incredible almost unthinkable once but so many impossibilities had happened to Horace of late that one more made little or no strain upon his credulity What he felt chiefly was the new barrier that this event must raise between himself and Sylvia to do him justice the mere fact that the father of his fiancee was a mule did not lessen his ardour in the slightest Even if he had felt no personal responsibility for the calamity he loved Sylvia far too well to be deterred by it and few family cupboards are without a skeleton of some sort With courage and the determination to look only on the bright side of things almost any domestic drawback can be lived down But the real point as he instantly recognised was whether in the changed condition of circumstances Sylvia would consent to marry him Might she not after the experiences of that abominable dinner of his the night before connect him in some way with her poor father s transformation She might even suspect him of employing this means of compelling the Professor to renew their engagement and indeed Horace was by no means certain himself that the Jinnee might not have acted from some muddle headed motive of this kind It was likely enough that the Professor after learning the truth should have refused to allow his daughter to marry the protege of so dubious a patron and that Fakrash had then resorted to pressure In any case Ventimore knew Sylvia well enough to feel sure that pride would steel her heart against him so long as this obstacle remained It would be unseemly to set down here all that Horace said and thought of the person who had brought all this upon them but after some wild and futile raving he became calm enough to recognise that his proper place was by Sylvia s side Perhaps he ought to have told her at first and then she would have been less unprepared for this and yet how could he trouble her mind so long as he could cling to the hope that the Jinnee would cease to interfere But now he could be silent no longer naturally the prospect of calling at Cottesmore Gardens just then was anything but agreeable but he felt it would be cowardly to keep away Besides he could cheer them up he could bring with him a message of hope No doubt they believed that the Professor s transformation would be permanent a harrowing prospect for so united a family but fortunately Horace would be able to reassure them on this point Fakrash had always revoked his previous performances as soon as he could be brought to understand their fatuity and Ventimore would take good care that he revoked this Nevertheless it was with a sinking heart and an unsteady hand that he pulled the visitors bell at the Futvoyes house that afternoon for he neither knew in what state he should find that afflicted family nor how they would regard his intrusion at such a time CHAPTER XII THE MESSENGER OF HOPE Jessie the neat and pretty parlour maid opened the door with a smile of welcome which Horace found reassuring No girl he thought whose master had suddenly been transformed into a mule could possibly smile like that The Professor she told him was not at home which again was comforting For a savant however careless about his personal appearance would scarcely venture to brave public opinion in the semblance of a quadruped Is the Professor out he inquired to make sure Not exactly out sir said the maid but particularly engaged working hard in his study and not to be disturbed on no account This was encouraging too since a mule could hardly engage in literary labour of any kind Evidently the Jinnee must either have overrated his supernatural powers or else have been deliberately amusing himself at Horace s expense Then I will see Miss Futvoye he said Miss Sylvia is with the master sir said the girl but if you ll come into the drawing room I ll let missus Futvoye know you are here He had not been in the drawing room long before missus Futvoye appeared and one glance at her face confirmed Ventimore s worst fears Outwardly she was calm enough but it was only too obvious that her calmness was the result of severe self repression her eyes usually so shrewdly and placidly observant had a haggard and hunted look her ears seemed on the strain to catch some distant sound I hardly thought we should see you to day she began in a tone of studied reserve but perhaps you came to offer some explanation of the extraordinary manner in which you thought fit to entertain us last night If so The fact is said Horace looking into his hat I came because I was rather anxious about the Professor About my husband said the poor lady with a really heroic effort to appear surprised He is as well as could be expected Why should you suppose otherwise she asked with a flash of suspicion I fancied perhaps that that he mightn t be quite himself to day said Horace with his eyes on the carpet I see said missus Futvoye regaining her composure you were afraid that all those foreign dishes might not have agreed with him But except that he is a little irritable this afternoon he is much as usual I m delighted to hear it said Horace with reviving hope Do you think he would see me for a moment Great heavens no cried missus Futvoye with an irrepressible start I mean she explained that after what took place last night Anthony my husband very properly feels that an interview would be too painful But when we parted he was perfectly friendly I can only say replied the courageous woman that you would find him considerably altered now Horace had no difficulty in believing it At least I may see Sylvia he pleaded No said missus Futvoye I really can t have Sylvia disturbed just now She is very busy helping her father Anthony has to read a paper at one of his societies to morrow night and she is writing it out from his dictation If any departure from strict truth can ever be excusable this surely was one unfortunately just then Sylvia herself burst into the room Mother she cried without seeing Horace in her agitation do come to papa quick He has just begun kicking again and I can t manage him alone Oh you here she broke off as she saw who was in the room Why do you come here now Horace Please please go away Papa is rather unwell nothing serious only oh do go away Darling said Horace going to her and taking both her hands I know all do you understand all Mamma cried Sylvia reproachfully have you told him already When we settled that even Horace wasn t to know till till papa recovers I have told him nothing my dear replied her mother He can t possibly know unless but no that isn t possible And after all she added with a warning glance at her daughter I don t know why we should make any mystery about a mere attack of gout But I had better go and see if your father wants anything And she hurried out of the room Sylvia sat down and gazed silently into the fire I dare say you don t know how dreadfully people kick when they ve got gout she remarked presently Oh yes I do said Horace sympathetically at least I can guess Especially when it s in both legs continued Sylvia Or said Horace gently in all four Ah you do know cried Sylvia Then it s all the more horrid of you to come Dearest said Horace is not this just the time when my place should be near you and him Not near papa Horace she put in anxiously it wouldn t be at all safe Do you really think I have any fear for myself Are you sure you quite know what he is like now I understand said Horace trying to put it as considerately as possible that a casual observer who didn t know your father might mistake him at first sight for for some sort of quadruped He s a mule sobbed Sylvia breaking down entirely I could bear it better if he had been a nice mule B but he isn t Whatever he may be declared Horace as he knelt by her chair endeavouring to comfort her nothing can alter my profound respect for him And you must let me see him Sylvia because I fully believe I shall be able to cheer him up If you imagine you can persuade him to to laugh it off said Sylvia tearfully I wasn t proposing to try to make him see the humorous side of his situation Horace mildly explained I trust I have more tact than that But he may be glad to know that at the worst it is only a temporary inconvenience I ll take care that he s all right again before very long She started up and looked at him her eyes widened with dawning dread and mistrust If you can speak like that she said it must have been you who no I can t believe it that would be too horrible I who did what Sylvia Weren t you there when when it happened No she replied I was only told of it afterwards Mother heard papa talking loudly in his study this morning as if he was angry with somebody and at last she grew so uneasy she couldn t bear it any longer and went in to see what was the matter with him Dad was quite alone and looked as usual only a little excited and then without the slightest warning just as she entered the room he he changed slowly into a mule before her eyes Anybody but mamma would have lost her head and roused the whole house Thank Heaven she didn t said Horace fervently That was what I was most afraid of Then oh Horace it was you It s no use denying it I feel more certain of it every moment Now Sylvia he protested still anxious if possible to keep the worst from her what could have put such an idea as that into your head I don t know she said slowly Several things last night No one who was really nice and like everybody else would live in such queer rooms like those and dine on cushions with dreadful black slaves and and dancing girls and things You pretended you were quite poor So I am darling And as for my rooms and and the rest they re all gone Sylvia If you went to Vincent Square to day you wouldn t find a trace of them That only shows said Sylvia But why should you play such a cruel and and ungentlemanly trick on poor dad If you had ever really loved me But I do Sylvia you can t really believe me capable of such an outrage Look at me and tell me so No Horace said Sylvia frankly I don t believe you did it But I believe you know who did And you had better tell me at once If you re quite sure you can stand it he replied I ll tell you everything And as briefly as possible he told her how he had unsealed the brass bottle and all that had come of it She bore it on the whole better than he had expected perhaps being a woman it was some consolation to her to remind him that she had foretold something of this kind from the very first But of course I never really thought it would be so awful as this she said Horace how could you be so careless as to let a great wicked thing like that escape out of its bottle I had a notion it was a manuscript said Horace till he came out But he isn t a great wicked thing Sylvia He s an amiable old Jinnee enough And he d do anything for me Nobody could be more grateful and generous than he has been Do you call it generous to change the poor dear dad into a mule inquired Sylvia with a little curl of her upper lip That was an oversight said Horace he meant no harm by it In Arabia they do these things or used to in his day Not that that s much excuse for him Still he s not so young as he was and besides being bottled up for all those centuries must have narrowed him rather You must try and make allowances for him darling I shan t said Sylvia unless he apologises to poor father and puts him right at once Why of course he ll do that Horace answered confidently I ll see that he does I don t mean to stand any more of his nonsense I m afraid I ve been just a little too slack for fear of hurting his feelings but this time he s gone too far and I shall talk to him like a Dutch uncle He s always ready to do the right thing when he s once shown where he has gone wrong only he takes such a lot of showing poor old chap But when do you think he ll do the right thing Oh as soon as I see him again Yes but when will you see him again That s more than I can say He s away just now in China or Peru or somewhere Horace Then he won t be back for months and months Oh yes he will He can do the whole trip aller et retour you know in a few hours He s an active old beggar for his age In the meantime dearest the chief thing is to keep up your father s spirits So I think I d better I was just telling Sylvia missus Futvoye he said as that lady re entered the room that I should like to see the Professor at once It s quite quite impossible was the nervous reply He s in such a state that he s unable to see any one You don t know how fractious gout makes him Dear missus Futvoye said Horace believe me I know more than you suppose Yes mother dear put in Sylvia he knows everything really everything And perhaps it might do dad good to see him missus Futvoye sank helplessly down on a settee Oh dear me she said I don t know what to say I really don t If you had seen him plunge at the mere suggestion of a doctor Privately though naturally he could not say so Horace thought a vet might be more appropriate but eventually he persuaded missus Futvoye to conduct him to her husband s study Anthony love she said as she knocked gently at the door I ve brought Horace Ventimore to see you for a few moments if he may It seemed from the sounds of furious snorting and stamping within that the Professor resented this intrusion on his privacy My dear Anthony said his devoted wife as she unlocked the door and turned the key on the inside after admitting Horace try to be calm Think of the servants downstairs Horace is so anxious to help As for Ventimore he was speechless so inexpressibly shocked was he by the alteration in the Professor s appearance He had never seen a mule in sorrier condition or in so vicious a temper Most of the lighter furniture had been already reduced to matchwood the glass doors of the bookcase were starred or shivered precious Egyptian pottery and glass were strewn in fragments on the carpets and even the mummy though it still smiled with the same enigmatic cheerfulness seemed to have suffered severely from the Professorial hoofs Horace instinctively felt that any words of conventional sympathy would jar here indeed the Professor s attitude and expression reminded him irresistibly of a certain Blondin Donkey he had seen enacted by music hall artists at the point where it becomes sullen and defiant Only he had laughed helplessly at the Blondin Donkey and somehow he felt no inclination to laugh now Believe me sir he began I would not disturb you like this unless steady there for Heaven s sake Professor don t kick till you ve heard me out For the mule in a clumsy shambling way which betrayed the novice was slowly revolving on his own axis so as to bring his hind quarters into action while still keeping his only serviceable eye upon his unwelcome visitor Listen to me sir said Horace manoeuvring in his turn I m not to blame for this and if you brain me as you seem to be endeavouring to do you ll simply destroy the only living man who can get you out of this The mule appeared impressed by this and backed cumbrously into a corner from which he regarded Horace with a mistrustful but attentive eye If as I imagine sir continued Horace you are though temporarily deprived of speech perfectly capable of following an argument will you kindly signify it by raising your right ear The mule s right ear rose with a sharp twitch Now we can get on said Horace First let me tell you that I repudiate all responsibility for the proceedings of that infernal Jinnee I wouldn t stamp like that you might go through the floor you know Now if you will only exercise a little patience At this the exasperated animal made a sudden run at him with his mouth open which obliged Horace to shelter himself behind a large leather arm chair You really must keep cool sir he remonstrated your nerves are naturally upset If I might suggest a little champagne you could manage it in in a bucket and it would help you to pull yourself together A whisk of your er tail would imply consent The Professor s tail instantly swept some rare Arabian glass lamps and vases from a shelf at his rear whereupon missus Futvoye went out and returned presently with a bottle of champagne and a large china jardiniere as the best substitute she could find for a bucket When the mule had drained the flower pot greedily and appeared refreshed Horace proceeded I have every hope sir he said that before many hours you will be smiling pray don t prance like that I mean what I say smiling over what now seems to you very justly a most annoying and serious catastrophe I shall speak seriously to Fakrash the Jinnee you know and I am sure that as soon as he realises what a frightful blunder he has made he will be the first to offer you every reparation in his power For old foozle as he is he s thoroughly good hearted The Professor drooped his ears at this and shook his head with a doleful incredulity that made him look more like the Pantomime Donkey than ever I think I understand him fairly well by this time sir said Horace and I ll answer for it that there s no real harm in him I give you my word of honour that if you ll only remain quiet and leave everything to me you shall very soon be released from this absurd position That s all I came to tell you and now I won t trouble you any longer If you could bring yourself as a sign that you bear me no ill feeling to give me your your off foreleg at parting I But the Professor turned his back in so pointed and ominous a manner that Horace judged it better to withdraw without insisting further I m afraid he said to missus Futvoye after they had rejoined Sylvia in the drawing room I m afraid your husband is still a little sore with me about this miserable business I don t know what else you can expect replied the lady rather tartly he can t help feeling as we all must and do after what you said just now that but for you this would never have happened If you mean it was all through my attending that sale said Horace you might remember that I only went there at the Professor s request You know that Sylvia Yes Horace said Sylvia but papa never asked you to buy a hideous brass bottle with a nasty Genius in it And any one with ordinary common sense would have kept it properly corked What you against me too Sylvia cried Horace cut to the quick No Horace never against you I didn t mean to say what I did Only it is such a relief to put the blame on somebody I know I know you feel it almost as much as we do But so long as poor dear papa remains as he is we can never be anything to one another You must see that Horace Yes I see that he said but trust me Sylvia he shall not remain as he is I swear he shall not In another day or two at the outside you will see him his own self once more And then oh darling darling you won t let anything or anybody separate us Promise me that He would have held her in his arms but she kept him at a distance When papa is himself again she said I shall know better what to say I can t promise anything now Horace Horace recognised that no appeal would draw a more definite answer from her just then so he took his leave with the feeling that after all matters must improve before very long and in the meantime he must bear the suspense with patience He got through dinner as well as he could in his own rooms for he did not like to go to his club lest the Jinnee should suddenly return during his absence If he wants me he d be quite equal to coming on to the club after me he reflected for he has about as much sense of the fitness of things as Mary s lamb I shouldn t care about seeing him suddenly bursting through the floor of the smoking room Nor would the committee He sat up late in the hope that Fakrash would appear but the Jinnee made no sign and Horace began to get uneasy I wish there was some way of ringing him up he thought If he were only the slave of a ring or a lamp I d rub it but it wouldn t be any use to rub that bottle and besides he isn t a slave Probably he has a suspicion that he has not exactly distinguished himself over his latest feat and thinks it prudent to keep out of my way for the present But if he fancies he ll make things any better for himself by that he ll find himself mistaken It was maddening to think of the unhappy Professor still fretting away hour after hour in the uncongenial form of a mule waiting impatiently for the relief that never came If it lingered much longer he might actually starve unless his family thought of getting in some oats for him and he could be prevailed upon to touch them And how much longer could they succeed in concealing the nature of his affliction How long before all Kensington and the whole civilised world would know that one of the leading Orientalists in Europe was restlessly prancing on four legs around his study in Cottesmore Gardens Racked by speculations such as these Ventimore lay awake till well into the small hours when he dropped off into troubled dreams that wild as they were could not be more grotesquely fantastic than the realities to which they were the alternative CHAPTER XIII A CHOICE OF EVILS Not even his morning tub could brace Ventimore s spirits to their usual cheerfulness After sending away his breakfast almost untasted he stood at his window looking drearily out over the crude green turf of Vincent Square at the indigo masses of the Abbey and the Victoria Tower and the huge gasometers to the right which loomed faintly through a dun coloured haze He felt a positive loathing for his office to which he had gone with such high hopes and enthusiasm of late There was no work for him to do there any longer and the sight of his drawing table and materials would he knew be intolerable in their mute mockery Nor could he with any decency present himself again at Cottesmore Gardens while the situation still remained unchanged as it must do until he had seen Fakrash When would the Jinnee return or horrible suspicion did he never intend to return at all Fakrash he groaned aloud you can t really mean to leave me in such a regular deuce of a hole as this At thy service said a well known voice behind him and he turned to see the Jinnee standing smiling on the hearthrug and at this accomplishment of his dearest desire all his indignation surged back Oh there you are he said irritably Where on earth have you been all this time Nowhere on earth was the bland reply but in the regions of the air seeking to promote thy welfare If you have been as brilliantly successful up there as you have down here retorted Horace I have much to thank you for I am more than repaid answered the Jinnee who like many highly estimable persons was almost impervious to irony by such assurances of thy gratitude I m not grateful said Horace fuming I m devilish annoyed Well hath it been written replied the Jinnee Be disregardful of thine affairs and commit them to the course of Fate For often a thing that enrages thee may eventually be to thee pleasing I don t see the remotest chance of that in my case said Horace Why is thy countenance thus troubled and what new complaint hast thou against me What the devil do you mean by turning a distinguished and perfectly inoffensive scholar into a wall eyed mule Horace broke out If that is your idea of a practical joke It is one of the easiest affairs possible said the Jinnee complacently running his fingers through the thin strands of his beard I have accomplished such transformations on several occasions Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself that s all The question is now how do you propose to restore him again Far from undoing be that which is accomplished was the sententious answer What cried Horace hardly believing his ears you surely don t mean to allow that unhappy Professor to remain like that for ever do you None can alter what is predestined Very likely not But it wasn t decreed that a learned man should be suddenly degraded to a beastly mule for the rest of his life Destiny wouldn t be such a fool Despise not mules for they are useful and valuable animals in the household But confound it all have you no imagination Can t you enter at all into the feelings of a man a man of wide learning and reputation suddenly plunged into such a humiliating condition Upon his own head be it said Fakrash coldly For he hath brought this fate upon himself Well how do you suppose that you have helped me by this performance Will it make him any the more disposed to consent to my marrying his daughter Is that all you know of the world It is not my intention that thou shouldst take his daughter to wife Whether you approve or not it s my intention to marry her Assuredly she will not marry thee so long as her father remaineth a mule There I agree with you But is that your notion of doing me a good turn I did not consider thy interest in this matter Then will you be good enough to consider it now I have pledged my word that he shall be restored to his original form Not only my happiness is at stake but my honour By failure to perform the impossible none can lose honour And this is a thing that cannot be undone Cannot be undone repeated Horace feeling a cold clutch at his heart Why Because said the Jinnee sullenly I have forgotten the way Nonsense retorted Horace I don t believe it Why he urged descending to flattery you re such a clever old Johnny I beg your pardon I meant such a clever old Jinnee you can do anything if you only give your mind to it Just look at the way you changed this house back again to what it was Marvellous That was the veriest trifle said Fakrash though he was obviously pleased by this tribute to his talent this would be a different affair altogether But child s play to you insinuated Horace Come you know very well you can do it if you only choose It may be as thou sayest But I do not choose Then I think said Horace that considering the obligation you admit yourself you are under to me I have a right to know the reason the real reason why you refuse Thy claim is not without justice answered the Jinnee after a pause nor can I decline to gratify thee That s right cried Horace I knew you d see it in the proper light when it was once put to you Now don t lose any more time but restore that unfortunate man at once as you ve promised Not so said the Jinnee I promised thee a reason for my refusal and that thou shalt have Know then O my son that this indiscreet one had by some vile and unhallowed arts divined the hidden meaning of what was written upon the seal of the bottle wherein I was confined and was preparing to reveal the same unto all men What would it matter to you if he did Much for the writing contained a false and lying record of my actions If it is all lies it can t do you any harm Why not treat them with the contempt they deserve They are not all lies the Jinnee admitted reluctantly Well never mind Whatever you ve done you ve expiated it by this time Now that Suleyman is no more it is my desire to seek out my kinsmen of the Green Jinn and live out my days in amity and honour How can that be if they hear my name execrated by all mortals Nobody would think of execrating you about an affair three thousand years old It s too stale a scandal Thou speakest without understanding I tell thee that if men knew but the half of my misdoings said Fakrash in a tone not altogether free from a kind of sombre complacency the noise of them would rise even unto the uppermost regions and scorn and loathing would be my portion Oh it s not so bad as all that said Horace who had a private impression that the Jinnee s past would probably turn out to be chiefly made up of peccadilloes But anyway I m sure the Professor will readily agree to keep silence about it and as you have of course got the seal in your own possession again Nay the seal is still in his possession and it is naught to me where it is deposited said Fakrash since the only mortal who hath deciphered it is now a dumb animal Not at all said Horace There are several friends of his who could decipher that inscription quite as easily as he did Is this the truth said the Jinnee in visible alarm Certainly said Horace Within the last quarter of a century archaeology has made great strides Our learned men can now read Babylonian bricks and Chaldean tablets as easily as if they were advertisements on galvanised iron You may think you ve been extremely clever in turning the Professor into an animal but you ll probably find you ve only made another mistake How so inquired Fakrash Well said Horace seeing his advantage and pushing it unscrupulously now that in your infinite wisdom you have ordained that he should be a mule he naturally can t possess property Therefore all his effects will have to be sold and amongst them will be that seal of yours which like many other things in his collection will probably be bought up by the British Museum where it will be examined and commented upon by every Orientalist in Europe I suppose you ve thought of all that O young man of marvellous sagacity said the Jinnee truly I had omitted to consider these things and thou hast opened my eyes in time For I will present myself unto this man mule and adjure him to reveal where he hath bestowed this seal so that I may regain it He can t do that you know so long as he remains a mule I will endow him with speech for the purpose Let me tell you this said Horace he s in a very nasty temper just now naturally enough and you won t get anything out of him until you have restored him to human form If you do that he ll agree to anything Whether I restore him or not will depend not on me but on the damsel who is his daughter and to whom thou art contracted in marriage For first of all I must speak with her So long as I am present and you promise not to play any tricks said Horace I ve no objection for I believe if you once saw her and heard her plead for her poor father you wouldn t have the heart to hold out any longer But you must give me your word that you ll behave yourself Thou hast it said the Jinnee I do but desire to see her on thine account Very well agreed Horace but I really can t introduce you in that turban she d be terrified Couldn t you contrive to get yourself up in commonplace English clothes just for once something that wouldn t attract so much attention Will this satisfy thee inquired the Jinnee as his green turban and flowing robes suddenly resolved themselves into the conventional chimney pot hat frock coat and trousers of modern civilisation He bore a painful resemblance in them to the kind of elderly gentleman who comes on in the harlequinade to be bonneted by the clown but Horace was in no mood to be critical just then That s better he said encouragingly much better Now he added as he led the way to the hall and put on his own hat and overcoat we ll go out and find a hansom and be at Kensington in less than twenty minutes We shall be there in less than twenty seconds said the Jinnee seizing him by the arm above the elbow and Horace found himself suddenly carried up into the air and set down gasping with surprise and want of breath on the pavement opposite the Futvoyes door I should just like to observe he said as soon as he could speak that if we ve been seen we shall probably cause a sensation Londoners are not accustomed to seeing people skimming over the chimney pots like amateur rooks Trouble not for that said Fakrash for no mortal eyes are capable of following our flight I hope not said Horace or I shall lose any reputation I have left I think he added I d better go in alone first and prepare them if you don t mind waiting outside I ll come to the window and wave my pocket handkerchief when they re ready And do come in by the door like an ordinary person and ask the maidservant if you may see me I will bear it in mind answered the Jinnee and suddenly sank or seemed to sink through a chink in the pavement Horace after ringing at the Futvoyes door was admitted and shown into the drawing room where Sylvia presently came to him looking as lovely as ever in spite of the pallor due to sleeplessness and anxiety It is kind of you to call and inquire she said with the unnatural calm of suppressed hysteria Dad is much the same this morning He had a fairly good night and was able to take part of a carrot for breakfast but I m afraid he has just remembered that he has to read a paper on Oriental Occultism before the Asiatic Society this evening and it s worrying him a little Oh Horace she broke out unexpectedly how perfectly awful all this is How are we to bear it Don t give way darling said Horace you will not have to bear it much longer It s all very well Horace but unless something is done soon it will be too late We can t go on keeping a mule in the study without the servants suspecting something and where are we to put poor dear papa It s too ghastly to think of his having to be sent away to to a Home of Rest for Horses and yet what is to be done with him Why do you come if you can t do anything I shouldn t be here unless I could bring you good news You remember what I told you about the Jinnee Remember cried Sylvia As if I could forget Has he really come back Horace Yes I think I have brought him to see that he has made a foolish mistake in enchanting your unfortunate father and he seems willing to undo it on certain conditions He is somewhere within call at this moment and will come in whenever I give the signal But he wishes to speak to you first To me Oh no Horace exclaimed Sylvia recoiling I d so much rather not I don t like things that have come out of brass bottles I shouldn t know what to say and it would frighten me horribly You must be brave darling said Horace Remember that it depends on you whether the Professor is to be restored or not And there s nothing alarming about old Fakrash either I ve got him to put on ordinary things and he really doesn t look so bad in them He s quite a mild amiable old noodle and he ll do anything for you if you ll only stroke him down the right way You will see him won t you for your father s sake If I must said Sylvia with a shudder I I ll be as nice to him as I can Horace went to the window and gave the signal though there was no one in sight However it was evidently seen for the next moment there was a resounding blow at the front door and a little later Jessie the parlour maid announced mister Fatrasher Larmash to see mister Ventimore and the Jinnee stalked gravely in with his tall hat on his head You are probably not aware of it sir said Horace but it is the custom here to uncover in the presence of a lady The Jinnee removed his hat with both hands and stood silent and impassive Let me present you to Miss Sylvia Futvoye Ventimore continued the lady whose name you have already heard There was a momentary gleam in Fakrash s odd slanting eyes as they lighted on Sylvia s shrinking figure but he made no acknowledgment of the introduction The damsel is not without comeliness he remarked to Horace but there are lovelier far than she I didn t ask you for either criticisms or comparisons said Ventimore sharply there is nobody in the world equal to Miss Futvoye in my opinion and you will be good enough to remember that fact She is exceedingly distressed as any dutiful daughter would be by the cruel and senseless trick you have played her father and she begs that you will rectify it at once Don t you Sylvia Yes indeed said Sylvia almost in a whisper if if it isn t troubling you too much I have been turning over thy words in my mind said Fakrash to Horace still ignoring Sylvia and I am convinced that thou art right Even if the contents of the seal were known of all men they would raise no clamour about affairs that concern them not Therefore it is nothing to me in whose hands the seal may be Dost thou not agree with me in this Of course I do said Horace And it naturally follows that It naturally follows as thou sayest said the Jinnee with a cunning assumption of indifference that I have naught to gain by demanding back the seal as the price of restoring this damsel s father to his original form Wherefore so far as I am concerned let him remain a mule for ever unless indeed thou art ready to comply with my conditions Conditions cried Horace utterly unprepared for this conclusion What can you possibly want from me But state them I ll agree to anything in reason I demand that thou shouldst renounce the hand of this damsel That s out of all reason said Horace and you know it I will never give her up so long as she is willing to keep me Maiden said the Jinnee addressing Sylvia for the first time the matter rests with thee Wilt thou release this my son from his contract since thou art no fit wife for such as he How can I cried Sylvia when I love him and he loves me What a wicked tyrannical old thing you must be to expect it I can t give him up It is but giving up what can never be thine said Fakrash And be not anxious for him for I will reward and console him a thousandfold for the loss of thy society A little while and he shall remember thee no more Don t believe him darling said Horace you know me better than that Remember said the Jinnee that by thy refusal thou wilt condemn thy parent to remain a mule throughout all his days Art thou so unnatural and hard hearted a daughter as to do this thing Oh I couldn t cried Sylvia I can t let poor father remain a mule all his life when one word and yet what am I to do Horace what shall I say Advise me Advise me Heaven help us both groaned Ventimore If I could only see the right thing to do Look here mister Fakrash he added this is a matter that requires consideration Will you relieve us of your presence for a short time while we talk it over With all my heart said the Jinnee in the most obliging manner in the world and vanished instantly Now darling began Horace after he had gone if that unspeakable old scoundrel is really in earnest there s no denying that he s got us in an extremely tight place But I can t bring myself to believe that he does mean it I fancy he s only trying us And what I want you to do is not to consider me in the matter at all How can I help it said poor Sylvia Horace you you don t want to be released do you I said Horace when you are all I have in the world That s so likely Sylvia But we are bound to look facts in the face To begin with even if this hadn t happened your people wouldn t let our engagement continue For my prospects have changed again dearest I m even worse off than when we first met for that confounded Jinnee has contrived to lose my first and only client for me the one thing worth having he ever gave me And he told her the story of the mushroom palace and mister Wackerbath s withdrawal So you see darling he concluded I haven t even a home to offer you and if I had it would be miserably uncomfortable for you with that old Marplot continually dropping in on us especially if as I m afraid he has he s taken some unreasonable dislike to you But surely you can talk him over said Sylvia you said you could do anything you liked with him I m beginning to find he replied ruefully enough that he s not so easily managed as I thought And for the present I m afraid if we are to get the Professor out of this that there s nothing for it but to humour old Fakrash Then you actually advise me to to break it off she cried I never thought you would do that For your own sake said Horace for your father s sake If you won t Sylvia I must And you will spare me that Let us both agree to part and and trust that we shall be united some day Don t try to deceive me or yourself Horace she said if we part now it will be for ever He had a dismal conviction that she was right We must hope for the best he said drearily Fakrash may have some motive in all this we don t understand Or he may relent But part we must for the present Very well she said If he restores dad I will give you up But not unless Hath the damsel decided asked the Jinnee suddenly re appearing for the period of deliberation is past Miss Futvoye and I Horace answered for her are willing to consider our engagement at an end until you approve of its renewal on condition that you restore her father at once Agreed said Fakrash Conduct me to him and we will arrange the matter without delay Outside they met missus Futvoye on her way from the study You here Horace she exclaimed And who is this gentleman This said Horace is the er author of the Professor s misfortunes and he had come here at my request to undo his work It would be so kind of him exclaimed the distressed lady who was by this time far beyond either surprise or resentment I m sure if he knew all we have gone through and she led the way to her husband s room As soon as the door was opened the Professor seemed to recognise his tormentor in spite of his changed raiment and was so powerfully agitated that he actually reeled on his four legs and stood over in a lamentable fashion O man of distinguished attainments began the Jinnee whom I have caused for reasons that are known unto thee to assume the shape of a mule speak I adjure thee and tell me where thou hast deposited the inscribed seal which is in thy possession The Professor spoke and the effect of articulate speech proceeding from the mouth of what was to all outward seeming an ordinary mule was strange beyond description I ll see you damned first he said sullenly You can t do worse to me than you ve done already As thou wilt said Fakrash but unless I regain it I will not restore thee to what thou wast Well then said the mule savagely you ll find it in the top right hand drawer of my writing table the key is in that diorite bowl on the mantelpiece The Jinnee unlocked the drawer and took out the metal cap which he placed in the breast pocket of his incongruous frock coat So far well he said next thou must deliver up to me the transcription thou hast made and swear to preserve an inviolable secrecy regarding the meaning thereof Do you know what you re asking sir said the mule laying back his ears viciously Do you think that to oblige you I m going to suppress one of the most remarkable discoveries of my whole scientific career Never sir never Since if thou refusest I shall assuredly deprive thee of speech once more and leave thee a mule as thou art now of hideous appearance said the Jinnee thou art like to gain little by a discovery which thou wilt be unable to impart However the choice rests with thee The mule rolled his one eye and showed all his teeth in a vicious snarl You ve got the whip hand of me he said and I may as well give in There s a transcript inside my blotting case it s the only copy I ve made Fakrash found the paper which he rubbed into invisibility between his palms as any ordinary conjurer might do Now raise thy right forefoot he said and swear by all thou holdest sacred never to divulge what thou hast learnt which oath the Professor in the vilest of tempers took clumsily enough Good said the Jinnee with a grim smile Now let one of thy women bring me a cup of fair water Sylvia went out and came back with a cup of water It s filtered she said anxiously I don t know if that will do It will suffice said Fakrash Let both the women withdraw Surely remonstrated missus Futvoye you don t mean to turn his wife and daughter out of the room at such a moment as this We shall be perfectly quiet and we may even be of some help Do as you re told my dear snapped the ungrateful mule do as you re told You ll only be in the way here Do you suppose he doesn t know his own beastly business They left accordingly whereupon Fakrash took the cup an ordinary breakfast cup with a Greek key border pattern in pale blue round the top and drenching the mule with the contents exclaimed Quit this form and return to the form in which thou wast For a dreadful moment or two it seemed as if no effect was to be produced the animal simply stood and shivered and Ventimore began to feel an agonising suspicion that the Jinnee really had as he had first asserted forgotten how to perform this particular incantation All at once the mule reared and began to beat the air frantically with his fore hoofs after which he fell heavily backward into the nearest armchair which was fortunately a solid and capacious piece of furniture with his fore legs hanging limply at his side in a semi human fashion There was a brief convulsion and then by some gradual process unspeakably impressive to witness the man seemed to break through the mule the mule became merged in the man and Professor Futvoye restored to his own natural form and habit sat gasping and trembling in the chair before them CHAPTER XIV SINCE THERE S NO HELP COME LET US KISS AND PART As soon as the Professor seemed to have regained his faculties Horace opened the door and called in Sylvia and her mother who were as was only to be expected overcome with joy on seeing the head of the family released from his ignoble condition of a singularly ill favoured quadruped There there said the Professor as he submitted to their embraces and incoherent congratulations it s nothing to make a fuss about I m quite myself again as you can see And he added with an unreasonable outburst of ill temper if one of you had only had the common sense to think of such a simple remedy as sprinkling a little cold water over me when I was first taken like that I should have been spared a great deal of unnecessary inconvenience But that s always the way with women lose their heads the moment anything goes wrong If I had not kept perfectly cool myself It was very very stupid of us not to think of it papa said Sylvia tactfully ignoring the fact that there was scarcely an undamaged article in the room still you know if we had thrown the water it mightn t have had the same effect I m not in a condition to argue now said her father you didn t trouble to try it and there s no more to be said No more to be said exclaimed Fakrash O thou monster of ingratitude hast thou no thanks for him who hath delivered thee from thy predicament As I am already indebted to you sir said the Professor for about twenty four hours of the most poignant and humiliating mental and bodily anguish a human being can endure inflicted for no valid reason that I can discover except the wanton indulgence of your unholy powers I can only say that any gratitude of which I am conscious is of a very qualified description As for you Ventimore he added turning to Horace I don t know I can only guess at the part you have played in this wretched business but in any case you will understand once for all that all relations between us must cease Papa said Sylvia tremulously Horace and I have already agreed that that we must separate At my bidding explained Fakrash suavely for such an alliance would be totally unworthy of his merits and condition This frankness was rather too much for the Professor whose temper had not been improved by his recent trials Nobody asked for your opinion sir he snapped A person who has only recently been released from a term of long and from all I have been able to ascertain well deserved imprisonment is scarcely entitled to pose as an authority on social rank Have the decency not to interfere again with my domestic affairs Excellent is the saying remarked the imperturbable Jinnee Let the rat that is between the paws of the leopard observe rigidly all the rules of politeness and refrain from words of provocation For to return thee to the form of a mule once more would be no difficult undertaking I think I failed to make myself clear the Professor hastened to observe failed to make myself clear I I merely meant to congratulate you on your fortunate escape from the consequences of what I I don t doubt was an error of justice I I am sure that in the future you will employ your your very remarkable abilities to better purpose and I would suggest that the greatest service you can do this unfortunate young man here is to abstain from any further attempts to promote his interests Hear hear Horace could not help throwing in though in so discreet an undertone that it was inaudible Far be this from me replied Fakrash For he has become unto me even as a favourite son whom I design to place upon the golden pinnacle of felicity Therefore I have chosen for him a wife who is unto this damsel of thine as the full moon to the glow worm and as the bird of Paradise to an unfledged sparrow And the nuptials shall be celebrated before many hours Horace cried Sylvia justly incensed why why didn t you tell me this before Because said the unhappy Horace this is the very first I ve heard of it He s always springing some fresh surprise on me he added in a whisper but they never come to anything much And he can t marry me against my will you know No said Sylvia biting her lip I never supposed he could do that Horace I ll settle this at once he replied Now look here mister Jinnee he added I don t know what new scheme you have got in your head but if you are proposing to marry me to anybody in particular Have I not informed thee that I have it in contemplation to obtain for thee the hand of a King s daughter of marvellous beauty and accomplishments You know perfectly well you never mentioned it before said Horace while Sylvia gave a little low cry Repine not O damsel counselled the Jinnee since it is for his welfare For though as yet he believeth it not when he beholds the resplendent beauty of her countenance he will swoon away with delight and forget thy very existence I shall do nothing of the sort said Horace savagely Just understand that I don t intend to marry any Princess You may prevent me in fact you have from marrying this lady but you can t force me to marry anybody else I defy you When thou hast seen thy bride s perfections thou wilt need no compulsion said Fakrash And if thou shouldst refuse know this that thou wilt be exposing those who are dear to thee in this household to calamities of the most unfortunate description The awful vagueness of this threat completely crushed Horace he could not think he did not even dare to imagine what consequences he might bring upon his beloved Sylvia and her helpless parents by persisting in his refusal Give me time he said heavily I want to talk this over with you Pardon me Ventimore said the Professor with acidulous politeness but interesting as the discussion of your matrimonial arrangements is to you and your a protector I should greatly prefer that you choose some more fitting place for arriving at a decision which is in the circumstances a foregone conclusion I am rather tired and upset and I should be obliged if you and this gentleman could bring this most trying interview to a close as soon as you conveniently can You hear mister Fakrash said Horace between his teeth it is quite time we left If you go at once I will follow you very shortly Thou wilt find me awaiting thee answered the Jinnee and to missus Futvoye s and Sylvia s alarm disappeared through one of the bookcases Well said Horace gloomily you see how I m situated That obstinate old devil has cornered me I m done for Don t say that said the Professor you appear to be on the eve of a most brilliant alliance in which I am sure you have our best wishes the best wishes of us all he added pointedly Sylvia said Horace still lingering before I go tell me that whatever I may have to do you will understand that that it will be for your sake Please don t talk like that she said We may never see one another again Don t let my last recollection of you be of of a hypocrite Horace A hypocrite he cried Sylvia this is too much What have I said or done to make you think me that Oh I am not so simple as you suppose Horace she replied I see now why all this has happened why poor dad was tormented why you insisted on my setting you free But I would have released you without that Indeed all this elaborate artifice wasn t in the least necessary You believe I was an accomplice in that old fool s plot he said You believe me such a cur as that I don t blame you she said I don t believe you could help yourself He can make you do whatever he chooses And then you are so rich now it is natural that you should want to marry some one some one more suited to you like this lovely Princess of yours Of mine groaned the exasperated Horace When I tell you I ve never even seen her As if any Princess in the world would marry me to please a Jinnee out of a brass bottle And if she did Sylvia you can t believe that any Princess would make me forget you It depends so very much on the Princess was all Sylvia could be induced to say Well said Horace if that s all the faith you have in me I suppose it s useless to say any more Good bye missus Futvoye good bye Professor I wish I could tell you how deeply I regret all the trouble I have brought on you by my own folly All I can say is that I will bear anything in future rather than expose you or any of you to the smallest risk I trust indeed said the Professor stiffly that you will use all the influence at your command to secure me from any repetition of an experience that might well have unmanned a less equable temperament than my own Good bye Horace said missus Futvoye more kindly I believe you are more to be pitied than blamed whatever others may think And I don t forget if Anthony does that but for you he might instead of sitting there comfortably in his armchair be lashing out with his hind legs and kicking everything to pieces at this very moment I deny that I lashed out said the Professor My a hind quarters may have been under imperfect control but I never lost my reasoning powers or my good humour for a single instant I can say that truthfully If the Professor could say that truthfully amidst the general wreck in which he sat like another Marius he had little to learn in the gentle art of self deception but there was nothing to gain by contradicting him then Good bye Sylvia said Horace and held out his hand Good bye she said without offering to take it or look at him and after a miserable pause he left the study But before he had reached the front door he heard a swish and swirl of drapery behind him and felt her light hand on his arm Ah no she said clinging to him I can t let you go like this I didn t mean all the things I said just now I do believe in you Horace at least I ll try hard to And I shall always always love you Horace I shan t care very much even if you do forget me so long as you are happy Only don t be too happy Think of me sometimes I shall not be too happy he said as he held her close to his heart and kissed her pathetically drawn mouth and flushed cheeks And I shall think of you always And you won t fall in love with your Princess entreated Sylvia at the end of her altruism Promise If I am ever provided with one he replied I shall loathe her for not being you But don t let us lose heart darling There must be some way of talking that old idiot out of this nonsense and bringing him round to common sense I m not going to give in just yet These were brave words but as they both felt the situation had little enough to warrant them and after one last long embrace they parted and he was no sooner on the steps than he felt himself caught up as before and borne through the air with breathless speed till he was set down he could not have well said how in a chair in his own sitting room at Vincent Square Well he said looking at the Jinnee who was standing opposite with a smile of intolerable complacency I suppose you feel satisfied with yourself over this business It hath indeed been brought to a favourable conclusion said Fakrash Well hath the poet written I don t think I can stand any more Elegant Extracts this afternoon interrupted Horace Let us come to business You seem he went on with a strong effort to keep himself in hand to have formed some plan for marrying me to a King s daughter May I ask you for full particulars No honour and advancement can be in excess of thy deserts answered the Jinnee Very kind of you to say so but you are probably unaware that as society is constituted at the present time the objections to such an alliance would be quite insuperable For me said the Jinnee few obstacles are insuperable But speak thy mind freely I will said Horace To begin with no European Princess of the Blood Royal would entertain the idea for a moment And if she did she would forfeit her rank and cease to be a Princess and I should probably be imprisoned in a fortress for lese majeste or something Dismiss thy fears for I do not propose to unite thee to any Princess that is born of mortals The bride I intend for thee is a Jinneeyeh the peerless Bedeea el Jemal daughter of my kinsman Shahyal the Ruler of the Blue Jann Oh is she though said Horace blankly I m exceedingly obliged but whatever may be the lady s attractions Her nose recited the Jinnee with enthusiasm is like unto the keen edge of a polished sword her hair resembleth jewels and her cheeks are ruddy as wine She hath heavy lips and when she looketh aside she putteth to shame the wild cows My good excellent friend said Horace by no means impressed by this catalogue of charms one doesn t marry to mortify wild cows When she walketh with a vacillating gait continued Fakrash as though he had not been interrupted the willow branch itself turneth green with envy Personally said Horace a waddle doesn t strike me as particularly fascinating it s quite a matter of taste Do you happen to have seen this enchantress lately My eyes have not been refreshed by her manifold beauties since I was enclosed by Suleyman whose name be accursed in the brass bottle of which thou knowest Why dost thou ask Merely because it occurred to me that after very nearly three thousand years your charming kinswoman may well to put it as mildly as possible not have altogether escaped the usual effects of Time I mean she must be getting on you know O silly bearded one said the Jinnee in half scornful rebuke art thou then ignorant that we of the Jinn are not as mortals that we should feel the ravages of age Forgive me if I m personal said Horace but surely your own hair and beard might be described as rather inclining to grey Not from age said Fakrash This cometh from long confinement I see said Horace Like the Prisoner of Chillon Well assuming that the lady in question is still in the bloom of early youth I see one fatal difficulty to becoming her suitor Doubtless said the Jinnee thou art referring to Jarjarees the son of Rejmoos the son of Iblees No I wasn t said Horace because you see I don t remember having ever heard of him However he s another fatal difficulty That makes two of them Surely I have spoken of him to thee as my deadliest foe It is true that he is a powerful and vindictive Efreet who hath long persecuted the beauteous Bedeea with hateful attentions Yet it may be possible by good fortune to overthrow him Then I gather that any suitor for Bedeea s hand would be looked upon as a rival by the amiable Jarjarees Far is he from being of an amiable disposition answered the Jinnee simply and he would be so transported by rage and jealousy that he would certainly challenge thee to mortal combat Then that settles it said Horace I don t think any one can fairly call me a coward but I do draw the line at fighting an Efreet for the hand of a lady I ve never seen How do I know he ll fight fair He would probably appear unto thee first in the form of a lion and if he could not thus prevail against thee transform himself into a serpent and then into a buffalo or some other wild beast And I should have to tackle the entire menagerie said Horace Why my dear sir I should never get beyond the lion I would assist thee to assume similar transformations said the Jinnee and thus thou mayst be enabled to defeat him For I burn with desire to behold mine enemy reduced to cinders It s much more likely that you would have to sweep me up said Horace who had a strong conviction that anything in which the Jinnee was concerned would be bungled somehow And if you re so anxious to destroy this Jarjarees why don t you challenge him to meet you in some quiet place in the desert and settle him yourself It s much more in your line than it is in mine He was not without hopes that Fakrash might act on this suggestion and that so he would be relieved of him in the simplest and most satisfactory way but any such hopes were as usual doomed to disappointment It would be of no avail said the Jinnee for it hath been written of old that Jarjarees shall not perish save by the hand of a mortal And I am persuaded that thou wilt turn out to be that mortal since thou art both strong and fearless and moreover it is also predestined that Bedeea shall wed one of the sons of men Then said Horace feeling that this line of defence must be abandoned I fall back on objection number one Even if Jarjarees were obliging enough to retire in my favour I should still decline to become the a consort of a Jinneeyeh whom I ve never seen and don t love Thou hast heard of her incomparable charms and verily the ear may love before the eye It may admitted Horace but neither of my ears is the least in love at present These reasons are of no value said Fakrash and if thou hast none better Well said Ventimore I think I have You profess to be anxious to to requite the trifling service I rendered you though hitherto you ll admit yourself you haven t made a very brilliant success of it But putting the past aside he continued with a sudden dryness in his throat putting the past aside I ask you to consider what possible benefit or happiness such a match as this I m afraid I m not so fortunate as to secure your attention he broke off as he observed the Jinnee s eyes beginning to film over in the disagreeable manner characteristic of certain birds Proceed said Fakrash unskinning his eyes for a second I am hearkening unto thee It seems to me stammered Horace inconsequently enough that all that time inside a bottle well you can t call it experience exactly and possibly in the interval you ve forgotten all you knew about feminine nature I think you must have It is not possible that such knowledge should be forgotten said the Jinnee resenting this imputation in quite a human way Thy words appear to me to lack sense Interpret them I pray thee Why explained Horace you don t mean to tell me that this young and lovely relation of yours a kind of immortal and and with the devil s own pride would be gratified by your proposal to bestow her hand upon an insignificant and unsuccessful London architect She d turn up that sharp and polished nose of hers at the mere idea of so unequal a match An excellent rank is that conferred by wealth remarked the Jinnee But I m not rich and I ve already declined any riches from you said Horace And what s more to the point I m perfectly and hopelessly obscure If you had the slightest sense of humour which I fear you have not you would at once perceive the absurdity of proposing to unite a radiant ethereal superhuman being to a commonplace professional nonentity in a morning coat and a tall hat It s really too ridiculous What thou hast just said is not altogether without wisdom said Fakrash to whom this was evidently a new point of view Art thou indeed so utterly unknown Unknown repeated Horace I should rather think I was I m simply an inconsiderable unit in the population of the vastest city in the world or rather not a unit a cipher And don t you see a man to be worthy of your exalted kinswoman ought to be a celebrity There are plenty of them about What meanest thou by a celebrity inquired Fakrash falling into the trap more readily than Horace had ventured to hope Oh well a distinguished person whose name is on everybody s lips who is honoured and praised by all his fellow citizens Now that kind of man no Jinneeyeh could look down upon I perceive said Fakrash thoughtfully Yes I was in danger of committing a rash action How do men honour such distinguished individuals in these days They generally overfeed them said Horace In London the highest honour a hero can be paid is to receive the freedom of the City which is only conferred in very exceptional cases and for some notable service But of course there are other sorts of celebrities as you could see if you glanced through the society papers I cannot believe that thou who seemest a gracious and talented young man can be indeed so obscure as thou hast represented My good sir any of the flowers that blush unseen in the desert air or the gems concealed in ocean caves so excellently described by one of our poets could give me points and a beating in the matter of notoriety I ll make you a sporting offer There are over five million inhabitants in this London of ours If you go out into the streets and ask the first five hundred you meet whether they know me I don t mind betting you what shall I say a new hat that you won t find half a dozen who ve ever even heard of my existence Why not go out and see for yourself To his surprise and gratification the Jinnee took this seriously I will go forth and make inquiry he said for I desire further enlightenment concerning thy statements But remember he added should I still require thee to wed the matchless Bedeea el Jemal and thou shouldst disobey me thou wilt bring disaster not on thine own head but on those thou art most desirous of protecting Yes so you told me before said Horace brusquely Good evening But Fakrash was already gone In spite of all he had gone through and the unknown difficulties before him Ventimore was seized with what Uncle Remus calls a spell of the dry grins at the thought of the probable replies that the Jinnee would meet with in the course of his inquiries I m afraid he won t be particularly impressed by the politeness of a London crowd he thought but at least they ll convince him that I am not exactly a prominent citizen Then he ll give up this idiotic match of his I don t know though He s such a pig headed old fool that he may stick to it all the same I may find myself encumbered with a Jinneeyeh bride several centuries my senior before I know where I am No I forget there s the jealous Jarjarees to be polished off first I seem to remember something about a quick change combat with an Efreet in the Arabian Nights I may as well look it up and see what may be in store for me And after dinner he went to his shelves and took down Lane s three volume edition of The Arabian Nights which he set himself to study with a new interest It was long since he had looked into these wondrous tales old beyond all human calculation and fresher even now than the most modern of successful romances After all he was tempted to think they might possess quite as much historical value as many works with graver pretentions to accuracy He found a full account of the combat with the Efreet in The Story of the Second Royal Mendicant in the first volume and was unpleasantly surprised to discover that the Efreet s name was actually given as Jarjarees the son of Rejmoos the son of Iblees evidently the same person to whom Fakrash had referred as his bitterest foe He was described as of hideous aspect and had it seemed not only carried off the daughter of the Lord of the Ebony Island on her wedding night but on discovering her in the society of the Royal Mendicant had revenged himself by striking off her hands her feet and her head and transforming his human rival into an ape Between this fellow and old Fakrash he reflected ruefully at this point I seem likely to have a fairly lively time of it He read on till he reached the memorable encounter between the King s daughter and Jarjarees who presented himself in a most hideous shape with hands like winnowing forks and legs like masts and eyes like burning torches which was calculated to unnerve the stoutest novice The Efreet began by transforming himself from a lion to a scorpion upon which the Princess became a serpent then he changed to an eagle and she to a vulture he to a black cat and she to a cock he to a fish and she to a larger fish still If Fakrash can shove me through all that without a fatal hitch somewhere Ventimore told himself I shall be agreeably disappointed in him But after reading a few more lines he cheered up For the Efreet finished as a flame and the Princess as a body of fire And when we looked towards him continued the narrator we perceived that he had become a heap of ashes Come said Horace to himself that puts Jarjarees out of action any way The odd thing is that Fakrash should never have heard of it But as he saw on reflection it was not so very odd after all as the incident had probably happened after the Jinnee had been consigned to his brass bottle where intelligence of any kind would be most unlikely to reach him He worked steadily through the whole of the second volume and part of the third but although he picked up a certain amount of information upon Oriental habits and modes of thought and speech which might come in useful later it was not until he arrived at the twenty fourth Chapter of the third volume that his interest really revived For the twenty fourth Chapter contained The Story of Seyf el Mulook and Bedeea el Jemal and it was only natural that he should be anxious to know all that there was to know concerning the antecedents of one who might be his fiancee before long He read eagerly Bedeea it appeared was the lovely daughter of Shahyal one of the Kings of the Believing Jann her father not Fakrash himself as the Jinnee had incorrectly represented had offered her in marriage to no less a personage than King Solomon himself who however had preferred the Queen of Sheba Seyf the son of the King of Egypt afterwards fell desperately in love with Bedeea but she and her grandmother both declared that between mankind and the Jann there could be no agreement And Seyf was a King s son commented Horace I needn t alarm myself She wouldn t be likely to have anything to say to me It s just as I told Fakrash His heart grew lighter still as he came to the end for he learnt that after many adventures which need not be mentioned here the devoted Seyf did actually succeed in gaining the proud Bedeea as his wife Even Fakrash could not propose to marry me to some one who has a husband already he thought Still she may be a widow To his relief however the conclusion ran thus Seyf el Mulook lived with Bedeea el Jemal a most pleasant and agreeable life until they were visited by the terminator of delights and the separator of companions If that means anything at all he reasoned it means that Seyf and Bedeea are both deceased Even Jinneeyeh seem to be mortal Or perhaps she became so by marrying a mortal I dare say that Fakrash himself wouldn t have lasted all this time if he hadn t been bottled like a tinned tomato But I m glad I found this out because Fakrash is evidently unaware of it and if he should persist in any more of this nonsense I think I see my way now to getting the better of him So with renewed hope and in vastly improved spirits he went to bed and was soon sound asleep CHAPTER XV BLUSHING HONOURS It was rather late the next morning when Ventimore opened his eyes to discover the Jinnee standing by the foot of his bed Oh it s you is it he said sleepily How did you a get on last night I gained such information as I desired said Fakrash guardedly and now for the last time I am come to ask thee whether thou wilt still persist in refusing to wed the illustrious Bedeea el Jemal And have a care how thou answerest So you haven t given up the idea said Horace Well since you make such a point of it I ll meet you as far as this If you produce the lady and she consents to marry me I won t decline the honour But there s one condition I really must insist on It is not for thee to make stipulations Still yet this once I will hear thee I m sure you ll see that it s only fair Supposing for any reason you can t persuade the Princess to meet me within a reasonable time shall we say a week Thou shalt be admitted to her presence within twenty four hours said the Jinnee That s better still Then if I don t see her within twenty four hours I am to be at liberty to infer that the negotiations are off and I may marry anybody else I please without any opposition from you Is that understood It is agreed said Fakrash for I am confident that Bedeea will accept thee joyfully We shall see said Horace But it might be as well if you went and prepared her a little I suppose you know where to find her and you ve only twenty four hours you know More than is needed answered the Jinnee with such childlike confidence that Horace felt almost ashamed of so easy a victory But the sun is already high Arise my son put on these robes and with this he flung on the bed the magnificent raiment which Ventimore had last worn on the night of his disastrous entertainment and when thou hast broken thy fast prepare to accompany me Before I agree to that said Horace sitting up in bed I should like to know where you re taking me to Obey me without demur said Fakrash or thou knowest the consequences It seemed to Horace that it was as well to humour him and he got up accordingly washed and shaved and putting on his dazzling robe of cloth of gold thickly sewn with gems he joined Fakrash who by the way was similarly if less gorgeously arrayed in the sitting room in a state of some mystification Eat quickly commanded the Jinnee for the time is short And Horace after hastily disposing of a cold poached egg and a cup of coffee happened to go to the windows Good Heavens he cried What does all this mean He might well ask On the opposite side of the road by the railings of the square a large crowd had collected all staring at the house in eager expectation As they caught sight of him they raised a cheer which caused him to retreat in confusion but not before he had seen a great golden chariot with six magnificent coal black horses and a suite of swarthy attendants in barbaric liveries standing by the pavement below Whose carriage is that he asked It belongs to thee said the Jinnee descend then and make thy progress in it through the City I will not said Horace Even to oblige you I simply can t drive along the streets in a thing like the band chariot of a travelling circus It is necessary declared Fakrash Must I again recall to thee the penalty of disobedience Oh very well said Horace irritably If you insist on my making a fool of myself I suppose I must But where am I to drive and why That replied Fakrash thou shalt discover at the fitting moment And so amidst the shouts of the spectators Ventimore climbed up into the strange looking vehicle while the Jinnee took his seat by his side Horace had a parting glimpse of mister and missus Rapkin s respective noses flattened against the basement window and then two dusky slaves mounted to a seat at the back of the chariot and the horses started off at a stately trot in the direction of Rochester Row I think you might tell me what all this means he said You ve no conception what an ass I feel stuck up here like this Dismiss bashfulness from thee since all this is designed to render thee more acceptable in the eyes of the Princess Bedeea said the Jinnee Horace said no more though he could not but think that this parade would be thrown away But as they turned into Victoria Street and seemed to be heading straight for the Abbey a horrible thought occurred to him After all his only authority for the marriage and decease of Bedeea was the Arabian Nights which was not unimpeachable evidence What if she were alive and waiting for the arrival of the bridegroom No one but Fakrash would have conceived such an idea as marrying him to a Jinneeyeh in Westminster Abbey but he was capable of any extravagance and there were apparently no limits to his power mister Fakrash he said hoarsely surely this isn t my my wedding day You re not going to have the ceremony there Nay said the Jinnee be not impatient For this edifice would be totally unfitted for the celebration of such nuptials as thine As he spoke the chariot left the Abbey on the right and turned down the Embankment The relief was so intense that Horace s spirits rose irrepressibly It was absurd to suppose that even Fakrash could have arranged the ceremony in so short a time He was merely being taken for a drive and fortunately his best friends could not recognise him in his Oriental disguise And it was a glorious morning with a touch of frost in the air and a sky of streaky turquoise and pale golden clouds the broad river glittered in the sunshine the pavements were lined with admiring crowds and the carriage rolled on amidst frantic enthusiasm like some triumphal car How they re cheering us said Horace Why they couldn t make more row for the Lord Mayor himself What is this Lord Mayor of whom thou speakest inquired Fakrash The Lord Mayor said Horace Oh he s unique There s nobody in the world quite like him He administers the law and if there s any distress in any part of the earth he relieves it He entertains monarchs and Princes and all kinds of potentates at his banquets and altogether he s a tremendous swell Hath he dominion over the earth and the air and all that is therein Within his own precincts I believe he has said Horace rather lazily but I really don t know precisely how wide his powers are He was vainly trying to recollect whether such matters as sky signs telephones and telegraphs in the City were within the Lord Mayor s jurisdiction or the County Council s Fakrash remained silent just as they were driving underneath Charing Cross Railway Bridge when he started perceptibly at the thunder of the trains overhead and the piercing whistles of the engines Tell me he said clutching Horace by the arm what meaneth this You don t mean to say said Horace that you have been about London all these days and never noticed things like these before Till now said the Jinnee I have had no leisure to observe them and discover their nature Well said Horace anxious to let the Jinnee see that he had not the monopoly of miracles since your days we have discovered how to tame or chain the great forces of Nature and compel them to do our will We control the Spirits of Earth Air Fire and Water and make them give us light and heat carry our messages fight our quarrels for us transport us wherever we wish to go with a certainty and precision that throw even your performances my dear sir entirely into the shade Considering what a very large majority of civilised persons would be as powerless to construct the most elementary machine as to create the humblest kind of horse it is not a little odd how complacently we credit ourselves with all the latest achievements of our generation Most of us accept the amazement of the simple minded barbarian on his first introduction to modern inventions as a gratifying personal tribute we feel a certain superiority even if we magnanimously refrain from boastfulness And yet our own particular share in these discoveries is limited to making use of them under expert guidance which any barbarian after overcoming his first terror is quite as competent to do as we are It is a harmless vanity enough and especially pardonable in Ventimore s case when it was so desirable to correct any tendency to uppishness on the part of the Jinnee And doth the Lord Mayor dispose of these forces at his will inquired Fakrash on whom Ventimore s explanation had evidently produced some impression Certainly said Horace whenever he has occasion The Jinnee seemed engrossed in his own thoughts for he said no more just then They were now nearing saint Paul s Cathedral and Horace s first suspicion returned with double force mister Fakrash answer me he said Is this my wedding day or not If it is it s time I was told Not yet said the Jinnee enigmatically and indeed it proved to be another false alarm for they turned down Cannon Street and towards the Mansion House Perhaps you can tell me why we re going through Victoria Street and what all this crowd has come out for asked Ventimore For the throng was denser than ever the people surged and swayed in serried ranks behind the City police and gazed with a wonder and awe that for once seemed to have entirely silenced the Cockney instinct of persiflage For what else but to do thee honour answered Fakrash What bosh said Horace They mistake me for the Shah or somebody and no wonder in this get up Not so said the Jinnee Thy names are familiar to them Horace glanced up at the hastily improvised decorations on one large strip of bunting which spanned the street he read Welcome to the City s most distinguished guest They can t mean me he thought and then another legend caught his eye Well done Ventimore And an enthusiastic householder next door had burst into poetry and displayed the couplet Would we had twenty more Like Horace Ventimore They do mean me he exclaimed Now mister Fakrash will you kindly explain what tomfoolery you ve been up to now I know you re at the bottom of this business It struck him that the Jinnee was slightly embarrassed Didst thou not say he replied that he who should receive the freedom of the City from his fellow men would be worthy of Bedeea el Jemal I may have said something of the sort But good heavens you don t mean that you have contrived that I should receive the freedom of the City It was the easiest affair possible said the Jinnee but he did not attempt to meet Horace s eye Was it though said Horace in a white rage I don t want to be inquisitive but I should like to know what I ve done to deserve it Why trouble thyself with the reason Let it suffice thee that such honour is bestowed upon thee By this time the chariot had crossed Cheapside and was entering King Street This really won t do urged Horace It s not fair to me Either I ve done something or you must have made the Corporation believe I ve done something to be received like this And as we shall be in the Guildhall in a very few seconds you may as well tell me what it is Regarding that matter replied the Jinnee in some confusion I am truly as ignorant as thyself As he spoke they drove through some temporary wooden gates into the courtyard where the Honourable Artillery Company presented arms to them and the carriage drew up before a large marquee decorated with shields and clustered banners Well mister Fakrash said Horace with suppressed fury as he alighted you have surpassed yourself this time You ve got me into a nice scrape and you ll have to pull me through it as well as you can Have no uneasiness said the Jinnee as he accompanied his protege into the marquee which was brilliant with pretty women in smart frocks officers in scarlet tunics and plumed hats and servants in State liveries Their entrance was greeted by a politely subdued buzz of applause and admiration and an official who introduced himself as the Prime Warden of the Candlestick makers Company advanced to meet them The Lord Mayor will receive you in the library he said If you will have the kindness to follow me Horace followed him mechanically I m in for it now he thought whatever it is If I can only trust Fakrash to back me up but I m hanged if I don t believe he s more nervous than I am As they came into the noble Library of the Guildhall a fine string band struck up and Horace with the Jinnee in his rear made his way through a lane of distinguished spectators towards a dais on the steps of which in his gold trimmed robes and black feather hat stood the Lord Mayor with his sword and mace bearers on either hand and behind him a row of beaming sheriffs A truly stately and imposing figure did the Chief Magistrate for that particular year present tall dignified with a lofty forehead whose polished temples reflected the light an aquiline nose and piercing black eyes under heavy white eyebrows a frosty pink in his wrinkled cheeks and a flowing silver beard with a touch of gold still lingering under the lower lip he seemed as he stood there a worthy representative of the greatest and richest city in the world Horace approached the steps with an unpleasant sensation of weakness at the knees and no sort of idea what he was expected to do or say when he arrived And in his perplexity he turned for support and guidance to his self constituted mentor only to discover that the Jinnee whose short sightedness and ignorance had planted him in this present false position had mysteriously and perfidiously disappeared and left him to grapple with the situation single handed CHAPTER XVI A KILLING FROST Fortunately for Ventimore the momentary dismay he had felt on finding himself deserted by his unfathomable Jinnee at the very outset of the ceremony passed unnoticed as the Prime Warden of the Candlestick makers Company immediately came to his rescue by briefly introducing him to the Lord Mayor who with dignified courtesy had descended to the lowest step of the dais to receive him mister Ventimore said the Chief Magistrate cordially as he pressed Horace s hand you must allow me to say that I consider this one of the greatest privileges if not the greatest privilege that have fallen to my lot during a term of office in which I have had the honour of welcoming more than the usual number of illustrious visitors My Lord Mayor said Horace with absolute sincerity you really overwhelm me I I only wish I could feel that I had done anything to deserve this this magnificent compliment Ah replied the Lord Mayor in a paternally rallying tone Modest my dear sir I perceive Like all truly great men A most admirable trait Permit me to present you to the Sheriffs The Sheriffs appeared highly delighted Horace shook hands with both of them indeed in the flurry of the moment he very nearly offered to do so with the Sword and Mace bearers as well but their hands were as it happened otherwise engaged The actual presentation said the Lord Mayor takes place in the Great Hall as you are doubtless aware I I have been given to understand so said Horace with a sinking heart for he had begun to hope that the worst was over But before we adjourn said his host you will let me tempt you to partake of some slight refreshment just a snack Horace was not hungry but it occurred to him that he might get through the ceremony with more credit after a glass of champagne so he accepted the invitation and was conducted to an extemporised buffet at one end of the Library where he fortified himself for the impending ordeal with a caviare sandwich and a bumper of the driest champagne in the Corporation cellars They talk of abolishing us said the Lord Mayor as he took an anchovy on toast but I maintain mister Ventimore I maintain that we with our ancient customs our time honoured traditions form a link with the past which a wise statesman will preserve if I may employ a somewhat vulgar term untinkered with Horace agreed remembering a link with a far more ancient past with which he devoutly wished he had refrained from tinkering Talking of ancient customs the Lord Mayor continued with an odd blend of pride and apology you will shortly have an illustration of our antiquated procedure which may impress you as quaint Horace feeling absolutely idiotic murmured that he felt sure it would do that Before presenting you for the freedom the Prime Warden and five officials of the Candlestick makers Company will give their testimony as compurgators in your favour making oath that you are a man of good name and fame and that you will be amused at this mister Ventimore that you do desire the freedom of this city whereby to defraud the Queen or the City Ha ha Curious way of putting it is it not Very said Horace guiltily and not a little concerned on the official s account A mere form said the Lord Mayor but I for one mister Ventimore I for one should be sorry to see the picturesque old practices die out To my mind he added as he finished a pate de foie gras sandwich the modern impatience to sweep away all the ancient landmarks whether they be superannuated or not is one of the most disquieting symptoms of the age You won t have any more champagne Then I think we had better be making our way to the Great Hall for the Event of the Day I m afraid said Horace with a sudden consciousness of his incongruously Oriental attire I m afraid this is not quite the sort of dress for such a ceremony If I had known Now don t say another word said the Lord Mayor Your costume is very nice very nice indeed and and most appropriate I am sure But I see the City Marshal is waiting for us to head the procession Shall we lead the way The band struck up the March of the Priests from Athalie and Horace his head in a whirl walked with his host followed by the City Lands Committee the Sheriffs and other dignitaries through the Art Gallery and into the Great Hall where their entrance was heralded by a flourish of trumpets The Hall was crowded and Ventimore found himself the object of a popular demonstration which would have filled him with joy and pride if he could only have felt that he had done anything whatever to justify it for it was ridiculous to suppose that he had rendered himself a public benefactor by restoring a convicted Jinnee to freedom and society generally His only consolation was that the English are a race not given to effusiveness without very good reason and that before the ceremony was over he would be enabled to gather what were the particular services which had excited such unbounded enthusiasm Meanwhile he stood there on the crimson draped and flower bedecked dais bowing repeatedly and trusting that he did not look so forlornly foolish as he felt A long shaft of sunlight struck down between the Gothic rafters and dappled the brown stone walls with patches of gold the electric lights in the big hooped chandeliers showed pale and feeble against the subdued glow of the stained glass the air was heavy with the scent of flowers and essences Then there was a rustle of expectation in the audience and a pause in which it seemed to Horace that everybody on the dais was almost as nervous and at a loss what to do next as he was himself He wished with all his soul that they would hurry the ceremony through anyhow and let him go At length the proceedings began by a sort of solemn affectation of having merely met there for the ordinary business of the day which to Horace just then seemed childish in the extreme it was resolved that items one to four on the agenda need not be discussed which brought them to item five Item five was a resolution read by the Town Clerk that the freedom of the City should be presented to Horace Ventimore esquire Citizen and Candlestick maker which last Horace was not aware of being but supposed vaguely that it had been somehow managed while he was at the buffet in the Library in recognition of his services the resolution ran and Horace listened with all his ears especially in connection with It was most unfortunate but at this precise point the official was seized with an attack of coughing in which all was lost but the conclusion of the sentence that have justly entitled him to the gratitude and admiration of his fellow countrymen Then the six compurgators came forward and vouched for Ventimore s fitness to receive the freedom He had painful doubts whether they altogether understood what a responsibility they were undertaking but it was too late to warn them and he could only trust that they knew more of their business than he did After this the City Chamberlain read him an address to which Horace listened in resigned bewilderment The Chamberlain referred to the unanimity and enthusiasm with which the resolution had been carried and said that it was his pleasing and honourable duty as the mouthpiece of that ancient City to address what he described with some inadequacy as a few words to one by adding whose name to their roll of freemen the Corporation honoured rather themselves than the recipient of their homage It was flattering but to Horace s ear the phrases sounded excessive almost fulsome though of course that depended very much on what he had done which he had still to ascertain The orator proceeded to read him the Illustrious List of London s Roll of Fame a recital which made Horace shiver with apprehension For what names they were What glorious deeds they had performed How was it possible that he plain Horace Ventimore a struggling architect who had missed his one great chance could have achieved especially without even being aware of it anything that would not seem ludicrously insignificant by comparison He had a morbid fancy that the marble goddesses or whoever they were at the base of Nelson s monument opposite were regarding him with stony disdain and indignation that the statue of Wellington knew him for an arrant impostor and averted his head with cold contempt and that the effigy of Lord Mayor Beckford on the right of the dais would come to life and denounce him in another moment Turning now to your own distinguished services he suddenly heard the City Chamberlain resuming you are probably aware sir that it is customary on these occasions to mention specifically the particular merit which had been deemed worthy of civic recognition Horace was greatly relieved to hear it for it struck him as a most sensible and in his own particular case essential formality But on the present occasion sir proceeded the speaker I feel as all present must feel that it would be unnecessary nay almost impertinent were I to weary the public ear by a halting recapitulation of deeds with which it is already so appreciatively familiar At this he was interrupted by deafening and long continued applause at the end of which he continued I have only therefore to greet you in the name of the Corporation and to offer you the right hand of fellowship as a Freeman and Citizen and Candlestick maker of London As he shook hands he presented Horace with a copy of the Oath of Allegiance intimating that he was to read it aloud Naturally Ventimore had not the least objection to swear to be good and true to our Sovereign Lady Queen Victoria or to be obedient to the Lord Mayor and warn him of any conspiracies against the Queen s peace which might chance to come under his observation so he took the oath cheerfully enough and hoped that this was really the end of the ceremony However to his great chagrin and apprehension the Lord Mayor rose with the evident intention of making a speech He said that the conclusion of the City to bestow the highest honour in their gift upon mister Horace Ventimore had been here he hesitated somewhat hastily arrived at Personally he would have liked a longer time to prepare to make the display less inadequate to and worthier of this exceptional occasion He thought that was the general feeling It evidently was judging from the loud and unanimous cheering However for reasons which for reasons with which they were as well acquainted as himself the notice had been short The Corporation had yielded as they always did as it would always be their pride and pleasure to yield to popular pressure which was practically irresistible and had done the best they could in the limited he might almost say the unprecedentedly limited period allowed them The proudest leaf in mister Ventimore s chaplet of laurels to day was he would venture to assert the sight of the extraordinary enthusiasm and assemblage not only in that noble hall but in the thoroughfares of this mighty Metropolis Under the circumstances this was a marvellous tribute to the admiration and affection which mister Ventimore had succeeded in inspiring in the great heart of the people rich and poor high and low He would not detain his hearers any longer all that remained for him to do was to ask mister Ventimore s acceptance of a golden casket containing the roll of freedom and he felt sure that their distinguished guest before proceeding to inscribe his name on the register would oblige them all by some account from his own lips of of the events in which he had figured so prominently and so creditably Horace received the casket mechanically there was a universal cry of Speech from the audience to which he replied by shaking his head in helpless deprecation but in vain he found himself irresistibly pressed towards the rail in front of the dais and the roar of applause which greeted him saved him from all necessity of attempting to speak for nearly two minutes During that interval he had time to clear his brain and think what he had better do or say in his present unenviable dilemma For some time past a suspicion had been growing in his mind until it had now almost swollen into certainty He felt that before he compromised himself or allowed his too generous entertainers to compromise themselves irretrievably it was absolutely necessary to ascertain his real position and to do that he must make some sort of speech With this resolve all his nervousness and embarrassment and indecision melted away he faced the assembly coolly and gallantly convinced that his best alternative now lay in perfect candour My Lord Mayor my lords ladies and gentlemen he began in a clear voice which penetrated to the farthest gallery and commanded instant attention If you expect to hear from me any description of what I ve done to be received like this I m afraid you will be disappointed For my own belief is that I ve done nothing whatever There was a general outcry of No no at this and a fervid murmur of protest It s all very well to say No no said Horace and I am extremely grateful to you all for the interruption Still I can only repeat that I am absolutely unaware of having ever rendered my Country or this great City a single service deserving of the slightest acknowledgment I wish I could feel I had but the truth is that if I have the fact has entirely slipped from my memory Again there were murmurs this time with a certain under current of irritation and he could hear the Lord Mayor behind him remarking to the City Chamberlain that this was not at all the kind of speech for the occasion I know what you re thinking said Horace You re thinking this is mock modesty on my part But it s nothing of the sort I don t know what I ve done but I presume you are all better informed Because the Corporation wouldn t have given me that very charming casket you wouldn t all of you be here like this unless you were under a strong impression that I d done something to deserve it At this there was a fresh outburst of applause Just so said Horace calmly Well now will any of you be kind enough to tell me in a few words what you suppose I ve done There was a dead silence in which every one looked at his or her neighbour and smiled feebly My Lord Mayor continued Horace I appeal to you to tell me and this distinguished assembly why on earth we re all here The Lord Mayor rose I think it sufficient to say he announced with dignity that the Corporation and myself were unanimously of opinion that this distinction should be awarded for reasons which it is unnecessary and hum ha invidious to enter into here I am sorry persisted Horace but I must press your lordship for those reasons I have an object Will the City Chamberlain oblige me then No Well then the Town Clerk No it s just as I suspected none of you can give me your reasons and shall I tell you why Because there aren t any Now do bear with me for a moment I m quite aware this is very embarrassing for all of you but remember that it s infinitely more awkward for me I really cannot accept the freedom of the City under any suspicion of false pretences It would be a poor reward for your hospitality and base and unpatriotic into the bargain to depreciate the value of so great a distinction by permitting it to be conferred unworthily If after you ve heard what I am going to tell you you still insist on my accepting such an honour of course I will not be so ungracious as to refuse it But I really don t feel that it would be right to inscribe my name on your Roll of Fame without some sort of explanation If I did I might for anything I know involuntarily be signing the death warrant of the Corporation There was a breathless hush upon this the silence grew so intense that to borrow a slightly involved metaphor from a distinguished friend of the writer s you might have picked up a pin in it Horace leaned sideways against the rail in an easy attitude so as to face the Lord Mayor as well as a portion of his audience Before I go any farther he said will your lordship pardon me if I suggest that it might be as well to direct that all reporters present should immediately withdraw The reporters table was instantly in a stir of anger and many of the guests expressed some dissatisfaction We at least said the Lord Mayor rising flushed with annoyance have no reason to dread publicity I decline to make a hole and corner affair of this I shall give no such orders Very well said Horace when the chorus of approval had subsided My suggestion was made quite as much in the Corporation s interests as mine I merely thought that when you all clearly understood how grossly you ve been deluded you might prefer to have the details kept out of the newspapers if possible But if you particularly want them published over the whole world why of course An uproar followed here under cover of which the Lord Mayor contrived to give orders to have the doors fastened till further directions Don t make this more difficult and disagreeable for me than it is already said Horace as soon as he could obtain a hearing again You don t suppose that I should have come here in this Tom fool s dress imposing myself on the hospitality of this great City if I could have helped it If you ve been brought here under false pretences so have I If you ve been made to look rather foolish what is your situation to mine The fact is I am the victim of a headstrong force which I am utterly unable to control Upon this a fresh uproar arose and prevented him from continuing for some time I only ask for fair play and a patient hearing he pleaded Give me that and I will undertake to restore you all to good humour before I have done They calmed down at this appeal and he was able to proceed My case is simply this he said A little time ago I happened to go to an auction and buy a large brass bottle For some inexplicable reason his last words roused the audience to absolute frenzy they would not hear anything about the brass bottle Every time he attempted to mention it they howled him down they hissed they groaned they shook their fists the din was positively deafening Nor was the demonstration confined to the male portion of the assembly One lady indeed who is a prominent leader in society but whose name shall not be divulged here was so carried away by her feelings as to hurl a heavy cut glass bottle of smelling salts at Horace s offending head Fortunately for him it missed him and only caught one of the officials Horace was not in a mood to notice details very accurately but he had a notion that it was the City Remembrancer somewhere about the region of the watch pocket Will you hear me out Ventimore shouted I m not trifling I haven t told you yet what was inside the bottle When I opened it I found He got no farther for as the words left his lips he felt himself seized by the collar of his robe and lifted off his feet by an agency he was powerless to resist Up and up he was carried past the great chandeliers between the carved and gilded rafters pursued by a universal shriek of dismay and horror Down below he could see the throng of pale upturned faces and hear the wild screams and laughter of several ladies of great distinction in violent hysterics And the next moment he was in the glass lantern and the latticed panes gave way like tissue paper as he broke through into the open air causing the pigeons on the roof to whirr up in a flutter of alarm Of course he knew that it was the Jinnee who was abducting him in this sensational manner and he was rather relieved than alarmed by Fakrash s summary proceeding for he seemed for once to have hit upon the best way out of a situation that was rapidly becoming impossible CHAPTER XVII HIGH WORDS Once outside in the open air the Jinnee towered like a pheasant shot through the breast and Horace closed his eyes with a combined swing switchback and Channel passage sensation during a flight which apparently continued for hours although in reality it probably did not occupy more than a very few seconds His uneasiness was still further increased by his inability to guess where he was being taken to for he felt instinctively that they were not travelling in the direction of home At last he felt himself set down on some hard firm surface and ventured to open his eyes once more When he realised where he actually was his knees gave way under him and he was seized with a sudden giddiness that very nearly made him lose his balance For he found himself standing on a sort of narrow ledge or cornice immediately under the ball at the top of saint Paul s Many feet beneath him spread the dull leaden summit of the dome its raised ridges stretching like huge serpents over the curve beyond which was a glimpse of the green roof of the nave and the two west towers with their grey columns and urn topped buttresses and gilded pineapples which shone ruddily in the sun He had an impression of Ludgate Hill and Fleet Street as a deep winding ravine steeped in partial shadow of long sierras of roofs and chimney pots showing their sharp outlines above mouse coloured smoke wreaths of the broad pearl tinted river with oily ripples and a golden glitter where the sunlight touched it of the gleaming slope of mud under the wharves and warehouses on the Surrey side of barges and steamers moored in black clusters of a small tug fussing noisily down the river leaving a broadening arrow head in its wake Cautiously he moved round towards the east where the houses formed a blurred mosaic of cream slate indigo and dull reds and browns above which slender rose flushed spires and towers pierced the haze stained in countless places by pillars of black grey and amber smoke and lightened by plumes and jets of silvery steam till all blended by imperceptible gradations into a sky of tenderest gold slashed with translucent blue It was a magnificent view and none the less so because the indistinctness of all beyond a limited radius made the huge City seem not only mystical but absolutely boundless in extent But although Ventimore was distinctly conscious of all this he was scarcely in a state to appreciate its grandeur just then He was much too concerned with wondering why Fakrash had chosen to plant him up there in so insecure a position and how he was ever to be rescued from it since the Jinnee had apparently disappeared He was not far off however for presently Horace saw him stalk round the narrow cornice with an air of being perfectly at home on it So there you are said Ventimore I thought you d deserted me again What have you brought me up here for Because I desired to have speech with thee in private replied the Jinnee We re not likely to be intruded on here certainly said Horace But isn t it rather exposed rather public If we re seen up here you know it will cause a decided sensation I have laid a spell on all below that they should not raise their eyes Be seated therefore and hear my words Horace lowered himself carefully to a sitting position so that his legs dangled in space and Fakrash took a seat by his side O most indiscreet of mankind he began in an aggrieved tone thou hast been near the committal of a great blunder and doing ill to thyself and to me Well I do like that retorted Horace when you let me in for all that freedom of the City business and then sneaked off leaving me to get out of it the best way I could and only came back just as I was about to explain matters and carried me up through the roof like a sack of flour Do you consider that tactful on your part Thou hadst drunk wine and permitted it to creep as far as the place of secrets Only one glass said Horace and I wanted it I can assure you I was obliged to make a speech to them and thanks to you I was in such a hole that I saw nothing for it but to tell the truth Veracity as thou wilt learn answered the Jinnee is not invariably the Ship of Safety Thou wert about to betray the benefactor who procured for thee such glory and honour as might well cause the gall bladder of lions to burst with envy If any lion with the least sense of humour could have witnessed the proceedings said Ventimore he might have burst with laughter certainly not envy Good Lord Fakrash he cried in his indignation I ve never felt such an absolute ass in my whole life If nothing would satisfy you but my receiving the freedom of the City you might at least have contrived some decent excuse for it But you left out the only point there was in the whole thing and all for what What doth it signify why the whole populace should come forth to acclaim thee and do thee honour so long as they did so said Fakrash sullenly For the report of thy fame would reach Bedeea el Jemal That s just where you re mistaken said Horace If you had not been in too desperate a hurry to make a few inquiries you would have found out that you were taking all this trouble for nothing How sayest thou Well you would have discovered that the Princess is spared all temptation to marry beneath her by the fact that she became the bride of somebody else about thirty centuries ago She married a mortal one Seyf el Mulook a King s son and they ve both been dead a considerable time another obstacle to your plans It is a lie declared Fakrash If you will take me back to Vincent Square I shall be happy to show you the evidence in your national records said Horace And you may be glad to know that your old enemy mister Jarjarees came to a violent end after a very sporting encounter with a King s daughter who though proficient in advanced magic unfortunately perished herself poor lady in the final round I had intended thee to accomplish his downfall said Fakrash I know said Horace It was most thoughtful of you But I doubt if I should have done it half as well and it would have probably cost me an eye at the very least It s better as it is And how long hast thou known of these things Only since last night Since last night And thou didst not unfold them unto me till this instant I ve had such a busy morning you see explained Horace There s been no time Silly bearded fool that I was to bring this misbegotten dog into the august presence of the great Lord Mayor himself on whom be peace cried the Jinnee I object to being referred to as a misbegotten dog said Horace but with the rest of your remark I entirely concur I m afraid the Lord Mayor is very far from being at peace just now He pointed to the steep roof of the Guildhall with its dormers and fretted pinnacles and the slender lantern through which he had so lately made his inglorious exit There s the devil of a row going on under that lantern just now mister Fakrash you may depend upon that They ve locked the doors till they can decide what to do next which will take them some time And it s all your fault It was thy doing Why didst thou dare to inform the Lord Mayor that he was deceived Why Because I thought he ought to know Because I was bound particularly after my oath of allegiance to warn him of any conspiracy against him Because I was in such a hat He ll understand all that he won t blame me for this business It is fortunate observed the Jinnee that I flew away with thee before thou couldst pronounce my name You gave yourself away said Horace They all saw you you know You weren t flying so particularly fast They ll recognise you again If you will carry off a man from under the Lord Mayor s very nose and shoot up through the roof like a rocket with him you can t expect to escape some notice You see you happen to be the only unbottled Jinnee in this City Fakrash shifted his seat on the cornice I have committed no act of disrespect unto the Lord Mayor he said therefore he can have no just cause of anger against me Horace perceived that the Jinnee was not altogether at ease and pushed his advantage accordingly My dear good old friend he said you don t seem to realise yet what an awful thing you ve done For your own mistaken purposes you have compelled the Chief Magistrate and the Corporation of the greatest City in the world to make themselves hopelessly ridiculous They ll never hear the last of this affair Just look at the crowds waiting patiently below there Look at the flags Think of that gorgeous conveyance of yours standing outside the Guildhall Think of the assembly inside all the most aristocratic noble and distinguished personages in the land continued Horace piling it on as he proceeded all collected for what To be made fools of by a Jinnee out of a brass bottle For their own sakes they will preserve silence said Fakrash with a gleam of unwonted shrewdness Probably they would hush it up if they only could conceded Horace But how can they What are they to say What plausible explanation can they give Besides there s the Press you don t know what the Press is but I assure you its power is tremendous it s simply impossible to keep anything secret from it nowadays It has eyes and ears everywhere and a thousand tongues Five minutes after the doors in that hall are unlocked and they can t keep them locked much longer the reporters will be handing in their special descriptions of you and your latest vagaries to their respective journals Within half an hour bills will be carried through every quarter of London bills with enormous letters Extraordinary Scene at the Guildhall Strange End to a Civic Function Startling Appearance of an Oriental Genie in the City Abduction of a Guest of the Lord Mayor Intense Excitement Full Particulars And by that time the story will have flashed round the whole world Keep silence indeed Do you imagine for a moment that the Lord Mayor or anybody else concerned however remotely will ever forget or be allowed to forget such an outrageous incident as this If you do believe me you re mistaken Truly it would be a terrible thing to incur the wrath of the Lord Mayor said the Jinnee in troubled accents Awful said Horace But you seem to have managed it He weareth round his neck a magic jewel which giveth him dominion over devils is it not so You know best said Horace It was the splendour of that jewel and the majesty of his countenance that rendered me afraid to enter his presence lest he should recognise me for what I am and command me to obey him for verily his might is greater even than Suleyman s and his hand heavier upon such of the Jinn as fall into his power If that s so said Horace I should strongly advise you to find some way of putting things straight before it s too late you ve no time to lose Thou sayest well said Fakrash springing to his feet and turning his face towards Cheapside Horace shuffled himself along the ledge in a seated position after the Jinnee and looking down between his feet could just see the tops of the thin and rusty trees in the churchyard the black and serried swarms of foreshortened people in the street and the scarlet rimmed mouths of chimney pots on the tiled roofs below There is but one remedy I know said the Jinnee and it may be that I have lost power to perform it Yet will I make the endeavour And stretching forth his right hand towards the east he muttered some kind of command or invocation Horace almost fell off the cornice with apprehension of what might follow Would it be a thunderbolt a plague some frightful convulsion of Nature He felt sure that Fakrash would hesitate at no means however violent of burying all traces of his blunder in oblivion and very little hope that whatever he did it would prove anything but some worse indiscretion than his previous performances Happily none of these extreme measures seemed to have occurred to the Jinnee though what followed was strange and striking enough For presently as if in obedience to the Jinnee s weird gesticulations a lurid belt of fog came rolling up from the direction of the Royal Exchange swallowing up building after building in its rapid course one by one the Guildhall Bow Church Cheapside itself and the churchyard disappeared and Horace turning his head to the left saw the murky tide sweeping on westward blotting out Ludgate Hill the Strand Charing Cross and Westminster till at last he and Fakrash were alone above a limitless plain of bituminous cloud the only living beings left as it seemed in a blank and silent universe Look again said Fakrash and Horace looking eastward saw the spire of Bow Church rosy once more the Guildhall standing clear and intact and the streets and house tops gradually reappearing Only the flags with their unrestful shiver and ripple of colour had disappeared and with them the waiting crowds and the mounted constables The ordinary traffic of vans omnibuses and cabs was proceeding as though it had never been interrupted the clank and jingle of harness chains the cries and whip crackings of drivers rose with curious distinctness above the incessant trampling roar which is the ground swell of the human ocean That cloud which thou sawest said Fakrash hath swept away with it all memory of this affair from the minds of every mortal assembled to do thee honour See they go about their several businesses and all the past incidents are to them as though they had never been It was not often that Horace could honestly commend any performance of the Jinnee s but at this he could not restrain his admiration By Jove he said that certainly gets the Lord Mayor and everybody else out of the mess as neatly as possible I must say mister Fakrash it s much the best thing I ve seen you do yet Wait said the Jinnee for presently thou shalt see me perform a yet more excellent thing There was a most unpleasant green glow in his eyes and a bristle in his thin beard as he spoke which suddenly made Horace feel uncomfortable He did not like the look of the Jinnee at all I really think you ve done enough for to day he said And this wind up here is rather searching I shan t be sorry to find myself on the ground again That replied the Jinnee thou shalt assuredly do before long O impudent and deceitful wretch And he laid a long lean hand on Horace s shoulder He is put out about something thought Ventimore But what My dear sir he said aloud I don t understand this tone of yours What have I done to offend you Divinely gifted was he who said Beware of losing hearts in consequence of injury for the bringing them back after flight is difficult Excellent said Horace But I don t quite see the application The application explained the Jinnee is that I am determined to cast thee down from here with my own hand Horace turned faint and dizzy for a moment Then by a strong effort of will he pulled himself together Oh come now he said you don t really mean that you know After all your kindness You re much too good natured to be capable of anything so atrocious All pity hath been eradicated from my heart returned Fakrash Therefore prepare to die for thou art presently about to perish in the most unfortunate manner Ventimore could not repress a shudder Hitherto he had never been able to take Fakrash quite seriously in spite of all his supernatural powers he had treated him with a half kindly half contemptuous tolerance as a well meaning but hopelessly incompetent old foozle That the Jinnee should ever become malevolent towards him had never entered his head till now and yet he undoubtedly had How was he to cajole and disarm this formidable being He must keep cool and act promptly or he would never see Sylvia again As he sat there on the narrow ledge with a faint and not unpleasant smell of hops saluting his nostrils from some distant brewery he tried hard to collect his thoughts but could not He found himself instead idly watching the busy jostling crowd below who were all unconscious of the impending drama so high above them Just over the rim of the dome he could see the opaque white top of a lamp on a shelter where a pigmy constable stood directing the traffic Would he look up if Horace called for help Even if he could what help could he render All he could do would be to keep the crowd back and send for a covered stretcher No he would not dwell on these horrors he must fix his mind on some way of circumventing Fakrash How did the people in The Arabian Nights manage The fisherman for instance He persuaded his Jinnee to return to the bottle by pretending to doubt whether he had ever really been inside it But Fakrash though simple enough in some respects was not quite such a fool as that Sometimes the Jinn could be mollified and induced to grant a reprieve by being told stories one inside the other like a nest of Oriental boxes Unfortunately Fakrash did not seem in the humour for listening to apologues and even if he were Horace could not think of or improvise any just then Besides he thought I can t sit up here telling him anecdotes for ever I d almost sooner die Still he remembered that it was generally possible to draw an Arabian Efreet into discussion they all loved argument and had a rough conception of justice I think mister Fakrash he said that in common fairness I have a right to know what offence I have committed To recite thy misdeeds replied the Jinnee would occupy much time I don t mind that said Horace affably I can give you as long as you like I m in no sort of a hurry With me it is otherwise retorted Fakrash making a stride towards him Therefore court not life for thy death hath become unavoidable Before we part said Horace you won t refuse to answer one or two questions Didst thou not undertake never to ask any further favour of me Moreover it will avail thee nought For I am positively determined to slay thee I demand it said Horace in the most great name of the Lord Mayor on whom be peace It was a desperate shot but it took effect The Jinnee quailed visibly Ask then he said but briefly for the time groweth short Horace determined to make one last appeal to Fakrash s sense of gratitude since it had always seemed the dominant trait in his character Well he said but for me wouldn t you be still in that brass bottle That replied the Jinnee is the very reason why I purpose to destroy thee Oh was all Horace could find to say at this most unlooked for answer His sheet anchor in which he had trusted implicitly had suddenly dragged and he was drifting fast to destruction Are there any other questions which thou wouldst ask inquired the Jinnee with grim indulgence or wilt thou encounter thy doom without further procrastination Horace was determined not to give in just yet he had a very bad hand but he might as well play the game out and trust to luck to gain a stray trick I haven t nearly done yet he said And remember you ve promised to answer me in the name of the Lord Mayor I will answer one other question and no more said the Jinnee in an inflexible tone and Ventimore realised that his fate would depend upon what he said next CHAPTER XVIII A GAME OF BLUFF Thy second question O pertinacious one said the Jinnee impatiently He was standing with folded arms looking down on Horace who was still seated on the narrow cornice not daring to glance below again lest he should lose his head altogether I m coming to it said Ventimore I want to know why you should propose to dash me to pieces in this barbarous way as a return for letting you out of that bottle Were you so comfortable in it as all that In the bottle I was at least suffered to rest and none molested me But in releasing me thou didst perfidiously conceal from me that Suleyman was dead and gone and that there reigneth one in his stead mightier a thousand fold who afflicteth our race with labours and tortures exceeding all the punishments of Suleyman What on earth have you got into your head now You can t mean the Lord Mayor Whom else said the Jinnee solemnly And though for this once by a device I have evaded his vengeance yet do I know full well that either by virtue of the magic jewel upon his breast or through that malignant monster with the myriad ears and eyes and tongues which thou callest The Press I shall inevitably fall into his power before long For the life of him in spite of his desperate plight Horace could not help laughing I beg your pardon mister Fakrash he said as soon as he could speak but the Lord Mayor It s really too absurd Why he wouldn t hurt a hair on a fly s head Seek not to deceive me further said Fakrash furiously Didst thou not inform me with thy own mouth that the spirits of Earth Air Water and Fire were subject to his will Have I no eyes Do I not behold from here the labours of my captive brethren What are those on yonder bridges but enslaved Jinn shrieking and groaning in clanking fetters and snorting forth steam as they drag their wheeled burdens behind them Are there not others toiling with panting efforts through the sluggish waters others again imprisoned in lofty pillars from which the smoke of their breath ascendeth even unto Heaven Doth not the air throb and quiver with their restless struggles as they writhe below in darkness and torment And thou hast the shamelessness to pretend that these things are done in the Lord Mayor s own realms without his knowledge Verily thou must take me for a fool After all reflected Ventimore if he chooses to consider that railway engines and steamers and machinery generally are inhabited by so many Jinn doing time it s not to my interest to undeceive him indeed it s quite the contrary I wasn t aware the Lord Mayor had so much power as all that he said but very likely you re right And if you re so anxious to keep in favour with him it would be a great mistake to kill me That would annoy him Not so said the Jinnee for I should declare that thou hadst spoken slightingly of him in my hearing and that I had slain thee on that account Your proper course said Horace would be to hand me over to him and let him deal with the case Much more regular That may be said Fakrash but I have conceived so bitter a hatred to thee by reason of thy insolence and treachery that I cannot forego the delight of slaying thee with my own hand Can t you really said Horace on the verge of despair And then what will you do Then replied the Jinnee I shall flee away to Arabia where I shall be safe Don t you be too sure of that said Horace You see all those wires stretched on poles down there Those are the pathways of certain Jinn known as electric currents and the Lord Mayor could send a message along them which would be at Baghdad before you had flown farther than Folkestone And I may mention that Arabia is now more or less under British jurisdiction He was bluffing of course for he knew perfectly well that even if any extradition treaty could be put in force the arrest of a Jinnee would be no easy matter Thou art of opinion then that I should be no safer in mine own country inquired Fakrash I swear by the name of the Lord Mayor to whom be all reverence said Horace that there is no land you could fly to where you would be any safer than you are here If I were but sealed up in my bottle once more said the Jinnee would not even the Lord Mayor have respect unto the seal of Suleyman and forbear to disturb me Why of course he would cried Horace hardly daring to believe his ears That s really a brilliant idea of yours my dear mister Fakrash And in the bottle I should not be compelled to work continued the Jinnee For labour of all kinds hath ever been abhorrent unto me I can quite understand that said Horace sympathetically Just imagine your having to drag an excursion train to the seaside on a Bank Holiday or being condemned to print off a cheap comic paper or even the War Cry when you might be leading a snug and idle existence in your bottle If I were you I should go and get inside it at once Suppose we go back to Vincent Square and find it I shall return to the bottle since in that alone there is safety said the Jinnee But I shall return alone Alone cried Horace You re not going to leave me stuck up here all by myself By no means said the Jinnee Have I not said that I am about to cast thee to perdition Too long have I delayed in the accomplishment of this duty Once more Horace gave himself up for lost which was doubly bitter just when he had begun to consider that the danger was past But even then he was determined to fight to the last One moment he said Of course if you ve set your heart on pitching me over you must Only I may be quite mistaken but I don t quite see how you are going to manage the rest of your programme without me that s all O deficient in intelligence cried the Jinnee What assistance canst thou render me Well said Horace of course you can get into the bottle alone that s simple enough But the difficulty I see is this Are you quite sure you can put the cap on yourself from the inside you know If he can he thought I m done for That began the Jinnee with his usual confidence will be the easiest of nay he corrected himself there be things that not even the Jinn themselves can accomplish and one of them is to seal a vessel while remaining in it I am indebted to thee for reminding me thereof Not at all said Ventimore I shall be delighted to come and seal you up comfortably myself Again thou speakest folly exclaimed the Jinnee How canst thou seal me up after I have dashed thee into a thousand pieces That said Horace with all the urbanity he could command is precisely the difficulty I was trying to convey There will be no difficulty for as soon as I am in the bottle I shall summon certain inferior Efreets and they will replace the seal When you are once in the bottle said Horace at a venture you probably won t be in a position to summon anybody Before I get into the bottle then said the Jinnee impatiently Thou dost but juggle with words But about those Efreets persisted Horace You know what Efreets are How can you be sure that when they ve got you in the bottle they won t hand you over to the Lord Mayor I shouldn t trust them myself but of course you know best Whom shall I trust then said Fakrash frowning I m sure I don t know It s rather a pity you re so determined to destroy me because as it happens I m just the one person living who could be depended on to seal you up and keep your secret However that s your affair After all why should I care what becomes of you I shan t be there Even at this hour said the Jinnee undecidedly I might find it in my heart to spare thee were I but sure that thou wouldst be faithful unto me I should have thought I was more to be trusted than one of your beastly Efreets said Horace with well assumed indifference But never mind I don t know that I care after all I ve nothing particular to live for now You ve ruined me pretty thoroughly and you may as well finish your work I ve a good mind to jump over and save you the trouble Perhaps when you see me bouncing down that dome you ll be sorry Refrain from rashness said the Jinnee hastily without suspecting that Ventimore had no serious intention of carrying out his threat If thou wilt do as thou art bidden I will not only pardon thee but grant thee all that thou desirest Take me back to Vincent Square first said Horace This is not the place to discuss business Thou sayest rightly replied the Jinnee hold fast to my sleeve and I will transport thee to thine abode Not till you promise to play fair said Horace pausing on the brink of the ledge Remember if you let me go now you drop the only friend you ve got in the world May I be thy ransom replied Fakrash There shall not be harmed a hair of thy head Even then Horace had his misgivings but as there was no other way of getting off that cornice he decided to take the risk And as it proved he acted judiciously for the Jinnee flew to Vincent Square with honourable precision and dropped him neatly into the armchair in which he had little hoped ever to find himself again I have brought thee hither said Fakrash and yet I am persuaded that thou art even now devising treachery against me and wilt betray me if thou canst Horace was about to assure him once more that no one could be more anxious than himself to see him safely back in his bottle when he recollected that it was impolitic to appear too eager After the way you ve behaved he said I m not at all sure that I ought to help you Still I said I would on certain conditions and I ll keep my word Conditions thundered the Jinnee Wilt thou bargain with me yet further My excellent friend said Horace quietly you know perfectly well that you can t get yourself safely sealed up again in that bottle without my assistance If you don t like my terms and prefer to take your chance of finding an Efreet who is willing to brave the Lord Mayor well you ve only to say so I have loaded thee with all manner of riches and favours and I will bestow no more upon thee said the Jinnee sullenly Nay in token of my displeasure I will deprive thee even of such gifts as thou hast retained He pointed his grey forefinger at Ventimore whose turban and jewelled robes instantly shrivelled into cobwebs and tinder and fluttered to the carpet in filmy shreds leaving him in nothing but his underclothing That only shows what a nasty temper you re in said Horace blandly and doesn t annoy me in the least If you ll excuse me I ll go and put on some things I can feel more at home in and perhaps by the time I return you ll have cooled down He slipped on some clothes hurriedly and re entered the sitting room Now mister Fakrash he said we ll have this out You talk of having loaded me with benefits You seem to consider I ought to be grateful to you In Heaven s name for what I ve been as forbearing as possible all this time because I gave you credit for meaning well Now I ll speak plainly I told you from the first and I tell you now that I want no riches nor honours from you The one real good turn you did me was bringing me that client and you spoilt that because you would insist on building the palace yourself instead of leaving it to me As for the rest here am I a ruined and discredited man with a client who probably supposes I m in league with the Devil with the girl I love and might have married believing that I have left her to marry a Princess and her father unable ever to forgive me for having seen him as a one eyed mule In short I m in such a mess all round that I don t care two straws whether I live or die What is all this to me said the Jinnee Only this that unless you can see your way to putting things straight for me I m hanged if I take the trouble to seal you up in that bottle How am I to put things straight for thee cried Fakrash peevishly If you could make all those people entirely forget that affair in the Guildhall you can make my friends forget the brass bottle and everything connected with it can t you There would be no difficulty in that Fakrash admitted Well do it and I ll swear to seal you up in the bottle exactly as if you had never been out of it and pitch you into the deepest part of the Thames where no one will ever disturb you First produce the bottle then said Fakrash for I cannot believe but that thou hast some lurking guile in thy heart I ll ring for my landlady and have the bottle brought up said Horace Perhaps that will satisfy you Stay you d better not let her see you I will render myself invisible said the Jinnee suiting the action to his words But beware lest thou play me false his voice continued for I shall hear thee So you ve come in mister Ventimore said missus Rapkin as she entered And without the furrin gentleman I was surprised and so was Rapkin the same to see you ridin off this morning in the gorgious chariot and osses and dressed up that lovely Depend upon it I says to Rapkin I says depend upon it mister Ventimore ll be sent for to Buckinham Pallis if it ain t Windsor Castle Never mind that now said Horace impatiently I want that brass bottle I bought the other day Bring it up at once please I thought you said the other day you never wanted to set eyes on it again and I was to do as I pleased with it sir Well I ve changed my mind so let me have it quick I m sure I m very sorry sir but that you can t because Rapkin not wishful to have the place lumbered up with rubbish disposed of it on y last night to a gentleman as keeps a rag and bone emporium off the Bridge Road and alf a crown was the most he d give for it sir Give me his name said Horace Dilger sir Emanuel Dilger When Rapkin comes in I m sure he d go round with pleasure and see about it if required I ll go round myself said Horace It s all right missus Rapkin quite a natural mistake on your part but but I happen to want the bottle again You needn t stay O thou smooth faced and double tongued one said the Jinnee after she had gone as he reappeared to view Did I not foresee that thou wouldst deal crookedly Restore unto me my bottle I ll go and get it at once said Horace I shan t be five minutes And he prepared to go Thou shalt not leave this house cried Fakrash for I perceive plainly that this is but a device of thine to escape and betray me to the Press Devil If you can t see said Horace angrily that I m quite as anxious to see you safely back in that confounded bottle as ever you can be to get there you must be pretty dense Can t you understand The bottle s sold and I can t buy it back without going out Don t be so infernally unreasonable Go then said the Jinnee and I will await thy return here But know this that if thou delayest long or returnest without my bottle I shall know that thou art a traitor and will visit thee and those who are dear to thee with the most unpleasant punishments I ll be back in half an hour at most said Horace feeling that this would allow him ample margin and thankful that it did not occur to Fakrash to go in person He put on his hat and hurried off in the gathering dusk He had some little trouble in finding mister Dilger s establishment which was a dirty dusty little place in a back street with a few deplorable old chairs rickety washstands and rusty fenders outside and the interior almost completely blocked by piles of dingy mattresses empty clock cases tarnished and cracked mirrors broken lamps damaged picture frames and everything else which one would imagine could have no possible value for any human being But in all this collection of worthless curios the brass bottle was nowhere to be seen Ventimore went in and found a youth of about thirteen straining his eyes in the fading light over one of those halfpenny humorous journals which thanks to an improved system of education at least eighty per cent of our juvenile population are now enabled to appreciate I want to see mister Dilger he began You can t said the youth Cause he ain t in He s attending of an auction When will he be in do you know Might be back to his tea but I wasn t to expect him not before supper You don t happen to have any old metal bottles copper or or brass would do for sale You don t git at me like that Bottles is made o glorss Well a jar then a big brass pot anything of that kind Don t keep em said the boy and buried himself once more in his copy of Spicy Sniggers I ll just look round said Horace and began to poke about with a sinking heart and a horrid dread that he might have come to the wrong shop for the big pot bellied vessel certainly did not seem to be there At last to his unspeakable joy he discovered it under a piece of tattered drugget Why this is the sort of thing I meant he said feeling in his pocket and discovering that he had exactly a sovereign How much do you want for it I dunno said the boy I don t mind three shillings said Horace who did not wish to appear too keen at first I ll tell the guv nor when he comes in was the reply and you can look in later I want it at once insisted Horace Come I ll give you three and six for it It s more than it s wurf replied the candid youth Perhaps said Horace but I m rather pressed for time If you ll change this sovereign I ll take the bottle away with me You seem uncommon anxious to get old on it mister said the boy with sudden suspicion Nonsense said Horace I live close by and I thought I might as well take it that s all Oh if that s all you can wait till the guv nor s in I I mayn t be passing this way again for some time said Horace Bound to be if you live close by and the provoking youth returned to his Sniggers Do you call this attending to your master s business said Horace Listen to me you young rascal I ll give you five shillings for it You re not going to be fool enough to refuse an offer like that I ain t goin to be fool enough to refuse it nor yet I ain t goin to be fool enough to take it cause I m only ere to see as nobody don t come in and sneak fings I ain t got no authority to sell anyfink and I don t know the proice o nuffink so there you ave it Take the five shillings said Horace and if it s too little I ll come round and settle with your master later I thought you said you wasn t likely to be porsin again No mister you don t kid me that way Horace had a mad impulse to snatch up the precious bottle then and there and make off with it and might have yielded to the temptation with disastrous consequences had not an elderly man entered the shop at that moment He was bent and wore rather more fluff and flue upon his person than most well dressed people would consider necessary but he came in with a certain air of authority nevertheless mister Dilger sir piped the youth ere s a gent took a fancy to this ere brass pot o yours Says he must ave it Five shillings he d got to but I told him he d ave to wait till you come in Quite right my lad said mister Dilger cocking a watery but sharp old eye at Horace Five shillings Ah sir you can t know much about these hold brass antiquities to make an orfer like that I know as much as most people said Horace But let us say six shillings Couldn t be done sir couldn t indeed Why I give a pound for it myself at Christie s as sure as I m standin ere in the presence o my Maker and you a sinner he declared impressively if rather ambiguously Your memory is not quite accurate said Horace You bought it last night from a man of the name of Rapkin who lets lodgings in Vincent Square and you paid exactly half a crown for it If you say so I dare say it s correct sir said mister Dilger without exhibiting the least confusion And if I did buy it off mister Rapkin he s a respectable party and ain t likely to have come by it dishonest I never said he did What will you take for the thing Well just look at the work in it They don t turn out the like o that nowadays Dutch that is what they used for to put their milk and such like in Damn it said Horace completely losing his temper I know what it was used for Will you tell me what you want for it I couldn t let a curiosity like that go a penny under thirty shillings said mister Dilger affectionately It would be robbin myself I ll give you a sovereign for it there said Horace You know best what profit that represents That s my last word My last word to that sir is good hevenin said the worthy man Good evening then said Horace and walked out of the shop rather to bring mister Dilger to terms than because he really meant to abandon the bottle for he dared not go back without it and he had nothing about him just then on which he could raise the extra ten shillings supposing the dealer refused to trust him for the balance and the time was growing dangerously short Fortunately the well worn ruse succeeded for mister Dilger ran out after him and laid an unwashed claw upon his coat sleeve Don t go mister he said I like to do business if I can though pon my word and honour a sovereign for a work o art like that Well just for luck and bein my birthday we ll call it a deal Horace handed over the coin which left him with a few pence There ought to be a lid or stopper of some sort he said suddenly What have you done with that No sir there you re mistook you are indeed I do assure you you never see a pot of this partickler pattern with a lid to it Never Oh don t you though said Horace I know better Never mind he said as he recollected that the seal was in Fakrash s possession I ll take it as it is Don t trouble to wrap it up I m in rather a hurry It was almost dark when he got back to his rooms where he found the Jinnee shaking with mingled rage and apprehension No welcome to thee he cried Dilatory dog that thou art Hadst thou delayed another minute I would have called down some calamity upon thee Well you need not trouble yourself to do that now returned Ventimore Here s your bottle and you can creep into it as soon as you please But the seal shrieked the Jinnee What hast thou done with the seal which was upon the bottle Why you ve got it yourself of course said Horace in one of your pockets O thou of base antecedents howled Fakrash shaking out his flowing draperies How should I have the seal This is but a fresh device of thine to undo me Don t talk rubbish retorted Horace You made the Professor give it up to you yesterday You must have lost it somewhere or other Never mind I ll get a large cork or bung which will do just as well And I ve lots of sealing wax I will have no seal but the seal of Suleyman declared the Jinnee For with no other will there be security Verily I believe that that accursed sage thy friend hath contrived by some cunning to get the seal once more into his hands I will go at once to his abode and compel him to restore it I wouldn t said Horace feeling extremely uneasy for it was evidently a much simpler thing to let a Jinnee out of a bottle than to get him in again He s quite incapable of taking it And if you go out now you ll only make a fuss and attract the attention of the Press which I thought you rather wanted to avoid I shall attire myself in the garments of a mortal even those I assumed on a former occasion said Fakrash and as he spoke his outer robes modernised into a frock coat Thus shall I escape attention Wait one moment said Horace What is that bulge in your breast pocket Of a truth said the Jinnee looking relieved but not a little foolish as he extracted the object it is indeed the seal You re in such a hurry to think the worst of everybody you see said Horace Now do try to carry away with you into your seclusion a better opinion of human nature Perdition to all the people of this age cried Fakrash re assuming his green robe and turban for I now put no faith in human beings and would afflict them all were not the Lord Mayor on whom be peace mightier than I Therefore while it is yet time take thou the stopper and swear that after I am in this bottle thou wilt seal it as before and cast it into deep waters where no eye will look upon it more With all the pleasure in the world said Horace only you must keep your part of the bargain first You will kindly obliterate all recollection of yourself and the brass bottle from the minds of every human being who has had anything to do with you or it Not so objected the Jinnee for thus wouldst thou forget thy compact Oh very well leave me out then said Horace Not that anything could make me forget you Fakrash swept his right hand round in a half circle It is accomplished he said All recollection of myself and yonder bottle is now erased from the memories of every one but thyself But how about my client said Horace I can t afford to lose him you know He shall return unto thee said the Jinnee trembling with impatience Now perform thy share Horace had triumphed It had been a long and desperate duel with this singular being who was at once so crafty and so childlike so credulous and so suspicious so benevolent and so malign Again and again he had despaired of victory but he had won at last In another minute or so this formidable Jinnee would be safely bottled once more and powerless to intermeddle and plague him for the future And yet in the very moment of triumph quixotic as such scruples may seem to some Ventimore s conscience smote him He could not help a certain pity for the old creature who was shaking there convulsively prepared to re enter his bottle prison rather than incur a wholly imaginary doom Fakrash had aged visibly within the last hour now he looked even older than his three thousand and odd years True he had led Horace a fearful life of late but at first at least his intentions had been good His gratitude if mistaken in its form was the sign of a generous disposition Not every Jinnee surely would have endeavoured to press untold millions and honours and dignities of all kinds upon him in return for a service which most mortals would have considered amply repaid by a brace of birds and an invitation to an evening party And how was Horace treating him He was taking what in his heart he felt to be a rather mean advantage of the Jinnee s ignorance of modern life to cajole him into returning to his captivity Why not suffer him to live out the brief remainder of his years for he could hardly last more than another century or two at most in freedom Fakrash had learnt his lesson he was not likely to interfere again in human affairs he might find his way back to the Palace of the Mountain of the Clouds and end his days there in peaceful enjoyment of the society of such of the Jinn as might still survive unbottled So obeying against his own interests some kindlier impulse Horace made an effort to deter the Jinnee who was already hovering in air above the neck of the bottle in a swirl of revolving draperies like some blundering old bee vainly endeavouring to hit the opening into his hive mister Fakrash he cried before you go any farther listen to me There s no real necessity after all for you to go back to your bottle If you ll only wait a little But the Jinnee who had now swelled to gigantic proportions and whose form and features were only dimly recognisable through the wreaths of black vapour in which he was involved answered him from his pillar of smoke in a terrible voice Wouldst thou still persuade me to linger he cried Hold thy peace and be ready to fulfil thine undertaking But look here persisted Horace I should feel such a brute if I sealed you up without telling you The whirling and roaring column in shape like an inverted cone was being fast sucked down into the vessel till only a semi materialised but highly infuriated head was left above the neck of the bottle Must I tarry it cried till the Lord Mayor arrive with his Memlooks and the hour of safety is expired By my head if thou delayest another instant I will put no more faith in thee And I will come forth once more and afflict thee and thy friends ay and all the dwellers in this accursed city with the most painful and unheard of calamities And with these words the head sank into the bottle with a loud clap resembling thunder Horace hesitated no longer The Jinnee himself had absolved him from all further scruples to imperil Sylvia and her parents not to mention all London out of consideration for one obstinate and obnoxious old demon would clearly be carrying sentiment much too far Accordingly he made a rush for the jar and slipped the metal cover over the mouth of the neck which was so hot that it blistered his fingers and seizing the poker he hammered down the secret catch until the lid fitted as closely as Suleyman himself could have required Then he stuffed the bottle into a kit bag adding a few coals to give it extra weight and toiled off with it to the nearest steamboat pier where he spent his remaining pence in purchasing a ticket to the Temple Next day the following paragraph appeared in one of the evening papers which probably had more space than usual at its disposal SINGULAR OCCURRENCE ON A PENNY STEAMER A gentleman on board one of the Thames steamboats so we are informed by an eye witness met with a somewhat ludicrous mishap yesterday evening It appears that he had with him a small portmanteau or large hand bag which he was supporting on the rail of the stern bulwark Just as the vessel was opposite the Savoy Hotel he incautiously raised his hand to the brim of his hat thereby releasing hold of the bag which overbalanced itself and fell into the deepest part of the river where it instantly sank The owner whose carelessness occasioned considerable amusement to passengers in his immediate vicinity appeared no little disconcerted by the oversight and was not unnaturally reticent as to the amount of his loss though he was understood to state that the bag contained nothing of any great value However this may be he has probably learnt a lesson which will render him more careful in future THE EPILOGUE On a certain evening in May Horace Ventimore dined in a private room at the Savoy as one of the guests of mister Samuel Wackerbath In fact he might almost be said to be the guest of the evening as the dinner was given by way of celebrating the completion of the host s new country house at Lipsfield of which Horace was the architect and also to congratulate him on his approaching marriage which was fixed to take place early in the following month with Miss Sylvia Futvoye Quite a small and friendly party said mister Wackerbath looking round on his numerous sons and daughters as he greeted Horace in the reception room Only ourselves you see Miss Futvoye a young lady with whom you are fairly well acquainted and her people and an old schoolfellow of mine and his wife who are not yet arrived He s a man of considerable eminence he added with a roll of reflected importance in his voice quite worth your cultivating Sir Lawrence Pountney his name is I don t know if you remember him but he discharged the onerous duties of Lord Mayor of London the year before last and acquitted himself very creditably in fact he got a baronetcy for it As the year before last was the year in which Horace had paid his involuntary visit to the Guildhall he was able to reply with truth that he did remember Sir Lawrence He was not altogether comfortable when the ex Lord Mayor was announced for it would have been more than awkward if Sir Lawrence had chanced to remember him Fortunately he gave no sign that he did so though his manner was graciousness itself Delighted my dear mister Ventimore he said pressing Horace s hand almost as warmly as he had done that October day of the dais most delighted to make your acquaintance I am always glad to meet a rising young man and I hear that the house you have designed for my old friend here is a perfect palace a marvel sir I knew he was my man declared mister Wackerbath as Horace modestly disclaimed Sir Lawrence s compliment You remember Pountney my dear fellow that day when we were crossing Westminster Bridge together and I was telling you I thought of building Go to one of the leading men an R A and all that sort of thing you said then you ll be sure of getting your money s worth But I said No I like to choose for myself to ah exercise my own judgment in these matters And there s a young fellow I have in my eye who ll beat em all if he s given the chance I m off to see him now And off I went to Great Cloister Street for he hadn t those palatial offices of his in Victoria Street at that time without losing another instant and dropped in on him with my little commission Didn t I Ventimore You did indeed said Horace wondering how far these reminiscences would go And continued mister Wackerbath patting Horace on the shoulder from that day to this I ve never had a moment s reason to regret it We ve worked in perfect sympathy His ideas coincided with mine I think he found that I met him so to speak on all fours Ventimore assented though it struck him that a happier expression might and would have been employed if his client had remembered one particular interview in which he had not figured to advantage They went in to dinner in a room sumptuously decorated with panels of grey green brocade and softly shaded lamps and screens of gilded leather through the centre of the table rose a tall palm its boughs hung with small electric globes like magic fruits This palm said the Professor who was in high good humour really gives quite an Oriental look to the table Personally I think we might reproduce the Arabian style of decoration and arrangement generally in our homes with great advantage I often wonder it never occurred to my future son in law there to turn his talents in that direction and design an Oriental interior for himself Nothing more comfortable and luxurious for a bachelor s purposes I m sure said his wife Horace managed to make himself quite comfortable enough as it was He has the most delightful rooms in Vincent Square Ventimore heard her remark to Sir Lawrence I shall never forget the first time we dined there just after my daughter and he were engaged I was quite astonished everything was so perfect quite simple you know but so ingeniously arranged and his landlady such an excellent cook too Still of course in many ways it will be nicer for him to have a home of his own With such a beautiful and charming companion to share it with said Sir Lawrence in his most florid manner the ah poorest home would prove a Paradise indeed And I suppose now my dear young lady he added raising his voice to address Sylvia you are busy making your future abode as exquisite as taste and research can render it ransacking all the furniture shops in London for treasures and going about to auctions or do you ah delegate that department to mister Ventimore I do go about to old furniture shops Sir Lawrence she said but not auctions I m afraid I should only get just the thing I didn t want if I tried to bid And she added in a lower voice turning to Horace I don t believe you would be a bit more successful Horace What makes you say that Sylvia he asked with a start Why do you mean to say you ve forgotten how you went to that auction for papa and came away without having managed to get a single thing she said What a short memory you must have There was only tender mockery in her eyes absolutely no recollection of the sinister purchase he had made at that sale or how nearly it had separated them for ever So he hastened to admit that perhaps he had not been particularly successful at the auction in question Sir Lawrence next addressed him across the table I was just telling missus Futvoye he said how much I regretted that I had not the privilege of your acquaintance during my year of office A Lord Mayor as you doubtless know has exceptional facilities for exercising hospitality and it would have afforded me real pleasure if your first visit to the Guildhall could have been paid under my hm ha auspices You are very kind said Horace very much on his guard I could not wish to pay it under better I flatter myself said the ex Lord Mayor that while in office I did my humble best to maintain the traditions of the City and I was fortunate enough to have the honour of receiving more than the average number of celebrities as guests But I had one great disappointment I must tell you It had always been a dream of mine that it might fall to my lot to present some distinguished fellow countryman with the freedom of the City By some curious chance when the opportunity seemed about to occur the thing was put off and I missed it missed it by the nearest hair breadth Ah well Sir Lawrence said Ventimore one can t have everything For my part put in Lady Pountney who had only caught a word or two of her husband s remarks what I miss most is having the sentinels present arms whenever I went out for a drive They did it so nicely and respectfully I confess I enjoyed that My husband never cared much for it Indeed he wouldn t even use the State coach unless he was absolutely obliged He was as obstinate as a mule about it I see Lady Pountney the Professor put in that you share the common prejudice against mules It s quite a mistaken one The mule has never been properly appreciated in this country He is really the gentlest and most docile of creatures I can t say I like them myself said Lady Pountney such a mongrel sort of animal neither one thing nor the other And they re hideous too Anthony added his wife And not at all clever There you re mistaken my dear said the Professor they are capable of almost human intelligence I have had considerable personal experience of what a mule can do he informed Lady Pountney who seemed still incredulous More than most people indeed and I can assure you my dear Lady Pountney that they readily adapt themselves to almost any environment and will endure the greatest hardships without exhibiting any signs of distress I see by your expression Ventimore that you don t agree with me eh Horace had to set his teeth hard for a moment lest he should disgrace himself by a peal of untimely mirth but by a strong effort of will he managed to command his muscles Well sir he said I ve only chanced to come into close contact with one mule in my life and frankly I ve no desire to repeat the experience You happened to come upon an unfavourable specimen that s all said the Professor There are exceptions to every rule This animal Horace said was certainly exceptional enough in every way Do tell us all about it pleaded one of the Miss Wackerbaths and all the ladies joined in the entreaty until Horace found himself under the necessity of improvising a story which it must be confessed fell exceedingly flat This final ordeal past he grew silent and thoughtful as he sat there by Sylvia s side looking out through the glazed gallery outside upon the spring foliage along the Embankment the opaline river and the shot towers and buildings on the opposite bank glowing warm brown against an evening sky of silvery blue Not for the first time did it seem strange incredible almost to him that all these people should be so utterly without any recollection of events which surely might have been expected to leave some trace upon the least retentive memory and yet it only proved once more how thoroughly and honourably the old Jinnee now slumbering placidly in his bottle deep down in unfathomable mud opposite the very spot where they were dining had fulfilled his last undertaking Fakrash the brass bottle and all the fantastic and embarrassing performances were indeed as totally forgotten as though they had never been And it is but too probable that even this modest and veracious account of them will prove to have been included in the general act of oblivion though the author will trust as long as possible that Fakrash el Aamash may have neglected to provide for this particular case and that the history of the Brass Bottle may thus be permitted to linger awhile in the memories of some at least of its readers END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BRASS BOTTLE This file should be named thirty thousand six hundred eighty nine txt or thirty thousand six hundred eighty
