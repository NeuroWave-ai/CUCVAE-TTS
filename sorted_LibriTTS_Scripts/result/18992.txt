fourteen eighteen ninety six Four hundred and fifty copies printed of which this is No Copyright eighteen ninety six BY THE AMERICAN FOLK LORE SOCIETY All rights reserved The Riverside Press Cambridge Mass U S A Electrotyped and Printed by H O Houghton and Company PREFACE In the Popular Science Monthly for July eighteen eighty six there was printed a somewhat miscellaneous assortment of customs and superstitions under the title Animal and Plant Lore of Children This article was in the main composed of reminiscences of my own childhood spent in Northern Ohio though two or three friends of New England rearing contributed personal recollections Seldom is a line cast which brings ashore such an abundant catch as did my initial folk lore paper A footnote had by the advice of a friend been appended asking readers to send similar lore to the writer About seventy answers were received from all sorts of localities ranging from Halifax to New Orleans These numerous letters convinced me that there was even then before the foundation of the national Society a somewhat general interest in folk lore not a scientific interest but a fondness for the subject matter itself Many who do not care for folk lore as a subject of research are pleased to have recalled to them the fancies beliefs and customs of childhood and early youth A single proverb superstition riddle or tradition may by association of ideas act like a magic mirror in bringing back hundreds of long forgotten people pastimes and occupations And whatever makes one young if only for an hour will ever fascinate The greater number of those who kindly responded to the request for additional notes to my animal and plant lore were naturally those of somewhat literary or scientific tastes and pursuits Many letters were from teachers many others from physicians a few from professional scientists the rest from men and women of various callings who had been pleased by suggestions that aroused memories of the credulous and unreflecting period in their own lives The abundant material thus brought in which consisted of folk lore items of the most varied kind was read gratefully and with pleasant surprise The items were assorted and catalogued after some provisional fashion of my own Succeeding papers issued in the Popular Science Monthly brought in further accessions I gradually formed the habit of asking as opportunity offered any one and every one for folk lore Nurses abound in such knowledge Domestic help whether housekeepers seamstresses or servants whether American or foreign all by patient questioning were induced to give of their full store The folk lorist who chances to have a pet superstition or two of his own that he never fails to observe has an open sesame to beliefs of this sort held by any one with whom he comes in contact The fact that I have I blush to confess it a preference for putting on my right shoe before the left has I dare say been the providential means of bringing to me hundreds of bits of folk lore Many times has the exposure of this weakness instantly opened up an opportunity for asking questions about kindred customs and superstitions I once asked an Irish peasant girl from County Roscommon if she could tell me any stories about fairies Do ye give in to fairies then ma am she joyously asked adding A good many folks don t give in to them believe in them i e the fairies Apparently she was heartily glad to meet some one who spoke her own language From that hour she was ever ready to tell me tales or recall old sayings and beliefs about the doings and powers of the good people of old Ireland A stewardess properly approached can communicate a deal of lore in her leisure hours during a three or four days ocean trip Oftentimes a caller has by chance let drop a morsel that was quickly picked up and preserved The large amount of botanical and zooelogical

superstitions belonging to English speaking folk Numerous as are the items here presented only a part of the matter is included the collector having preferred to reserve for separate presentation superstitions connected with animal and plant lore material which would require a space about equal to that here occupied Again the present gathering by no means pretends to completeness while certain departments may be adequately represented other sections exhibit scarce more than a gleaning The collection therefore will be looked on as a first essay subject to revision and enlargement The designations of locality will suffice to show the width of the area from which information has been obtained as well as the degree of similarity which appears in the folk lore of different regions belonging to this wide territory Here and there may be observed items showing a measure of originality a new superstition may have arisen or an ancient one been modified according to the fancy of an individual in consequence of defective memory or in virtue of misapprehension But on the whole such peculiarities make no figure nor does recent immigration play any important part Almost the entire body of this tradition belongs to the English stock it is the English population which together with the language has imposed on other elements of American life its polity society ethics and tradition This relation is not an isolated phenomenon on the contrary it is entirely in the line of experience Language is the most important factor which determines usage and influences character this result is effected through the literature oral or written with which in virtue of the possession of a particular speech any given people is brought into contact In this process race goes for little Borrowing the tongue of a superior race a subject population receives also the songs tales habits inclinations which go with the speech human nature in all times essentially imitative copies qualities which are united with presumed superiority to this process not even racial hostility is a bar assimilation and transmission go on in spite of hatred directed against the persons who are the object of the imitation such a process may be observed in the recent history of Ireland Reception of new ideas however though promoted by the possession of a common language constituting a means of exchange is not limited by its absence on the contrary in all historical time among contiguous races takes place a transference of ideas which dislike and even warfare do not prevent Here the law seems to be that the lower culture has relatively little effect on the higher with which it is in contact while the superior civilization speedily influences an inferior one Nor is the effect confined to the higher classes of any given society beginning with these the new knowledge descends through all ranks and everywhere carries its transforming influence What is true of written literature in a less degree is true of oral songs and tales rites and customs beliefs and superstitions diffuse themselves from the civilization which happens to be in fashion with a rapidity greater or less according to the interworking of a multitude of modifying forces In the other direction from the lower culture to the higher exchange is slow albeit likely to be promoted in certain cases by peculiar conditions such as the deliberate literary choice which seeks opportunity for archaistic representation or the respect which an advanced race may have for the magical ability of a simple tribe believed to be nearer to nature and therefore more likely to remain in communion with natural forces But these exceptional effects are of small relative moment the general principle continually at work in the main controls the result In regard to the themes of stories especially the many tongues and dialects of Western Europe offer scarcely more variation than will be often found to exist among the versions of the same tale which may be discovered in a single canton The spirit of the language already mentioned as constituting the element of nationality taking possession of this common stock of knowledge moulds its precise form and sentiment in accordance with its own character it is in details rather than in outlines that racial differences are found to exist this principle applies in a considerable degree in the field of folk tales even between cultures so opposite as those of Western Europe and Western Africa In the case of superstitions the diffusive process though less rapid or effectual than in tales is nevertheless continually active in Europe at least a similar identity will probably be discovered But in this category the problem of separating what is general because human from that which is common because diffused always a complicated task will be found more difficult than in literary matter and without the aid of extensive collection insoluble It is possible to fall back on the consideration that after all such resolution matters not very much since in any case the survival of the belief indicates its humanity and for the purpose of the study of human nature borrowed superstitions may be cited as confidently as if original in the soil to which they have emigrated and where they have indissolubly intertwined themselves with thought and habit Again it is to be considered that while differences of speech impede but do not prevent integration changes of condition may have an immediate effect in producing differentiation Protestantism by banishing complicated usages connected with sacred days has caused English folk lore to vary from Continental so far this contrast seems a result of the alterations of the last three hundred years rather than of more remote inconsistency If these remarks are in any degree valid it follows that from the presence or absence of any particular item of belief in this or that English speaking district no conclusion is to be drawn the deficiency must be supposed to proceed from absence of record and seldom to depend on the structure of the population To this general doctrine as usual with such propositions may be observed minor exceptions Whatever doubts may be cast on the operation of the principle as applicable to England there can be no doubt that it is valid in the United States and Canada It is not however intended to assert that the contributions of the entire region covered in this collection are identical in character On the contrary it will be seen that the record made in certain districts as for example in Newfoundland and among the Mountain Whites of the Alleghanies presents superstition as more primitive and active than in the eastern United States But this vitality is only to be regarded as the persistence of a stock once proper to English speaking folk and by no means as indicating a diversity of origins The chief value of a collection such as the present consists in the light it may be made to cast on the history of mental processes in other words on its psychologic import To appreciate this value it is needful to understand the quality in which superstition really consists This distinguishing characteristic is obscured by the definitions of English dictionaries which describe superstition as a disease depending on an excess of religious sentiment which disposes the person so affected to unreasonable credulity In the same spirit it has been the wont of divines to characterize superstition and unbelief as opposite poles between which lies the golden mean of discreet faith But this view is inadequate and erroneous The manner of conception mentioned has been borrowed from Latin and Greek writers of the Roman republic and of the Imperial period In primitive Roman usage superstitio and religio were synonyms both perhaps etymologically considered expressed no more than that habit of careful consideration with which a prudent man will measure the events which encounter him and determine his conduct with a view to consequences Superstitio may have indicated only the overstanding of the phenomenon the pause necessary for its deliberate inspection By Cicero a distinction was made the word was now employed to designate a state of mind under the influence of supernatural terrors In the Greek tongue a similar conception was expressed by the word deisidaimonia or fear of daemons a term in bad odor as associated with practices of Oriental temple worship representing primitive conceptions and therefore odious to later and more enlightened Hellenic thought Established as a synonym of the Greek noun superstitio received all the meaning which Plutarch elaborated as to the former the idea of that excellent heathen that true piety is the mean between atheism and credulity has given a sense to the word superstition and become a commonplace of Christian hortatory literature It is however sufficiently obvious that the signification mentioned does not have application to the omens recorded in the present volume the majority of which have no direct connection with spiritual beings while it will also be allowed that these do not lie without the field ordinarily covered by the word superstition For our purposes therefore it is necessary to enlarge this definition This may be done by emphasizing the first component part of the word and introducing into it the notion of what has been left over or of survival made familiar by the genius of Edward B Tylor In these lingering notions we have opinions respecting relations of cause and effect which have resulted as a necessary consequence from past intellectual conditions A superstition accordingly I should define as a belief respecting causal sequence depending on reasoning proper to an outgrown culture According to this view with adequate information it would be possible to trace the mental process in virtue of which arise such expectations of futurity and to discover the methods of their gradual modification and eventual supersession by generalizations founded on experience more accurate and extensive Yet it is not to be assumed that in each and every case such elucidation will be possible In all human conduct there is an element which cannot be designated otherwise than as accidental this uncertainty appears to be greater the reaction against the natural conditions less definite the more primitive is the life It is impossible to forecast in what manner a savage may be impressed by an event of which he can note only external conditions or how his action may respond to the impression One may guess what opinion an augur would form concerning the appearance of a single eagle or raven but it would be labor lost to attempt to conjecture the manner in which the imagination of the observer would explain a flight of these birds or what complicated rules augural art might evolve to guide the interpretation This accidental quality and the arbitrariness with which phenomena are judged to be ominous will be visible in the numerous signs here recorded At first sight it may be thought that extreme folly is their salient quality Yet if we take a wide view the case is reversed we are surprised not at the unintelligibility of popular belief but at its simplicity and at the frequency with which we can discern the natural process of unsystematic conjecture Such judgments are not to be treated with derision as subjects of ridicule but to be seriously examined as revealing the natural procedure of intelligence limited to a superficial view of phenomena This consideration leads to an important remark The term survival expresses a truth but only a part of the truth Usages habits opinions which are classed as superstition exhibit something more than the unintelligent and unconscious persistence of habit Folk lore survives and popular practices continue only so long as endures a method of thinking corresponding to that in which these had their origin Individual customs may be preserved simply as a matter of thoughtless habit yet in general it is essential that these usages should be related to conscious intellectual life so soon as they cease to be so explicable they begin to pass into oblivion The chapters of this collection therefore will emphasize the doctrine that the essential elements of human nature continue to exist however opposite may be the actions in which its operations are manifested In examining many of the maxims of conduct here set forth we are able to understand the motives in which they had their being we perceive that the inclination has not disappeared however checked by mediation through complex experience and however counteracted by the weight of later maxims The examiner finds that he himself shares the mental state of the superstitious person if not he can easily make an effort of imagination which will enable him to comprehend its evident reasonableness Thus while superstitions are properly designated as survivals it will in many cases be found that they represent a survival of ratiocination as well as of action In some striking examples also it happens that the modern notion indicates the continuance of conceptions more ancient than a mass of connected ideas which have wholly perished The former endure because being simple in their nature they represent a human impulse an impulse which animated the prehistoric ancestor as well as the modern descendant When this tendency ceases to operate the plant suddenly withers So it is that an elimination of these beliefs which formed the science of remote antiquity has taken place in our own century which has worked a change greater than fifty preceding generations because it has been able to introduce generalizations with which ancient notions and habits are perceived no longer to coincide As illustrations of the psychologic value of the material it may be permitted to offer brief comments on the several sections In the usages of mothers and nurses it is interesting to observe with what persistence survives the conception that the initial action of the series determines the character of events sequent in order It is still a universal practice to consecrate every baby by a rite not ecclesiastical The infant on his first journey must be taken to a height symbolic of his future fortune an elevation believed to secure the prosperity of his whole subsequent career It would be of interest to learn what analogies the practice has among races in a primitive condition of culture The babe of the Pueblo of Sia when on the fourth day four being a sacred number for the first time he is taken from the dark chamber is ritually presented to his father the Sun similarly in a superstition of the present series I know not how generally observed Sunday is said to be the day on which the infant is first to be carried into the sunshine It is likely that such continuing customs represent feeble echoes of pre Christian dedicatory ceremonies which in the first instance were themselves founded on a corresponding habit of thought according to an opposite yet connected system of notions we find Protestant Christianity still preserving a memento of the world old and universal belief in a crowd of malicious spirits prepared at every moment to take up their residence in the convenient shelter of the human frame as a hermit crab watches for a suitable shell in which to make his home It must be owned that the volume of observances connected with infancy here presented is very inadequate it is certain that a nurse of a century ago would have been familiar with a vastly more extensive array of duties and cautions As we go back in time and culture action becomes more restricted Where the effects of any line of conduct are unknown adherence to precedent is all important every part of the life must be administered according to a complicated system of rules while common prudence is considered as inseparable from religious obligation The following section presents us with interesting material in the exhibition of ideas and customs which are maintained by children themselves and which they learn from one another rather than from their elders It is true that these are of necessity the reflection of the conceptions and practice of older persons but according to the law of their nature it is found that children often exhibit a peculiar conservatism in virtue of which habits of thought still exercise control which among men and women have been outgrown This is illustrated in popular games and songs which children have orally preserved and the same is true of their superstitions Women especially who may peruse this collection will be surprised to find how many of the items here recorded will seem familiar and at the same time to have received credence in the case of a particularly clear minded person free from any disposition toward credulity nearly a hundred of these superstitions were remembered The ideas in question perhaps at no time more than half believed have frequently altogether faded into oblivion Attention should be paid also to the imaginative power of the youthful mind and the manner in which beliefs are visualized and appear as realities of perception To illustrate this principle have been included a few examples belonging rather to individual than to general opinion The little girl who without any direct instruction imagines that the light of the heaven gleams through the orifices we call stars who sees celestial beings in meteor form winging their way across the skies or who is surrounded by the benevolent spirits which her discriminating education banishing the terrors of the supernatural world has permitted to exist for her comprehension illustrates that readiness of fancy and control of vision by expectation which belongs to humanity in the reverse degree of the reflective habit Herein childish conceptions and vivacity of feeling represent the human faculty which education may control but cannot obliterate Beliefs relating to the influence of physiognomy present us with a very limited anthology of popular ideas which in elaborate developments have been expanded into pseudo sciences and fill whole libraries of learned misinformation These notions may be divided into two classes On the one hand appear indications founded on natural analogies as when we still speak of close fistedness On the other side many of these associations are arbitrary as when the study of spots on the nails is supposed to give means for determining future fortune Such conclusions depend partly on the correct opinion that in the cradle lies the future man with all elements of his complex nature and partly on external marks the interpretation of which is purely arbitrary The chapter on Projects presents the reader with a class of usages sufficiently foolish when considered in themselves but none the less demanding attention as exhibiting in full energy the survival at the end of the nineteenth century of the practice of divination It is true that these attempts to forecast the future are commonly made in a sportive manner and only with partial belief being now for the most part reduced to social sports They belong also almost exclusively to the female sex who by way of amusement still keep up rites which are to determine the future partner in life Yet that these observances were formerly performed with sober forethought may be seen by the superstitious character with which in retired districts they are still invested it is likely that in this limited field we have the final echoes of ceremonies employed to determine action and to supply means for the estimation of every species of good or evil fortune Among these customs a considerable part may be of relatively recent origin but a number are undoubtedly ancient Particularly remarkable is the word by which in the English folk lore of America at least these practices seem to have been popularly entitled Dictionaries give no aid in explaining the signification of the word project here used in the sense of a ceremony of divination I cannot offer any explanation as to the probable antiquity of the term neither middle Latin nor Romance languages seem to offer parallels One might guess that if all were known the use might be found to proceed from the special language of mediaeval magic or astrology perhaps mirror divination With practices of this sort has been connected an incident of colonial history During the accusations brought against alleged witches of Salem Massachusetts in sixteen ninety two the chief agents were a group of children belonging to a particular neighborhood of that town It has been asserted that these young persons previous to the outbreak of the excitement formed a circle of girls in the habit of meeting for the purpose of performing magical tricks to use a phrase employed by Cotton Mather and that it was experience so acquired that fitted them for the part afterwards played in the trials This statement has been repeated by so many recent writers as to become a commonplace of accepted history it would seem however that the representation depends on the invention of a modern essayist who transferred to the colonial period ideas derived from his acquaintance with the phenomena of contemporary spiritualistic seances and that the habit of trying projects no doubt universal in colonial times had nothing to do with the delusion in question See note p one hundred fifty three Ancient popular divination would as a matter of course have taken a ritual character and been associated especially with particular seasons It is therefore more than an accident that many of these harmless observations seem especially connected with Halloween The Day of All Saints of which name our English title is a translation precedes that of All Souls for the institution and significance of both the church has its explanation Yet this account is not the correct one these feasts descend not from any Christian ecclesiastical ordination but from an ancient festival of the dead they represent the survival of a celebration which probably consisted in the bestowing on the departed after the ingathering of the harvest his share of the fruits of the ground conveyed by direct material administration That at such a period spirits of the dead should be supposed to walk the earth would be a matter of course in early time these would be conceived as returning in order to behold and join the sacred dances of the tribe Accordingly there seem to be indications showing an original association of some of these usages with the lower world such may be the significance of the backward movement or the inversion of garments occasionally recommended In order to put one s self in connection with the world of darkness it is essential to reverse the procedure which is proper for the realm of light This principle appearing in mediaeval magic could also be illustrated from savage custom It can hardly be doubted that the limitation of such forecasts to the field of choosing partners for life is but a survival of an older practice in which divinations of fortune in other directions also were sought on the day sacred to the dead it may be that the latter as having power and knowledge were invoked to act as illuminators The stress laid on dreams appears to imply a practice of evoking spirits whether of the deceased or of the living In the division entitled Love and Marriage we are dealing not with ceremonies but signs in the former case a voluntary action is implied in the consulter of fate in the latter the subject is passive The word signs is a popular term for omens of any kind in this case we cannot be in error in seeking a Latin derivation signum being classically used in this sense Here again the prognostics in question are respected only by women and at the present time with but a light admixture of genuine credulity unless among people of secluded districts retaining old world notions Foolish as are these ideas of sequence they indicate a habit of association anciently prevalent which in early times had the most serious consequences The gathering of expectations relating to Wishes shows that the name and idea of folk lore must not be limited to primitive beliefs or to the ideas of uneducated persons The assumption that an occurrence neither unusual nor characterized by any correspondent quality may promote the fulfilment of a contemporaneous desire illustrates the arbitrary nature of a considerable part of this lore Nevertheless it cannot be doubted that many of these beliefs if they could be followed back to their origins would be found to exhibit some process of consistent though erroneous reasoning as exhibited in the case of wishes made with reference to the state of the moon hereafter to be mentioned It is also to be observed that prayer to the evening star forms a feature of the usages in question Of dreams we are presented with a series in some degree representing their function in surviving belief The comparison of these with dream books still sold and used and with a more extensive collection of superstitions retained in this and other continents would no doubt offer curious results At present attention may be called only to one remarkable trait namely the interpretation of dreams by contraries This practice I conceive to be altogether modern and to have resulted from the extension of scientific culture which has lead to the discredit of more direct explanations So far as I am aware dreams in literature ancient or mediaeval are always presumed symbolically to represent the future and to be capable of straightforward interpretation The usages of folk medicine form a wide subject which would occupy many volumes such as the present a mere bibliography of the literature could not be included in the number of pages here allowed The gleaning also is in this case very imperfect the greater number of such Cures would fall in that part of the subject here omitted relating to the function of animals and plants In this field conceptions formerly operative have not yet disappeared the doctrine of signatures that is to say the rule that the healing object is indicated by its resemblance to the organ affected has scarcely passed into oblivion while popular systems of treatment are still based on rules not essentially different In addition to this guiding idea an exorcistic method has survived in our folk lore is retained the removal of the trouble in virtue of its transfer to another place or person Especially in the significant case of warts such rule of early medicine operates with full force Here as in other instances the obscure influence of suggestion plays a complicated part belief in the efficacy of any system of treatment appears sufficient to promote its effect These charms are perhaps sometimes effective even although no conscious attention is paid to the process but to enter on this field would be foreign to the present discussion It is sufficient to point out that in popular belief the preservation of the theory goes hand in hand with the survival of the practice Weather proverbs form an extensive body of popular observations here only partially recorded From the psychologic point of view the principal interest attaches to the mental causes of these prognostics Collectors have generally assumed that in this field experience is at the basis of a great part of the alleged knowledge It may be so with a few of the simpler signs yet even in respect to these great diversity is visible In general I should myself attach small importance to this consideration Remarkable in man regarded as an intellectual being is the variation to be observed in the effect of experience In certain relations of daily life the savage is as quick to learn and as accurate in his judgment as civilized man mention need only be made of his skill in the hunt and his intimacy with the forest But under complicated conditions whenever this action falls outside of daily habit he appears incapable of profiting by observation on the contrary it is usually imagination which dictates presumed experience The latter rarely corrects a superstition as already remarked discovery of error in the application of inherited theory is applied only to increase the complexity of the formula Not until the existence of a means of record and the formation of a body of observations capable of methodical arrangement is an erroneous belief superseded when the true causes of the events become manifest of this principle ideas respecting the weather constitute good illustrations Students of this collection will be surprised by the number and vitality of formulas and beliefs relative to the moon It is probable that the majority of the readers of the male sex will have no other associations with the newly born moon than that poetic sentiment which delights in the vision of the faint sickle silver through the twilight if they possess any further association with the planet it is likely to be no more than a vague dread of the effect of its radiance falling on a sleeper Women on the contrary will remember that the moon should be first seen not full face but over the the TN one right shoulder they will be aware that with such vision may be united a wish to which jesting fancy assigns a probability of accomplishment But these also will be surprised by the discovery that lunar divination is maintained with profound seriousness and that the honor paid to the orb is nothing else than a continued worship still connected with material blessings expected from its bounty This record reveals the central principle and natural cause of moon worship by making clear the effect still ascribed to the variation of the luminary It is the night which is especially the season of primitive worship from times long antecedent to written history as well among the lowest savages as among tribes possessing the beginnings of civilization changes of the starry heavens have been the object of devout contemplation and of reverent study To the watcher it is the rapid growth of the lunar crescent that is the most distinctive feature of differences between the nights an alteration which could not but be supposed to exercise control over human and animal life According to natural processes of thought it was inevitable that during the time when it so rapidly increases and becomes dominant in the sky the principle of growth should appear to prevail and on the other hand that the time of lunar diminution should be the season of decay Hence the conclusion probably prevalent in all times and countries that designs and undertakings which expect increase should belong to the new moon and that only operations which aim at the annihilation of existence should be carried on during the waning quarter In Hellenic antiquity the dark of the moon is mentioned as the suitable time for magical operations for such no doubt as were concerned with a forwarding of life Our collection exhibits the full survival of the usage and theory It is the new moon to which is dedicated the money that under its expanding influence will be sure to multiply it is at such time that the seed is to be put into the ground On the contrary the abolishment of pests and diminution of objects in which shrinkage is desired may be obtained by connecting these with the waning sphere Lunar change has had an important connection with ancient myth as well as with primitive ritual For the reason indicated the crescent was assigned as an emblem to goddesses of growth This ornament passed from Cybele and Diana to Mary as on the vault of saint Mark s the Virgin wears the starry robe of the earlier goddess so on garden walls of Venice she stands crowned with the crescent in the same manner as the divinities whom she has superseded In this connection is especially to be considered the habit of personification implied in our English rhymes Of late the doctrine which perceives in myth a symbolic expression of the forces of nature has fallen into comparative discredit a contempt explicable in view of the unscientific manner in which sun myths have been exploited our English sayings therefore are to be received as a welcome demonstration that one must not proceed too far in his attitude of doubt If the popular mind to day and in a country particularly accessible to the influences of modern culture worships the personified moon it may be considered as certain that antiquity did the like Mythology is woven out of so many strands that goddesses like Artemis and Diana may have been much more than lunar personifications but I think it can scarce be doubted that in a measure such they were There is to be noted a most important characteristic of modern superstition namely that the original usage and also the primitive theory has sometimes continued the longest because founded on the broadest and most human foundation The modern survival exhibits those fundamental conceptions out of which grew the complicated rites and elaborate mythologies of ancient religions In this manner as from a height of observation we are able to look back beyond recorded history and to trace the principles of historic development So may be elucidated problems which neither metaphysical speculation nor historical research has proved adequate to expound Comparative study of folk lore has placed in our hands a key which ingenious theorists proceeding with that imperfect knowledge of antiquity which can be gathered from books have lacked and for the want of which they have wandered in hopeless error In modern folk belief the influence of the sun is less directly apparent The custom of saluting the rising orb with which the day was once begun or of ascending high places where the benediction of the luminary could be obtained and the direct reverence to solar rays belonging to all primitive life survives only in the vague symbolism which until very lately has caused churches to be built on hills But a single essential feature of sun worship still survives not only among ignorant and isolated peasants but in the households and among the matrons of educated English speaking folk To this significant relic so far as I know missus Bergen has been the first to direct attention That the sun moves in a particular course must have been one of the first observations which primitive man made in regard to the movements of celestial bodies His cardinal rule being to perform everything decently and in order it followed that the precedent set in heaven was to be imitated on earth In any operation for which success must be sought progress must be sun wise the reverse order could be suitable only for operations of destructive magic tending to undo natural sequences Nevertheless even primitive man has a passion for originality a desire to obtain peculiarly intimate relations with nature which may be to the advantage of his own people probably from this consideration certain American tribes have reversed the ceremonial order so far at least as to make their processional movements in the opposite direction but our modern customs or household life show among the ancestors of English folk that the sun wise circuit entered not only into the religious life but also mingled with and directed the most ordinary actions Little does the modern housewife who in beating the egg instinctively stirs her spoon in one direction a form of movement usually recommended by no conscious association of ideas imagine that in the method of her action she is bearing testimony to the deepest ethical and ceremonial conceptions of remote ancestors yet there can be no doubt that such is the case Here also prevails the remarkable principle to which attention has already been directed The mythology of the ancient worship has perished but the notion which inspired the ritual practice has survived sun worship is thus shown to have been characteristic of our forefathers as indeed in all probability it was an original feature of primitive human life In this case also could we go back a little way in time we should probably find a conception of the sun as a personal being united with usages arising from contemplation of this path It is always found that especial conservatism attaches to customs and ideas associated with death the disinclination to exercise independent thought on a subject so serious leaves the field open for the continuance of ancestral notions and practices It is therefore natural that the volume of superstition associated with the end of life should only be paralleled by that connected with the marriage relation A vast number of actions and experiences still pass as the signs of approaching departure As in omens generally the prevailing principle is usually the effect of association of ideas the shock to the nerves consequent on the imagination of the occurrence is in the popular fancy inseparable from belief in its reality Hence the general tendency to insist on euphemistic speech the required abstinence from unpleasant suggestions the favete linguis of the Roman In this body of deeds to be avoided ancient and modern notions are interwoven One must not pass under a ladder for a ladder is used in modern executions one must not carry a spade through the house for with a spade is dug a grave More in accordance with fundamentally human ideas the delicate rose of fall presages the untimely waning of a youthful life As with all superstition the sign is not merely the prediction of an event it is felt that as the avoidance of the omen would be to escape its consequence so the careless action in becoming the presage of calamity is likewise its cause Here appear natural antinomies of human thought on the one hand the sense of the inevitableness of the designated fate on the other hand the consciousness of ability by altering conditions to change conclusions Thus the thoughts and actions of primitive man are inspired by the same contending intellectual forces which in later time appear under the guise of warring philosophies Still more remarkable are the remains of world old usage wherein may be remarked tendencies which have formerly been expressed in elaborate rituals In customs relating to death a controlling feature is that sense of individual possession which has been prevalent from a time antecedent to the rudimentary beginnings of civilization To early man doubt is but a change of state the head of the household in his place be it the tumulus erected for his shelter be it the distant land to which his spirit has been transported holds the same rights and is entitled to the same privileges which on earth he enjoyed His wives his slaves his steeds his arms are his own TN two property which none dare meddle with inasmuch as the departed now more than heretofore has the power to enforce his title In a measure therefore these possessions must accompany him on his voyage and remain with him in his new abode But this deprivation is too great in the natural course of things the living cannot waive so much and continue to live A part is given for the whole substitution takes the place of direct offering The dead is no more to be received among the living bringing with him as he does a claim on other lives by many methods by concealment placation substitution ritual exile he must be banned to the place where only on occasions he may be sought and consulted One of these methods of avoidance is the habit of making the return of the funeral procession so intricate that the spirit may be deceived in its attempt to retrace the route it is perhaps a consequence of this manner of thought that even now in retired districts it is held unwise for the mourners to return on the same path by which they proceeded These usages change their character inasmuch as the original intent of ceremonial actions being forgotten acts intended to secure more practical ends are performed in order to correspond to supposed obligations of decency Such is the case with the arrangement of the chamber of death with the stoppage of the clock of which traces are found in customary usage so it is with the inversion of garments of which also in our lore traces seem to linger Different perhaps is the idea underlying the covering of the mirror indications show that the practice was once extended to all objects in the room which formerly seems to have been draped with white cloth The object appears to have been to protect domestic objects from the contamination caused by contact with the dead which would protect them from subsequent employment by the living who otherwise could not with safety associate themselves with the other world just as even at the present time it is not held lucky to wear the garments of the departed In the same manner the Mosaic law commanded the Israelite to cover at the time of death the vessels used in his tent It has been remarked that white and not black is the proper color for such drapery The association of white with the dead as the hue of mourning is ancient it appears to me that the idea of ritual purity expressed by the color is at the bottom of the custom In Hellenic times white continued to be the hue most closely associated with the dead albeit black as the sign of melancholy was also introduced The character of funeral rites from Western Europe to Japan exhibits a similarity which in my judgment is to be explained only on the supposition of very early and long continued historical contact a contact otherwise demonstrable On the other hand a world old custom which may be set down as human and universal dictated and among all nomadic peoples continues to dictate the abandonment of any habitation in which a death has occurred The obvious motive is expressed in a surviving superstition that a second decease is likely to follow a first Death naturally impersonated and identified with the spirit of the departed will return to the place where he has once made himself at home and in which he has proprietary rights This idea constitutes a superstition which stands directly in the way of progress thus the Navajo refuses to build a house which at the first mortality among his family it would be necessary to desert The cause of the general custom is to be sought not in any sanitary principle but in the associations explained acting with superstitious force In the course of time and with the advance of culture such desertion is no longer possible and some means must be found by which the requirement shall be evaded the desired escape is effected by such alterations as shall vary the character of the mansion and indicate it as a new place of abode not subject to the perils of the home invaded by death The remarks which have been offered are presented only by way of suggestions which could be indefinitely extended To construct a commentary on the body of beliefs presented in this volume would be an enticing but a laborious task such notes also would far exceed in volume the compass of this work Besides as originally remarked the present collection contains but a part of the volume of surviving superstitions For these reasons it will be possible to proceed no farther In commending this collection to the attention of psychologists and to the continuing industry of students of folk lore I need only express my hope that it may be sufficient to make clear how far reaching are the studies for which folk lore supplies material The history of religion the theory of mythologies cannot afford to overlook modern popular beliefs in which ancient conceptions appear as still effective In the same way archaeology regarded only as the investigation of monuments and literatures and dissociated from the observation of continuing human life is devoid of inspiration and vitality These studies when accompanied with disregard of the existing world and indifference to the fortunes and relations of humanity as a whole remain not only incomplete but positively misleading and devoid of their best claim on respect and attention It is to be hoped that this interesting collection made under so many difficulties will have a useful effect in helping to emphasize this truth and to render obvious the possible uses of traditional information CAMBRIDGE MASS Dec twenty four eighteen ninety five CURRENT SUPERSTITIONS CHAPTER I BABYHOOD one The bairn that is born on fair Sunday Is bonny and loving and

Introduction page eight S G Drake Annals of Witchcraft in New England Boston eighteen sixty nine p one hundred eighty nine remarks that the principal accusers and witnesses in the witchcraft prosecutions of sixteen ninety two in Salem Mass were eight girls from eleven to twenty years of age and adds with reference to their conduct previous to the accusations These Females instituted frequent Meetings or got up as it would now be styled a Club which was called a Circle How frequent they had these Meetings is not stated but it was soon ascertained that they met to try projects or to do or produce superhuman Acts They doubtless had among them some book or books on Magic and Stories of Witchcraft which one or more of their Circle professed to understand and pretended to teach the Rest An examination of the evidence in the trials however shows not only no authority for these assertions but that no such meetings took place previous to the trials nor did any such circle exist Drake derived his information from a paper by S P Fowler who in an address before the Essex Institute in the year eighteen fifty six had remarked These girls together with Abigail Williams a niece of mister Parris aged eleven years were in the habit of meeting in a circle in the village to practise palmistry fortune telling c For such representation mister Fowler had no warrant it would seem that he had obtained the notion by transferring to the time of the trials his experience in connection with spiritualistic circles of his own day It is curious to observe how readily this suggestion was adopted and with what uniformity recent popular narratives of the delusion reiterate with increasing positiveness of phrase the unfounded assumption The expression to try projects is therefore taken by mister Drake from modern folk lore Fowler s address entitled An Account of the Life and Character of the reverend Samuel Parris of Salem Village and of his Connection with the Witchcraft Delusion of sixteen ninety two was printed in the Proceedings of the Essex Institute Salem Mass eighteen sixty two vol ii pp forty nine sixty eight and also separately Salem eighteen fifty seven For assistance in determining the origin of Drake s statement I am indebted to mister Abner C Goodell junior of Salem Mass W W N Nos fifteen sixteen The reader who is interested to know how much importance has been attributed to the caul will do well to consult Levinus Lemnius De Miraculis Occultis Naturae Chapter viii of Book II is headed De infantium recens natorum galeis seu tenui mollique membrana qua facies tanquam larva aut personata tegmine obducta ad primum lucis intuitum se spectandam exhibet The belief in the efficacy of the caul goes back at least to the time of saint Chrysostom who in the latter part of the fourth century preached against this with kindred superstitions Advertisements of cauls for sale at prices ranging from twenty guineas down have from time to time appeared in the London papers as recently as the middle of the present century if not even later No sixty See Current Superstitions Journal of American Folk Lore vol ii No V Nos one hundred sixteen one hundred eighteen The custom of consulting in augury the occasional white spots on the finger nails still survives despite the protestation of old Sir Thomas Browne He says That temperamental dignotions and conjecture of prevalent humours may be collected from spots in our Nails we are not averse to concede But yet not ready to admit sundry divinations vulgarly raised upon them Nor do we observe it verified in others what Cardan discovered as a property in himself to have found therein signs of most events that ever happened unto him Or that there is much considerable in that doctrine of Cheiromancy that spots in the top of the Nails do signifie things past in the middle things present and at the bottom events to come That White specks presage our felicity Blue ones our misfortunes That those in the Nail of the Thumb have significations of honour those in the fore Finger of riches and so respectively in other Fingers according to Planetical relations from whence they receive their names as Tricassus hath taken up and Picciolus well rejecteth No one hundred forty eight A very complete account of the signification of moles is quoted from The Greenwich Fortune Teller in Brand s Popular Antiquities Bonn s ed iii two hundred fifty four CHAPTERS IV AND V Two of the most interesting and most accessible lists of projects and Halloween observances are Gay s well known Shepherds Week and Burns s Halloween No one hundred seventy It is an interesting psychological fact that projects are in the great majority of cases tried by girls and young women rather than by boys and young men No one hundred seventy four Here as in many other cases it is assumed that young men and women are accustomed to indulge in promiscuous kissing The use of the word gentleman sufficiently indicates the level of society from which this project was obtained Gentleman in this sense signifies any male human being over sixteen It is often used more specifically to mean sweetheart as Mary and her gentleman were at the policemen s ball No one hundred eighty four On Biblical divination see Brand s Popular Antiquities Bonn s ed iii three hundred thirty seven three hundred thirty eight No one hundred eighty six This custom of divining the color of the hair of one s future wife or husband which is probably very old yet survives in many places but with interesting modifications as to the bird which gives the signal to try the divination In Westphalia it is at sight of the first swallow that the peasant looks to see if there be a hair under his foot According to Gay in England it is the cuckoo When first the year I heard the cuckoo sing And call with welcome note the budding spring I straightway set a running with such haste Deborah that won the smock scarce ran so fast Till spent for lack of breath quite weary grown Upon a rising bank I sat adown There doffed my shoe and by my troth I swear Therein I spied this yellow frizzled hair As like to Lubberkin s in curl and hue As if upon his comely pate it grew Nos one hundred eighty seven one hundred ninety three These practices and others like No four hundred fifty three and the asseverations Nos sixty sixty seven shade off insensibly into children s games customs and sayings Games pure and simple have been omitted from the present monograph since they are evidently out of place among superstitions They have been admirably treated in mister Newell s Games and Songs of American Children The customs and sayings for the most part belong in collections like Halliwell s Nursery Rhymes rather than in the present collection No two hundred eleven Projects in which flowers and leaves are employed certainly much antedate the Christian era Theocritus Idyll III describes one in which a poppy petal is used and he also refers to another form of love divination by aid of the leaf of the plant Telephilon No two hundred forty five It is probable that the direction in which one is to walk during the performance of this and similar acts of divination is not a matter of indifference even when no direction is prescribed One would expect to find it done sunwise See note on Chapter xvi Nos two hundred fifty four two hundred fifty six The Sedum has long enjoyed a reputation for aphrodisiac qualities as is set forth in Gerarde s Herbal and other authorities Perhaps the choice of the plant for use in this form of project is due to some lingering tradition of its potency or it may be simply because of its great vitality and power of growing under adverse conditions No three hundred thirty four I happen to know that in eighteen ninety five one bride in a Boston suburb wore seven yellow garters at the request of seven girl friends Probably the fashion of wearing yellow garters owes its present currency to the repute in which they are held as love amulets CHAPTER VIII Some notion of the prevalence of a popular belief in the omens to be derived from dreams may be obtained from the fact that dream books are still enough in demand to warrant their publication I have seen but one such volume That was more than thirty years ago A dream book is now published by a New York firm and I find from inquiries in Boston that it sells at a moderate rate No six hundred twenty six See Shoe Omens in Brand s Popular Antiquities Bohn s ed iii one hundred sixty six Nos seven hundred eighty five seven hundred eighty nine The curious reader will find an excellent summary of the beliefs in regard to sneezing in Brand s Popular Antiquities vol iii Nos seven hundred ninety six eight hundred In New Hampshire it was formerly usual for young people to purchase gold beads one at a time with their earnings When a sufficient number of beads was obtained the necklace was made and after it had once been put on was never taken off by night or day It is difficult to induce the elderly people who still retain these necklaces to part with them there being a superstitious feeling in regard to the consequences Nos eight hundred thirty one eight hundred thirty two These cures and a few other superstitions have been taken from a very interesting paper Notes on the Folk Lore of Newfoundland in the Journal of American Folk Lore vol viii No XXXI Almost all of the other folk lore from Newfoundland and Labrador has been given me by reverend A C Waghorne It is interesting to notice how among these seafaring people weather lore predominates over all other kinds Nos eight hundred forty five eight hundred forty eight These devices for suppressing hiccoughs are scarcely superstitions in reality as they doubtless often do relieve the nervous spasmodic action of the respiratory muscles by fixing the attention upon the cure But in the popular mind some charm I take it is attributed to the counting repeating or what not CHAPTER XIII Several remedies for warts are here introduced which belong with the collection of animal and plant lore for which the writer has much material accumulated In general such topics including a very large number of saliva charms and cures have been omitted from the present list Nos eight hundred seventy two eight hundred eighty eight hundred eighty two It is interesting to notice this illustration of the doctrine of signatures Excrescences of such varied character whether animal or vegetable are supposed by contact to cause warts doubtless simply because of the accidental resemblance Nos eight hundred eighty nine eight hundred ninety six It seems that any juices of peculiar or marked color are popularly credited with curative power The plants whose juices are thought to cure warts are it will be noticed of wide botanical range In all probability there is no similarity in the effects to be obtained from the application of their sap No nine hundred seventy nine The somewhat unusual phenomenon of rain falling while the sun is shining seems to have so attracted the attention of the human mind as to have given rise to various sayings A native of Western Africa told me that among his tribe the Vey people it was always said when the sun shone as rain fell that it was a sign that a leopardess had just given birth to young In Japan the occurrence is said to indicate that a wedding procession of foxes is passing near by and the children have a pretty habit of running to the supporting pillars of the house to place the ear against the timbers and listen for the footfalls of the foxes The little people also interlace their fingers in a certain way then peeping through the chinks between the fingers they declare they can see the wedding train Nos ten twenty ten twenty eight The mackerel sky is a name given to an assemblage of cirrus clouds which are thought to imitate the barred markings on the side of a mackerel Mares tails are wisp like curved cirri CHAPTER XV To illustrate the remarkable prevalence of a regard for the phases of the moon in the management of every day affairs among the Pennsylvania Germans the following list of their beliefs is appended All are from Buffalo Valley Central Pennsylvania one hundred fifty seven one THE MOON All cereals when planted in the waxing of the moon will germinate more rapidly than if planted in the waning of the moon The same is true of the ripening of grain Beans planted when the horns of the moon are up will readily pole but if planted when the horns are down will not Plant early potatoes when the horns of the moon are up else they will go too deep into the ground Plant late potatoes in the dark of the moon For abundance in anything you must plant it when the moon is in the sign of the Twins Plant onions when the horns of the moon are down Pick apples in the dark of the moon to keep them from rotting Make wine in the dark of the moon Make vinegar in the light of the moon Marry in the light of the moon Move in the light of the moon Butcher in the increase of the moon Boil soap in the increase of the moon Cut corn in the decrease of the moon else it will spoil Spread manure when the horns of the moon are down Lay the first or lower rail of a fence when the horns of the moon are up Put in the stakes and finish the fence when the horns are down Roof buildings when the horns of the moon are down else the shingles will curl up at the edges and the nails will draw out Lay a board on the grass if the horns of the moon are up the grass will not be killed if they are down it will Cut your hair on the first Friday after the new moon Never cut your hair in the decrease of the moon Cut your corns in the decrease of the moon Nos eleven fourteen eleven twenty three These superstitions regarding planting crops according to the moon are by no means idle sayings that have no influence over farmers I know positively that in many parts of the United States and in Prince Edward Island gardens and fields are often planted after direct reference to the almanac in regard to the moon s changes Metropolitan dwellers have small knowledge of what an important book the almanac is to many country people In many a quiet farm home the appearance of the new almanac is looked forward to with great interest Its arrival is welcomed and it is hung up near the kitchen clock for constant reference It is studied with care especially on Sundays The farmer or farm wife who would scorn to do an hour s work in the hay field to save a crop from a Sunday shower earnestly peruses the almanac to get rules to guide the week day sowing and planting There are old auguries too of whose import I am not definitely informed to be derived from consulting the signs of the zodiac auguries I think concerning human destiny as well as the planting of crops Speaking of the place held by the almanac recalls one of those neighborhood anecdotes that by oft telling become classic A young woman long ill with consumption I believe died very suddenly Her brother in speaking of the event said Why no we never thought of Mary dying so soon Why she sat up in the big rocking chair most all Sunday afternoon reading the almanac and then she died on Monday Poor Mary the thin volume was her sole library CHAPTER XVI It would involve a much more extended discussion than the space limits of these notes will allow to undertake to show the origin and meaning of the superstitions in regard to the sun and sunwise movement While the origin and meaning of sun worship has been very fully treated by Sir G W Cox Professor Max Mueller Professor De Gubernatis and others the existence in modern times and among civilized communities of usages which seem to be derived from sun worship has apparently almost escaped notice I quote in this connection a few paragraphs from my brief article on this subject in the Popular Science Monthly for June eighteen ninety five In dealing with the origination of actions or customs in which is involved what doctor Fewkes calls the ceremonial circuit one hundred fifty eight one it is difficult to determine the value of the factor whether it be large or small that is due to the greater convenience of moving in a right handed direction Occasionally the dextral circuit is followed in cases in which it is evidently less convenient than the sinistral would be as in dealing cards in all ordinary games Also who can tell just how large or small an element may depend upon the tradition that the left hand in itself is uncanny without reference to the sun s apparent motion There certainly is a general feeling of wide distribution that to be left handed is unfortunate doctor Fewkes s careful and valuable researches among the Moki Indians of Arizona however show without doubt that they in their religious rites make the circuits sinistrally i e contrary to the apparent course of the sun or as physicists say contra clockwise The Mokis also are careful to stir medicines according to the sinistral circuit But doubtless instances go to show that among Asiatic and European peoples the general belief or feeling is that the dextral circuit i e clockwise or with the apparent motion of the sun is the correct and auspicious direction As contra sunwise notions were thought to be of ill omen or to be able to work in supernatural ways so it came to be believed that to reverse other acts as for instance reading the Bible or repeating the Lord s Prayer backward might produce powerful counter charms The negroes in the Southern States often resort to both of these latter practices to lay disturbing ghosts In the ring games of our school children they always move sunwise though whether because of convenience or from some forgotten reason who can say In New Harbor Newfoundland it is customary in getting off small boats especially when gunning or sealing to take pains to start from east to west and when the wind will permit the same custom is observed in getting large schooners under way So too in the Western Isles off the coast of Scotland boats at starting are or at any rate used to be rowed in a sunwise course to insure a lucky voyage It will be noticed that in several of these cures as well as in some of the charms already cited no rule is given as to the direction to be followed in movement but it is quite possible that the original description was more explicit and it is almost certain that in every instance a sunwise course would now be followed No eleven sixty six This appearance is due to the presence of a minute unicellular plant of a red color which grows and multiplies with great rapidity on the surface of bread starch paste and similar substances So general was once the belief in its portentous nature that Ehrenberg described it under the name Monas Prodigiosa No eleven seventy six The non appearance of rigor mortis as omen of another death is alluded to in a skeptical way by Sir Thomas Browne in his Vulgar Errors Book V chapter xxiii No twelve eighty TN twelve Doubtless this apparently most trivial and meaningless sign is but one of hundreds of examples of pure symbolism The custom of draping the bell or front door knob with crape when death has come to a house is suggested by seeing anything hung on the door knob It might be convenient to hang the dish cloth to dry on the kitchen door knob as the door stands open The idea of death is suggested then comes the thought this is like death hence it may bode death and so the omen arises No twelve oh four See article on Current Superstitions Journal of American Folk Lore vol ii No IV No twelve oh seven Not infrequently people of education and culture feel that mourning is significant of further deaths In popular arguments about the advisability of wearing mourning it is said that if one begins to wear it he will have occasion to continue to do so It is also claimed that mourning is directly unhealthful on account of injurious components of the black dyes used This delusion no doubt proceeds from observed cases of ill health due to the depressing effects of mourning upon the spirits and therefore the physical condition of the wearer No twelve thirty seven See Current Superstitions Journal of American Folk Lore vol ii No IV I chanced to know a few years ago of a family party of educated unusually intelligent people when it happened that the number to dine was thirteen One laughingly proposed to sit at a side table and did so The dinner table would otherwise have been a bit crowded the hostess said as excuse for heeding the evil omen of thirteen at table I doubt if one of those present had any real faith in the superstition and yet I fancy there was a certain feeling of relief in avoiding the augury predicted by the old saying No twelve forty one See article Survivals of Sun Worship by the author in Popular Science Monthly June nine eighteen ninety five No twelve forty seven To what extent an old custom of touching the dead survives I cannot say but I well remember a painful experience of my own early childhood I had been taken to the funeral of a little child and at the proper time passed with the little procession to take leave of the dead baby A lady who had charge of me turned down the wrist of my glove and bade me touch the corpse which I did At the time I felt it was to show me how cold were the dead but I now think it must have been in conformity with some tradition for the person who directed me was one who had great regard for what were deemed the proprieties in funeral rites Nos thirteen thirty five thirteen thirty eight It is quite a general custom among country people on the Eastern Shore of Maryland to decapitate a crowing hen The same custom is reported from New Hampshire and from Prince Edward Island Does not this proverb then refer to the common superstition that it presages death or disaster for a hen to crow in consequence of which such hens are summarily killed No fourteen fifteen There is a somewhat widespread prejudice in the minds of old people against having their pictures taken particularly if they have never done so I do not think the objection is a natural conservatism or dislike of doing something to which one is unaccustomed The ill omen does not appear to have been feared for the young as well as for the old even in provincial localities when for the first time portraiture by daguerreotypy or more recently by photography was introduced It has long been known that among primitive peoples there is a decided prejudice against portraiture The notion seems to be that the individual may lose his vigor if not his life by allowing a copy of himself to be made in any way Catlin in his intercourse with the North American Indians found great difficulty in gaining the consent of individuals to his painting them He says in his work on The Manners Customs and Condition of the North American Indians The Squaws generally agreed that they had discovered life enough in them Catlin s portraits to render my medicine too great for the Mandans saying that such an operation could not be performed without taking away from the original something of his existence which I put in the picture and they could see it move could see it stir Herbert Spencer in his Principles of Sociology vol i p two hundred forty two refers to a similar belief among the Chinooks and the Mapuches It would seem as if there is in the popular mind an instinctive recognition that the tenure of life is less strong in the aged than in the young So while the general notion that it is dangerous to have one s person represented has disappeared from the mind of civilized man a similar psychological condition survives here and there among people leading peculiarly simple lives Another evidence of a popular belief in some vital relationship between a portrait and its original is suggested by the quite general superstition that photographs or other pictures fade after and in consequence of the decease of the original I have found this to be a common belief in Ireland Prince Edward Island and in various parts of the United States I remember as a child to have heard persons remark while turning over a family album of photographs That looks as if the person were dead In fact I think that I thus received the impression that the picture of one dead underwent some change that many persons could perceive and thus become aware of the death of the original This notion is akin to a superstition of the Irish peasantry that the clothes left by the dead decay with unusual
